00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,888
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,101
Domestic case number 2022-523845.

3
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,270
Plaintiff, Kang Hui-seop.
Defendant, Lee Seo-jin.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,608
Plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff's brief
submitted on May 3, 2022.

5
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,653
Plaintiff will testify based on the brief
submitted on June 6, 2022,

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,823
and exhibits 1 to 12 have been submitted.

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,076
I have a question.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,497
Do you remember
that link I sent you that day?

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,833
The best restaurant nearby.

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,835
Did you go?

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,633
-Yes.
-Not bad, right?

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,768
Yes, it was all right.

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,188
It's a shame
that she was unwilling to negotiate

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,191
throughout the mediation period.

15
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,611
It is quite disconcerting to see
Ms. Lee demanding custody

16
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,656
even though she is the spouse at fault

17
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,118
and her son was sent to the emergency room
in the middle of the night.

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,080
Would any decent parent
be able to make such a decision

19
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,542
when the reason for their divorce
is causing so much pain for their son?

20
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,503
This is causing Hyeon-u so much pain.

21
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,756
Should I really keep fighting
for his custody?

22
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,676
DONGSEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

23
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,302
Why do you want Hyeon-u's custody?

24
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,681
Just like you said,

25
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,016
this is putting him in a really bad place.

26
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,352
Why do you want his custody?

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,023
Because he can't stay there.

28
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,819
So you're afraid that Hyeon-u will
live in pain just like you did, right?

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,571
Yes.

30
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,657
That's why we have to win this lawsuit.

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,033
And we will.

32
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,578
Now that we're going to court,

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,455
we'll also demand
an exact division of property.

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,790
Don't do that.

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
He might become more stubborn.

36
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,880
Do you think he'll hand over the boy
just because you don't demand money?

37
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,798
You'd just be taking what's yours.

38
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:55,925
Also,

39
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,344
don't be so scared.

40
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
We're going to win.

41
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,766
Let's wait and see who'll win.

42
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,276
Giving Ms. Lee the custody
of her son would be the same

43
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,820
as giving up on the dignity of the child.

44
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,616
It is only natural for my client
to not give up his custody.

45
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
-Defendant's counselor.
-Yes.

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,456
His dignity?

47
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,666
It's interesting you'd say that.

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,667
Make your case.

49
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,711
Have you ever asked Kang Hyeon-u,

50
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,423
the child under discussion,
who he wants to live with?

51
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,426
Your Honor, the child's opinion
isn't taken into account

52
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,179
-unless he is over 13--
-I know that.

53
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,014
Anyone can look that up online.

54
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,934
A child has to be 13
for their opinion to be considered.

55
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,101
But that's not what I'm asking.

56
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,646
Mr. Kang.

57
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,566
Your child's opinion
can't affect the court's decision,

58
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,861
but you could have
asked him as his father, right?

59
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,405
We are here

60
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,952
because the child already said
he couldn't live with a mom like her.

61
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,286
Is that so?

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,957
In that case, one of us has been lied to.

63
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,890
Hyeon-u.

64
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,767
The way I see it…

65
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,605
both your dad and your mom are at fault.

66
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,901
They're both awful parents.

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,364
You'll have to deal with that.

68
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,116
It sucks.

69
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,201
Move out as soon as you come of age.

70
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,246
Living alone isn't all that bad.

71
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,999
But let me ask you.

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,001
If…

73
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,589
If you could choose just one person

74
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,551
to be left in this world with you,

75
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,012
who would you choose?

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,432
Mom.

77
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,768
Okay.

78
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,397
I thought she might die.

79
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,318
She would stand barefoot
on the balcony sometimes

80
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,403
when she thought no one was watching.

81
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,614
But I saw her.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,908
It must have been scary.

83
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,661
She was in pain.

84
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,496
I'm in pain too.

85
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,081
I know.

86
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,958
You're in the worst pain right now.

87
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,754
I saw something painful.

88
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,846
So when will you move out, Hyeon-u?

89
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,931
I moved to Germany

90
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,017
-in high school--
-You already know, right?

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,021
You know why I threw Dad's phone.

92
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,490
Hyeon-u.

93
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,328
What you saw and heard…

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,581
That won't go away.

95
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
For all your life,

96
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,545
it'll linger in your heart, mind,
and all over the place.

97
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,425
And it will only get better
if you try your absolute best.

98
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,929
If it keeps coming back,
you have to keep yourself busy.

99
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,933
Whenever that happens to me,
I listen to music.

100
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,810
Trot music.

101
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,319
I have a question.

102
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,032
But you don't have to answer it
if it's too hard for you.

103
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:48,991
Okay?

104
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,623
Did you look it up?

105
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,294
Or did someone show it to you?

106
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,261
Your Honor.

107
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,222
This is Hyeon-u's journal.

108
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,684
Your Honor, this evidence
was not submitted beforehand.

109
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,311
-No, I received it today.
-Let's hear it.

110
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,444
"I'm unhappy."

111
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,321
"Mom is never home."

112
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,699
"I'm always with Dad these days."

113
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,827
"That's why I'm unhappy."

114
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,247
"I'm always with Dad,
who makes me unhappy."

115
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,957
"I pity myself."

116
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,752
Your Honor, Hyeon-u is
currently in a mental state

117
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,088
where he is unhappy about everything.

118
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,216
A child's unstable emotional state
cannot be used as legal grounds.

119
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,342
She's right.

120
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,760
She's absolutely right.

121
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,137
An unstable child.

122
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,389
Your Honor.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,683
I would like to question
the plaintiff, Kang Hui-seop.

124
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,477
You may proceed.

125
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,738
WITNESS

126
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,449
Mr. Kang.

127
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,535
Did you show Hyeon-u,

128
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,954
your insecure son…

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,585
the video of Ms. Lee?

130
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,922
Your Honor!

131
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,841
This is only causing
humiliation for my client!

132
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,177
It's an important question.
I will hear his answer.

133
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,720
Let me ask once again.

134
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,140
Did you show that video

135
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
to your young son,

136
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,394
Hyeon-u,

137
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,855
who's only in third grade?

138
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,233
What?

139
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,275
What did you say?

140
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,362
I want to live with Mom.

141
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,446
Have you gone insane?

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,324
Do you have any idea what a bitch she is?

143
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,452
I want to live with Mom.

144
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,621
I want to live with her.

145
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,957
Please.

146
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,250
Watch this.

147
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,584
Watch it, you little shit!

148
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,794
Open your eyes!

149
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,837
This is who your mother is.

150
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,880
Look!

151
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,965
Look at it!

152
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,094
He had to know.

153
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,473
He had to know why he couldn't live
with his so-called mom!

154
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,308
Plaintiff, calm down.

155
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,643
That's why you showed him?

156
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,148
Plaintiff.

157
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,401
You should be after that trashy bitch.

158
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,819
Why are you interrogating me?

159
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,612
I don't care if you're an attorney.

160
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,865
I showed him.

161
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,286
He's my son.

162
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,996
I showed him as his dad. So what?

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,123
-Plaintiff, calm down.
-Damn it.

164
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,001
What did you say about his dignity?

165
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,128
Your Honor.

166
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,338
Do you think
Mr. Kang's despicable behavior

167
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,258
respects his son's dignity?

168
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,434
Defendant, sit down.

169
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,533
Defendant!

170
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,494
You crazy bitch, have you gone--

171
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,094
You're up.

172
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,680
So? Are you all right?

173
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,270
-Excuse me.
-You have to finish this before you go.

174
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,313
Excuse me!

175
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,649
Excuse me!

176
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,733
Ms. Lee.

177
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,903
-Yes?
-Please pull this out.

178
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,240
-Ma'am, you must finish the IV--
-Please pull it out.

179
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,451
Okay.

180
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,079
One second. I'll let the doctor know.

181
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,459
Why didn't you tell me?

182
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,130
This morning,

183
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,424
I got a call from Hyeon-u.

184
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,009
He asked me to come to his school.

185
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,303
That's when I got his journal.

186
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,014
He said that…

187
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,851
you would cry

188
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,437
if you found out that he had seen it,

189
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,233
but he still wanted to live with you.

190
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,994
I'll beg for his forgiveness

191
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,122
until the day I die.

192
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,835
I want to see Hyeon-u.

193
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,462
Okay.

194
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,923
I'll tell the doctor. Give me one second.

195
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,148
Wait.

196
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,900
I forgot to tell you something important.

197
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,152
We won.

198
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,114
Go have a nice meal with Hyeon-u.

199
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,997
Thank you.

200
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,444
MARRY CAREFULLY
DIVORCE SWIFTLY

201
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,657
Seems like they lost.

202
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,909
Not going to happen.

203
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,118
It should be over by now.

204
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,704
-Maybe they're having lunch.
-It's way past lunchtime.

205
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,081
Maybe she's consulting him.

206
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,499
Because they lost?

207
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,126
Why won't he call--

208
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,548
You lost…

209
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,258
You won, right?

210
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,301
Hey, I'm going straight home.

211
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,346
-I'm not in the mood to go to the office.
-Why not?

212
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,847
Why aren't you in the mood?

213
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,808
What is it? Tell me. What …

214
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,184
Wait. Did you lose?

215
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,394
Of course not.

216
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,229
Right?

217
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,355
You won, right?

218
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,940
Yes, I knew it.

219
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,109
You're tiring me out, man. I'm hanging up.

220
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:24,947
Did they win?

221
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,074
What is this uneasy feeling?

222
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,439
I'm home.

223
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,774
Did your class run late?

224
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,527
No, I went to an internet cafe
with a friend.

225
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,529
Did you have fun?

226
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,697
I'm sleepy.

227
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,949
Hyeon-u.

228
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,578
I made some sweet and sour pork
with a recipe I found online.

229
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,497
It might be good.

230
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,463
I'll go wash my hands.

231
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,090
Okay.

232
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,607
How is it?

233
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,276
It's good.

234
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,196
Not bad for a first try, right?

235
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,323
Yes.

236
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,210
Who am I going to live with?

237
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,298
Me.

238
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,101
Where's Dad?

239
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,148
He's staying at a hotel near his office.

240
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,909
I'm full.

241
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,413
Okay, you don't have to finish it.

242
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,708
Mom, are you sick?

243
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,836
No, I'm not sick.

244
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,504
You don't look so well.

245
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,840
No, I'm fine.

246
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,435
I'm so sorry.

248
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,563
It was wrong of me.

249
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,434
She was in pain.

250
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,353
I'm in pain too.

251
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,189
I'll beg for his forgiveness

252
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
until the day I die.

253
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,320
I want to see Hyeon-u.

254
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,653
That's bitter.

255
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,346
LECTURE ON CIVIL PROCEDURE ACT
2015 EDITION

256
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,809
INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION

257
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,063
The wind blows

258
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,737
A roadside bar

259
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,659
I can't just

260
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:15,667
Pass by it

261
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,937
The wind blows

262
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,982
A roadside bar--

263
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,109
Come on!

264
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,030
I think this noise level is
absolutely acceptable!

265
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,908
Come on, you people are too sensitive!

266
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,534
Good grief!

267
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,162
Man, that scared me.

268
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,622
That's "It's Me" by Nam Jin.

269
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,791
Move aside.

270
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,626
Open up already!

271
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,629
It's me, it's me, it's me

272
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,299
It's me, it's me, it's me

273
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,759
Open the door

274
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,178
You punk

275
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm so sick of these clowns.

276
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,181
Open up.

277
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,725
Open up, you little… It's open.

278
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,477
Crazy bastards.

279
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,063
-Hey, you won the case.
-Hey.

280
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,148
-Why are you in a bad mood?
-What took you so long?

281
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,567
-Hey.
-Did something happen to Seo-jin?

282
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,821
-You studied music in Germany.
-Why are you sad after winning?

283
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,406
-Are you trying to be a trot singer?
-Did something happen with Seo-jin?

284
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,711
I can't believe we still drink soju
with canned tuna at our age.

285
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,296
Better than shrimp chips and soju.

286
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,630
I have spicy tuna too.

287
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,757
-I… Attorney Shin.
-Hey.

288
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,801
I'm going to leave
if you're going to talk about work.

289
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,719
Sure, bye.

290
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,722
Just tell me already.

291
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,057
Did Seo-jin's case end well?

292
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,561
-Hey, Ms. Lee…
-Yes?

293
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,188
has some guts.

294
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,356
-What?
-We were in the courtroom.

295
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,734
-The judge was watching, right?
-Okay.

296
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,279
-And she just slapped…
-Slapped?

297
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,447
-You know her husband.
-Right.

298
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,907
-No, ex-husband.
-Yes, ex.

299
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,450
She just slapped…

300
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,411
-the absolute hell out of him.
-She hit him first?

301
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,412
Yes.

302
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,836
This soju tastes great today, doesn't it?

303
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,339
It's because we're drinking
from beautiful glasses.

304
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,757
You idiots.

305
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,175
Hey.

306
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,219
Why would you worry about Lee Seo-jin?

307
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,096
At least she got a divorce.
You, on the other hand…

308
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,056
Do you have ramyeon?

309
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,724
Listen, man.

310
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,353
Finalize your divorce before you fall
head over heels for a celebrity.

311
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,480
Why are you ruining such a great day?

312
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,607
He does have a point though.

313
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,151
-You think you're any better?
-What did I do?

314
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,279
You see that speaker
that looks like a coffin?

315
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,948
Do you know how much that is?

316
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,075
It's worth over 50 million won.

317
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,493
Made in Germany, right?

318
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,745
So what kind of music
should you be listening to on it?

319
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,623
You know, there's our man, Debussy.

320
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,208
There's our mom, Handel.

321
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,543
There's a ton of music to listen to.

322
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,338
Why are you so bigoted?

323
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,632
What's wrong with
Nam Jin and Sim Soo-bong?

324
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,677
And who's that kid? Young-woong.

325
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,136
Young-woong. Lim Young-woong.

326
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,680
I love his songs.

327
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,348
I like Kim Ho-joong. He's good.

328
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,267
And I respect your taste.

329
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,645
Stop cutting me off. I was talking.

330
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,855
-Go ahead, idiot.
-Yes, go ahead.

331
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,691
Mark my words, man.

332
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,608
Did you know?

333
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,485
Soju can be decanted as well.

334
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,112
-Really?
-If you leave it out,

335
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,699
it meets the air and turns smoother.

336
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,409
Hey, I'm talking.

337
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,743
Yes, what?

338
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,828
"Yes, what?"

339
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,246
"What?"

340
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,456
"Say what?"

341
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,916
"What?"

342
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,835
What was that?

343
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,839
Isn't that a catchphrase from the 1980s?

344
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,507
That was too much. I apologize.

345
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,009
Don't apologize.

346
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,468
It brings back memories.

347
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,762
-Right?
-That's Kim Heung-kook!

348
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,472
-I know.
-So funny.

349
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,891
-"Say what?"
-"Say what?"

350
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,436
-"Get in there!"
-Do you know "Reggae Party"?

351
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,937
-Feeling good
-Feeling good

352
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
Feeling good

353
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,774
Kick it

354
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,276
-Kick it
-You know…

355
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,569
What are you doing?

356
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,904
If you touch that,
I'll beat the crap out of you.

357
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,656
Shin Sung-han, you bastard.

358
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,741
I feel betrayed.

359
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,658
What?

360
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,369
If you mess with my playlist,
I'll stab you with a chopstick.

361
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,579
-Hyeong-geun.
-Yes?

362
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,789
-His playlist doesn't have
-What?

363
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,125
-any Shin Seung-hun songs.
-Really?

364
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,129
-You don't even have Roo'ra?
-What can we do? To each their own.

365
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,381
I've had it with you.

366
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,635
Why do you carry that in your bag?

367
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,013
Ready to pair.

368
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,765
Why do you carry that?

369
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,183
Does that work all right?

370
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,104
Stop that.

371
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,273
-Hey!
-It sounds pretty good.

372
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,367
It may have been a coincidence

373
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,371
But whenever you cried

374
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,293
Rain fell from the sky

375
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,586
So cold.

376
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,214
-I was used to it
-Nice.

377
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,385
I looked into your sad eyes

378
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,844
And what did you say?

379
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,305
And threw a cold remark

380
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,266
-"Don't cry"
-"Don't cry"

381
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,395
But now

382
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,774
When it rains like it did then

383
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,446
-Jeong-sik!
-I shed tears

384
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,117
Because you, my dear

385
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:27,455
You are no longer by my side

386
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,375
I've been crying with the rain

387
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,389
Honey, didn't you say
that man is a lawyer?

388
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,015
He's not married yet.

389
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,892
Does he do that because he's single

390
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,477
or is that why he's single?

391
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,438
Same difference.

392
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,649
What I cannot bear is

393
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,111
The thought that you might be

394
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,740
Crying somewhere like I am

395
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,201
Heavens, please help me

396
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,247
Don't just cry like that

397
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,417
You can easily find out

398
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,045
-Where my love is now
-Where my love is now

399
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,632
-I wish to see her
-I wish to see her

400
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,803
Just once more while I live

401
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,473
Even as a coincidence

402
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:31,102
I will trust you as I stand here

403
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:37,484
Under your tears

404
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,740
-Is he… He's crying.
-This guy.

405
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,993
It's so sad.

406
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:56,127
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

407
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,213
-Good morning.
-Hello.

408
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,507
Excuse me.

409
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,929
-You're the lawyer here, right?
-Yes.

410
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,140
-A divorce attorney?
-Yes.

411
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,642
So…

412
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,521
Is it expensive to get a divorce?

413
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,731
Oh, the cost?

414
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,651
Well, I guess it…

415
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,320
-It depends on the situation.
-I see.

416
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,031
All right.

417
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,868
-Take it easy then.
-Sure.

418
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,926
CUT YA HAIR

419
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,766
-Hello.
-You said your water pipe is leaking?

420
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,143
Yes, it's not that bad,

421
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,355
but I've been noticing some puddles.

422
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,941
-May I take a look?
-Sure, of course.

423
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,319
Goodness.

424
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,951
I'll call after we talk.

425
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,286
Okay, sure.

426
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,705
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

427
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,373
Is she the landlady?

428
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,083
She doesn't look like one.

429
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,712
No, her mother-in-law is.

430
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,922
That lady just manages the building.

431
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:27,093
She does all the cleaning
and maintenance work.

432
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,304
The bathroom is a mess as usual.

433
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,891
Even a public restroom
would be cleaner than that.

434
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,060
Dad, can you fold these?

435
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,519
He has two girls.

436
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,730
How can you make him fold laundry?

437
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,482
I have to run the machine again.

438
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,567
Mi-so, you come out and fold the laundry.

439
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,527
She's studying, Grandma.

440
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,113
Leave it. I'll do it later.

441
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,533
I fed, clothed, and sheltered you,
then sent you to college for nothing.

442
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,995
All you ever do is
look down on me and talk back.

443
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,456
Leave it.

444
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,417
It goes faster if we do it together.

445
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,794
You're killing me.

446
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,879
Why is your mom so late?

447
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,798
We're all starving here.

448
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,261
I'm home.

449
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,430
The traffic was really bad, wasn't it?

450
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,140
The bus lane isn't too bad.

451
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,892
Go make dinner.

452
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,268
Your husband's starving to death.

453
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,021
Yes, let me shower quickly.

454
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,856
I'm sweating from cleaning--

455
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,025
Longevity sure is a curse.

456
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,197
I need to walk on eggshells
all the time to be fed.

457
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,532
I'll cook first.

458
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,325
I already did. Just set the table.

459
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,035
Why? I was going to be home soon.

460
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,162
Get us dinner already!

461
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,831
Go inside.

462
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,961
What on earth does she eat
while she's out?

463
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,212
Look at her size.

464
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,339
Is she a human or a beast?

465
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,634
I'm sure she's not hungry
since she stuffs her face outside.

466
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,447
Take it easy.

467
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,452
Taking it easy isn't going to
pay off the mortgage.

468
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,915
Do you want heat packs?

469
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,585
Talk to your mother.

470
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,463
Tell her to stop
talking to our kids like that.

471
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,884
She's talked like that all her life.
It's not so easy.

472
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,219
How can you be laughing?

473
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,224
You're their dad.

474
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,269
Mi-yeong and Mi-so
shouldn't be insulted like that

475
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,480
just because they're our kids.

476
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,023
-Right?
-I'll talk to her.

477
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,149
You will, won't you?

478
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,693
You'll tell her to stop
talking to our girls like that, right?

479
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,279
Go to sleep. You said you were tired.

480
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,655
Seo Byeong-cheol.

481
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,574
I work my butt off

482
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,035
and put up with her insults every day

483
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,369
because I deserve it.

484
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,288
What do you mean?

485
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,208
It's because I clung to you
and didn't let you go.

486
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,293
I deserve to live in this mess.

487
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,296
Don't bring up that old story again.

488
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,299
Because your mother brings up
that old story every single day…

489
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,766
I mean it.

490
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,683
You better tell her.

491
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,437
If she mistreats
Mi-yeong and Mi-so once again,

492
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,314
I won't sit back.

493
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,758
Good morning.

494
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,218
Make bean soup noodles tonight.

495
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,179
Your husband seems to have no appetite.

496
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,431
I'll soak the beans.

497
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,433
Boil them when you get home.

498
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,313
Sit down.

499
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,112
Rent out the unit upstairs.

500
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,740
I eat here anyway,

501
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,742
and I barely have any laundry.

502
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,994
I'll move out, so rent it out.

503
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,787
Where will you stay then?

504
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,707
All my stuff is old,
so I don't need to bring anything.

505
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,917
I'll just move downstairs.

506
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,546
Those girls don't need separate rooms.

507
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,341
Let them share one room
so there's a spare room.

508
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,967
I'll move in there.

509
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,514
When will we ever pay off our mortgages?

510
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,810
Rent out the unit upstairs
to cover the mortgages.

511
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,940
The girls are all grown up now.

512
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,983
They're too old to be sharing a room now.

513
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,778
You'd be out on the street
if I didn't let you live here.

514
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,113
They should be thankful for one room.

515
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,658
Your situation never gets better

516
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,285
because you waste all your money.

517
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,871
I have to wash up and go to work.

518
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,486
I need to see you outside.

519
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,447
Tell Mother that you're seeing a friend.

520
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,218
A BEAUTIFUL CONCERT
A JOYOUS RESONATION FOR THE PATIENTS

521
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,517
That was fun. I almost danced.

522
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,893
So why didn't you?

523
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,144
You didn't see me dancing?

524
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,396
I guess I missed it.

525
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,525
I'm going back to Germany next week.

526
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,322
There's this amazing jazz band
I love in Hamburg,

527
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,408
and I was invited to play with them.

528
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,076
Isn't it exciting?

529
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,370
Thank you.

530
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,165
-When are you coming, Professor?
-Where?

531
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,458
Germany.

532
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm genuinely curious.

533
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,880
What do you do in Korea?

534
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,091
Concerts? Lessons?

535
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,134
I'm an attorney.

536
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,718
Come on.

537
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,720
Really?

538
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,390
So you weren't kidding back then?

539
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,058
You're really an attorney?

540
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,351
Why did you want to meet?

541
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,894
Your piano wasn't so…

542
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,020
Come on.

543
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,859
Ta-da.

544
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,735
Your favorite wine.

545
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,821
It was on sale, so I got a bottle.

546
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,991
See? I'm your best student, right?

547
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,994
It's true, but I don't drink wine anymore.

548
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,078
You quit drinking?

549
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,455
No, just wine.

550
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,165
Right, wine.

551
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,542
Let's grab a meal before you go.

552
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,838
There's a killer ramyeon place
right in front of my office.

553
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,131
Whatever.

554
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,927
-What am I going to do with this wine?
-I'll take it.

555
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,973
There are two freeloaders at my place
who dig up these things

556
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,600
as if they're drawn to them.

557
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,519
-Professor Shin.
-Hey.

558
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,771
-Don't call me that.
-Why not?

559
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,939
It's awkward.

560
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,774
You're my professor.

561
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,568
It's too much.

562
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,584
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

563
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,798
My billion-won baby.

564
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,675
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE

565
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:56,430
I wanted to thank you,
but I didn't know what you liked.

566
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,891
It's a nice bottle of wine.

567
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,060
It's a wine party for me today.

568
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,687
I got one from someone earlier.

569
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,565
You must like wine.

570
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm glad.

571
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,401
Sure.

572
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,656
I just did my job.
You didn't have to get me this.

573
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,116
Anyway, thank you.

574
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,619
Had I gone to another lawyer,

575
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,788
I would have lost.

576
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,124
Well…

577
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,503
That… is possible.

578
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,630
We won because of me.

579
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,012
You know…

580
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,598
Well, I…

581
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,727
I'm sorry, but I just really want to know.

582
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,815
Did you get married…

583
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,819
because you wanted to?

584
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,532
I'm sorry.

585
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,951
I didn't mean anything else by that.

586
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,744
He said he loved me.

587
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,247
That's why.

588
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,167
My brother was addicted to gambling.

589
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,129
He was good friends with my ex-husband.

590
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,550
They started that business together.

591
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,679
I was studying to become
a newscaster at the time.

592
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,850
My brother gambled
with the business funds.

593
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,979
The company was about to go bankrupt,

594
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,108
but my ex-husband sold his house
and took care of it.

595
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,818
So you married him

596
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,404
because you felt indebted to him.

597
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,114
Looking back, I guess you're right.

598
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,784
But Ms. Lee,

599
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,496
you had a stable and cool career,

600
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,707
and you were so famous.

601
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,417
Why didn't you divorce him sooner?

602
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,086
When I decided to leave him,

603
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,255
my brother died.

604
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,717
He gambled away all his money again,

605
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,637
got wasted, and got in a car accident.

606
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,390
I got scared and stayed…

607
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,393
And then life happened.

608
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,656
Raindrops.

609
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,953
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23,
the 2nd movement.

610
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,749
Those careless words.

611
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,378
But the touch of the keys…

612
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,006
How can I put this?

613
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,802
Deep sorrow.

614
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,763
Like adagio.

615
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,942
Sounds cool, right?

616
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,361
Yes.

617
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,781
I guess the wine was a good gift.

618
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,118
It goes well with your grape drawing.

619
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,328
-Well…
-Hey.

620
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,288
You have one more to go.

621
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,666
Last time, there were two left.

622
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,673
Are you looking for a new job?

623
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:21,009
I've been sending out my résumé,
but it's not easy.

624
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,430
You should probably hurry.

625
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,808
Mr. Kang might be watching you
to file another lawsuit.

626
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,270
I know.

627
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,898
I'll be going.

628
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,444
Right, how's Hyeon-u?

629
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,486
He's doing well.

630
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:44,032
He eats well,
and he talks to me from time to time.

631
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,033
That's nice.

632
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,911
You know that it's my competence

633
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:53,041
that won you his custody
and a fair division of property, right?

634
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,048
You also know I was joking, right?

635
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,342
You should change your name.

636
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,386
From Mr. Shin Sung-han

637
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,054
to Mr. Competent.

638
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,982
What does he spend all his money on?

639
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Mr. Competent.

640
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,326
Not bad.

641
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,662
Hello, I'm your competent attorney,
Mr. Competent.

642
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,956
Your competent attorney, Mr. Competent.

643
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,208
Okay, it's weird.

644
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,880
Your mother wants to rent out her place.

645
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,550
She's moving in with us.

646
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,680
Fine.

647
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,141
Of course you have nothing to say.

648
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,519
I didn't want to see you
to hear your opinion.

649
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,687
You need to stop her.

650
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,943
-I'll talk to her.
-Don't just say you'll talk to her!

651
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,655
It can't happen.

652
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,282
Make sure it doesn't happen.

653
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,536
Okay.

654
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,805
Where's Jeong-sik?

655
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,099
He got a client as he was heading out.

656
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,101
He needs to make his rent.

657
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,520
He should just sell his car.

658
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,357
How can he not show up
after calling us to some random place?

659
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,151
This is a pub he helped move in.

660
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,861
Maybe he has to help them out.

661
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,321
Drink up.

662
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,532
You need to mix it up a little.

663
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

664
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,834
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

665
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,085
Enjoy.

666
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,844
You know…

667
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,346
Do you think Seo-jin…

668
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,891
won't be returning to radio?

669
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:22,357
Well, it's not very likely
that she'll come back to her old show.

670
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,697
Why should Seo-jin be kicked off the show?

671
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,574
Why?

672
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,160
Quiet down, you idiot.

673
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,456
-I'll do a…
-What?

674
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,125
-A one-man…
-You'll do what?

675
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,585
One-man protest.

676
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,880
-One-man protest.
-Was that so hard?

677
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,214
Here's an idea.

678
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,761
Use the broadcasting station's
message board,

679
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,181
my slow, stupid, crazy friend.

680
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,974
I already did, stupid.

681
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,523
I already spammed their message board.

682
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:08,111
I spammed it so much
that it's more like a…

683
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,364
charcuterie board.

684
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,866
I'm a genius.

685
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,576
I mean…

686
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,203
What the hell?

687
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,331
Why don't you try
working so hard at the office?

688
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,124
-You crazy little…
-"Crazy"?

689
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,376
Hey.

690
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,212
I work my ass off.

691
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,089
That's why you can do

692
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,466
your little coloring exercise
with your grapes.

693
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,221
I only have one left.

694
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,266
Just one more to go.

695
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,353
Are you going to fight him

696
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,565
once you're done coloring the grapes?

697
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,279
I'm not sure if he'll listen.

698
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,698
DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

699
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,325
Did you say he named his firm
after himself?

700
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,786
-Shin Sung-han.
-Yes.

701
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,706
It's not too far, so go over and coax him.

702
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,667
He's not the type to listen.

703
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,754
But I will meet with him.

704
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,550
Ha-yul's been asking a lot of questions
ever since she started elementary school.

705
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,468
She loves her brother so much.

706
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:19,141
I guess kids these days have
no problem with having half-siblings.

707
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,518
So innocent.

708
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,229
Ha-yul is that innocent.

709
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,733
Gi-yeong is the gloomy one. Ha-yul is…

710
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,902
She wants to do everything with him.

711
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,155
When he goes to meet his uncle,

712
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,282
she doesn't smile until he's back.

713
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,618
It's about time I sorted this out.

714
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,705
Please do that for me.

715
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,499
Rest assured, ma'am.

716
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,877
I should have sorted it out sooner.

717
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,504
I've been curious, so this is great.

718
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,467
A former pianist turned attorney?

719
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,094
That's just ridiculous.

720
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,556
I've always wanted to meet him.

721
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,808
Shin Sung-han.

722
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,102
I'm going to kill him.

723
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,148
Dude.

724
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,652
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

725
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,529
I get how you feel.

726
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,991
I completely get it.

727
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:22,370
That's why I'm here as your paralegal.

728
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:28,043
I know why you left everything
in Germany and came here.

729
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,296
I know why you moved into
that tiny study hostel.

730
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,423
I know everything.

731
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,301
But you still can't kill him.

732
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,470
So why not?

733
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,097
Why can't I?

734
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,558
Because of that jerk, my dear Ju-hwa…

735
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:48,396
Okay? My dear Ju-hwa and Gi-yeong…

736
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,569
I'm going to kill that bastard.

737
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,202
Slow down.

738
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,372
Hey, slow down.

739
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,541
Don't drink so fast.

740
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,543
Slowly.

741
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,756
Those lunatics.

742
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,819
No.

743
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,911
Perhaps I can't

744
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,960
Forget about you

745
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:57,132
Forever, forever

746
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,846
As long as you live

747
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,019
No, even after my death

748
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,241
Please.

749
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,285
-Go upstairs. It's late.
-Let go of me.

750
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,246
Listen to how this brat talks to me.

751
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,790
-What did you say?
-Why would you move in here?

752
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,127
You come down at 4 a.m.
and leave after dinner every day!

753
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,379
If you move in, how are we going to live?

754
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,048
Do you think I want to?

755
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,675
We have mortgages to pay off!

756
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,970
I only kicked the tenants out of this unit
for your family's sake!

757
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,849
I should have left you
to live out on the streets.

758
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,768
That's why Mom works so hard every day.

759
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,686
Plus, it wasn't her business
that went under.

760
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,647
It was Dad's!

761
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,399
-That doesn't matter!
-Enough. Go to your room.

762
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,318
Go study. You have a test tomorrow.

763
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,444
How can I study right now?

764
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,279
How high and mighty you are.

765
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,282
Why should girls study anyway?
You only waste your dad's money.

766
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,617
More like my mom's.

767
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,202
So I won't go to college!

768
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,536
Mi-so, enough.

769
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,538
Mother, you need to stop.

770
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,041
Look at what a bad example
you've set for these brats!

771
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:13,959
Mother.

772
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,170
Stop talking to them like that.

773
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,340
They don't deserve to be insulted
like that by their family.

774
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,217
Yes, sure, good for you.

775
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,927
You never even gave me a grandson…

776
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,804
Stop it, Grandma!

777
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,431
-Go upstairs.
-Let go, you idiot.

778
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,100
What are you so afraid of?

779
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,726
Is this their building?

780
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,312
It's mine. So hold your head up.

781
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,855
Go to your rooms, girls.

782
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,900
Dad.

783
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,902
Why are you always like this?

784
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,279
You never say a thing.
Don't you feel bad for Mom?

785
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,990
Listen to this brat talk.

786
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,283
He's not your friend, you brat.

787
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,035
-Is he your friend?
-Stop!

788
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,249
What did you say?

789
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,917
Do not swear at them.

790
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,127
And do not hit them.

791
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,379
What will you do about it?

792
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,672
What she did was wrong!

793
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,299
She didn't do anything so wrong
for you to beat her!

794
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,093
So please stop.

795
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,096
I hit her. What now?

796
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,223
-Stop it, Mom.
-Get out of the way.

797
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,726
-Come!
-Six. Seven.

798
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,436
Eight!

799
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,331
What are you going to do?
Beat your mother-in-law?

800
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,459
What are you going to do?

801
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,627
-One, two…
-Goodness!

802
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,712
She's killing me!

803
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,088
-Three!
-Honey.

804
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,049
-She's killing me!
-Let go of me.

805
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,885
Let go. I haven't gotten to eight yet.

806
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:51,181
-I'm getting beaten by my daughter-in-law.
-She hit my child eight times!

807
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,893
Let go of me!

808
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,228
Let go of me!

809
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,607
-She hit my child eight times!
-It's okay.

810
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,734
Let go!

811
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,360
Let go of me!

812
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,280
THE SILENCE BETWEEN THE NOTES
IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE NOTES THEMSELVES

813
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,657
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

814
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,368
MARRY CAREFULLY
DIVORCE SWIFTLY

815
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,520
What do you think I'll do first
after coloring in that last grape?

816
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,939
I might be quite useful.

817
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,942
For example, I can handle
miscellaneous tasks like this.

818
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,488
I didn't hit my husband.
I hit my mother-in-law.

819
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,490
This is a difficult case.

820
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,117
So let's visit her neighborhood,

821
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,869
ask around, then decide.

822
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,454
Is the old lady fussy?

823
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,373
I'm going to ruin his grapes.

824
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,919
We're already tied together
by some terrible misfortune.

825
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:42,592
