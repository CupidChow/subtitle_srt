00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,348
Wait for me!

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,683
Hurry up.

4
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,344
What time is it?

5
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,311
My stomach.

6
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,689
Hyeong-geun, that bastard.

7
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,653
How much soju did he mix into the beer?

8
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,241
My stomach…

9
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,537
Water.

10
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,809
Why do my hands feel so weak?

11
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,839
Man, I'm full.

12
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,217
My stomach hurts and I'm full.

13
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,653
This asshole…

14
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,198
Hello?

15
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,783
Hey, you're amazing!

16
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,410
You've still got it.

17
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,788
-What are you talking about?
-Wait. Have you not seen it?

18
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,292
-Seen what?
-I guess you haven't.

19
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,295
But then again, I guess you
wouldn't have picked up if you have.

20
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,840
You didn't even show up last night.
What are you--

21
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,967
You… Hello?

22
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,887
This clown hung up on me.

23
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,605
What now?

24
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:57,487
"An ordinary guy's insane busking skills."

25
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,616
Let's see.

26
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,518
THE SILENCE BETWEEN THE NOTES
IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE NOTES THEMSELVES

27

Holy shit!

28
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,274
That's me!

29
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,152
It's me!

30
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,364
No wonder my arms felt so weak!

31
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,158
You stupid, drunk idiot!

32
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,998
Damn it. Why won't it stop?

33
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,378
This is a disaster!

34
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,880
I'm doomed.

35
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,966
I'm screwed.

Do you want me to drive you to school?

38
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,028
You're a big boy now.

39
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,989
I guess your friends
might tease you if I do, right?

40
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,116
Drive me.

41
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,847
Good morning, everyone.

42
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,934
It's already been a month
since I took over.

43
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,771
I remember being really nervous at first.

44
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,065
Time really flies.

45
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,357
Thanks to all of you,

46
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,109
my mornings fly right by,

47
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,529
and they're filled with joy every day.

No.

51
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,541
Okay.

52
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,799
Good morning.

53
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,968
Where's Mr. Jang?

54
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,180
Where's Mr. Jang?

55
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,933
He said he wasn't feeling too well.

56
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,059
I see.

57
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,233
What are you watching?

58
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,652
What are you watching?

59
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,947
-What are you watching?
-I'm sorry.

60
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,323
I won't watch videos at work.

61
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,658
No.

62
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,745
I asked you what you were watching.

63
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm not asking you
why you're watching videos at work.

64
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,457
I'm asking what it is.

65
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,546
The thing is, I have this morning routine.

66
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,881
-I watch music videos--
-What?

67
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,384
Music videos? What kind?

68
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,680
I always come ten minutes early
and watch their videos before work.

69
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,890
Yes, I came in late.
That's why I'm watching them now.

70
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,059
Do I really deserve to be bitched…

71
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,103
I mean, yelled at, for that?

72
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,272
"Their videos"?

73
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,356
Yes.

74
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,858
SEVENTEEN.

75
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,654
I know them. I like them too.

76
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,615
What a great routine.

77
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,660
Please do continue.

78
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,954
Put them back in.

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,249
What's his problem?

80
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,720
I don't want that crap right now.

81
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,350
Let's go home after you have lunch.

82
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,102
Staying here will tire you out.

83
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,148
She can only act so recklessly
because you're a damn pushover.

84
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,194
I can get a diagnosis
for three weeks of treatment, right?

85
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,905
How can you get three weeks
when you're perfectly healthy?

86
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,573
I need at least two weeks.

87
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,325
I'm just going to…

88
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,910
I just can't believe this.

89
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,205
Ae-ran feels extremely bad
about what happened.

90
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,789
I gave her a good scolding.

91
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,042
-So let's go home and--
-As if.

92
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,418
As if you'd ever scold her.

93
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,965
You should have married
the vice principal's daughter instead.

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,010
Come on, Mother.

95
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,304
Why are you bringing that up?

96
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,015
I will get that diagnosis

97
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,226
and I'm going to make sure

98
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,145
that she won't be able to
pull something like that ever again.

99
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,397
Do you think I won't?

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,734
I'm so mad.

101
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,445
I'm so mad.

00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,390
"I'm sorry,

106
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,352
but could you please
take down this video?"

107
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,357
Why am I asking him so nicely?

108
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,150
"Take down the video."

109
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,986
"I have my portrait rights."

110
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,362
"Take it down this instant."

111
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,575
Ten exclamation marks.

112
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,702
Make that 12.

113
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,374
Why won't you read my messages?

114
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,710
June Man!

115
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,254
You freak!

116
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,299
Had I met you in June, you would be…

117
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,759
You…

118
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,803
I better not catch you.

119
00:09:55,886 --> 00:10:00,683
I'm going to rearrange
all of your front teeth.

120
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
This is killing me.

121
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,479
I feel terrible.

122
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,821
When is Mr. Jang Hyeong-geun coming in?

123
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,239
I don't know.

124
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,449
He hasn't called since.

125
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,452
Call him right now
and tell him this is a neglect of duty.

126
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,995
Tell him that.

127
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,913
For every minute that he's late…

128
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
He's here.

129
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,879
Ma'am, we do our own cleaning.

130
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,175
That's not why I'm here.

131
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,968
You see…

132
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,722
I'd like a divorce consultation.

133
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,943
I've only ever cleaned the building.

134
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,530
I never knew I'd be in here
for a consultation.

135
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
You can just tell me what's on your mind.

136
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,452
It's okay.

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm not young anymore,

138
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,999
and my kids are growing up.

139
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,419
So I'm not sure
if this is the right thing to do.

140
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,673
But I just…

141
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,300
can't do this anymore.

142
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,097
Now it's a matter of
whether I'm going to file for divorce

143
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
or he's going to.

144
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,435
Would you like some more water?

145
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,229
Please. I'm very thirsty.

146
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,355
I'll be right back.

147
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,859
Is he still not here?

148
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,071
There he is.

149
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,326
Someone must have spiked our drinks.

150
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,079
-This is no ordinary hangover.
-Then it's a crime.

151
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:45,996
You should report it.

152
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,124
I'm just saying it's that bad.

153
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
I'm with a client right now, Mr. Jang.

154
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,919
You should have had me do this.

155
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,629
Drink some cold water.

156
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,047
I'll try to sober up.

157
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,928
Goodness.

158
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,013
Should we just remove that door, Mr. Shin?

159
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,975
Piss off.

160
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,523
Thank you.

161
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,191
Go on.

162
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,416
I used violence.

163
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,963
I see.

164
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,341
That happens from time to time.

165
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,553
So…

166
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,431
how's your husband's condition right now?

167
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,849
I didn't hit my husband.

168
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,850
Sorry?

169
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,270
I hit my mother-in-law.

170
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,940
I didn't mean to do that.

171
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,402
I'd understand even if
you threw rocks at me.

172
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,197
I deserve that.

173
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
No, I didn't throw rocks at you.

174
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,825
This is just a pen.

175
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,077
And I didn't throw it at you either.

176
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,580
I play with my pen like this.

177
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,166
I was supposed to catch it.

178
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,337
But I happened to overwork
my fingers yesterday…

179
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,463
I'm rambling, aren't I?

180
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,215
What I'm saying is,

181
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,551
it's all a coincidence.

182
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,761
That's all.

183
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,846
Do you think I can win?

184
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,098
I hit my mother-in-law.

185
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,727
Depending on the situation,

186
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,732
you could end up being
the plaintiff or the defendant.

187
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,691
Sorry?

188
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,735
I don't know what any of those words mean.

189
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm sorry. What I meant was…

190
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,698
You could demand a divorce,

191
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,202
or your husband could
file a divorce suit against you.

192
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,745
Didn't I already say that?

193
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,289
Right, you did say that.

194
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,415
In any case,

195
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,751
I want my share.

196
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,338
-Do you mean division of property?
-Yes.

197
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,924
We own a building,

198
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,051
and I believe I deserve a share.

199
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,014
Is that building registered
under your husband's name?

200
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,225
No. My mother-in-law's.

201
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,897
Division of property
is only possible for assets

202
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,525
that your spouse owns.

203
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,901
My husband was the one

204
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,362
who had originally
purchased that building.

205
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,073
His business wasn't going well,

206
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,494
so he said we had to save the building
in case we went bankrupt.

207
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,831
That's why he transferred
the property to his mother.

208
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,376
Did you agree to this transfer?

209
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,336
No.

210
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,463
He told me afterward.

211
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,009
My opinion doesn't matter.

212
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,428
That's how it is in that family.

213
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,597
I see.

214
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,181
But first things first,

215
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,312
may I ask you why
you hit your mother-in-law?

216
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,690
I think…

217
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,986
I just lost it.

218
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,781
I was crazy.

219
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,203
You know, Attorney Shin,

220
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:19,877
after being treated
like a doormat for over 20 years,

221
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,464
your life becomes so miserable.

222
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,844
But I can put up with that.

223
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,930
But…

224
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,935
when my kids get treated the same way,

225
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,647
I can't tolerate that.

226
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,096
Online streams are better these days.

227
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,515
You can make content
with much fewer restrictions.

228
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,393
Most of our viewers
are in their twenties and thirties,

229
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,728
so you don't have to worry.

230
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,064
We could create a channel just for you.

231
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,608
You'll find it much more comfortable.

232
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,405
We already have
over a million subscribers,

233
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,825
so your channel will be
guaranteed those subscribers.

234
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,951
I see.

235
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,078
So,

236
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,790
what kind of content
are you expecting from me?

237
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
You're so gorgeous,

238
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,798
and since there are plenty of
fashion and beauty content already,

239
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,593
we were thinking of doing
something a bit different.

240
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,679
"Different"?

241
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,058
I'll just cut to the chase.

242
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,310
-We'll be turning 40 soon anyway.
-Yes.

243
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,395
-Right?
-Right.

244
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,982
We're planning some R-rated content.

245
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,986
But we're not talking about
making R-rated videos or anything.

246
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,823
It would just be talk-oriented content
on more intimate topics.

247
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:17,619
For example, topics that will catch
single men's and women's attention.

248
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,040
Things they have to talk about
to improve their sex life

249
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,709
but are hesitant to do so.

250
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,627
-You get it, right?
-No.

251
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,299
It's not going to be lowbrow.

252
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,551
With your sophisticated image,

253
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,512
anything you say will sound classy.

254
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,722
That's right.

255
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,474
I'm so jealous.

256
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,143
You don't have any wrinkles at all.

257
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,479
If you talk about
your skin care routine every--

258
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,148
Thank you for the meal.

259
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,901
It's been nice.

260
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,946
-Wait.
-I'm sorry if I offended you.

261
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,823
-But--
-"If I offended you."

262
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,992
"If that's the case."

263
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,871
It's your hypotheticals that offend me.

264
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,930
She must think she's still
the same morning radio DJ.

265
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,681
Couldn't you be more subtle?

266
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,142
She was embarrassed
because you were so upfront.

267
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,811
How else was I supposed to put it?

268
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,122
The door is a bit wonky.

269
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,170
-Thank you.
-I'll be in touch.

270
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,677
Why was she here?

271
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,012
She wants a divorce.

272
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,640
At her age?

273
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,433
Let's get something for our hangover.

274
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,436
I'm on an empty stomach
because I was waiting for you.

275
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,481
I waited for you too.

276
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,571
Enjoy your meal.
I'll just be starving here.

277
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,032
Don't get me a sandwich
with extra bacon or anything!

278
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
How about ox blood soup?

279
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,455
No, let's have bean sprout soup.

280
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,083
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Bean sprout.

281
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,293
Bean sprout.

282
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,295
You do everything your way.

283
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,882
When will the ramyeon lady
open her shop again?

284
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,133
Seriously.

285
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,054
A bowl of her ramyeon would
do the trick, don't you think?

286
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,932
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

287
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,058
Grandma!

288
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,811
-Grandma!
-I knew you'd be open today.

289
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,479
I thought you were sick.

290
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,564
Grandma?

291
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,151
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,621
That turtle wasn't there before.

293
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,877
She's got the right amount of water.

294
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,130
She already put the spring onions in.

295
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
Right.

296
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,800
-It's all about the noodles.
-Right.

297
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,596
I'm sorry for laughing
as soon as I saw you.

298
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,306
It's just that I could tell

299
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,184
you were the guys Mom told me about.

300
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,187
-"Mom"?
-Are you her daughter?

301
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,149
I guess she didn't tell you.
Yes, I'm the owner's daughter.

302
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,986
Why is she not here? Is she no longer…

303
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,030
No, she just hurt her back.

304
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,156
Oh, no.

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,824
She'll be in the hospital for a while.

306
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,619
It happens with people her age.

307
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,872
-Which hospital?
-Are you going to visit her?

308
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,542
Of course. We grew up eating her ramyeon.

309
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,127
By the way,

310
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,422
what did she tell you about us
that you recognized us right away?

311
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,758
We're not so bad-looking
in the town of Seocho-dong.

312
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,593
In the whole district, not just the town.

313
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
I don't think that's it.

314
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,014
I've only seen the two of you.

315
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,978
She said,

316
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,647
"There are these three pitiful losers
who come way too often."

317
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,984
Her words.

318
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,069
The "loser" part, I mean.

319
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,157
Not to step on any toes,
but the water is boiling.

320
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,702
Please don't put eggs in mine.

321
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,413
I didn't know we were pitiful.

322
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,291
-She was talking about you.
-No, it was you.

323
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,210
Hey, look at your skin.
Your pores are like craters.

324
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,421
Me? Don't be ridiculous.

325
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,715
-I'm not pitiful.
-You're extremely pitiful.

326
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,845
They're in, right?

327
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,306
They're having a hangover meal.

328
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,266
-Where?
-A sandwich shop?

329
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,184
Sandwiches?

330
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,812
Sandwiches…

331
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,822
Is it to your liking?

332
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,408
Yes.

333
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,873
Where's the third guy?

334
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,208
Mom said there were three of you.

335
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,003
Having ramyeon, are we?

336
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,549
-Where's Grandma?
-This is your third guy.

337
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,676
Do you want a bowl?

338
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,136
No, thank you.

339
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,096
I don't have a hangover, so I'm okay.

340
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,225
Why are you avoiding me?

341
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,644
Do I make you uncomfortable?

342
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,314
Guess what I saw.

343
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,941
What's with him?
Does he have something on you?

344
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,030
Hey, are you really not eating?

345
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,407
No, I need to pay rent.

346
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,159
So I stopped eating altogether.

347
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,829
Then stop being a nuisance
and be on your way.

348
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,664
Okay? This isn't a cafe.

349
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,584
I went to your office to tell you
something, but you weren't there.

350
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,919
Do you want rice?

351
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,506
-Half a bowl.
-A bowl of rice, please.

352
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,466
I don't have any rice.

353
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,177
Hey, she has no rice.

354
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,512
Stop stuffing your face.

355
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,972
-I'm trying to tell you something--
-Hey, I'll tell you what.

356
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,226
Go get us some instant rice
from the convenience store.

357
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,769
Make sure to microwave it first.

358
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,354
Are you crazy?

359
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,688
Hey, stop eating.

360
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,525
Pay up for your dine and dash first.

361
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,860
"Dine and dash"?

362
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,445
Me?

363
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,073
I've never been accused of that before.

364
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,200
Me neither.

365
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,869
What would she think of us?

366
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,121
Excuse me.

367
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,914
Mr. Attorney. Mr. Paralegal.

368
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,083
You literally practice law for a living.

369
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,920
You ran up a tab of 310,000 won.

370
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,465
You somehow managed to drink
310,000 won worth of soju and beer.

371
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,718
And on top of that,
one of you ran out like a lunatic,

372
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,638
and the other fell asleep
and then quietly disappeared.

373
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,598
So what choice did I have?

374
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,726
I wired them the money this morning.

375
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,354
How would you summarize
this whole situation in three words?

376
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,272
"Dine and dash"?

377
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,898
Correct.

378
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
Did we drink that much?

379
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:04,901
No way.

380
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,737
I know. It sounds ridiculous, right?

381
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,574
That's why I brought this, you pricks.
Look at this.

382
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,368
You had 15 bottles of soju
and 36 bottles of beer.

383
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,453
You're unbelievable.

384
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,877
I spent 310,000 won on alcohol
that I never even got to sniff.

385
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,254
-You called us there. Where were you?
-He's right.

386
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,172
To be frank,

387
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,883
we had no reason to be there at all.

388
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,718
It's on you for not showing up.

389
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,802
How much is it?

390
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,887
7,000 won.

391
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,471
Hey, that hasn't changed.

392
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,598
Look.

393
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,851
This guy's a regular too.
You better watch out.

394
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,146
Most things that come out
of his mouth are nonsense.

395
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,689
Just tune him out.

396
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,608
Your mother probably knows.

397
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,402
I'll prepare rice in the future.

398
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,487
Please don't fight.

399
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,488
Hey.

400
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,365
Wire me 155,000 won each.

401
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,783
Right now.

402
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,204
Has he gone to get the rice yet?

403
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,127
Hey, do you know
Seoul Arts Center's number?

404
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,128
No, look it up online.

405
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,464
-Or ask the stars in the sky.
-Darn it.

406
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,176
Why don't you just rent
a concert hall and have a recital?

407
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,345
I knew you were drinking too much.

408
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,513
Look at the likes.

409
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,474
Holy shit, there are so many.

410
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,558
61,000 LIKES

411
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,768
Hey, let's do a concert.

412
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,894
This will be a hit.

413
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,270
Shut up!

414
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,522
The guy who uploaded it won't reply!

415
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,984
-Delivery.
-Here, please.

416
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,946
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

417
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,991
Where are you going?

418
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,368
I'm going to sue the uploader.

419
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,286
-Put that down.
-Hey.

420
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,663
You didn't get extra bacon, did you?

421
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,705
I don't like bacon.

422
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,415
You bacon-hating prick.

423
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,960
What did you say? Put that down.

424
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,002
Hey.

425
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,381
Take this too!

426
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,635
CUT YA HAIR

427
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,887
Girls.

428
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,015
I'm so sorry.

429
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,976
Mom.

430
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,102
Don't say anything.

431
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,730
Don't look so gloomy.

432
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,774
You're making me sad.

433
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,405
Have some.

434
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,789
Did you eat?

435
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,082
Yes, go ahead.

436
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,792
Go on and eat.

437
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,554
Eat up.

438
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,472
Mom.

439
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,725
Don't worry about me and eat your dinner.

440
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,109
Are you proud of yourself?

441
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,153
Why did you let it come so far?

442
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,612
What have you ever done?

443
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,698
Fine.

444
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,616
Mother took it too far.

445
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,702
You've been through a lot.

446
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,995
But what can I do?

447
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,331
She was widowed
before I even started school

448
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,207
and she worked hard all her life.

449
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,918
Couldn't we have just humored her?

450
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,212
I did for over 20 years.

451
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,382
And I'm finally starting to lose it!

452
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,094
I've never had a single night
of proper sleep ever since I met you.

453
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,722
I didn't even have time
to recover after having our kids.

454
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,182
Should I guess what you'll say next?

455
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,351
-What?
-You're going to complain

456
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,687
about how tough it was to raise the kids
when my business went under

457
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,481
with me drinking day and night

458
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,441
and getting chased by creditors.

459
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,361
You're no different from your mother.

460
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,029
What did I expect?

461
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,615
I'm the idiot.

462
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,953
Honey.

463
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,707
I know how you feel.

464
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,543
I know how much I owe you.

465
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,462
But can't you…

466
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,132
be understanding once more?

467
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,176
Let's go to her

468
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,136
and apologize.

469
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,931
Yes, I should.

470
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,057
Do you mean that?

471
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,226
After we get a divorce.

472
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,355
-Park Ae-ran!
-I want my share of this building.

473
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,649
Let's not go through a lawsuit
and cause a scene.

474
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,359
The building isn't even mine.

475
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,194
You know it's under Mother's name.

476
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,029
Are you serious?

477
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,573
You think this is your mother's building?

478
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,083
She must think she's still
the same morning radio DJ.

479
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,335
Couldn't you be more subtle?

480
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,504
She was embarrassed
because you were so upfront.

481
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,005
How else was I supposed to put it?

482
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,890
This is the price you pay
for being famous.

483
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,653
You only have one more grape to go.

484
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,282
This case is much too difficult.

485
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,326
She can't get her share of the property
after assaulting her mother-in-law.

486
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,912
Plus, the building is under
her mother-in-law's name.

487
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,706
You're right. It's not an easy one.

488
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,957
You're going to lose.

489
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,542
Should I tell her instead?

490
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,045
"Attorney Shin is too busy

491
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,174
to take on any more cases."

492
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,092
Hey, she cleans this building every day.

493
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,803
You don't think she knows
how much free time I have?

494
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,721
She'd know.

495
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,390
-Even the people in the next building do.
-They do?

496
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,142
-Yes.
-That's not good.

497
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,812
Let's just look into it.

498
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,939
Into what?

499
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,191
This is an uphill battle.

500
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,735
Hey, about Ms. Park…

501
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,321
She's been cleaning here
for over two years.

502
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,074
Even when everyone else left, she stayed.

503
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,411
And she always greets us with a smile.

504
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,540
And when that English academy director
who was on a total power trip

505
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,542
used to order her around like a servant,

506
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,795
she always did as asked without complaint.

507
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,550
So let's visit her neighborhood,
ask around, then decide.

508
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,761
I'm not going there.

509
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,388
Why would I send you there?
You're a terrible actor.

510
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm sending an expert.

511
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,105
There aren't a lot of
two-year leases these days.

512
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,899
Let's see.

513
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,485
What about the one at the alley entrance?

514
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,905
The building with the hair salon.
It looked nice.

515
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,698
Are there no vacancies there?

516
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,075
I can do short-term as well.

517
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,869
The old lady
is renting out the fifth floor,

518
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,246
but it's always noisy there.

519
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,247
Why?

520
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,082
Is the old lady fussy?

521
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,042
She's notorious.

522
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,004
But her daughter-in-law
does all the maintenance,

523
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,131
so you won't run
into the old lady that often.

524
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,676
Are you moving in right away?

525
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:52,141
Well, it shouldn't take too long
to find someone to move into my place.

526
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,685
But I'm a bit worried.

527
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,691
My current landlady is very fussy too.

528
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,318
She's so fussy
that it feels stuffy to be at home.

529
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,362
So stuffy that my head feels fuzzy.

530
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,950
I don't think I can take it
if the daughter-in-law is fussy too.

531
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,869
She's a great person.

532
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,328
She does all the work.

533
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,247
She leads a very honest life.

534
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,582
What time will you come by?

535
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,791
You wanted a haircut.

536
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,209
After work.

537
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,087
She's the owner of that hair salon.

538
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,673
-Hello.
-Hello.

539
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,466
He's looking for a place

540
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,427
-and asked if your landlady was fussy.
-I see.

541
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,555
Ae-ran manages the building,
so he'll be all right.

542
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,600
You don't need to worry.

543
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,561
Wait, there's a vacancy?

544
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,771
You know the landlady
lives on the fifth floor, right?

545
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,772
Yes.

546
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,316
She wants to rent it out.

547
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,401
Is that why they argued?

548
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,986
Something's up, right?

549
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,905
I don't know.

550
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,823
It's none of my business anyway.

551
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,034
She put up with her long enough.

552
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,577
I would have run away ages ago.

553
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,287
She sells gimbap in the morning

554
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,247
and cleans buildings until late at night.

555
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,415
Tell me about it.

556
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,167
She lives like a servant,

557
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,418
not a daughter-in-law.

558
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,878
I could never.

559
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,631
Would you like to take a look?

560
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,175
Well…

561
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,303
Is there anything else available?

562
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,558
Did you go there like that?

563
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,394
Looking like some thug
in that leather jacket?

564
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,730
And why did you wear
those glasses without lenses?

565
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,649
It's not my fault I have perfect vision.

566
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,653
What is this?

567
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,614
These look new.

568
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,782
Don't pull that.

569
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,118
It's part of my work expenses.

570
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,496
I'll send you the receipt,
so wire me the money.

571
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,874
Why would your purchase of shoes
be considered a work expense?

572
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,918
I'm doing your legwork for you.

573
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,920
Legs have feet, and feet need shoes.

574
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,089
That's oddly persuasive.

575
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,591
At least remove this tag.

576
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,219
-Stop it! The tag is everything.
-What is this?

577
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,261
Really?

578
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,471
It's a part of it.

579
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,514
Right.

580
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,599
So apparently, everybody knows.

581
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,684
About what?

582
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,354
Everyone knows how much the old lady
mistreats her daughter-in-law.

583
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,940
From what I heard,

584
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,025
she has a nasty temper.

585
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,319
So? Did you get to see the house?

586
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,071
They must have given you a tour.

587
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,948
They vehemently refused to.

588
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,283
They're renting a unit out
without even showing it?

589
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,203
They rarely give tours nowadays.
That's the trend.

590
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:22,125
I felt uneasy spying on another realtor.

591
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,503
Fix your door already.

592
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,839
I will once you pay your overdue rent.

593
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,215
I'm clocking out.

594
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,591
Already?

595
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,385
Yes, I need to take a shower.

596
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,762
-Should I buy some new clothes too?
-I see.

597
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,931
-Ji-eun wants to see you?
-Yes.

598
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,182
Go on.

599
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,603
This is the register
for Ms. Park's building.

600
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,608
Here you go, punk.

601
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,140
How's your new job?

602
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,267
Do you like your colleagues?

603
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,436
Yes.

604
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,395
That's good.

605
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,608
You look drawn.

606
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,735
Are you eating well?

607
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,737
Yes.

608
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,210
I have a health checkup voucher.
You can have it.

609
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,336
It's a premium checkup.

610
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,590
The doctor used to be our client.

611
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,967
You can have it. I'm okay.

612
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,095
I already get one yearly.

613
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,514
The doctors are surprised
by how healthy I am.

614
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,808
My cholesterol level is low,

615
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,686
-and I don't have any--
-I guess your work suits you well.

616
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,772
I get to clock out on time.

617
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,734
I can always have dinner at home.

618
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,070
You seem to be doing better
than you were at the trading company.

619
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,031
I barely got to see your face
on the weekdays.

620
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,243
And you'd even get called
to work on the weekends.

621
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,870
Your liver count was bad too.

622
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,789
That's why…

623
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,459
I resigned.

624
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,837
Because you couldn't stand it.

625
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,633
I still have the money
I saved up to open up a cafe.

626
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,386
Let's run our own cafe and--

627
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,679
Are you still hung up on that?

628
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,682
Why can't you let it go?

629
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm living with another man.

630
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,535
-You'll come back to me.
-No, I won't.

631
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,370
-Ji-eun.
-Let's get a divorce.

632
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,080
Please.

633
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,094
I'm only saying this
so you won't blame yourself.

634
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,263
I know that you're a good man.

635
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,765
-It's not that I don't like you--
-Then why?

636
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,734
I just love him so much.

637
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,031
I don't need anything.
Please just file the divorce papers.

638
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,490
Goodbye.

639
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,256
Lucky you.

640
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,052
You're over 40…

641
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,849
and you can still say you love someone.

642
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,355
We need evidence to show

643
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,066
that you've been
verbally abused for a long time.

644
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,401
A diary would be perfect.

645
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,447
"She said this to me on this day,
and I felt like this."

646
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,658
That kind of stuff.

647
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,952
I don't have time to write a diary.

648
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,579
-I barely get enough sleep.
-Right.

649
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,208
But your neighbors
seem to know about your situation.

650
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,627
Maybe one of them could testify for you.

651
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,338
Gosh, I don't know
if they'll want to get involved.

652
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,133
Getting a divorce isn't so easy.

653
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,680
Goodness, Attorney Shin.
You can leave it. I can do it.

654
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,057
It's okay. I'm exercising my legs.

655
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:54,188
We need some kind of evidence.

656
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,691
We may need your daughters to testify.

657
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,651
Attorney Shin.

658
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,568
Yes?

659
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,448
My kids have already seen too much.

660
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,783
I'd be so ashamed.

661
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,994
I know. I completely understand.

662
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,955
But you'll have to give it some thought
if it comes down to it.

663
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,542
Look.

664
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,585
When you first purchased the building,

665
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,213
are you sure it was paid for
from your husband's account?

666
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,673
Of course.

667
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,760
I was there with him
when he was paid the installments.

668
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,681
I thought we were going to
be building owners.

669
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,309
-I was so excited.
-Right.

670
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,602
In that case,

671
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,565
we can submit
the transaction record to the court.

672
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,317
But here's the problem.

673
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,486
That record alone might not be enough.

674
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,865
Are there any notarized documents
signed by your mother-in-law

675
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,283
and your husband?

676
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,493
-Sorry?
-Notarized…

677
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,995
What I mean is,

678
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,290
some kind of proof that it's his building

679
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,584
although it's under
your mother-in-law's name.

680
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,463
Is there some kind of notarized memorandum

681
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,923
that can prove this?

682
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,469
You know, a memorandum
with stamps and signatures.

683
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,725
Why did you hand over the building
without discussing it?

684
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,851
If I had,

685
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,645
would you have said yes?

686
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,983
If I hadn't registered it under her name,
we'd be broke right now.

687
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,197
What if she claims
that the building is hers later?

688
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,740
The building isn't going anywhere.

689
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,784
I'm her only son.

690
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,954
Also, I have a notarized document

691
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,208
that says I'm the actual owner.

692
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,751
I have a recording too.

693
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,127
Where? Let me see them.

694
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,712
They're…

695
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,382
with her.

696
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,550
Why would she have them?

697
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,595
She feels uneasy otherwise.
What choice did I have?

698
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,183
They're safe with her, so don't worry.

699
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,354
We would have lost the building
if I hadn't done that.

700
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,190
Yes, we have proof.

701
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,528
He said there was
a notarized document and a recording.

702
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,780
That's great. Do you have them?

703
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,741
No. My mother-in-law does.

704
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,745
I'll retrieve them.

705
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,455
I'll get them at all costs.

706
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:17,957
All right.

707
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,798
Gosh, you don't need to.

708
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,092
-I'll move this over here.
-Goodness.

709
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,218
-There.
-You didn't have to.

710
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,886
Thank you, Attorney Shin.

711
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,305
-I can finish up on my own.
-It's okay.

712
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,646
Uncle Sung-han,
can I bring my game console?

713
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,607
Of course, why not?
Bring everything you want to play.

714
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,900
You have a fun game?

715
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,527
Yes, it's super fun.

716
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,820
Is it?

717
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,822
Bring it here and we'll play together.

718
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,532
But under one condition.

719
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,451
It won't be fun
if there's nothing at stake.

720
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,036
The loser gets flicked on the forehead.

721
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,955
I won't go easy on you.

722
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,292
Gi-yeong.

723
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,046
Uncle Sung-han, Ms. Jin is calling me.

724
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,299
See you next week.

725
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,468
Okay. Bye.

726
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,951
Were you talking to your friend?

727
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,036
Yes.

728
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,162
Gi-yeong!

729
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,584
Are you ready
for your English test tomorrow?

730
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,503
-Yes.
-Mom.

731
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,005
Can I play with him now?

732
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,049
Gi-yeong, let's play this game.

733
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,967
It's super fun.

734
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,761
Okay. Let me see that.

735
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,515
It's time for bed, Ha-yul.

736
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,226
Let's just let him study.

737
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,937
Keep studying.

738
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,284
This bastard.

739
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,912
I HAVE MY PORTRAIT RIGHTS.
TAKE IT DOWN THIS INSTANT!

740
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,497
Why isn't he replying?

741
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,587
ANYONE THERE?

742
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,347
Everyone loves the video.

743
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,266
I'm honored.

744
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,393
What's with the smiley face?

745
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,270
You think this is funny?

746
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,775
"I work in the field of law."

747
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,861
"This could cause problems."

748
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,030
"Take it down."

749
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,084
You were playing in public.

750
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,381
This guy's a nutjob.

751
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,635
"That's because I was inebriated…"

752
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,558
AND MY JUDGMENT WAS IMPAIRED

753
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,694
You're the one who drank.

754
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,737
Not my problem.

755
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
I can't take it down
when it has so many views.

756
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,491
Please stop bothering me, Piano Man.

757
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,580
I am lost for words.

758
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,083
Should I just beat the crap out of him?

759
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,297
What's this punk's deal?

760
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,971
I'm so mad.

761
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,474
I'm so mad!

762
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,601
Damn it!

763
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,354
Brother Tes

764
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,316
What's wrong with this world?

765
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,904
Why does it make me want to use violence?

766
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,033
Come on, man.

767
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,036
Why are you embarrassed by your talent?

768
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,290
Could he be a professor?

769
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,172
Is it because of his dignity
as a professor or…

770
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,507
PLEASE STOP BOTHERING ME, PIANO MAN

771
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,301
He sure doesn't look like one.

772
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,680
AN ORDINARY GUY'S
INSANE BUSKING SKILLS WHILE DRUNK

773
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,602
It has so many views.

774
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,106
1,000 comments!

775
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,194
I hit the jackpot.

SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

777
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,908
RÉSUMÉ

778
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,673
Did we happen to

779
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,385
post a job advertisement, Mr. Jang?

780
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,096
No, we already have nothing to do.

781
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,389
Are you telling me to quit?

782
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,348
-No!
-No!

783
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,809
I don't need a big paycheck.

784
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,978
I'm sure I'll find
things to do around here.

785
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,105
Please consider this in a positive light.

786
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,732
Well, to be honest,

787
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:40,070
we don't exactly get
a lot of work around here.

788
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:46,702
Even now, we're gathered here
to discuss what to order for snacks.

789
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,580
-I'm good at choosing what to eat.
-I have good suggestions too.

790
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,206
Then we could cooperate.

791
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,749
Why don't you have a seat and--

792
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,543
I need proof of employment.

793
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,337
You know that, right?

794
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,594
Let's talk in my office.

795
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,721
I'm sure you'll find a decent job.

796
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,306
This way, Ms. Lee.

797
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,975
-Some drinks, please.
-Sure.

798
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,060
That little…

799
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,772
I might be quite useful.

800
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,650
For example…

801
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,572
Goodness.

802
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,059
-Do you have a lighter?
-Yes.

803
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,146
I thought you quit.

804
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,648
Starting tomorrow.

805
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,918
Try opening it.

806
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,217
You won't need both hands.

807
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,062
For example, I can handle
miscellaneous tasks like this.

808
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,902
-Open…
-Sesame!

809
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,071
-Open…
-Sesame!

810
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,198
-Open…
-Sesame!

811
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,117
Sae-bom, four cups of coffee.

812
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,995
Please.

813
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,289
Please.

814
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,456
Unbelievable.

815
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,001
We could fit a vending machine through it!

816

00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,844
Goodness.

818
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,054
If I were you,

819
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,141
I'd live off the rent money.

820
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,273
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

821
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,327
I've only heard of you.

822
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,370
But now that I'm sitting in your office,

823
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,372
you seem like a real attorney.

824
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,127
Why would you come all the way here

825
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,547
out of the blue?

826
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,094
Those are nice-looking grapes.

827
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,306
Do you color one in
for every case you win?

828
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,391
Goodness.

829
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,685
You have one more to go.

830
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,313
I tend to have a good hunch.

831
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,483
I bet you'll do something
after coloring all of them.

832
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,567
Right?

833
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:06,985
Right.

834
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,697
Don't tell me. Is it me?

835
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,371
Sung-han.

836
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:24,211
Living in the past only eats away at you.

837
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,381
Who was it? Adler?

838
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,133
He said not to bitch over
what happened in the past.

839
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,886
Come on.

840
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,182
I doubt such a renowned psychologist

841
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,560
used such unsophisticated words.

842
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,437
I'm not very sophisticated.

843
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,191
I don't look any better
with expensive clothes on.

844
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,693
Someone once told me

845
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,738
that money can't hide your crudity.

846
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,074
That's why I don't buy clothes.

847
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,492
It's a waste of money.

848
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,077
I see.

849
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,081
Why don't you just cut to the chase?

850
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,292
I do have a lot of time,
but I'm getting bored.

851
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,087
You sure are different.

852
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,506
You're a true artist.

853
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,967
All right then.

854
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
Your monthly visitation
with Gi-yeong ends here.

855
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,390
We won't send him over anymore.

856
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,520
And who decided that?

857
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,771
His family, of course.

858
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,899
Why are they suddenly taking away
the 12 visits per year

859
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,277
that they benevolently granted me?

860
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,404
Beats me.

861
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,824
I'm only here
because I was the attorney in charge.

862
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,785
You were my sister's attorney,

863
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,036
not theirs.

864
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,415
But look at you now,
delivering a message like this.

865
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,002
-You really don't change, do you?
-I'm in a difficult spot too.

866
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,338
You're so close by,
yet I never got to visit you until now.

867
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,799
I have it rough too.

868
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,094
Anyway, she wants to end this.

869
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,265
His mom is the PR director
of my firm, so I have to--

870
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,854
Stepmom.

871
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,397
His stepmom.

872
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,365
-Well, this is quite upsetting.
-What is?

873
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,785
I testified that meeting
his uncle regularly

874
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,078
would help his emotional stability.

875
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,122
I was the one who did that.

876
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,291
Aren't you grateful?

877
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,589
I would've been if I didn't have to
go through all that to begin with.

878
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,009
Come on, you studied law for years.

879
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,428
I guess you don't change either.

880
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,724
You said you had a good hunch, right?

881
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,770
Then let me ask you a question,
Mr. Park Yu-seok with a great hunch.

882
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,232
What do you think I'll do first

883
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,109
after coloring in that last grape?

884
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,405
You'll come after us
with your family law expertise.

885
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,325
Gosh, you're scaring me.

886
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,994
This one bastard

887
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:07,457
did a shitty job as an attorney

888
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,668
but claimed to have done his best.

889
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,380
He was obviously a puppet
who sold out for money.

890
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,091
He even became a partner at a firm.

891
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:17,884
Tell me.

892
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,971
Wouldn't you be pissed too?

893
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,019
I'll tell you what.

894
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,480
About this bastard…

895
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,361
He wouldn't have had to sell out
had he inherited a building too.

896
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,615
Just how much would I make on rent alone?

897
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,788
It's not easy for someone
from a rich family to decide to study.

898
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,249
But I did it.

899
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,459
I knew nothing about the law.

900
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,087
I was a pianist, for crying out loud.

901
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,088
But I made it.

902
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,965
What do you think motivated me?

903
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,512
Rage.

904
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:09,227
The rage that fills every inch of me

905
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,479
from head to toe.

906
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,276
You're impressive.

907
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:22,240
You became an attorney to get to
the bottom of your sister's divorce.

908
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,410
You're competent,
yet only handle divorce cases.

909
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,037
You must be popular with women.

910
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,413
Are you still single?

911
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,083
That is the shittiest question
I've heard recently.

912
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,546
I'll take care of that myself, so…

913
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,673
why don't you leave?

914
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,468
All right.

915
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,018
Fine.

916
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,229
I'll take care of
relaying your message over.

917
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,153
Have a good day.

918
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,896
Shin Sung-han.

919
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,899
You're still young.

920
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,821
Should I sue that bastard who told me
I'd have good luck with people after 50?

921
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,033
How much did I pay him for that reading?

922
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,961
-Did you want to see me, sir?
-Yes. Did you have coffee?

923
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,212
Yes, I already had some.

924
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,839
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

925
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,764
I heard you were our top intern.

926
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,474
Yes, sir.

927
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,641
And this is your last week.

928
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,561
-Yes, sir.
-Have you chosen your field?

929
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,271
M&A? Enterprise accounting?

930
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,898
-Sorry?
-Come on.

931
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,442
Don't play dumb.

932
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,777
That's old-fashioned.

933
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,779
You obviously know.

934
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,655
That you'll be the last one standing.

935
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,910
Let me give you one last mission.

936
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,078
Yes, sir. Anything.

937
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,621
Shin Sung-han.

938
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,623
He's an attorney.

939
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,333
That bastard…

940
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,881
Look into the divorce suit
that he's preparing for.

941
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,676
I'm sorry, sir.

942
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,098
But I need to understand
the task to be motivated.

943
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,600
-Why…
-Do you like grapes?

944
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,393
I love them.

945
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,895
They're what you make wine with.

946
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,021
Were you born in the '90s?

947
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,356
1993, sir.

948
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,899
-I see.
-Yes, sir.

949
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,485
You sure are a different generation.

950
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,911
-Listen carefully.
-Yes, sir.

951
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,831
Starting today, I hate grapes.

952
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,752
So I'm going to ruin his grapes.

953
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,298
I see.

954
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,053
"Grapes"?

955
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,821
You should sleep at home.

956
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,072
I'm okay.

957
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,825
Why are you here
when she's sleeping comfortably at home?

958
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,034
Go on.

959
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,105
Darn it.

960
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,079
Why were you in there?

961
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,552
That was terrible.

962
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,638
No, I can do better.

963
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,473
Listen.

964
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,823
Jeez.

965
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,171
Aren't I good?

966
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,382
You need to practice more.

967
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,722
Sung-han.

968
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,806
Yes?

969
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,559
I think this piece is really sad.

970
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,730
This Mozart piece.

971
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,524
Piano Concerto No. 23, the 2nd movement.

972
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,620
Can you play this piece
when you perform in Germany?

973
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,747
-Will you come?
-Yes.

974
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,956
If you play it.

975
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,209
Sure. Then bring Gi-yeong with you.

976
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,754
You can watch my recital together.

977
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,298
Yes. We'll go to Vienna together.

978
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,424
And…

979
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,263
Ju-hwa.

980
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,058
Ju-hwa.

981
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,810
Shin Ju-hwa.

982
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,402
Ju-hwa.

983
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,908
Ju-hwa.

984
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,662
Ju…

985
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,122
Ju-hwa…

986
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,043
Ju-hwa.

987
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,268

DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

989
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:13,122
-We don't handle that many cases.
-You're the paralegal. This is your job.

990
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,332
-We should get to work.
-What?

991
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,000
-What?
-Let's do this.

992
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,043
We'll file a countersuit.

993
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,253
How could an attorney
encourage her to lie?

994
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,255
I believe my client's words.

995
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,757
We should get you started.

996
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:24,967
So it was you?

997
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:29,180
From this point on,
you really need to brace yourself.

998
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,723
I think we'll win.

999
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,434
Now that it's begun,

1000
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,770
we have to win at all costs.

1001
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,652
