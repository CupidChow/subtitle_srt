1
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,888
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,601
I got…

3
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,981
some fresh octopus.

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,608
EPISODE 9

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,736
Let's parboil it

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,156
and enjoy it with some spicy sauce.

7
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,993
It'll be delicious.

8
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,209
So hurry up and bring Yeong-gwang back.

9
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,384
My client neither has any friends here

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,553
nor speaks the language.

11
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,140
But she started a family here

12
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,643
because she trusted the defendant.

13
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,022
But things were not as she expected.

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:52,028
The defendant owns
about 3,600 pyeong of farmland.

15
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,531
And he does all the farming himself

16
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,117
without hiring any help.

17
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,453
As the workload was too heavy for him,

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
my young client

19
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,834
had no choice
but to help him out all the time.

20
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,962
She thought she was marrying him.

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,881
But she ended up doing labor for him.

22
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,968
In the diagnosis that we submitted,

23
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,763
you can see that she was suffering from
severe postpartum depression.

24
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,390
That's why she asked him…

25
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,769
if she could visit Vietnam for a while.

26
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,939
She wanted to see her mother
and her young siblings.

27
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,942
Was that too much to ask?

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,822
Did she really deserve to be beaten
until her bones were broken?

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,577
Right. The farming.

30
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,124
The couple worked hard
without getting any help.

31
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,292
That's true.

32
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,629
So I made some calculations.

33
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
Plaintiff.

34
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,052
You told him you needed time
to adjust to this country, correct?

35
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,513
That's why you spent

36
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,892
a whole year taking
online Korean classes from home.

37
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,814
And then another year and two months,
for a hairdressing course in Gwangju.

38
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,107
A four-hour round trip.

39
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,110
Your Honor, the plaintiff is a foreigner.

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,030
He's confusing her
with irrelevant questions.

41
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,074
These are all relevant questions.
Let me talk.

42
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,826
Defendant's counselor.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,952
Get to the point.

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,037
This is all important.

45
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,914
Yes, Your Honor.

46
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,582
I'll get to the point.

47
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,626
Plaintiff.

48
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,795
Throughout your marriage,

49
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,925
who did the house chores
and looked after the baby?

50
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,264
That's right.

51
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,060
Your 87-year-old mother-in-law did.

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,646
So I did some calculations.

53
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,522
The total amount of time

54
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,777
that you spent
helping out with the farming

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,403
is about three months.

56
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,447
Sure, that's a long time.

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,115
It must have been tough.

58
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,951
But what about my client?

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,994
Did he have it any easier?

60
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,913
Since he got married,

61
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:12,252
he's taken 4 weekends off out of 52.

62
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,255
This is including holidays, of course.

63
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,425
He works from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day.

64
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,639
And he's been sticking to
this grueling schedule to this day.

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,224
And you say he exploited you?

66
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,810
I can't agree with that.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,271
That is an unverified claim.

68
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,649
It's a subjective claim
with no evidence to back it up.

69
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,568
I would like to submit

70
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,862
the neighbors' statements.

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,964
You also claim he neglected
your postpartum depression,

72
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,590
but I beg to differ.

73
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:05,054
The defendant invited every single member
of the plaintiff's family to Korea

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,141
and sent them on a trip to Jeju Island.

75
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,601
I believe you were
six months pregnant, correct?

76
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,270
After she gave birth,

77
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,940
the defendant suggested

78
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,735
that they visit her home country together.

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,114
Since the baby was still young
and yet to be vaccinated,

80
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,158
they agreed on waiting for six months.

81
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,577
He purchased flight tickets right away,

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,704
which are still in your photo album.

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,039
You know that, right?

84
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,834
Here's the problem.

85
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,963
Four weeks after giving birth,

86
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,507
she started going out often

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,676
and leaving the baby
with her mother-in-law.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,848
She would often stay out late
and come home drunk.

89
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,643
The defendant didn't stop her
despite his concern.

90
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,563
Why? She was still young,
living in a new country,

91
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,065
and had just given birth.

92
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,942
Plus, he thought
she didn't have any friends.

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,529
Taking these factors into consideration,

94
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,783
it is far from the truth
that the defendant neglected

95
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,826
the plaintiff's postpartum depression.

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,621
I have one question.

97
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,831
Just one.

98
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,627
Is your child, Yeong-gwang,

99
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,045
the biological son

100
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,756
of Mr. Ma Chun-seok,

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,591
the defendant?

102
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,721
Your Honor.

103
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,975
I would like to request a paternity test
for their son, Ma Yeong-gwang.

104
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,143
Your Honor.

105
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,063
Asking for a paternity test
solely based on assumptions--

106
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,066
No. This isn't just based on assumptions.

107
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,610
There's something I don't understand.

108
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,946
Let's talk about their blood types.

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,867
Yeong-gwang is blood type A.

110
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,746
And his mother, the plaintiff,
is blood type O, correct?

111
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,083
In this case,

112
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,002
the father's blood type

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,172
can only be type AB or type A.

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,142
I'd like to submit
Mr. Ma's blood test results.

115
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,154
ABO TYPING TEST RESULTS

116
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,243
That's right. The defendant…

117
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,829
is blood type B.

118
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,791
No, that's not true.
He said he was blood type A.

119
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,884
BLOOD TYPE: A POSITIVE

120
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,993
IN SESSION

121
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,171
I had a long conversation
with the plaintiff.

122
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,173
Yes.

123
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,301
She has shown great remorse
for her past actions.

124
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,432
Since she is the spouse at fault,
she can no longer demand a divorce.

125
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,184
So I'd like to ask you.

126
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
Will you maintain this marriage?

127
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,568
Please do understand
that her guilt plays a part

128
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,779
in why she has given up on this marriage.

129
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,447
However,

130
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,158
the most painful thing
for her to bear was…

131
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,702
the defendant's violent behavior.

132
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,081
His violent tendencies

133
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,417
will affect the child negatively.

134
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,128
Not too long ago,

135
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,175
Attorney Shin over there
gracefully won a case.

136
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,472
As a result, a highly problematic mother
won custody of her child.

137
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,474
Infidelity,

138
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,060
-a video of her--
-Your Honor.

139
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,020
Plaintiff's counselor.

140
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,605
What are you trying to say?

141
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,942
As you can see from that case,

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,820
having an affair is bad,

143
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,156
but so is the situation
that makes one do such a thing.

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,242
That's what I'm trying to say.

145
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,504
Plaintiff.

146
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,507
About your fractured arm.

147
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,344
Both the defendant and his mother

148
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,513
deny assaulting you.

149
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,850
But you claim to have been beaten by him.

150
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,518
This is a very important matter,

151
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
but there were no cameras or witnesses.

152
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,025
Could you explain what happened that day?

153
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,735
No one saw what happened,

154
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,404
and I've been very curious about it.

155
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,824
If you don't mind,
could you tell us how he beat you?

156
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,534
-Your Honor!
-Your Honor.

157
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,827
This is very important.

158
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,245
You may continue.

159
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,371
Thank you.

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,043
What did he hit you with?

161
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,546
Plaintiff.

162
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,968
How did the defendant hit you?

163
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,596
With both hands?

164
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,309
He must have hit you very hard
to have fractured your bones.

165
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
So how did he do it?

166
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,397
Did he use his right arm like this?

167
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,567
Or did he use his left arm like this?

168
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,277
Which arm was it?

169
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm ready.

170
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,955
You're going to be fine.

171
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,750
Okay, just do it.

172
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,133
She says he hit her with his right arm.

173
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,968
-His right arm?
-Yes.

174
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,767
I…

175
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,312
I didn't think I'd need to submit this.

176
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,605
One minute, Your Honor.

177
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,948
This is the defendant's
orthopedic diagnosis.

178
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,032
Your Honor.

179
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,118
This evidence wasn't
submitted beforehand.

180
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,285
No.

181
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,580
This is no different from
the plaintiff's fracture diagnosis.

182
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,833
It's about his frozen shoulder.

183
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,126
It's nothing big.

184
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,753
Here.

185
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,849
Your Honor.

186
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,100
The defendant…

187
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:11,188
has been receiving treatment
for his right shoulder for over a year.

188
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,441
He can't even use chopsticks,

189
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,193
let alone carry anything heavy
with his right arm.

190
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,156
You trusted him enough
to move to this foreign country.

191
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,700
He's your husband.

192
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,953
Did you really not know

193
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,706
about his shoulder pain?

194
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,138
That is all.

195
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,208
What are your thoughts on the ruling?

196
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,210
Anything to say to Ms. Dinh Thi Hoa?

197
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,878
Attorney Shin.

198
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,422
Will you sue her for slander?

199
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,722
Do you think

200
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,434
Ms. Dinh Thi Hoa is the only one
who slandered him?

201
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,486
WITCH HUNT BY THE PUBLIC
DANGERS OF SOCIAL BIAS

202
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,071
SHIN SAYS "SHE'S NOT THE ONLY SLANDERER"

203
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,198
SHIN SUNG-HAN WAS RIGHT AGAIN

204
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:49,203
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

205
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,835
You can eat them now. They're all done.

206
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,296
Here.

207
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,018
This is great.

208
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,192
Is Mr. Ma not going to sue her?

209
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,239
He apparently got her
and the baby an apartment in Daejeon.

210
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,032
What about the kid's father?

211
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,201
He ran away ages ago.

212
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,307
I should make some more noodles.

213
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,433
It won't take long.

214
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,184
Go to her.

215
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,521
That reminds me.

216
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,523
Do you remember that novel?

217
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,149
The one we read in school.

218
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,027
The wife has an affair.

219
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,322
So she gives birth
even though her husband is sterile.

220
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,993
He knows the child isn't his,
but he wants some kind of connection.

221
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,246
So he insists that the baby has his toes.

222
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,915
Are you talking about Our Toes Are Alike?

223
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,083
Yes, that one.

224
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,462
I can't believe he butchered
that great novel like that.

225
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,339
Hey.

226
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,218
Yeom Sang-seop would be so upset.

227
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,762
He'd be turning in his grave.

228
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,597
-Right, Yeom Sang-seop.
-He'd be so mad.

229
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,767
But not as mad as Kim Dong-in.

230
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,729
The one who wrote Our Toes Are Alike.

231
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,980
Not Yeom Sang-seop.

232
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,107
You idiot.

233
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,359
Read your classicals.

234
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,821
It's "classics," not "classicals."

235
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,364
-Classics?
-Yes, classics.

236
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,324
I didn't have to take the CSAT.

237
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:15,993
I was gifted.

238
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,953
You're so obnoxious.

239
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,001
How are you feeling?

240
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,046
You seem to be doing well.

241
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,551
I eat and sleep well.

242
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,802
I'm doing fine.

243
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,596
But you shouldn't be.

244
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,806
Should I be crying in a corner?

245
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,267
Was that the best you could do?

246
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,062
You made us all look stupid.

247
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,314
I mean…

248
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,151
I had no idea Ma Chun-seok
genuinely loved her.

249
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,153
He hid his blood type
to cover up her infidelity

250
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,738
and even took in her son.

251
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,408
Love sure conquers all.

252
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,080
What happened to your drive?

253
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,499
You should have done

254
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,378
everything you could
like you did during Shin Ju-hwa's case.

255
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,922
Don't you agree?

256
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,884
That was a different story.

257
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,514
It's not like Dinh Thi Hoa
offered me a job.

258
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,474
I had no reason

259
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,684
to go that far.

260
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Park Yu-seok.

261
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,729
What did you call me?

262
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,148
What is this attitude?

263
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,109
You're crossing the line.

264
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,362
That's exactly what I want to say to you.

265
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,282
Please stop crossing the line.

266
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,577
I told you not to provoke Shin Sung-han

267
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,079
or we'd all be doomed.

268
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,707
Yet you sent Ma Chun-seok to him
without consulting me,

269
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,127
put me on the case
without discussing it with me,

270
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,420
and contacted the media
without running it by me.

271
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,967
Aren't we supposed to be partners?

272
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,930
These kinds of things are
hard to come back from.

273
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,311
How long do you think
you can keep that position of yours,

274
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,897
Attorney Park?

275
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,072
So that's what you wanted to tell me.

276
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,741
"Park Yu-seok."

277
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,746
"Know your place and stay there

278
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,624
if you want to keep your job."

279
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,919
This is as far as my generosity goes.

280
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,964
It's only natural

281
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,384
for the incompetent to be replaced,

282
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,636
Attorney Park.

283
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,321
You've all gotten old.

284
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,780
Grandma.

285
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,866
I have the skin of a 32-year-old.

286
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,535
Who said that?

287
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,703
My dermatologist.

288
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,496
You know that clinic, right?

289
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,081
J Clinic.

290
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,833
The dermatologist is totally hot.

291
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,792
Dr. Cha Mi-jo.

292
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,795
How did your surgery go?

293
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,964
At least I can walk around now.

294
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,176
She told me what you've been up to.

295
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,511
I heard you got divorced.

296
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,389
You caught me off-guard.

297
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,684
Yes. I did.

298
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,603
Well done.

299
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,439
You should have let her go sooner.

300
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,274
What's the point of holding on to her

301
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,984
when she's found someone else?

302
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,402
You did the right thing.

303
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
Thank you.

304
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
But still,

305
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,741
the stroller was over the top.

306
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,534
-Mom.
-Yes?

307
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,827
-Please.
-Why?

308
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,538
Well…

309
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,332
That's what people recommended.

310
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,334
I said cash.

311
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,795
He put that huge thing together himself

312
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,339
and it was a bit crooked.

313
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,299
It was a weird color too.

314
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,051
But you're in deeper water.

315
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,052
Me?

316
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:02,970
-Yes.
-Why?

317
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,682
Hyeong-geun is a single man now.

318
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,643
Considering his character,
women will be lining up for him.

319
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,395
Come on.

320
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,899
I'm a bachelor and he's divorced.

321
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,235
Hey, at least I have some money saved up.

322
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,486
You're in debt.

323
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,656
Even the conglomerates have debt.
You're so ignorant.

324
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,243
Hey.

325
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,121
I didn't know you were so good
at playing the piano.

326
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,039
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

327
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,332
Not bad, right?

328
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,583
Yes.

329
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,170
You should close down your lame office
and start a piano school instead.

330
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,674
From what I saw, I think
you're good enough to teach some kids.

331
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,842
-Mom.
-Yes?

332
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,011
I already explained it all to you.

333
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
He was a professor in Germany.

334
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,472
A piano professor.

335
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,808
And I told you to stop with that nonsense.

336
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,226
Grandma.

337
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,938
This world is full of nonsense.

338
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,232
But if you take a closer look,

339
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,776
everything happens for a reason,

340
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,446
-and everyone has a story--
-If you ask me,

341
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,906
you're as good as a piano professor.

342
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,033
No.

343
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,201
I'm not as good as a professor.

344
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,662
I was an actual professor in Germany--

345
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,998
Fine. Let's say that's the case.

346
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,875
So what's your problem?

347
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,127
Are you just dense?

348
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,086
Sorry?

349
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,589
You're sitting in your office all day,

350
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,843
meddling with other people's marriages
when you've never been married yourself.

351
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,387
In that sense, Jeong-sik…

352
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,638
That's your name, right?

353
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,891
He's doing much better than you.

354
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,020
Write that down.
That's pure wisdom right there.

355
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,272
Yes, write it down.

356
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,857
Just give us our ramyeon!

357
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,858
Look at you.

358
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,278
Pouting just because
I nagged you a little.

359
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,697
Write it down.

360
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,699
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

361
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,451
-Goodness. Be careful.
-But…

362
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,787
-I'm fine.
-Write it down before you forget.

363
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,663
You lost to Jeong-sik.

364
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,582
I'm suddenly worse than Jeong-sik?

365
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,169
KNITTING STUDIO

366
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,220
This must be the place.

367
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,597
Shall we go in?

368
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,058
I suddenly have a stomachache.

369
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,977
It's been hurting since this morning.

370
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,104
So I guess not suddenly.

371
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,272
I'll go get some medicine. Go ahead.

372
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,983
It's hard to focus
when you have a stomachache.

373
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,318
I know how that feels.

374
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,445
Where could a pharmacy--

375
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,197
I can find one myself.

376
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,785
I could use a refreshing vitamin drink.

377
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,746
I'll be going in.

378
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,592
-Come in.
-Hello, ladies.

379
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,969
Hello.

380
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,848
Does he want to divorce her
because of her schizophrenia?

381
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,101
I can't talk about that kind of stuff.

382
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,352
That's confidential.

383
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,396
Right.

384
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,898
I'm sure he has his reasons.

385
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,193
I may be running a support group for them,

386
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,946
but family members of those
who have schizophrenia

387
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,240
go through a lot emotionally.

388
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,743
You could write a dozen books

389
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,745
with all the stories from the group.

390
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,957
About your online support group,
Heart Waves.

391
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,792
It's got quite a few members.

392
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,878
How active are they?

393
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,005
Do you meet in person too?

394
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,634
We mostly share information online

395
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,929
and have our monthly offline meetings.

396
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,141
By any chance,

397
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,019
do you remember a man
named Park Hyeon-tae?

398
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,438
"Park Hyeon-tae"?

399
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,566
I'm not sure.

400
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,696
This is him.

401
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,785
I remember him now.

402
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,871
That's Hyeon-tae.

403
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,497
-He's handsome.
-Right?

404
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,460
Was he pretty active

405
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,671
in your support group?

406
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,007
He was very active.

407
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,009
Such a thoughtful young man.

408
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,107
It's probably lukewarm.

409
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,402
How's your stomach?
Did you take your medicine?

410
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,697
Yes, I feel better now.

411
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,992
-Should we go?
-Shall we?

412
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,118
Okay.

413
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,672
Have they been starving?

414
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,051
Hey, my ramyeon is better, right?

415
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,678
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

416
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,139
You can't beat the original owner.

417
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,601
I'm the original owner.
How many times do I have to tell you?

418
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,853
You use just the right amount of water.

419
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,896
Hey.

420
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,690
-Isn't the soup perfect?
-Yes.

421
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,944
But I think Ms. Kim's noodles
have better texture.

422
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,655
They don't get soggy until you finish.

423
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,448
That's a skill.

424
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,076
Do you want some rice?

425
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,036
A little bit later.

426
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,174
We never saw his potential.

427
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,510
May I have some rice?

428
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,471
Of course.

429
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,557
Rice.

430
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,643
He's miles ahead of you two.

431
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,228
You still have a long way to go.

432
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,024
Here's your rice.

433
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,085
Your noodles are getting soggy.

434
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,544
Go on and eat her ramyeon.

435
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,841
You've gone insane.

436
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,635
Hey.

437
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,056
Can we get some rice too?

438
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,265
We're all out.

439
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,898
Oh, dear.

440
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,441
I dropped it.

441
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,737
-I dropped it right in.
-Should we just kill him?

442
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,662
I could really use some rice.

443
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,873
-We're all out.
-No rice.

444
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,591
Why are you still here?

445
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,762
I guess I'll get going,
now that my boss is clocking out.

446
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,473
You and your words…

447
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,976
You know you come on too strong, right?

448
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,060
No, sir.

449
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,270
Right.

450
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,938
-I'm leaving.
-Sir.

451
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,065
Yes?

452
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,984
It's my first case.

453
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,236
-Could I brief you on it?
-No.

454
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,612
I have a lot on my mind.

455
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,239
Let's just mind our own business.

456
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,116
All right, I guess… Hold on.

457
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,368
Yes?

458
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,247
I think I can do the legwork alone.

459
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,458
And why is that?

460
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,795
I don't think Ms. Lee is quite ready
to go out and meet people yet.

461
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,258
I understand. Let's talk about it later.

462
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,176
Okay.

463
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,635
That's it, right?

464
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,388
No more "hold on,"
"wait," or "sir," right?

465
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,682
I love you, but not that much.

466
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,570
Do we have milk?

467
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,405
No.

468
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,115
Milk.

469
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,951
Do you need anything?

470
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,369
Sneakers.

471
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,330
They're too small now.

472
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,998
Already?

473
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,543
Your feet have gotten so big.

474
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,921
They used to be so tiny.

475
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,589
That tickles.

476
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,302
Sneakers.

477
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,018
Come here. These look nice.

478
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,524
Anything's fine.

479
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,693
You should still have a look.

480
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,946
What do you think?

481
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,906
It says they're comfortable.

482
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,617
Okay. I'll get those.

483
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,118
Do you not like them?

484
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,913
Let me look for other ones.

485
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,669
-Mom.
-Yes?

486
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,963
How do you know if they're comfortable

487
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,549
without trying them on?

488
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,644
Are you ordering them today?

489
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,312
Yes.

490
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,815
Do you think I can get them
before PE class on Friday?

491
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,733
Of course.

492
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,367
I'm going to bed.

493
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,410
Okay.

494
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,871
-Did you brush your teeth?
-Yes.

495
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,082
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night.

496
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,459
Thanks. You too.

497
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,502
Thanks.

498
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,184
MEDIATION ROOM

499
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,646
The defendant's brother and his wife
made many unreasonable demands.

500
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:44,235
They demanded clothes or home appliances
as gifts once every two months.

501
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,032
Their dryer, kimchi fridge, TV…

502
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,409
It's a 62-inch TV at that.

503
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,621
They even asked for a toaster
from a famous foreign brand.

504
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,664
And the plaintiff paid for everything.

505
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,667
Most recently,
for his sister-in-law's birthday,

506
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,297
he was demanded a designer
purse that you'd have to line up to get.

507
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,091
I submitted a text from her.

508
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,763
"I'll wait in line.
You can just give me your credit card."

509
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,684
The defendant couldn't say no

510
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,604
to these unreasonable demands. Why?

511
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,648
Why couldn't he?

512
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,152
Because they were raising his daughter
whom he had been hiding.

513
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,238
The problem is that he hid everything
and got married to the plaintiff.

514
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,659
When she found out that her niece
is actually her husband's daughter,

515
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,787
she was furious and devastated.

516
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,456
The defendant has shown
great remorse regarding that matter.

517
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,376
He has promised to dedicate
the rest of his life to her

518
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,419
and has been asking for her forgiveness.

519
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,257
But the plaintiff also held back
a very important piece of information.

520
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,135
Had she truly considered him her partner

521
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,763
who she loves and trusts,
she should have--

522
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,014
You mean her schizophrenia?

523
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,391
You're right.

524
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,893
It can't be cured, but it can be treated.

525
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,522
Her condition had been improving
until she met the defendant.

526
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,357
I submitted her doctor's note…

527
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,442
-Didn't you see it too?
-Look here.

528
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,986
I'm looking.

529
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,571
Please focus on the mediation.

530
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,448
My apologies.

531
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,786
Being a schizophrenic's guardian
requires a great deal of sacrifice.

532
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,205
Perhaps that's why her parents
gladly accepted him

533
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,792
despite his poor educational,
family, and financial background.

534
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,504
Do you feel inferior?

535
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,966
It's strange that he'd say
they "accepted" him.

536
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,969
And the "poor background" part
is strange too.

537
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,347
He's doing his best to be humble
in conveying his sincere feelings.

538
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,390
You're impatient.

539
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,641
I apologize.

540
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,647
He found out about her mental illness
after getting married,

541
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,691
but he cared for her with love.

542
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,736
Please do not disregard
his commendable decision

543
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,863
to become her life partner.

544
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,573
"Commendable"?

545
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,117
That's a total lie.

546
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,745
It's very important

547
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,873
to note when the defendant
found out about her illness.

548
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,082
Do you agree?

549
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,418
-Totally.
-I'm totally grateful.

550
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,671
Mr. Park.

551
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,342
Are you familiar with Heart Waves?

552
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,765
I haven't seen him in a while.

553
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,309
I wonder how his sister is doing.

554
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,977
His sister?

555
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,521
She suffers from schizophrenia.

556
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,816
Right.

557
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,359
I think I've heard.

558
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,737
Hyeon-tae is so considerate.

559
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,656
He took great care of his sister

560
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,284
to share his parents' burden.

561
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,912
He's such a great brother.

562
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,503
When did he join your group?

563
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,090
Let me think…

564
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,343
Three years ago in January.

565
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,178
Right before the Lunar New Year.

566
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,016
I remember being impressed
by how caring that young man was.

567
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,103
Why do you ask?

568
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,312
Heart Waves.

569
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,941
It's a support group
for family members of schizophrenics.

570
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,734
It's very active online and offline.

571
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:17,031
The defendant joined the group
on February 13, 2019.

572
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,368
Then he became a member
of the plaintiff's church

573
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,495
on March 8, 2019.

574
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,580
What could this mean?

575
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,543
It's an unreasonable assumption to say
that he intentionally approached her.

576
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,044
Okay. Let me ask you again.

577
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,380
Why did you join the group?

578
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,091
According to my research,

579
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,051
your sister is schizophrenic.

580
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:42,723
And that sister happened to be
the same age as your wife,

581
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,392
and they both majored in piano.

582
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,437
Except you don't have such a sister.

583
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,481
You only have a brother who makes

584
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,942
unreasonable demands
in return for raising your kid.

585
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,653
So who was this sister of yours?

586
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,533
I did it because I loved her.

587
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,410
Because I loved her.

588
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,079
I had to prove to her parents

589
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,290
that I could take
good care of their daughter

590
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,167
for them to accept me.

591
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,502
Don't you agree?

592
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,588
Let's face it.

593
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,049
You accepted me
because I put up with her nonsense.

594
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,135
Isn't that right?

595
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,680
You did it because you loved her?

596
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,224
Do you still love her?

597
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,268
How many times do I have to tell you?

598
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,936
She's all that I have!

599
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
Sure.

600
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:34,108
You came running when she was
fighting for her life after she overdosed.

601
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,861
Right.

602
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,071
You saw me there.

603
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
I did. I absolutely did.

604
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,283
And…

605
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,577
I also saw this.

606
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,224
You call this love?

607
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,568
Damn it.

608
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,197
It was a win-win.

609
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,325
You never would have paid attention

610
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,161
to a penniless, uneducated guy like me.

611
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,329
Aren't I right?

612
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,413
Defendant.

613
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,961
Why did you hide her condition?

614
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,630
You and your wife deceived me first!

615
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,217
How could you do that as church elders?

616
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,553
I said…

617
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,640
I would have taken care of
your crazy daughter forever!

618
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,309
-Defendant.
-Watch your mouth. What are you, a thug?

619
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,352
Plaintiff's counselor.

620
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,812
What did you just say?

621
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,314
Are you lecturing me
just because you're educated?

622
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,732
-Hey.
-What?

623
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,609
Are you such a mess
because you're uneducated?

624
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,778
Hey, are you even an attorney?

625
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,571
Why else would I be here, you idiot?

626
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,407
What did you say, you scumbag?

627
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,076
You hit me first, you bastard.

628
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,452
This is self-defense.

629
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,998
You asked for it, you scumbag.

630
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,499
Let me go!

631
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,583
Mr. Park!

632
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,460
-Cut it out!
-Hey!

633
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,922
-That's enough!
-I'm over 180cm tall, you prick!

634
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,716
-Break it up!
-Gosh!

635
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,385
-Here's some jiu-jitsu for you.
-You idiots!

636
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,886
Break it up!

637
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,097
That's about…

638
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,477
Hey, Attorney Choi.

639
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
Good work.

640
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,315
Mediating isn't easy, is it?

641
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,610
Attorney Shin always gets cold sweats
when he attends one.

642
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,739
Would you like a cold vitamin drink?

643
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,115
It's okay.

644
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,784
I don't feel like drinking anything
after getting cursed at.

645
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,330
But don't worry.

646
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,624
It went well and they agreed to a divorce.

647
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,420
That scumbag of a defendant
even demanded alimony.

648
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,089
I made sure he didn't get any, but…

649
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,049
But?

650
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,553
It was an awesome first mediation, but…

651
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,471
But what?

652
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,932
But it got a bit rowdy.

653
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,854
Where is he?

654
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,486
You really caused a scene
at the Seoul Family Court.

655
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,405
Did you do something?

656
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,240
It wasn't that serious.

657
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,701
I just lectured him a little

658
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,079
on the difference
between humans and animals.

659
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,290
-Listen carefully.
-Yes, sir.

660
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,710
If you act out like that,

661
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,840
word will spread about how I hired
someone exactly like me.

662
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,258
That word's already out.

663
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,968
Look.

664
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,303
Here's the thing about us.

665
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,848
Me. You. Us.

666
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,020
Every breath we take

667
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,481
and every single move we make

668
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,442
could attract attention.

669
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,738
Do you get that?

670
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,367
I strangely do.

671
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,703
Good-looking people like us

672
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,957
should always be extremely mindful

673
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,584
of every little thing we do.

674
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,920
And we always need to be humble, okay?

675
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,215
I wasn't thinking, Attorney Shin.

676
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,635
I know we have a strong sense of justice--

677
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,886
I want to go home.

678
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,682
-Was that too much?
-Yes.

679
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,350
-What?
-I'm sorry.

680
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,438
I thought I could compliment him
into being a better person.

681
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,189
-What?
-Can I leave early?

682
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,274
Are you sick?

683
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,401
I need to take out the recycling.

684
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,945
They do pile up quickly
if you miss the day.

685
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,613
Today must be your recycling day.

686
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,159
We're talking about recyclables
all of a sudden?

687
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,079
Get back to your boy band.
Stick to that great routine of yours.

688
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,164
Okay.

689
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,167
See you tomorrow.

690
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,418
-Thank you.
-No problem.

691
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,964
I won my first case.

692
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,924
Can we celebrate?

693
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,551
I…

694
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,346
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

695
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,806
-Goodbye.
-Happy recycling.

696
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,932
Thanks.

697
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,857
How lonely.

698
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,761
That's her, right?

699
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,138
I thought she moved away.

700
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,723
Rumor has it

701
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,518
-that her husband moved out.
-Seriously?

702
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,312
Unbelievable.

703
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,111
Let's go.

704
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,028
Let's go eat.

705
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,456
I…

706
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,961
Jang Guk-yeong.

707
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,171
Hear me out.

708
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,798
I worked in marketing for 15 years.

709
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,134
I dedicated my youth to it.

710
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,637
I can't ever go back there.

711
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,180
No. I won't.

712
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,309
You know it's my dream
to open up a macaron shop, right?

713
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,894
I'm almost there, you know?

714
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,314
But you see…

715
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,108
Hold on.

716
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,695
Jang Guk-yeong.

717
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,491
This is the macaron shop

718
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,202
and this is the noodle shop.

719
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,288
Point to the one you prefer.

720
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,750
Jang Guk-yeong, which one will you pick?

721
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,920
Which one?

722
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,297
Which one is it?

723
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,632
Welcome.

724
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,468
Long time no see.

725
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,469
Hello.

726
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,055
-Do you want some ramyeon?
-Yes, please.

727
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,392
Do you want eggs in it?

728
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,060
Sure.

729
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,610
I did some research,

730
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,821
and I heard you sell wine by the glass.

731
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,365
Yes, but it's not on the menu.
I serve leftovers.

732
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,701
-One minute.
-Okay.

733
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,037
I'm all out.

734
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,458
-What about soju?
-That's my mom's menu.

735
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,345
Do you like macarons?

736
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,055
Yes, I love them.

737
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,351
Do you know Mr. Jang's number?

738
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,269
Yes.

739
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,937
What?

740
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,987
Can you write it down here?

741
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,406
But…

742
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,994
Do you want a lot of green onions?

743
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,912
Yes, please.

744
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,917
I can't buy soju elsewhere
and bring it here, right?

745
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,085
No.

746
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,589
I see.

747
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,656
Stupid spam.

748
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,284
This one's persistent.

749
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,717
This is Kim So-yeon from the noodle shop.

750
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
Can we talk?

751
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,655
You must feel like you came back to work.

752
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,824
I could have come to you.

753
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,413
I'll feel like I'm clocking out again,
so it balances out.

754
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,924
I couldn't get any sleep last night.

755
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,012
I wanted to hear your answer
to a certain question.

756
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,348
I see.

757
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,600
What is it?

758
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,065
Should I start selling macarons

759
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,608
or keep selling ramyeon?

760
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,954
You should pursue your dream, so…

761
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,080
So macarons?

762
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,500
It's not a bad idea. Sure.

763
00:47:59,084 --> 00:47:59,918
Do you like macarons?

764
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,130
I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

765
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,132
But I'd buy them as gifts.

766
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,467
But you do like ramyeon, right?

767
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,178
Totally.

768
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,222
I love it.

769
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,516
I love it.

770
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,059
Totally.

771
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,438
I love it.

772
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,741
I see.

773
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,203
Okay.

774
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,665
Is that what you called to ask me?

775
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,335
Yes.

776
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,013
I have one more question.

777
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,975
It's about her.

778
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,518
Your ex-wife.

779
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,940
She's not

780
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,902
your last love.

781
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,739
Is she?

782
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,117
She's not the last woman
you'll ever love, is she?

783
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,175
That's such a tricky question.

784
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,219
It's nerve-racking.
It's a short-answer question.

785
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,512
"She was my first love."

786
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,097
-Come on, man!
-Come on!

787
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,140
-You idiot!
-You're insane!

788
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,225
Jeez!

789
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,935
-You idiot!
-What?

790
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,603
-Jeez!
-What?

791
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,897
I might lose a friend tonight.

792
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,192
Women hate men's first loves!

793
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,237
They don't even know
if they actually exist,

794
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,614
but they're always bothered by them!

795
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,410
Jealousy of first love is
a valid reason for divorce!

796
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,953
-No, it's not!
-I see.

797
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,079
Hey.

798
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:03,834
Why should I be criticized for my honesty?

799
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:10,173
I don't want to say another word
to an honest man like you tonight.

800
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:14,261
And I really want to beat the crap
out of you for being so dense tonight.

801
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,391
You're not drinking out of a wine glass.

802
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,893
You don't deserve this.

803
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,980
I'm so frustrated.

804
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,525
-I can't believe we're friends.
-You.

805
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,193
Drink out of this.

806
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,361
Here.

807
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,906
-It's not bad.
-Drink with both hands, you idiot.

808
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,618
-Damn it.
-You're so stupid.

809
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,499
Hey, Sung-han.
I see decanting actually works.

810
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,835
-I told you.
-This is nice.

811
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,088
We have some new jerky.

812
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,423
Don't drink on an empty stomach.

813
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,133
Hey, I bought that.

814
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,476
I'm so hot.

815
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,146
Guys.

816
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,441
I'm opening my third bottle.

817
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,620
Am I okay?

818
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,122
No problem.

819
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,540
I'm a man.

820
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,710
This is nothing for a man.

821
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:33,632
Right, that piano video?

822
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,259
Wasn't he just awesome?

823
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,762
To be honest,

824
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,225
I enjoyed playing the piano
more than studying law.

825
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,310
But hear me out.

826
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,814
Today, I had a divorce case.

827
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,941
And I got my first win.

828
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,076
Shin Sung-han…

829
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,832
He didn't even buy me a glass of soju.

830
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,501
-He's a terrible boss.
-Is that funny?

831
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,003
It's hilarious.

832
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,465
And the other colleagues…

833
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,635
What the…

834
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,053
Did he just fall asleep?

835
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,930
Seriously?

836
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,707
He's alive.

837
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,628
Why would you drink on a live stream
when you can't handle your alcohol?

838
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,882
Okay.

839
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,376
Ju-hwa's brother, was it?

840
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,212
He must be good at his job.

841
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,216
I don't know what to say, Father.

842
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,720
"One rotten apple spoils the barrel."

843
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,764
Do you know that saying?

844
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,390
Yes.

845
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,726
Father.

846
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,604
Before Shin Sung-han spoils the--

847
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,272
It could be you.

848
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,153
The rotten apple.

849
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,407
You might be the bad apple.

850
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,660
Do you understand?

851
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,210
Ms. Ma Geum-hui…

852
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,545
filed for a divorce.

853
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,130
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

854
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,423
Let me ask you again.

855
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,342
Are you the rotten apple?

856
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,260
Or is it Shin Sung-han?

857
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,894
The divorce won't happen,
but you did spoil the barrel.

858
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,857
Her attorney…

859
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,404
is Shin Sung-han.

860
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,912
I bought a shabby farmhouse
on the outskirts of Seoul.

861
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,542
Living abroad at my age feels very lonely.

862
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:01,506
I'm planning to settle down here,
but not like this.

863
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,135
Are you thinking about divorce?

864
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,346
Please help me.

865
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,019
Leave Keumhwa.

866
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,312
I'll be hiring a team of attorneys.

867
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,273
We would look ridiculous if you stayed.

868
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,317
I won't hire anyone

869
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,237
from Keumhwa.

870
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,948
You may go.

871
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,793
Ju-hwa's father seemed like a good man.

872
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,087
He seemed like a man of character.

873
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,506
Ju-hwa was a nice girl too.

874
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,801
Is her brother the same?

875
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,015
Father.

876
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,269
Are you bad-mouthing my parents?

877
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,275
This is what I thought
when I first saw you.

878
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,452
"She knows no shame."

879
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,958
Leave Keumhwa.

880
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,927
Thank you for the coffee.

881
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,887
That's tasty.

882
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,391
There really aren't
any two-year leases around here.

883
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,977
Most of these buildings are full of shops.

884
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,522
The residential buildings
are across the street.

885
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,232
It's nice and quiet there.

886
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,777
Should I give you a call
if there's a vacancy?

887
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,070
That would be great.

888
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,906
-I'm okay with large deposits too.
-Okay.

889
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,535
So…

890
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,579
do you see a lot of stories
on your radio shows?

891
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,373
-I do.
-Right.

892
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,336
How's this story? I heard it somewhere.

893
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:06,297
A guy went to this gathering,

894
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:12,137
and he became interested in a lady.

895
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,272
-Hello.
-Hello.

896
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,610
-Would you like a drink?
-Okay.

897
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,496
And then she disappeared without a trace.

898
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,747
BE THERE OR BE SQUARE

899
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,249
Why do you think that is?

900
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:46,087
Maybe she was put off
by his "be there or be square" reply.

901
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,590
He came on too strong.

902
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,093
I mean, they're both single and young.

903
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,762
And they met at a gathering.

904
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,183
Is it really so wrong
to express their feelings?

905
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,727
You were being too straightforward.

906
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,896
No, I'm telling you.
Until the second gathering…

907
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,026
-This isn't about me.
-You're such a liar.

908
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,277
It's obvious.

909
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,989
Anyway, it's all about storytelling.

910
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,033
From my experience,

911
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,202
couples with stories stay together longer.

912
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,786
"Storytelling"?

913
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,830
Join clubs that have clear purposes.

914
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,082
-Purposes?
-For example,

915
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,293
a sports or reading club.

916
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,211
Reading?

917
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,046
Or a poetry club. Poems are shorter.

918
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,340
Poetry? That's good.

919
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,300
I write insane poems.

920
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,135
-I see.
-Seriously.

921
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,887
Excuse me.

922
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,014
Poetry sounds nice.

923
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,599
Hey, Seo-jin. I'm downstairs.

924
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,267
Yes.

925
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,228
Okay.

926
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,774
They're having a team dinner.

927
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,443
They invited me
to thank me for helping out.

928
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,737
-The Haenam case?
-Correct.

929
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,531
But I already have plans tonight.

930
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,533
Jeez.

931
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,701
I'll have to cancel.

932
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,591
Why are you here, Mr. Realtor?

933
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,261
Are you serious?

934
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:21,266
You know nothing
about storytelling, do you?

935
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:25,311
No wonder I was getting nowhere
asking that dimwit for advice.

936
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,855
I should have asked you to begin with,
Ms. Lee and Ms. Bang.

937
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,900
You would have made
all my problems go away.

938
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:35,280
Is this about the woman
who left that club because of you?

939
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,739
Shut up.

940
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,325
And remember that driving
to Haenam and back in a single day

941
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,868
is a true display of friendship.

942
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,329
I fed you beef after that.

943
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,040
You never actually fed me.

944
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,208
Jeez. Here.

945
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,086
Give it to me. Open up.

946
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,548
-Happy?
-That's salty!

947
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,341
The lettuce is salty!

948
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,386
I don't think Mr. Jang washed his hands
after using the bathroom.

949
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,762
I wiped them.

950
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,306
On that lettuce.

951
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,640
I didn't wash mine.

952
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,100
That's disgusting.

953
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,020
That round-trip does seem
like a display of friendship, right?

954
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,063
How many hours was that?

955
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,190
You got hemorrhoids that day, right?

956
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,984
You have hemorrhoids?

957
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,403
That's so gross.

958
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:19,032
That was supposed to be a secret.

959
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,366
He means I got a hammer.

960
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,701
They were like 15cm.

961
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,663
Isn't that a hernia at that point?

962
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,998
I got a deal on a hammer.

963
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,753
You're awfully quiet today, Attorney Choi.

964
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,256
I'm trying not to drink
for the time being.

965
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,051
Something's up.
You did something, didn't you?

966
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,969
Yes, on camera.

967
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,138
But I saved him
before he really screwed up.

968
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,433
I fell asleep while drinking on my stream.

969
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,895
-Ms. Bang came to my rescue.
-What?

970
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,774
If she went there,
it means she knew where you were.

971
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:56,319
Were you drinking at the office?

972
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,365
On the day I won my case, no one…

973
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,868
I was so upset,
so I ended up drinking too much.

974
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,245
-And then--
-Did you talk about me?

975
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,622
What did you say again?

976
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,791
"It was my first win, but Shin Sung-han,

977
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,211
-that terrible boss…"
-The meat's ready, sir.

978
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,546
-Please enjoy.
-Attorney Choi.

979
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,674
Let me know
next time you drink on your channel.

980
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,051
I'll join you as a beautiful guest.

981
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,137
Count me in too. I can do it well.

982
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,348
I was born to be on camera.

983
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,767
"Please subscribe and leave a comment…"

984
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,018
Speaking of which,

985
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,771
your channel has its charms.

986
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,314
Right?

987
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:37,860
Seo-jin, why don't we try
streaming online?

988
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,905
Don't panic.

989
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,491
It's just like hosting a radio show

990
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,702
but without the regulations.

991
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,120
That sounds amazing.

992
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,247
If Attorney Shin gives you crap,

993
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,374
you can use my office.

994
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,583
No, thanks.

995
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,960
What about the noodle shop?

996
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,045
You sly little…

997
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,381
It'll be much more interesting
than your office.

998
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,216
You just want to be on the stream.

999
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,968
And get that lettuce out of your teeth.

1000
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,386
Where?

1001
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,388
Where is it?

1002
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,306
Even your jacket looks like lettuce.

1003
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,601
Let me know if you need any advice.
I'm an expert.

1004
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,187
-Be quiet.
-Please eat up.

1005
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,731
-You should take callers.
-"I have hemorrhoids."

1006
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,482
Can I talk about your
hemorrhoids on my stream?

1007
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,900
It's a hammer!

1008
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,610
What a mess of a show!

1009
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,571
"Excuse me, but that's a hernia."

1010
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,116
I shouldn't drink anymore.

1011
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,410
Right. I had so much fun.

1012
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,995
Me too.

1013
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,121
Seo-jin!

1014
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,375
-I'm a big fan of yours.
-What are you doing?

1015
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,961
I'm just so happy to see her.

1016
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,423
I used to listen to your radio show
every single day.

1017
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,509
You looked great in that video too.

1018
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,971
-You're even sexier in person.
-Sir.

1019
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,556
Let's shake hands.

1020
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,517
Sir, you seem pretty drunk.

1021
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:52,977
You should go.

1022
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,229
And who are you?

1023
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,607
You see,

1024
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,609
I'm her fan.

1025
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,610
Really?

1026
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,111
Then once you sober up,

1027
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,572
ask yourself if you're truly her fan.

1028
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,407
Look at yourself.

1029
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,325
You little…

1030
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,665
How could you dismiss a fan's…

1031
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,958
Okay. I'll leave.

1032
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,418
You want me to leave?

1033
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,003
I'm leaving.

1034
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,589
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

1035
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,673
Let's go, Seo-jin.

1036
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,551
Let me take you home, okay?

1037
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,727
Are you okay?

1038
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,315
Yes.

1039
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,610
I'll walk you home. Let's go.

1040
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,404
I'll come with you guys.

1041
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,866
You two can go home.

1042
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,245
I want to walk alone.

1043
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,124
Ms. Lee.

1044
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,884
I'd like you…

1045
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,304
to stay strong.

1046
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,313
I know it's tough right now.

1047
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,649
I understand. It must be unbearable.

1048
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,151
But you see,

1049
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,737
we managed…

1050
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,449
to keep Hyeon-u.

1051
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,244
We even…

1052
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,956
pulled that off.

1053
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,420
So stay strong.

1054
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,867
Hi.

1055
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,077
Hi, Hyeon-u.

1056
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,165
-Did you have a fun team dinner?
-Yes.

1057
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,710
I had a great time
thanks to you and Ms. Kim.

1058
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,712
Thank you so much.

1059
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:27,006
He's so independent.

1060
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,341
I didn't do much.

1061
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,093
But do call me again if you need help.

1062
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,637
I'll do it as your fan.

1063
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,432
-I'll go brush my teeth.
-Okay.

1064
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,103
I'll be going now. Get some rest.

1065
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,897
Thank you so much.

1066
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,440
-No problem.
-I'll call you a taxi.

1067
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,484
Don't be absurd. I'm a grown woman.

1068
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,653
I can go home on my own.

1069
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,156
Get home safely.

1070
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,117
Bye. See you tomorrow.

1071
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,284
You need to try them on
to know if they're comfortable.

1072
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,828
You were right.

1073
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,664
So what do you think?
Are they comfortable?

1074
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,167
Yes. They're perfect.

1075
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:29,754
Let's buy some clothes too.

1076
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,507
Will you be okay?

1077
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,477
Will you be okay?

1078
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,270
Yes.

1079
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,648
To be honest,

1080
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,318
I'm so happy to be out with you.

1081
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,281
I'm happy to be out…

1082
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,325
with you.

1083
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,502
To be honest…

1084
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,632
I'm still not okay.

1085
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,511
But…

1086
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,846
I'm going to try.

1087
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,103
I'm sorry

1088
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,397
every single day.

1089
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,759
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

1090
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,579
Are you okay?

1091
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,664
Aren't you scared to go in alone?

1092
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,876
A strategy to take on six attorneys…

1093
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,170
Let's do this.

1094
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,798
I'll stop hiding and keep my chin up.

1095
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,426
Do I deserve that?

1096
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,469
It's just too easy.

1097
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,764
You're a perfect fit.

1098
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,475
What's in it for me, Father?

1099
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,937
-Gi-yeong.
-Attorney Shin Sung-han.

1100
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:58,027
