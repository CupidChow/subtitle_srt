1
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,888
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,642
Attorney Shin, did you know that
you're the talk of the town?

3
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,188
I've been getting a lot of requests
to appear on TV recently.

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,482
This is all very new to me.

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,778
Your video got more than
a million views in no time.

6
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,780
It also went viral on social media.

7
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,533
This is a personal question,

8
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,161
but are you married by any chance?

9
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,914
No, I'm not.

10
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,376
I bet that caught
our listeners' attention.

11
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,214
I'll ask him this on everyone's behalf,
dear viewers.

12
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,800
Here's another personal question.

13
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,761
Do you have a girlfriend?

14
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,887
No.

15
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,348
Say no!

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,811
The cases I take on
are as precious as a girlfriend.

17
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,853
-I see.
-Oh, my.

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,148
-That's a very professional answer.
-Good. That was clever.

19
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,151
I'm sure you're very popular.

20
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,614
The piece you played on the street
was "Erlkönig" by Schubert.

21
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,534
It's a very dynamic piece.

22
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,869
Is it one of your favorites?

23
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,455
Yes, not only is "Erlkönig"

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,083
a great piece to play on the piano,

25
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,253
but it's actually quite famous as a song.

26
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,381
I did my homework
before I came to meet you today.

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,008
The lyrics are
from a poem written by Goethe,

28
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,302
the German writer and philosopher.

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,720
-You're right.
-Yes.

30
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,475
The poem itself is actually quite tragic.

31
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,019
So tell us, Attorney Shin.

32
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,815
What caused you
to make a shift in your career path?

33
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,151
You used to be a pianist.

34
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,194
And if you taught students in Germany…

35
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,489
Why won't he talk about
who took the video?

36
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,201
Man, this show is getting boring.

37
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,911
LIVE

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,455
Well, there was no specific reason.

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,709
I was curious about the law.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,505
Curiosity is one thing,
but this is on a whole different level.

41
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,009
-You're so annoying, Shin Sung-han.
-How did you study for the bar exam?

42
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,385
Did you study textbooks?

43
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,178
"Textbooks"?

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,179
EVERY ISSUE

45
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,432
-I studied law books.
-I see.

46
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,601
I wish you would die too.

47
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,853
Now, let's move on

48
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,313
to your current occupation.

49
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,483
I'm sure some cases
are tougher than others.

50
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,569
Which one was the toughest?

51
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,823
Every case is difficult.

52
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,828
I'm always on edge,
worrying if I left anything out.

53
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,749
My current case
isn't a piece of cake either.

54
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,000
What is it about?

55
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,628
It's a divorce suit.

56
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,633
But it's suddenly turned into
a sensitive social issue.

57
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,801
A social issue?

58
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,638
Would you mind telling us a bit about it?

59
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,517
My client's Vietnamese wife
filed for divorce.

60
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,020
My client, however,

61
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,232
cannot wrap his head around why.

62
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,860
Since it's a sensitive issue,
I'd rather not talk about it here.

63
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,778
I see.

64
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,820
I WAS A FAN FOR A MOMENT… BYE.

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,448
I think I know
which case you're referring to.

66
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,200
IS HE FRIENDS WITH THE ABUSIVE HUSBAND?

67
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,493
Anyway…

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
I see.

69
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,206
It must be a lot of pressure.

70
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,207
It is.

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,127
Just like every other case I take on.

72
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,295
-I see.
-Yes.

73
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,964
So…

74
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:20,885
what's your resolution
in approaching this case?

75
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,095
Resolution?

76
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,889
I intend to do my best

77
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,601
-as an attorney--
-This prick.

78
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,735
Doesn't Attorney Shin have
such a great voice?

79
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,654
He's perfect for radio.

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,158
I mean, most people tense up
when they're on air for the first time.

81
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,076
Right.

82
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,663
Attorney Shin sure is
a bit of an entertainer.

83
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,416
To be frank,

84
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,585
it's me that should be
getting all the credit.

85
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,380
If it weren't for me,
who would ask him to be on their show?

86
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,092
It's just a beautiful story.

87
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,271
Do you remember Jae-sik
from middle school?

88
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,731
-Yes.
-He's a reporter.

89
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,525
-Let's talk to him.
-Articles would get swept under the rug.

90
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,027
Keumhwa's story is everywhere.

91
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,655
It'll be covered up
the moment it's published.

92
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,408
I have a question.

93
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,577
Why did you call me here?

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,079
You're on leave.
Might as well put your talent to use.

95
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
Right, okay.

96
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,000
How about this?

97
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,044
Why don't we post on an online community?

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,296
They've even caught
suspects for some cases.

99
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,505
No.

100
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,341
Mr. Ma doesn't need any more attention.

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,720
Speaking of which,

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,140
and this is just an idea
I'd like to throw out there.

103
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,641
I'm just throwing it out there.

104
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,688
This case has already
become a huge social issue.

105
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,691
The public opinion
is in support of Dinh Thi Hoa,

106
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,652
and Mr. Ma has been
dragged onto the stage as well.

107
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,946
But Dinh Thi Hoa is hogging the spotlight.

108
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,866
We should be getting
some of the spotlight too.

109
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,326
We need to be provocative.

110
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,620
Right? So here it goes.

111
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,622
-It's just an idea.
-Yes.

112
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,207
Hear me out.

113
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,667
Shin Sung-han.

114
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,753
Attorney Shin Sung-han.

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,338
A sort of…

116
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,258
The hottest guy in the field of law.

117
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,137
A sexy guy who's perfect in every way.

118
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,055
A total stud.

119
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,556
Who's also…

120
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,102
as pretty as an idol.

121
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,648
The hidden gem of Seocho-dong…
I mean, of the whole district.

122
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,234
-A treasure?
-You do know you aren't that hot, right?

123
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,945
-No, I mean--
-How about the radio?

124
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,947
Are there any shows he could go on?

125
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,533
So this is why you told me to come.

126
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,243
You wanted a gig.

127
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,995
We need the public's attention
to turn the tables.

128
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,206
Even if we go with that ridiculous

129
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,583
Seocho-dong idol story…

130
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,296
Anyway, even if we go with that,

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,589
who's going to buy that?

132
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,007
"Ridiculous"?

133
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,809
Don't.

134
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,604
This meeting is too intense.

135
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,690
Let's play some music.

136
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,650
"Erlkönig" by Schubert.

137
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,193
It's perfect.

138
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,319
What's that?

139
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,031
I think we might have a beautiful story.

140
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,409
That story ends with you getting fired.

141
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,618
Attorney Choi!

142
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
You're a genius!

143
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,873
I'll kill you.

144
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,459
Please.

145
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,760
Is this real?

146
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,845
It's not a deepfake?

147
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,929
No.

148
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,347
It's really me.

149
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,934
This should draw attention, right?

150
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,645
He's so cool.

151
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,445
Who cares if he's a lawyer?

152
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,239
These people will do anything for money.

153
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,076
We need to come together
and bring this lawyer down.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,079
-Okay? Donate to my account.
-That jerk's lawyer is a jerk too!

155
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,874
Everyone is an attorney
before they get into politics.

156
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,752
Why are all the protagonists attorneys
in dramas these days?

157
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,129
HE SOLD OUT.
ANOTHER ATTENTION-SEEKING LAWYER.

158
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:57,328
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

159
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,547
You like the piano?

160
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,299
Yes.

161
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,302
I thought it was strange.

162
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,013
I wondered why he went to Shin Sung-han.

163
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,016
So you had that in common?

164
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,646
Did you also switch majors like he did?

165
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,482
No, I was never that good.

166
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,609
I just have a crush.

167
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,236
On Shin Sung-han?

168
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,280
On the piano!

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,033
I told you he was a funny guy.

170
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,620
This is his style.
He has an unusual approach.

171
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,415
What is Sung-han up to these days?

172
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,041
He's preparing for his defense

173
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,544
and hanging out with his friends.

174
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,381
Is he preparing anything
for the Ma Chun-seok case?

175
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,716
What do you mean?

176
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,634
Are you asking

177
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,012
whether he has an ace up his sleeve?

178
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,563
What's in it for me?

179
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,446
I thought you were pulling my leg
because I quit right after my internship.

180
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,490
But if it's going to be
this serious and consistent,

181
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,451
we should make a deal.

182
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,332
You sounded just like Sung-han.
You've learned a lot from him.

183
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,418
No, I didn't learn anything.
I do my own thing.

184
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,712
I told him from the get-go

185
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,381
-that I'd been spying on him.
-What did he say?

186
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,217
He told me to be a good spy

187
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,053
and to treat him when I get paid.

188
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,766
If you seriously want me to spy for you,

189
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,060
I'd like something else in return.

190
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,230
You really are one of a kind.

191
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,942
I'm not some cotton swab
you can tailor to your liking.

192
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,943
Choi Jun.

193
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,321
Attorney Choi.

194
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,868
What can I offer

195
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,953
to stir up your interest?

196
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,962
Are you serious?

197
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,423
-Park Yu-seok's position?
-Yes.

198
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,175
I even impressed myself.

199
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,303
I saw this vigor inside me.

200
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,516
Are you touched?

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,102
This is who I am, okay?

202
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,520
So loyal.

203
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,896
What are you talking about?

204
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,275
I sensed a deep melancholy
from your street performance.

205
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,653
How can I put this?

206
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,780
Some sort of deep, dark anger.

207
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,699
Some deep-rooted sorrow…

208
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,955
Excuse me.

209
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,457
Schumann…

210
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,792
Schubert.

211
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,960
Right.

212
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,879
-"Iconic."
-"Erlkönig."

213
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,006
That one.

214
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,802
I showed the video to my mom,
and it blew her mind.

215
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,806
Aren't you going to finish that?

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,351
She'll be here soon.

217
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,602
-Really?
-When?

218
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,479
Does she want to see me?

219
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,481
"I won't live much longer."

220
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,317
"I've got to see Attorney Shin
perform in person."

221
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,114
So what did Park Yu-seok say?

222
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,699
Nothing.

223
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,075
How did he look?

224
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:28,164
Like a cotton swab
with half the cotton missing.

225
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,382
Hey, look over there.

226
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,885
-What?
-Look at that.

227
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,386
It looks just like you.

228
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,846
That half-opened ramyeon bag.

229
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,561
Stop laughing.

230
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,314
Cut it out.

231
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,669
I'm in the parking garage.

232
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,254
I'll be right up.

233
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,976
Lee Seo-jin's Run on the Radio.

234
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,353
This is our last story of the day.

235
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,106
It was sent in
by Kim Su-ji from Namyangju.

236
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,316
"Hello."

237
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,403
"I went on a trip
to Jeju Island last month,

238
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,573
and I ran into the man
of my dreams there."

239
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,703
"I knew I would regret it
if I didn't do anything,

240
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,455
so I worked up the courage
to ask for his number."

241
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,457
Good for you.

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,420
"I got back home
and was about to contact him,

243
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,965
but I stopped,
wondering if I'm rushing it."

244
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,385
"What do you think I should do, Seo-jin?"

245
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,485
STATION DIRECTOR JANG JON-HO

246
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,950
You and Producer Bang
desperately begged me

247
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,619
to get him on a show,

248
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,247
but you never thanked me

249
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,457
or even got back to me.

250
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,960
-Where are your manners?
-Look.

251
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,088
I wanted to send you a gift,
but you wouldn't give me your address.

252
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,090
What was I to do?

253
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,593
I don't need any gifts.

254
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,471
I just wanted to see you.

255
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,433
You should have looked me up
on the internet.

256
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,061
There's a whole lot
of Lee Seo-jin on there.

257
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,772
You and your words.

258
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,610
Too bad you're wasting your talent.

259
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,029
Give me a show if you really think so.

260
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,326
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.

261
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,370
If you want to send me something,

262
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,829
I'll text you my address.

263
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,293
Anyway…

264
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,839
About the year-end reshuffle.

265
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,552
Why don't you come back
with a late-night show?

266
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,351
I guess a late-night show
would be a good fit.

267
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,938
And I can't wait to make a comeback.

268
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
But it won't be that easy.

269
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,359
Of course not.

270
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,945
You know how conservative this station is.

271
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,740
That's why you should start
with a late-night show.

272
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,283
Nine in the morning.

273
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,327
The same slot.

274
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,747
As long as the listeners accept me,

275
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,125
that's where I want to return to.

276
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,424
You seem surprised.

277
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,266
The morning show would be tough.

278
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,901
-Please have a seat.
-Sure.

279
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,237
-Thank you.
-No problem.

280
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
Where's Ms. Lee?

281
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,784
I wanted to see her, but she wasn't in.

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,286
What is she up to?

283
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,537
Beats me.

284
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,622
They have a ton of visitors these days.

285
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,499
Especially after the radio.

286
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,004
But they've only taken on
a couple of cases.

287
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,006
And yet, everyone seems busy.

288
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,758
It's weird.

289
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,968
They must get a lot of consultations.

290
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,803
Do they make visits too?

291
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,098
No way. They even send away
those who visit them here.

292
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,606
Do you have two-year leases too?

293
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,317
It's mostly monthly rent around here.

294
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,651
What's the average rent?

295
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,694
Rent…

296
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,114
Isn't it too far from your work?

297
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,451
I used to want to live close to work,

298
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,328
but not anymore.

299
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,629
You look excited.

300
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,508
Did your stocks go up?

301
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,635
This?

302
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,972
There's this small club I'm in,

303
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:24,019
and I'm interested in
one of the ladies there.

304
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,187
A lady?

305
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,607
Her username is Orange Sky.

306
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,817
Look at this.

307
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,987
She said,
"I'll be joining late. Sorry. Tears."

308
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,200
So I said,
"Be there or be square. Smiley face."

309
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,452
I want her to notice me.

310
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,870
This Saturday?

311
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,750
"This is Jo Jeong-sik."

312
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,836
Hey, you're here.

313
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,255
Seo-jin wasn't in.

314
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,923
I was asking him about rent.

315
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,925
Are you going to move here?

316
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,052
This part of the town is too expensive.

317
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,388
-I'll leave you two to talk.
-Sure.

318
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,350
You should probably delete
the "be square" part.

319
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,309
Why?

320
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,311
I've seen this before.

321
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,480
You seem a bit too…

322
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,941
Good luck anyway.

323
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,026
-Bye.
-Bye.

324
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,866
Hey, is "be there or be square" bad?

325
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,742
Everything you do is. I need your car.

326
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,327
Do you even know what it means?

327
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,830
-It means you're uptight.
-Dude.

328
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,208
It means you have to be there.
You need to learn these things.

329
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,168
-Good grief.
-Hey.

330
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,421
It looks pathetic
when you try too hard to sound young.

331
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,382
It would if I looked like you.

332
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,801
-Me, not so much.
-I need your car.

333
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,595
-What about yours?
-It's in the shop.

334
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,513
-What about Sung-han's?
-Just give it.

335
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,182
Where are you going?

336
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,183
Not too far.

337
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,186
So where exactly?

338
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,438
Jeolla-do. It's a quick drive. Nice roads.

339
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,190
-Are you going to Jeonju?
-No.

340
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,441
Even Gwangju is too far.

341
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,109
You're so stingy.

342
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,068
Forget it, man.

343
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,614
-Haenam isn't even that far.
-It's literally the farthest.

344
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,910
It's the Vietnamese wife case, isn't it?

345
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,289
I get that attorneys are
in the service industry,

346
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,790
but Haenam is just too far.

347
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,251
I'd even travel to the ends of the earth.

348
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,711
We have to win this one.

349
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,381
We're up against Park Yu-seok.

350
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,550
We have to step it up.

351
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,058
Don't get so serious.
Forget it. I'm renting a car.

352
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,101
Hey.

353
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,355
Should we leave now?

354
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,941
Why would I bring you?

355
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,116
I heard the station director
talked to you about your comeback.

356
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,829
I can't do a late-night show
with Hyeon-u alone at home.

357
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,666
He made that offer
knowing I couldn't accept it.

358
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,668
I'll look after Hyeon-u.

359
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,877
He loves me.

360
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,880
I guess we can ask him.

361
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,965
Hyeon-u, is that you?

362
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,884
Hyeon-u!

363
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,470
It's your favorite aunt, Aunt Ho-yeong!

364
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,348
That's it?

365
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,642
Hello.

366
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,519
Wow.

367
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,940
Hyeon-u, put your backpack down
and wash your hands.

368
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,490
-Here.
-Hello.

369
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,159
Hyeon-u.

370
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,413
What do you think
about Mom going back on the radio?

371
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,747
Can she go back?

372
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,165
If she does…

373
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,168
If she does comes back…

374
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,628
Mom does it better.

375
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,840
The 9 a.m. radio show.

376
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,509
She's the best at it.

377
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,887
Yes.

378
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,141
Okay, I'll call you back. Goodbye.

379
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,186
One for you.

380
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,939
-Eat up.
-Okay.

381
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,284
It must be tough to look after
your child with your injured arm.

382
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,455
People here help me out.

383
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,084
So they help you out.

384
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,961
Yes.

385
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,255
How's your son?

386
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,299
He's still very young.

387
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,592
He eats well

388
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,635
and sleeps well.

389
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,804
Good.

390
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,974
I just have some questions.

391
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,480
You were assaulted by Mr. Ma

392
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,191
on September 12, correct?

393
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,861
You asked him for a divorce,

394
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,822
and you told him
you'd take your child with you.

395
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,200
-Yes.
-What did you just say?

396
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,035
Divorce?

397
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,661
Divorce?

398
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,206
Don't be ridiculous!

399
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,373
Divorce?

400
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,210
What did I ever do wrong?

401
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,628
I'm going back to my mom's.

402
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm leaving with Yeong-gwang.

403
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,725
Chun-seok, you need to stop.

404
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,684
Chun-seok.

405
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,646
You need to stop.

406
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,108
So Mr. Ma became furious.

407
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,068
-Stop that!
-The old lady next door?

408
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,403
-The sweet potato lady.
-Yes, her.

409
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,990
She came and pulled you away.

410
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,033
Yes.

411
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,953
And then you left home, Ms. Dinh Thi Hoa.

412
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,079
Yes.

413
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,248
But without your son.

414
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,875
You left him behind, correct?

415
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,295
I couldn't bring him with me.

416
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,965
He's still a baby.

417
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,591
Right.

418
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,220
And the next day…

419
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
The next day.

420
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,477
Yes, September 13.

421
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,231
You went back and asked him once again.

422
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,733
Yes.

423
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,820
Hey, get back here!

424
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,657
Do you know how much I spent on you?

425
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,410
I want to live with my mom.

426
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,661
I'm leaving with my baby.

427
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,748
I've had enough
of your drinking and beatings.

428
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,459
Watch your damn mouth!

429
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,421
I've got to beat some sense into you.

430
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,382
Mr. Ma became furious
and picked up a stick…

431
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,469
and he hurt you right there.

432
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,479
She said she'd give up permanent residency
and leave for Vietnam with Yeong-gwang.

433
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,609
I still have no idea what I did wrong,

434
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,819
but I promised her I'd change.

435
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,948
I tried to talk her out of it,
but she wouldn't listen.

436
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,909
In the end, I lost it.

437
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,995
I kicked and broke everything.

438
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,622
I was a bit drunk.

439
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,668
When the old lady next door stepped in,

440
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,795
she left home.

441
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,720
It's considered emotional abuse
to throw and break objects.

442
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,139
I know what that is.

443
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,476
You'd rather be hit and be done with it.

444
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,065
It sucks to tremble with fear all day.

445
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,236
But that's what I was doing.

446
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,321
I swore…

447
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,700
that I'd never turn into my father.

448
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,495
Do you think I'm a pushover?

449
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,624
I'm asking you!
Do you think I'm a pushover?

450
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,210
You.

451
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,589
-You need a beating.
-Because of the memories of your father,

452
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,759
-you've never used violence.
-Don't hit her, Father!

453
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,429
Even if a dog bites into your leg,
you just let it be.

454
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,392
You just wait for it to grow tired.

455
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,061
Do you remember everything I told you?

456
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,607
There's something else that bothers me.

457
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,569
After you two had a fight in the yard,

458
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,865
your wife left home
but returned the next day.

459
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,659
And then

460
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:22,247
she started walking around
the yard and the house.

461
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,833
Thud.

462
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,752
Thud.

463
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,984
Are you her guardian?

464
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,785
Goodness.

465
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,787
Goodness, Yeong-gwang.

466
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,872
No.

467
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,582
Don't take him.

468
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,336
No.

469
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,049
No, Yeong-gwang!

470
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,635
Goodness, Chun-seok.

471
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,724
Goodness.

472
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,943
I just think it's weird.

473
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,740
She knew she'd get badly beaten

474
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,284
and asked the people
at the Women's Shelter to come.

475
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,454
And she wants to return
to Vietnam after the divorce,

476
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,123
giving up permanent residency.

477
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,709
Something doesn't seem right.

478
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,088
She got married
because she had too many younger siblings.

479
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,048
So why would she go back with her kid?

480
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,802
Right?

481
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,180
She'd be better off being here
and getting child support

482
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:06,017
and doing some part-time jobs
once the kid is older.

483
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,811
Exactly. Something doesn't add up.

484
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,024
Jeong-sik and I will do our best!

485
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,567
Jeong-sik?

486
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,111
Why Jeong-sik?

487
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,779
He's coming along.

488
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,781
He insisted on taking his car.

489
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,743
Did he…

490
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,704
open up the Box of Park Yu-seok?

491
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,581
It kind of ended up that way.

492
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,291
So he'll come to Haenam with you?

493
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,711
Man, when will he get over it?

494
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,380
Get over what?

495
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,216
Is he Park Yu-seok's other half?
Why is he getting involved?

496
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,803
This isn't easy for Jeong-sik.

497
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,555
Throw it.

498
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,688
Haenam is really far.

499
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,773
That's why I put a nice playlist together.

500
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,401
It's perfect for a road trip.

501
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,029
-Listen.
-No.

502
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,906
What do you mean?

503
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,451
I'm not doing it out of guilt.

504
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,250
Why else would a realtor
volunteer to drive all the way to Haenam?

505
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,717
All you did was help her find an attorney

506
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,552
on behalf of her selfish brother.

507
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,306
But that attorney
happened to be Park Yu-seok.

508
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,226
You better win.

509
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,938
Drive safely, idiot.

510
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,565
We're leaving early tomorrow.

511
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,983
Let's go home.

512
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,610
You're leaving tomorrow?

513
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes, I have Supper for Singles
the day after.

514
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,072
Suppressed singles?

515
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,700
No, it's a supper. For singles.

516
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,703
-What the heck is that?
-A singles' club.

517
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,330
Supper for Singles.

518
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,458
I have to be there.

519
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,543
She's joining late.

520
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
And I…

521
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,797
refuse to be square.

522
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,926
What a busy life you lead.

523
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,887
Supper for Singles, my foot.

524
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,890
I'd rather go to Supper for Shingles.

525
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,852
Darn it.

526
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,021
How about Supper for Shambles?

527
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,193
Why are the balls so fast here?

528
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,653
They have breaking balls.

529
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,781
They drop right in front of me.

530
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,449
I'm done with this.

531
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:00,483
I could live here
after fixing up a few things.

532
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,860
You're going to live here?

533
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,864
Are you surprised because it's shabby
or because I'm not returning to Hawaii?

534
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,294
Gardening isn't for me.

535
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,172
I am

536
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,884
thinking of living here with Gi-yeong.

537
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,469
Mother.

538
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,390
I was testing you.

539
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,060
I wondered if Gi-yeong meant

540
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,479
anything to you.

541
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,357
I'm relieved to know that you care.

542
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,318
I may not be a great son myself,

543
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,321
but I do care about my child.

544
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,198
Exactly. I'm quite relieved.

545
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,075
Isn't it obvious?

546
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,786
Then why did you try
to take away what's obvious?

547
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,876
Ju-hwa

548
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,630
obviously cared about Gi-yeong too.

549
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,344
You already lost her.

550
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,220
What if you lose more?

551
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,764
She had an accident.

552
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
-Gi-yeong--
-Why would you

553
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,185
take away what he loves the most?

554
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,939
What are you so afraid of
that you'd ban him from seeing his uncle?

555
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,985
Keeping my family strong is my priority.

556
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,154
Do you think our relationship is like this

557
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,073
because our family isn't strong?

558
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,995
What do you think life is?

559
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,333
I'm not sure.

560
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,002
It's full of choices.

561
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,422
Choices.

562
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,842
Make wise choices, and you break even.

563
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,135
If not…

564
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,147
Free up Gi-yeong's schedule
for the weekend.

565
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,942
I want to spend some time alone with him.

566
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,319
Come stay with us.

567
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,613
Gi-yeong misses you too.

568
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll stay at a hotel
during the renovation.

569
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,036
Send Gi-yeong over.

570
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,449
Asshole.

571
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,378
So? Should I take over?

572
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,173
Go back to sleep.

573
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,758
What? I just kept my eyes closed.

574
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,761
You slept for six hours straight.

575
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,220
You're lying.

576
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,222
I couldn't sleep at all
with the roof open.

577
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,266
-My back.
-The air is so crisp here.

578
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,436
How refreshing.

579
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,482
-My back feels weird.
-Why?

580
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,817
I'll drive. Give me the keys.

581
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,613
The police would pull you over
thinking you stole the car.

582
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,243
This is nice.

583
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,122
-How much longer do we have?
-Fifteen minutes.

584
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,249
We're in Haenam?

585
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,543
Are you even human?

586
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,922
Darn you, punk.

587
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,299
You're glowing from your nap.

588
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,183
GWANGJEODANG PHARMACY

589
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,355
What do you recommend for a lady

590
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,732
-in her mid-eighties?
-Mid-eighties?

591
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,983
Is it Ms. Gi-bok?

592
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,112
-Sorry?
-I know most people around here.

593
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,489
Which old lady is the supplement for?

594
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,783
Do you know Mr. Ma Chun-seok?

595
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,036
Any recommendations for his mother?

596
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,287
Is that so?

597
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,875
But even if she took supplements,

598
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,338
I don't think she's in any condition
to absorb any nutrients from them.

599
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,090
Yes, you're right.

600
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,426
So what's your take on this situation?

601
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,886
How much is it?

602
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,348
In my opinion,

603
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,309
everything began over there
at that pesticide shop.

604
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,274
When Chun-seok got into that huge fight
with the owner, Mr. Baek.

605
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,191
You know what I mean?

606
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:58,197
But how do you two know Chun-seok?

607
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,992
We're with Mr. Ma's attorney.

608
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,744
-From Gwangju?
-No, Seoul.

609
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,247
Oh, my. You came very far.

610
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,001
Chun-seok won't end up
behind bars or anything, right?

611
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,003
-Behind bars?
-Will he go to prison?

612
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,045
He assaulted her.

613
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,345
Ms. Jo first met her husband at church.

614
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,556
They grew closer after her husband

615
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,183
registered as a new member.

616
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,895
"To you, Yahweh, I lift up my soul."

617
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,940
"My God, I have trusted in you."

618
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,151
"Don’t let me be shamed."

619
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,822
"Don’t let my enemies triumph over me."

620
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,867
What do you do for a living?

621
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,456
I work as a plant manager in Osan.

622
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,417
I started as a part-timer

623
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,836
while I was taking time off from college,

624
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,088
but I ended up staying.

625
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,136
He mixed lies with facts
to sound trustworthy.

626
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,056
"Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them, saying,

627
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,474
'I am the light of the world.'

628
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,101
'He who follows me
will not walk in the darkness,

629
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,437
but will have the light of life.'"

630
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,147
"The Pharisees therefore said to him,

631
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,233
'You testify about yourself.'

632
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,859
'Your testimony is not valid.'"

633
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,612
"Jesus answered them,

634
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,614
'Even if I testify about myself,

635
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,324
my testimony is true,

636
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,452
for I know where I came from,
and where I am going…'"

637
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,167
I hear a signal from the balcony
every day at 2 p.m.

638
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,294
It sounds like Morse code.

639
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,755
He didn't seem bothered
by her schizophrenic symptoms

640
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,257
and heard her out.

641
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,344
Her mother was relieved to have him.

642
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,972
Her mother thought
his character was more important

643
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,099
than his education or career.

644
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,480
He works too far away.

645
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,983
That's true.

646
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,320
It'd be great if I could be with him.

647
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,283
I studied to be a barista.

648
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
What?

649
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,665
Look.

650
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,044
They opened a café for her,
and it was going well.

651
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,047
The problem was
that her husband would disappear,

652
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,882
leaving her alone in charge.

653
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,343
He didn't know she was schizophrenic,

654
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,679
so he must've thought
she could do this alone

655
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,972
and stayed out.

656
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,893
Schizophrenia can't be cured, right?

657
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,478
It can be treated.

658
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,274
When Ms. Jo met her husband,
she was improving,

659
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,986
so no one at her church knew
she had schizophrenia.

660
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,696
That girl said she'd kill me.

661
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,073
She bought a knife.

662
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,576
I threw it out, but she got it again.

663
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,537
But you know,

664
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,623
it's too small to kill a person with.

665
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,542
-"That girl"?
-The seven-year-old girl

666
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,211
who Park Hyeon-tae said was his niece

667
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,088
turned out to be his daughter.

668
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,468
Her condition quickly worsened
after she found out.

669
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,638
That's when her husband finally found out
she had schizophrenia.

670
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,183
But he said he'd look after her with love

671
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,810
and joined a schizophrenia
support group and whatnot.

672
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,980
"Look after her with love"?

673
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,815
He hides to watch shows on his phone.

674
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,484
Who is he trying to fool?

675
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,447
So you believe
that Mr. Park was already aware

676
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,950
that Ms. Jo was being
treated for schizophrenia?

677
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,788
I think that might be
why he was so receptive to her.

678
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,666
In that case,

679
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:44,340
why don't we go talk to the members
of the support group Mr. Park goes to?

680
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,717
We should go.

681
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,636
But he has already…

682
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,972
seen you two.

683
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,099
You could go yourself…

684
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,728
Let's discuss this when Mr. Jang returns.

685
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,356
I was supposed to go to Haenam with him.

686
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,650
I heard about this great tteokgalbi place.

687
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,277
After that video of yours
went viral again,

688
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,363
everyone's been asking for a new video.

689
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,326
So I was going to upload
a tteokgalbi mukbang video.

690
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,163
He'll probably be enjoying it with Mr. Jo.

691
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,128
There's this restaurant
where someone made a great mukbang video.

692
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,046
I thought I'd finally get to go.

693
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,715
Man, I'm jealous.

694
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,663
The sound of the engine is like a lullaby.

695
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,664
I slept like a baby.

696
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,542
You can go alone.

697
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,252
Of course, I'll do that.

698
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,046
-You're driving on our way back.
-Sure thing!

699
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,173
I'll be right back.

700
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,848
How is it sunny all day long?

701
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,684
Is this how it is in Haenam?

702
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,562
There's not a cloud in the sky.

703
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,190
HAENAM WELFARE CENTER

704
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,313
ATTORNEY PARK YU-SEOK

705
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,652
Down, seven.

706
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,782
Goodness.

707
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,327
So? Did your suit for damages end well?

708
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,037
You're amazing.

709
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,332
You saved my life.

710
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,043
Are you busy right now?

711
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,128
Not really.

712
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,966
I'd like to buy you a drink to celebrate.

713
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,051
-Goodness, really?
-Yes.

714
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,511
Thank you.

715
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,347
Thank you so much.

716
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,349
Attorney Park.

717
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,893
Do you handle divorce cases too?

718
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,813
I can start doing them from now on.

719
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,110
It's for a younger sister
of a good friend of mine.

720
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,530
You know Daenam Electronics, right?

721
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,991
Right, she's your friend's sister?

722
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,159
Yes, she can't find a lawyer.

723
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,996
Every single one got fired.

724
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,706
-Who got them fired?
-Daenam!

725
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,332
Daenam did.

726
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,005
I think Keumhwa Law Firm
actually belongs to Daenam Electronics.

727
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,050
No way. Corporations
can't invest in law firms.

728
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,096
Daenam.

729
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,522
I'll drive.

730
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,567
Let's pull over somewhere…

731
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,986
No, let's pull over
at the next rest area, okay?

732
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,699
Your discs will slip
if you drive both ways.

733
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,200
Piece of shit.

734
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,371
Why the hell was he here?

735
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,668
You better clarify
who you're talking about.

736
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,920
I'm in a crappy mood right now.

737
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:15,069
LEAVE FOR VIETNAM?
GIVE UP PERMANENT RESIDENCY?

738
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,573
Attorney Shin!

739
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,285
Attorney Shin!

740
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,206
What?

741
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,042
Do we have any beer in the office?

742
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,046
No beer!

743
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,471
I mean, what's the big deal
if he switched to another pesticide shop?

744
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,014
But it is.

745
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:49,436
His family's done business with that shop
since Mr. Ma's father's days.

746
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,648
They'd been doing business
for two generations

747
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,067
and he turned his back on them overnight.

748
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,611
It means they became enemies.

749
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,573
What's with him?

750
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,617
-Is he okay?
-Let him be.

751
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,702
He's been talking to himself all day.

752
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,999
Anyway, that pesticide shop owner
used to nag Mr. Ma

753
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,044
whenever they met.

754
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,337
Come on!

755
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,091
I only said that to him
because I was worried, okay?

756
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,386
Everyone in the neighborhood was
talking behind his back,

757
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,013
but nobody would tell him to his face.

758
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,223
Tell him what?

759
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,976
You know,

760
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,228
I was just worried.

761
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,522
I told him to keep an eye on her
just in case.

762
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,609
Chun-seok's wife is just a kid.

763
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,236
She's really young.

764
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,657
Chun-seok doubled his workload
to support her family in Vietnam.

765
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,328
But his wife stays out
using her Korean lessons as an excuse.

766
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,124
If she studied so hard,
she should speak better Korean by now.

767
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,083
Good grief.

768
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,003
She gets drunk
and takes a taxi home all the time.

769
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,671
I saw this with my own eyes.

770
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:58,714
You know,

771
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,717
I'm not sure if he was
Vietnamese or Filipino,

772
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,387
but she was drinking beer
with a man her age!

773
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,598
How could I not be angry?

774
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,975
I guess it is.

775
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,020
-For Mr. Ma.
-That's what I mean!

776
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,064
So I said a few things to him,

777
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,734
but he threw a huge fit at me,
when I'm like his brother!

778
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,195
Good grief, this is crazy.

779
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,197
She didn't get any better at Korean,

780
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,365
but she had the best attendance rate.

781
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,827
Why was Park Yu-seok there?

782
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,539
Are you still on about that?

783
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,044
Why would someone
in his position travel that far?

784
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,171
It does seem weird. Doesn't feel right.

785
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,797
What was he up to?

786
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,384
He looked like he was up to something.

787
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,011
That asshole.

788
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,723
So she had good attendance.

789
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,767
Park Yu-seok was there.

790
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,853
So what? I'm sure he came
because he was worried too.

791
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,938
Why would he be?

792
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,606
I told you many times already!

793
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,358
Dinh Thi Hoa is acting strangely.

794
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,861
It's unnatural for her
to return to Vietnam after the divorce.

795
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,782
Try to focus and listen carefully,
you stupid paralegal.

796
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,994
What the heck?

797
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
He drove both ways.

798
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,710
ATTORNEY ASSHOLE VISITS HAENAM?

799
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,296
WHAT DOES DINH THI HOA WANT?

800
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,549
SON
MA YEONG-GWANG

801
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,760
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

802
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,042
-Gi-yeong.
-Uncle Sung-han!

803
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:04,548
I have to get my hair done,
go to the sauna, and get a massage.

804
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,676
Can you stay with Gi-yeong?
I'll be back before dinner.

805
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,136
Feed him well.

806
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,972
You haven't left for Hawaii yet?

807
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,725
I'm not going back.
Things have become interesting lately.

808
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,269
I don't want to miss out on anything.

809
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,313
Gi-yeong, have fun.

810
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,480
Okay.

811
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,925
Put your phone away
during weekends, honey.

812
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,267
Where's Gi-yeong?

813
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,899
Dad, where's Gi-yeong?

814
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,779
He's meeting Grandma today.

815
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,864
Why can't I meet her?

816
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,957
Go.

817
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,876
Go!

818
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,803
You have to take that.

819
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,554
Take it!

820
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,349
If you don't take it,
it'll be too hard to win!

821
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,935
I heard Uncle Jeong-sik is good at this.

822
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,061
He's lying.

823
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,021
Why did you send them away?

824
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,732
Because they're dangerous people.

825
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,986
No!

826
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,117
It must be the uncles!

827
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,243
Really?

828
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,078
Darn it.

829
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,872
Who is it?

830
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,426
I've always wanted to meet you,

831
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,469
and here we are.

832
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,180
How may I help you?

833
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,808
I heard my son is here.

834
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,477
I asked Mr. Jung for the address.

835
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,772
Are you talking about Gi-yeong?

836
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,773
Yes.

837
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,276
He has a lesson in the evening.

838
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:32,988
Gi-yeong.

839
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,993
His grandmother is the one
who dropped him off.

840
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,203
I'll keep him here until she returns.

841
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,831
Mr. Shin.

842
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,753
On Gi-yeong's family registration,

843
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,257
there are only Jeong-guk, me,
and his sister, Ha-yul.

844
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,427
Your name is not on it.

845
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,554
That means the four of us,

846
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,057
Seo Jeong-guk, Jin Yeong-ju,
Seo Ha-yul, and Seo Gi-yeong,

847
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,560
are family.

848
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,898
Gi-yeong.

849
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,650
Gi-yeong.

850
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,367
Mother, it's me.

851
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,163
You must be busy,
so I came to pick up Gi-yeong.

852
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,958
Please take your time and enjoy your day.

853
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,002
Gi-yeong.

854
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,589
Let's break the record next time.

855
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,258
Let's go.

856
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,378
ATTORNEY ASSHOLE VISITS HAENAM?

857
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,130
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

858
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,590
Mr. Ma.

859
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,602
What are you doing here?

860
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,448
You used to be a piano teacher?

861
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:28,121
I looked you up on my phone
and saw you going wild on the street.

862
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,215
Are your fingers bruised yet?

863
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,141
You must like that song.

864
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,019
Yes.

865
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,064
I listened to it on my way here.

866
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,400
It was meant to be sung,

867
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,278
with this famous poem as the lyrics.

868
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,698
There's a dying boy in the poem.

869
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,577
His father tries to save him
from the Erlking,

870
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,246
an evil being who tries to take the boy.

871
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,916
It sounds more like a novel.

872
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,000
Right?

873
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,089
Many people think you are…

874
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,967
this Erlking.

875
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,178
Those who are on the fence think

876
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,306
you're the father
who's trying to save his son.

877
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,434
It sounds complicated, right?

878
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,778
To you,

879
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,949
am I the Erlking or the father?

880
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,957
I think you're the son.

881
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,087
The son who is dying

882
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,589
in his father's arms.

883
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,681
I want to ask you something.

884
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,143
And I really…

885
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,437
really have to know.

886
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,690
How do you think the trial will go?

887
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,400
How are you feeling now?

888
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,693
How do you feel?

889
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,278
-Please say something.
-Please give us a comment.

890
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,405
-Any comments?
-Tell us how you feel.

891
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,573
GWANGJU FAMILY COURT

892
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,243
How do you feel?

893
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,661
How do you think it'll go?

894
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,872
Tell us how you'll defend him.

895
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,625
-Did you really assault her?
-Say something!

896
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,711
Do you have anything to say?

897
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,254
Defendant's counselor.

898
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,589
You may question the plaintiff.

899
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,716
Plaintiff.

900
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,886
Is Yeong-gwang doing well?

901
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,680
Yes.

902
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,599
Yeong-gwang's family name is Ma.

903
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,685
His name is Ma Yeong-gwang.
Is that correct?

904
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,277
DEFENDANT

905
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,571
I will ask you just one question.

906
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,199
Just one.

907
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,496
I'll talk slowly, so listen up.

908
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,249
You may lie in court,

909
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,627
but you should never lie to me.

910
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,463
So be honest with me.

911
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,132
You can't keep anything from me.

912
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,636
Because you won't go down alone.
I'll go down with you.

913
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,181
So be honest.

914
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,892
This is a very important question
for reclaiming your honor.

915
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,812
So please

916
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,523
be honest

917
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,317
with me.

918
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,695
Is the child in question, Ma Yeong-gwang,

919
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,531
really the son

920
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,783
of the defendant,

921
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,785
Ma Chun-seok?

922
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,997
Where's the dad?

923
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,791
I don't know.

924
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,043
He changed his number.

925
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,462
He won't answer my calls.

926
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,590
He said he was going to Vietnam.

927
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,677
I have to go back to survive too.

928
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,304
Are you sure he went back to Vietnam?

929
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,393
Tell me his name, age,

930
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,436
former workplace,

931
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,480
and everything you know.

932
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,818
What happens to us once you find him?

933
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,155
We need to find him

934
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,408
and hide him in Vietnam.

935
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,703
My mother won't live for long.

936
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,123
Card games at the senior center
are her only enjoyment.

937
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,584
If…

938
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,421
If by any chance,

939
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,132
he isn't my son…

940
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,261
my mother

941
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,014
will shut herself in this house.

942
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,392
Even if…

943
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,147
Even if he really isn't my son,

944
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,027
he's still my son on paper.

945
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,947
So if we continue to live like this,

946
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,742
maybe we could be family.

947
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,931
What should we do?

948
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,022
What do you think we should do?

949
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,942
I already gave you my opinion.

950
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,987
People think you married
a young, foreign woman

951
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,698
only to abuse her.

952
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,577
You need to clear your name…

953
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,665
in order to live honorably.

954
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,172
Your Honor.

955
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:16,219
I request a paternity test
of their son, Ma Yeong-gwang.

956
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,264
Attorney Park.

957
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,640
Attorney Park Yu-seok!

958
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:48,293
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

959
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,156
However, the most painful thing
for her to bear was…

960
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,367
Do you think Ms. Dinh Thi Hoa
is the only one who slandered him?

961
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:26,581
Ms. Lee. We even pulled that off.

962
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:27,915
Your ex-wife.

963
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,543
She's not your last love, is she?

964
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,504
-She was my first love.
-Come on, man!

965
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,340
-You idiot!
-You've lost your mind!

966
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,425
Are you trying to tie Gi-yeong's hands?

967
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,135
Why me?

968
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,095
I know something is up.

969
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,388
Please help me.

970
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:47,477
