DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,974
If you hire me…

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,102
I'll take this down.

4
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,229
What?

5
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,706
June Man?

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,166
-June Man.
-Like Jun.

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,417
June.

8
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,547
-So it was you?
-Yes.

9
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,716
You're so awesome.

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,721
I see.

11
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,017
You son of a bitch!

12
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,816
You bastard!
What are you going to do about this?

13
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,192
-Wait.
-Answer me!

14
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,819
What are you going to do?

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,445
How are you going to fix this?

EPISODE 5

18
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,265
Come on, you guys are scholars of law.

19
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,433
How could you use violence?

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,351
I didn't.

21
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,396
-It was abrupt, one-sided violence.
-I'll beat the shit out of you.

22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,981
What about the video you uploaded

23
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,275
abruptly, one-sidedly, and deliberately?

24
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,153
-I'm here to tell you I'll take it down.
-So take it down!

25
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,821
So hire me!

26
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,948
-You lunatic.
-Sit down.

27
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,700
-Do something.
-That hurts!

28
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,327
-Come on!
-Stop him.

29
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,246
You little…

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,124
All right.

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,667
Okay.

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,836
Let's try

33
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,505
to sort this out.

34
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,716
You.

35
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,342
Take down the video.

36
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,635
Do it right now, you punk!

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,553
And Attorney Shin.

38
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,390
You should hire Attorney Choi.

39
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,851
You were going to hire someone anyway.

40
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,311
When did I say that?

41
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,938
You have a lot of employees.

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,441
But you're the only attorney.

43
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,110
I won't ask you to go beyond your limits.

44
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,613
But you only do the bare minimum

45
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,531
when you're the only attorney.

46
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,658
This is the busiest

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,328
we've ever been since our establishment.

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,288
-You know that, right?
-Look.

49
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,623
Don't you know the saying?

50
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,834
"All good things come to an end."

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,711
That's why you should
keep the momentum going.

52
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,879
-You little…
-Stop.

53
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,422
I ought to beat you up.

54
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,550
Tell me, you prick.

55
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,303
The video is everywhere.

56
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:45,308
-What'll you do about that?
-My settings don't let people share it.

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,893
-If I delete it, it's over.
-Really?

58
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,062
Then delete it right now.

59
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,813
You'll hire me, right?

60
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,067
Fine.

61
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,319
Delete it.

62
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,032
AN ORDINARY GUY'S
INSANE BUSKING SKILLS WHILE DRUNK

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,784
DELETE

64
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,411
Done. It's gone, right?

65
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,920
VIDEO HAS BEEN DELETED.
CONTACT THE USER FOR MORE DETAILS.

66
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,887
All right.

67
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,515
All right.

68
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,851
Let bygones be bygones.

69
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770
-Shake hands.
-Okay.

70
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,482
Shake hands.

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,527
-That's his foot.
-This is how we do it in Germany.

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,736
He uses his feet like hands.

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,780
-I see.
-He's from Germany.

74
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,740
-My hand.
-Come on.

75
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,660
You have a client.

76
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,912
Already?

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,748
I wasn't prepared to start today.

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,917
Would you rather be fired today?

79
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,836
No, sir. Thank you.

80
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,045
Thank you.

81
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,094
Hello.

82
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,095
Welcome.

83
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,513
Please excuse the commotion.

84
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,556
Come on in.

85
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,693
From now on,
I'll be texting you the schedule--

86
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,153
Lee Seo-jin.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,156
That's her, right?

88
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,450
She's so pretty.

89
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,496
This is our new attorney
who'll be starting soon.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,707
I'll introduce the two of you
when he starts--

91
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,841
Thank you.

92
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,595
-Please show yourself out.
-Yes, ma'am.

93
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,931
She's so pretty.

94
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,310
That was so cool.

95
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,396
-You get that often, don't you?
-That was a first.

96
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,649
"Please show yourself out."

97
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,446
"Please show yourself out."

98
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,491
"Please show yourself out."

99
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,201
Ms. Lee.

100
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,206
Ms. Lee.

101
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,708
We already have a paralegal,

102
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,544
so you can be the intake coordinator.

103
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,298
Sit in on consultations from now on.

104
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,674
Learn as you go.

105
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,804
And these cases
often get crazier than expected.

106
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,098
So try to hide your emotions--

107
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,434
I was one of them, so I'll be fine.

108
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,479
That's a great attitude.

109
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,023
Come and watch me do the consultation.

110
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,191
It'll help you learn.

111
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,152
Let's go. Hurry.

112
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,792
Attorney Shin.

113
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,793
Yes?

114
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,546
Do you understand me?

115
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:10,471
So you want me to prove
that you two are having an affair…

116
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,431
so that…

117
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,894
he can get a divorce, right?

118
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,066
-Correct.
-Well…

119
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:27,113
Is his current spouse
aware of your affair?

120
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,533
Yes. I met with her a few days ago.

121
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,829
I begged and pleaded with her
to divorce him,

122
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,248
but a lawsuit is our last resort now.

123
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,670
When the spouse at fault
files for divorce,

124
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:47,967
it's not likely for them
to get a favorable outcome.

125
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,638
Look. What about her?

126
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,974
She's Kim Seo-jin, right?

127
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,268
You won her divorce suit.

128
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,686
That's why I'm here.

129
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,396
That's your name, right?

130
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,024
It's Lee Seo-jin.

131
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,776
And she's our intake coordinator.

132
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,987
As for that case…

133
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,115
That was a bit different.

134
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,077
It was for custody,
which a child's life depended on.

135
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,829
-So as her attorney--
-What about us?

136
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,958
Are you refusing to help
because we're having an affair?

137
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,168
That's enough.

138
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,754
Let's just go.
They're all saying the same thing.

139
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,006
His life is at stake.

140
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,508
He's going to die.

141
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,886
If he doesn't get a divorce right now,
he might really die.

142
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,803
What do you mean?

143
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,477
I have liver cancer.

144
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,021
The doctor said a liver transplant

145
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,066
would increase my chance of survival.

146
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,110
And she's willing to be my donor.

147
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
But to do that, we need to get married.

148
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,866
I see.

149
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,077
I understand.

150
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,331
You can't give him your liver
unless you're his spouse.

151
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,542
And you want to marry him

152
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,836
so that you can donate your liver, right?

153
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,548
Yes, that's exactly right.

154
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,800
Could you please help us?

155
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,553
We can't let him die, can we?

156
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:20,184
Is your wife not able to donate her liver?

157
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,395
-Is she ill?
-No.

158
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,522
She's perfectly healthy.

159
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,941
That's why I can't become his donor.

160
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,737
She'd rather be widowed than divorced.

161
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,328
Your shoulders are very stiff.

162
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,497
Did you play golf?

163
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,375
I wish I had time for that.

164
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,294
Gosh, look at this.

165
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,171
Everyone puts their needs first.

166
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,090
No wonder my body tenses up.

167
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,220
I'm so sick of it.

168
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,055
Do you have any children?

169
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,684
I have a 16-year-old son.
He's studying abroad right now.

170
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,271
Is he aware of your situation?

171
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,897
Not in detail.

172
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,233
But he knows that I'm sick.

173
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,653
It's his son's right to know.

174
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,739
But his wife won't tell him anything.

175
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,823
Despite his illness,

176
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,827
she pesters him to pay the tuition
and give her allowances.

177
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,998
Last year, she even made him
take his pension early.

178
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,875
Isn't she the one at fault here?

179
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,293
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

180
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,717
She also has a ton of insurance.

181
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,470
She can save his life,
but she's waiting for him to die.

182
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,263
That's murder, right?

183
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,848
Don't you agree?

184
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,441
You need to send more money this month.

185
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,944
I need to pay the deposit
for Min-su's classes during his break.

186
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,905
-How much more?
-Four million won.

187
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,575
I gave you my pension money.

188
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,828
-Have you spent it all?
-I got a new car.

189
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,331
I almost died while driving
that 15-year-old junk.

190
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,340
Tell me.

191
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,550
Why were you acting differently?

192
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,677
-Sorry?
-I mean,

193
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,597
you would've given me an earful
if I called you Kim Seo-jin.

194
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,766
Why did you remain quiet?

195
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,811
I didn't want
to interrupt the consultation.

196
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,147
If that's the reason,

197
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,902
I don't want you to hold back.

198
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,865
We did so much work.

199
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,493
I'm very exhausted.

200
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,415
And on that note, I'm calling it a day.

201
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,583
Because I've done too much work.

202
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,044
I'm leaving. Goodbye!

203
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,008
What was that?

204
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,186
A swallowtail

205
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,481
Comes flying

206
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,360
And it sat down

207
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,030
On a flowerbed

208
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,827
But not a single person

209
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,330
Seems to

210
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,584
Pay attention

211
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,047
-Swallowtail, fly away
-Fly away

212
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,094
Fly away into the sky

213
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,057
Swallowtail, fly away

214
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,438
-Go hide in the clouds
-In the clouds

215
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,651
Go hide

216
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,865
Will it hide?

217
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,996
Okay!

218
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,082
Gi-yeong!

219
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,584
Uncle Sung-han!

220
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,545
How have you been, Gi-yeong?

221
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,172
Let me see your teeth.

222
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,049
They've all grown back.

223
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,926
Hello, Mr. Jung.

224
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,512
I'll pick him up at nine.

225
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,722
Isn't that too early?

226
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,516
I like to sleep in on the weekends.

227
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,685
I meant 9 p.m. tonight.

228
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,397
Tonight?

229
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,944
Okay.

230
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,820
Goodbye then.

231
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,617
Come on, Uncle Sung-han.
We don't have much time.

232
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,785
All right.

233
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,496
Hey!

234
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,376
Hey, it's cheating if you start first.

235
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,335
It's cheating.

236
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,337
I just wanted to see.

237
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,881
No, let's eat first.

238
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,675
It's been so long!

239
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,886
Jeez.

240
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,768
Here.

241
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,437
I'm ready.

242
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,734
Take that!

243
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,736
Eat this.

244
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,203
-Darn it.
-Yeah!

245
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,664
Come on!

246
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,170
Gi-yeong.

247
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,758
Don't be so smug
just because you beat me today.

248
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,385
I'll beat you next time.

249
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,888
No, I'm going to beat you every time.

250
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,558
Oh, man.

251
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,184
Goodness.

252
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,145
My Gi-yeong.

253
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,274
Go to bed right away
once you get home, okay?

254
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,359
You have to.

255
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,945
Okay?

256
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,280
-Okay.
-Hop in.

257
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,657
-Bye.
-Bye.

258
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,743
Put your seatbelt on.

259
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,789
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

260
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,082
Why is he leaving so early?

261
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
You see,

262
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
Madam will be flying in from the US soon.

263
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,590
Everyone's a bit on edge.

264
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,635
-"Madam"?
-Yes.

265
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,761
His paternal grandmother.

266
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,974
I see.

267
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,727
It's quite dark at night.
Please drive safely.

268
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,104
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

269
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,487
Text me.

270
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,030
See you.

271
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,573
Bye.

272
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,576
Bye.

273
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,271
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

274
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,739
Hi, Hyeon-u.

275
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,198
One minute.

276
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,493
What is it?

277
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,786
Do you need something?

278
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,081
Come on.

279
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,125
-You were just calling?
-Jeez.

280
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,503
More coffee?

281
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,758
I must be nervous on my first day.

282
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,051
I can't stop drinking it.

283
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,012
The office is so quiet

284
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,347
that I can hear my heart beating.

285
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,558
We have a coffee machine
and instant coffee.

286
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,521
The water purifier broke.

287
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,232
They're supposed to come fix it today.

288
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,400
Hold on.

289
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,700
Flowers?

290
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,370
It's to celebrate your first new recruit
since your establishment.

291
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,791
I've never received flowers
from a stranger before.

292
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:07,961
Hello.

293
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm Jo Jeong-sik
from Jo Jeong-sik Real Estate downstairs.

294
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,425
I see.

295
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,969
I heard you started working here.

296
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,390
I'd like to welcome you
on behalf of all tenants of this building.

297
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,726
-Welcome.
-It's my birthday today.

298
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,561
Lunar birthdays don't count.

299
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,106
Attorney Choi is a new face too.

300
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,899
It's okay. I'm allergic to flowers.

301
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,443
Where did Attorney Shin and Mr. Jang go?

302
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,529
I asked them to prepare a small cake.

303
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,780
Jeez.

304
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,408
We're childhood friends.

305
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,452
Not that we're childish.

306
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,710
Right. Have you had a team dinner yet?

307
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,671
We should.

308
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,298
Hey, you guys…

309
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,550
I can't believe you guys.

310
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,093
How could you…

311
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,097
We could go for Spanish cuisine or ribs.

312
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,016
But as our first team dinner,
maybe we should go for Korean…

313
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,729
This wasn't even my idea.

314
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,901
How will I explain the individualism
of this office to future generations?

315
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,696
You said it's your birthday.

316
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,574
-Should I buy you dinner?
-I don't do lunar birthdays.

317
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,077
I searched for a restaurant
for our dinner…

318
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,538
They're not under the couch.
Where on earth are they?

319
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,417
Is this a prank?

320
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,829
Enjoy.

321
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,083
I'll have a drink as well.

322
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,710
Sure.

323
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,711
What about you?

324
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,005
He stays away from wine.

325
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,343
-She's serving wine?
-Yes.

326
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,303
It's a new generation.

327
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,722
And she drinks wine.

328
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,474
Enjoy.

329
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,981
I'd like some soju.

330
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,983
I don't have any.

331
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,737
Hey.

332
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,365
How can you be drinking during work hours?

333
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,577
And what was your daily routine
for our first year of work?

334
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,331
Clock in, work, and clock out.

335
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,584
Clock in and drink a bottle of beer.

336
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,712
Drink two glasses of soju at lunch.

337
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,466
Clock out and drink
two whole bottles of soju.

338
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,927
That's amazing.

339
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,136
You sound like a master.

340
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,014
Is drinking your secret to winning cases?

341
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,809
-Write that down.
-What?

342
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,644
Her valuable words.

343
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,812
Or memorize them.

344
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,319
Hello.

345
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,862
-Hey.
-Hey.

346
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,451
I've been waiting for you.

347
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,288
-We should've come here together.
-Right.

348
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,457
Mr. Jang loves to drink during the day.

349
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,545
I just thought I'd stop by.

350
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,303
Are those for me?

351
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,305
They're so pretty.

352
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,682
I got them from someone,

353
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,726
but I didn't know where to put them.

354
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,853
I see.

355
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,941
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,110
I'm not dumping them on you.

357
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,946
I just don't know what to do with them.

358
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,656
You can always give them to me.

359
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,131
They must be unsolicited flowers.

360
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,300
Who's the bastard?

361
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,136
Who could it be?

362
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,513
Choi Jun?

363
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,765
No way.

364
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,316
Sae-bom, it's me.

365
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,694
Do you know who gave Ms. Lee…

366
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,866
So it was him.

367
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,659
Got it.

368
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,330
It was Choi Jun, right?
He crossed the line again.

369
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,707
Why would he do such a thing?

370
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,042
It was him, right?

371
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,092
What?

372
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,220
"Welcome to our building."

373
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,097
"I hope we get along."

374
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,808
"Feel free to tell me
if you need any help."

375
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:17,145
I wanted those flowers
to convey these messages.

376
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,942
So why are you guys
giving me these nasty looks?

377
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,860
-Who are you to welcome her?
-"Get along"?

378
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,278
Why would she need your help?

379
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,656
Did you give Sae-bom
flowers on her first day?

380
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,658
-That was--
-What about

381
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,993
-when we opened the office?
-No.

382
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,121
Why would I do that for you guys?

383
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,082
Exactly. If you wouldn't do it for us,

384
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,292
why would you do it for her?

385
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,378
Gosh, you're being so fussy.

386
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,839
That's my job, man!

387
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,715
You don't know
what could happen in the future.

388
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,385
Listen.

389
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,513
Because I'm not going to say this again.

390
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,307
"Don't go visiting graves

391
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
with a rake in your hand."

392
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,981
Talk to me in emojis
if you find Korean too hard.

393
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,859
You pathetic bastard.

394
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,573
Hey.

395
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,908
Fine, maybe I went over the top.

396
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,579
But what's so wrong about welcoming her?

397
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,583
I'm going to say this once, so listen up.

398
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,835
Ms. Lee doesn't want

399
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,337
anyone to recognize her.

400
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,923
But she needs to hold down a job

401
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,717
to maintain custody of her son.

402
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,345
She's still not emotionally stable.

403
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,681
And then you showed up.

404
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,517
With flowers, no less.

405
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,605
Just for Ms. Lee,
not Sae-bom or Attorney Choi.

406
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,607
Saying "welcome" like an idiot.

407
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,941
How would she feel?

408
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,280
Do you finally get it?

409
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,407
Gosh, I…

410
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,285
I can't believe how dense I've become.

411
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,997
Jo Jeong-sik.

412
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,874
Get a grip, will you?

413
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,545
So the biggest issue right now is that…

414
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
Sae-bom is upset, right?

415
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,259
You lunatic.

416
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,803
You damn lunatic.

417
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,804
For crying out loud.

418
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,226
Gosh. I'm such a lunatic.

419
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,603
He's right.

420
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,480
I understand. Darn it.

421
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,315
Wait!

422
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,235
You damn landlord!

423
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,238
That proverb.

424
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,700
Shouldn't it be a shovel, not a rake?

425
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:40,247
I'll think of him now and then

426
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,415
Come in.

427
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,466
Ms. Kim Ji-suk called several times.

428
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,052
She wants to know if you'll take her case.

429
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,141
Let me think about it a little longer.

430
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,768
Okay.

431
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,859
This is a personal question.

432
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,947
Is this case more difficult than mine?

433
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm just curious.

434
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,078
She came to you
because you managed to win my case.

435
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,957
Does that mean my situation was worse?

436
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,838
All divorce suits are difficult.

437
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,757
But why do you want to know that?

438
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:37,929
I'm not sure.

439
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,181
Is it on the same line

440
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:46,187
with why you felt uncomfortable
about those flowers?

441
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,698
It is.

442
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,328
Thank you for being honest.

443
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,621
He really crossed the line

444
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,957
with those flowers.

445
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,170
But I also overreacted.

446
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,255
It's understandable for now.

447
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,258
-"For now"?
-Yes, for now.

448
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,887
I hope you'll come back

449
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,515
to being yourself soon.

450
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,564
A musician's interpretation is important,

451
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,777
but the composer's first inspiration
always comes first.

452
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,822
How grand.

453
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,659
I heard it on a radio show

454
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,119
about classical music.

455
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,043
Mr. Jang told me

456
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,964
that you listen to trot music
when you're sad.

457
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,760
When the weather is nice,

458
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,429
I listen to classical music too.

459
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,665
Man.

460
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm so awesome.

461
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,144
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

462
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,395
Why is he leaving so early?

463
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,688
You see,

464
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,315
Madam will be flying in from the US soon.

465
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,152
If Ms. Ma returns…

466
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,450
Where do I… Goodness.

467
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,785
Please sit a little closer to your sister.

468
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,911
-Closer?
-Yes.

469
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,415
Her dress is so puffy.

470
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,293
That's good. Look at the camera. One, two.

471
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,505
You must be sad
to see your sister get married.

472
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,798
-Me?
-Yes.

473
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,716
Smile.

474
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,926
You tend to look serious
when you're tense.

475
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,473
Good. Look at the camera. One, two.

476
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,641
A bigger smile. One, two.

477
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,268
Good.

478
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,936
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

479
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,024
You fell in love so fast.

480
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,943
I thought you were against marriage.

481
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,032
You used to pester me,
telling me to talk to Dad about it.

482
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,950
He's a nice guy.

483
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,161
Come on. Nicer than me?

484
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,121
I wouldn't say you're the nice type.

485
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,123
That's true.

486
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,751
-You know what?
-What?

487
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,337
If you're unsure about all this,
we can leave right now.

488
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,047
Remember what Mom said?

489
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,132
You should throw away your bouquet and run

490
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,760
if you have second thoughts
while walking down the aisle.

491
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,387
I'm worried about you.

492
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,388
Why?

493
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,307
I wish you lived closer.

494
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,771
Mother.

495
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,898
Sit down.

496
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,818
You look great.

497
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,778
You look amazing.

498
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,071
Thank you.

499
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,156
I'm really nervous.

500
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,662
Ma'am, please take good care of my sister.

501
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,622
You don't have to ask.

502
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,998
We're thankful to have her.

503
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,835
She's really kind and softhearted.

504
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,127
"Kind"?

505
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,088
Yes.

506
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:44,926
Don't be.

507
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,220
Kindness is a weakness.

508
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,858
"Don't be kind. "

509
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,737
"Kindness is a weakness."

510
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,128
ATTORNEY
PARK YU-SEOK

511
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,593
You look good.

512
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,220
Yes, sir. I'm always doing well.

513
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,639
Both mentally and physically.

514
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,808
Are you prepared to get a new job?

515
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,393
Yes, I'm already working there.

516
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,855
I'm sure you'll do well.

517
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,941
Thank you, sir.

518
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,861
I got scared
when you suddenly wanted to see me.

519
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
I'm relieved that you're checking in

520
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,908
so I can transition smoothly
from one job to another.

521
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,327
Are you relieved?

522
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,079
-Pardon?
-Don't be.

523
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,999
Your resignation isn't final yet.

524
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,502
Then what do I need to do?

525
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,713
You're an employee
who knows about our secrets.

526
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,468
We couldn't let you go
without any safety measures, right?

527
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,678
But I don't know any secrets.

528
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,143
Apparently, my ear canals
are narrower than average.

529
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,895
So regular cotton swabs don't fit.

530
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,149
So I once tried
the ones made for children.

531
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,779
But those were so soft
that they got bent too easily.

532
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,697
You could ask a doctor to clean them.

533
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,660
Come on. They have better things to do.

534
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,872
I tend to tailor everything to my liking.

535
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,040
Cotton swabs…

536
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,917
or people.

537
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,214
You used to be my spy.

538
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,010
You mean that errand I ran for you?

539
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,929
You scared me for a second.

540
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,014
Does Sung-han know?

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,725
That you spied on him

542
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,728
and schemed with his client's husband?

543
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,148
I only did what my boss told me to.

544
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,483
Come on now.

545
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,237
What kind of attorney
gives such a basic response?

546
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm disappointed, Attorney Choi.

547
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,618
It doesn't matter who told you to do it.

548
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,705
What's important is that you did it.

549
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,333
And it's ridiculous
that you want to work there,

550
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,460
pledging to be loyal to him.

551
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,105
Ji-eun, how is your…

552
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,986
How are you feeling?

553
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,154
Is there anything…

554
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,832
I'd look like a lunatic
no matter what I say.

555
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,298
What?

556
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,018
Attorney Choi.

557
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,271
Why aren't you going into the office?

558
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,192
Is something wrong?

559
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,572
Do you want some water?

560
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,991
No.

561
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,621
Would you like to get some iced americano?

562
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,629
What should I do?

563
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,591
If Attorney Shin finds out,

564
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,468
he'll beat me, right?

565
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,928
Probably.

566
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,182
I don't know how I'm going to
defend you this time.

567
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,518
But if you think about it,

568
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,853
if I hadn't spied on him,

569
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,564
I wouldn't have known
that he was the Piano Man.

570
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,565
Then the video

571
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,110
would've gotten a lot more views.

572
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,278
This is actually a blessing in disguise.

573
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,368
Even then, Keumhwa Law Firm
is too much of a headache.

574
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,208
Do you know why Attorney Shin
feels uncomfortable around you?

575
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,127
Because I'm handsome?

576
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,003
And young?

577
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,174
Also, yes.

578
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,428
But it's because
you used to work for Keumhwa.

579
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,556
What's his beef with Park Yu-seok?

580
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,725
If I tell you, he'll give me shit…

581
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,062
I mean, he'll be upset.

582
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,856
I'll keep it a secret.

583
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,066
My future is at stake here.

584
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,154
I mean…

585
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,157
Okay.

586
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,077
But you better not let him find out.

587
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,788
I promise.

588
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,290
I even sealed it, okay?

589
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,630
In a sense,

590
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,092
everything started with the piano.

591
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,223
From Attorney Choi's point of view,

592
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,685
he was put up to it by his boss.

593
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,520
Right, Attorney Choi?

594
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,689
I had no power.

595
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,192
I was an intern
who could be fired any second.

596
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,276
Goodness.

597
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,279
A powerless intern all of a sudden?

598
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:44,535
I'm putting myself in
Park Yu-seok's shoes for the first time.

599
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,538
Let's stay on topic.

600
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,873
No, think about it.

601
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,793
Park Yu-seok must be pissed right now.

602
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,795
He thought, "This kid is a competent spy."

603
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,381
"He's so reliable." Right?

604
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,927
He was about to
officially hire this kid as an attorney

605
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,596
when the kid said
that he'd work for the enemy

606
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,097
and left him.

607
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,350
How upsetting is that?

608
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,727
I'm pretty sharp-witted, you know.

609
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,395
Attorney Choi.

610
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,232
"Why is Attorney Park
so worried about Attorney Shin?"

611
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,358
Attorney Choi.

612
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,735
"What does he care
about this small business?"

613
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
"What could this be about?"

614
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,782
My mom used to say
nothing happens without a reason.

615
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,741
There must be something.

616
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,910
I said, let's stay on topic.

617
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,703
Whatever the story may be,

618
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,165
I wanted to do my best to help you,
the pianist and attorney.

619
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,876
That's the determination
I entered this battlefield with.

620
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,056
Is he going to pay you?

621
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,475
Pay me?

622
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,185
You shouldn't work for free.

623
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,397
-I'm not doing it.
-Do it.

624
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,483
Let's take the money from Keumhwa

625
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,819
and have a team dinner.

626
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,533
Give him all the information
you can find here.

627
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,451
I won't know anything about it.

628
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,038
Go ahead and be his spy.

629
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,332
You're so awesome.

630
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,793
I promise

631
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,213
to be the best spy
so that your grapes grow

632
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,798
into the best vineyard ever.

633
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,675
Anything else?

634
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,012
I'll give him all the information.

635
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,308
Thank you for trusting me.

636
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,981
You're such a strategist.

637
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,524
Wait, is there a better word?

638
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,527
Tell me something I don't know.

639
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,070
What about you?

640
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,823
Are you sorting things out?

641
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,616
Goodness.

642
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,953
She's going to have a baby.

643
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,665
Don't worry about it.

644
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,752
You're smiling?

645
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:06,844
If you must get over this love

646
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,807
Don't turn around and cry

647
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,810
Wipe those tears away

648
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,290
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

649
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,509
I was just about to leave.

650
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,219
I made them.

651
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,262
Try them.

652
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,473
Thank you.

653
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,987
It's nice and sweet.

654
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,823
It goes well with wine.

655
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,995
Is your stomach okay,
having ramyeon and wine every day?

656
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,624
It'd be healthier to have rice.

657
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,586
Are you really going to
turn it into a macaron shop?

658
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,546
Yes.

659
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,048
I just don't think they'll sell very well.

660
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,762
I can always come back to selling ramyeon.

661
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,765
I guess you could do that.

662
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,813
JI-EUN

663
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,027
Hey, Ji-eun.

664
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,656
What's wrong?

665
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,243
-Are you okay?
-Help me.

666
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,204
It hurts.

667
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,623
My stomach hurts.

668
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,627
You should call an ambulance.

669
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,712
I'm scared.

670
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,258
I'll be right there. Wait for me, okay?

671
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,593
All right, Ji-eun?

672
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,348
-You're driving?
-What?

673
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,810
No, I shouldn't.

674
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,646
-But Ji-eun…
-Give me the keys.

675
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,383
Why won't you let me call an ambulance?

676
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,137
What if something happens to the baby?

677
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:06,065
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

678
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,201
Thank you.

679
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,452
You really saved the day.

680
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,412
My house is nearby.

681
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,705
Get yourself a cab.

682
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,041
What are you doing?

683
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,709
I was just helping you.

684
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,379
I just felt bad.

685
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
Don't worry about it.

686
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,551
Is she your sister?

687
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,512
No.

688
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,431
-She's my wife.
-Sorry?

689
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,642
She's your wife? Oh, dear.

690
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,185
I hope the baby is okay.

691
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,230
I hope so too.

692
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,107
Thank you so much.

693
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,693
Don't mention it. Goodbye.

694
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,736
Goodbye. Thank you.

695
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,830
Hold on.

696
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,666
Why does he have so much ramyeon and wine

697
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,668
when his wife just got pregnant?

698
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,629
Every day?

699
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,951
I…

700
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,009
Go inside.

701
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,679
Both the baby and Ji-eun are okay.

702
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,983
ATTORNEY SHIN

703
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,576
I'll be going now.

704
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,079
Thank you.

705
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,760
She was in pain.

706
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,097
And I happened to be nearby.

707
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,268
That's all.

708
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,395
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,230
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,732
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,119
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,746
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,009
Hello, everyone.

714
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,845
Let me show you today's item.

715
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,890
It's Korea's most beloved side dish,
crabs marinated in soy sauce.

716
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,143
But these aren't just any crabs.

717
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:33,605
-They have sold out every time so far.
-Look at that roe.

718
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,774
It's the Ihwa Marinated Crabs.

719
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,860
-Should I buy some?
-And we have a surprise.

720
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,530
-The CEO is here himself.
-Come on.

721
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,366
Why don't they sell them
in smaller portions?

722
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,535
So many people live alone nowadays.

723
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,705
It's time society caught up.

724
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,127
That looks incredible.

725
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,006
He's mixing it with rice.

726
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,382
Look at that.

727
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,675
Why isn't he picking up?

728
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,261
Darn it.

729
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,891
The roe-filled crabs
that we're showing you today…

730
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,142
Hello?

731
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,310
-Jeong-sik.
-What?

732
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,562
-Are you with Hyeong-geun?
-No. Why?

733
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,230
-No?
-No.

734
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,066
-Do you want to order some marinated--
-Cut it out.

735
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,445
Why did he hang up on me?

736
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,698
That little…

737
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,975
-What is it?
-Hey, Hyeong-geun.

738
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,561
They're selling marinated crabs.
Let's go halfsies.

739
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,813
We have three minutes left.

740
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,359
They're not those smaller ones, right?
I don't like those.

741
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,986
They're not, and they're full of roe.

742
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,614
The color of the roe is out of this world.

743
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,200
-I'm ordering them, okay?
-Okay.

744
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,583
Hello?

745
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,377
Why did you cry?

746
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,257
Holy shit, I got goosebumps.

747
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,218
Why are you here?

748
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,971
I was worried about Hyeong-geun.

749
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,556
You were anxiously looking for him.

750
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,017
-I knew something was wrong.
-I wasn't anxious when I called.

751
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,270
I was talking about crabs
when you hung up on me.

752
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,564
That's not what's important right now.

753
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,608
What's important is
that I knew something was wrong.

754
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,570
Look at those puffy eyes.

755
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,446
He definitely bawled.

756
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,532
Can we listen to Sim Soo-bong?

757
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,451
Sure. You want some whiskey with that?

758
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,330
You should have at least
brought some beef jerky.

759
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,332
Your friend's a teary mess, you ass.

760
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,512
Did you meet Ji-eun?

761
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,015
I met the guy.

762
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,182
The guy she lives with?

763
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,810
He looked so nice.

764
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:19,271
What the hell, man?
Are you out of your mind?

765
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,648
You're the nicest guy there is.

766
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,817
Hold on. Why did you guys suddenly meet?

767
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,030
Ji-eun had an emergency.

768
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,407
And he was out working.

769
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,950
So she called you?

770
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,953
Why didn't she just call an ambulance?

771
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,496
She couldn't.

772
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,665
She was ashamed.

773
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,338
Man…

774
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,187
Let's listen to Sim Soo-bong.

775
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,647
Life sucks.

776
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,814
What did he say?

777
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,108
Why are you rubbing salt in his wound?

778
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,069
He said he was sorry.

779
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,112
He cried.

780
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,491
She's ashamed, and he cried.

781
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,701
What a mess.

782
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,578
Are you okay?

783
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,041
I don't know.

784
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,794
With things the way they are,

785
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,254
I don't know what to feel.

786
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,299
I just…

787
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,511
I just hope the baby will be healthy.

788
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,264
I hope the delivery goes well.

789
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,102
I don't know.

790
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,542
What the hell are you doing?

791
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,877
You crazy bastard.

792
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,631
Look.

793
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,845
He looks so tall.

794
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,179
I know.

795
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,308
You look good.

796
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,436
Jeong-sik took it.

797
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,438
Let me see it.

798
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,315
Come here.

799
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,277
See?

800
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,696
You look good, right?

801
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,325
Send it to me.

802
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,453
Okay, I'll send it to you.

803
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,871
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

804
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,915
What do you say?
Do you want to pose for another one?

805
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,876
You look really tall. Look.

806
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,961
-Why don't you do another one?
-Yes.

807
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,088
You'll look taller next to the speaker.

808
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,132
And don't look at the camera.

809
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,759
I guess it doesn't look too bad.

810
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,719
Pose again. You looked really tall.

811
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,970
I need a profile photo.

812
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,638
-You do?
-You do?

813
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,475
So that's why it's been blank.

814
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,602
Is he auditioning or something?

815
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
-Don't sit down.
-Don't sit down.

816
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,063
-Look away.
-Look away.

817
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,691
-Don't touch that.
-Don't touch that.

818
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,194
-You son of a bitch.
-Just stand still.

819
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,029
-There you go.
-Look away.

820
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,615
Don't look at us.
It's better if you hide your face.

821
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,158
He's so awkward now.

822
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,910
-Come back. It's okay.
-Come here.

823
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,495
-The first one was better.
-It was?

824
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,246
You're not an actor or anything.

825
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,165
And don't touch my speaker, you asshole.

826
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,666
-It cost 50 million won.
-I'll send it to you.

827
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,168
I guess the first one will do.

828
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,669
Give me your number.

829
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,844
I don't play games that much anymore.

830
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,888
I could tell.

831
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,974
So let me do my homework in my room.

832
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,312
You want me to study here
so I don't play games.

833
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,522
That's not true.

834
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,192
I just don't want to be alone.

835
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,946
Why not?

836
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,370
It makes me think too much.

837
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,330
I don't like that.

838
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,918
But they're your thoughts.

839
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,089
You can think as much as you want.

840
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,142
School isn't that bad.

841
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,731
How's your work?

842
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,486
Good. I like it.

843
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,119
Welcome back, ma'am.

844
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,746
Hello, Mr. Jung.

845
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,093
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE

846
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,810
To Ichon-dong, ma'am?

847
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,438
Let's go to Nonhyeon-dong.

848
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,398
I want to see Gi-yeong first.

849
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,734
Nonhyeon-dong it is.

850
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,571
Have you tried her food, Mr. Jung?

851
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,031
Sorry?

852
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,992
My new daughter-in-law.

853
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,827
Yes.

854
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,581
Who's better?
Her or my late daughter-in-law?

855
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,083
At cooking.

856
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,920
I'm not sure, ma'am.

857
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,380
I'm not a picky eater.

858
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,759
I was just joking to wake myself up.

859
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,095
I must be getting old.

860
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,638
I'll be jet-lagged for a while.

861
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,556
Do you want to see Dr. Choi?

862
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,475
Let me rest for a few days and see.

863
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,685
Yes, ma'am.

864
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,188
About Gi-yeong.

865
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:36,815
Yes, ma'am.

866
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,900
If I asked him to come with me to Hawaii,

867
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,111
will he say yes?

868
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm not sure.

869
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,242
Ms. Jin will probably be against it.

870
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,745
She doesn't even let him
visit his uncle once a month.

871
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,418
That's how she is.

872
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,962
She's hostile for no reason.

873
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,255
She's vicious.

874
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,507
She's too much.

875
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,226
If you're Mr. Choi's son,

876
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,603
aren't you supposed to be
in the US right now?

877
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,772
I'm visiting.

878
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,733
Do your parents know?

879
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,402
No. I came straight from the airport.

880
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,030
But why?

881
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,282
You're my dad's attorney.

882
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,742
It's not decided yet.

883
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,286
-What's not decided?
-Right.

884
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:35,415
Whether I'll take on his case or not.

885
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,878
By who exactly? My dad or you?

886
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,004
Me.

887
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,132
Shouldn't we call your parents first?

888
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,258
It's okay.

889
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,677
There's not a single sane person
in my family.

890
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,096
Think about it.

891
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,891
My dad needs a donor for his liver cancer,

892
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,518
but my mom has no plans of doing that.

893
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,104
I don't know if I should be,

894
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,816
but I'm glad his mistress
is willing to donate her liver.

895
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,235
But he needs a divorce first.

896
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,071
Am I right?

897
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,323
Who told you all that?

898
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,912
That's their business.

899
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,997
I have another question.

900
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,878
I can donate my organs if I want to
since I'm over 15, right?

901
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:26,800
So?

902
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,593
I want to give him my liver.

903
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,263
So help me with the legal issues.

904
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,366
I'll shampoo your hair in ten minutes.

905
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,743
Okay. Did you have lunch?

906
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,037
I had too many customers then.

907
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,997
I just drank some soy milk.

908
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,376
Goodness, why do you work so hard
when your husband is a professor?

909
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,170
Wouldn't it be more convenient
to have a reservation system?

910
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,088
Please.

911
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,758
You're all regulars here.
It would be uninviting.

912
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,510
-Wait for a minute.
-Okay.

913
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,978
Have you heard anything from your son?

914
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,147
He deserves to know.

915
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,648
He'll resent you later.

916
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,649
JEONG-HO

917
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,824
Your name is Choi Min-su?

918
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,492
Yes.

919
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,705
I'm a bit dumbfounded right now.

920
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,416
Let me talk casually.

921
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,334
Sure.

922
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,670
Non-relative organ donors

923
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,257
are put under extreme scrutiny.

924
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,428
Do you think they'll be any more lenient

925
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,388
when you're related?

926
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,858
It would be more terrifying
to be on the operating table…

927
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,029
waiting for surgery.

928
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,364
Don't you agree?

929
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,951
I'm only 16.

930
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:37,180
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

931
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,277
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

932
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,533
I quit.

933
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,746
RAMYEON

934
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,831
Are you still undecided

935
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,292
on Professor Choi's case?

936
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,128
Yes.

937
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,506
I wish you'd take it.

938
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,970
Do you know that story

939
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,556
about a rabbit and its liver?

940
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,640
The Hare's Liver?

941
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,479
-I'm going to make a deal.
-A deal?

942
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,273
In return for donating my liver,

943
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,317
I want them to stop sending me abroad.

944
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,500
If you pass up on this case,

945
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,837
I don't think I'll be able to stay true

946
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,464
to the composer's first inspiration.

947
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,342
I think I'll end up

948
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,012
interpreting the piece however I want.

949
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,474
"What if they recognize me?"

950
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,144
"They did."

951
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,814
"What are they thinking?"

952
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,985
"What did I wear today?"

953
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,739
"Maybe I should've worn pants
instead of a skirt."

954
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,241
"Is my lipstick too bold?"

955
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,244
"Maybe I shouldn't have worn mascara."

956
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,129
"Attorney Shin must have felt

957
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,923
just as uncomfortable

958
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,052
when he was defending me."

959
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,805
Kind of like that.

960
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,113
This is on me.

961
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,160
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

962
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,597
These don't suit you.

963
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,225
I'll get you new ones.

964
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,519
Thank you.

965
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,019
Min-su visited me.

966
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,609
You don't look surprised.
Did you know about it?

967
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,611
No, I didn't.

968
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,241
You see,

969
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,994
I was really torn.

970
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:33,291
About whether I should
take your case or not.

971
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,169
But I shouldn't have been.

972
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:41,174
As an attorney, my job is to win cases.

973
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,469
Who am I to judge and interpret--

974
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,511
I'm sorry.

975
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,638
But I have

976
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,184
no energy to listen to you
beating around the bush.

977
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,103
Just call me out in my face.

978
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,647
No. I'm talking about
how to approach your case.

979
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:02,069
Now that it's begun,
we have to win at all costs.

980
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,822
There are two things

981
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,074
you must endure.

982
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,371
First.

983
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,373
Your cancer insurance.

984
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,251
Cancel all of it.

985
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,130
Second.

986
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,383
You might end up with a criminal record.

987
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,848
I'm sorry to say this,

988
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,684
but this is literally

989
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,645
a do-or-die situation.

990
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,738
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

991
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:13,850
It's different.

992
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,935
You wanted to protect Hyeon-u.

993
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,353
What the hell are you doing?

994
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,980
Professor Choi and his wife…

995
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,898
It was different from the beginning.

996
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,150
I was curious about you.

997
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,779
Kindness is a weakness.

998
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,947
Mark my words.

999
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,785
1225.

1000
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,872
Do these numbers mean anything?

1001
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,583

1002
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,001
Who's this?

1003
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,715
