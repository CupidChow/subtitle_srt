1
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,888
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,725
FINALE

3
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,884
I thought we were done negotiating.

4
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,262
Yes, but there is something
I need to check

5
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,140
before the case is wrapped up.

6
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,100
Sure.

7
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,855
Do you really want to…

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,983
divorce your wife?

9
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,695
It's true

10
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:57,283
that I gave her a hard time
throughout our marriage.

11
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,288
And she insisted on getting a divorce
even though I asked for forgiveness.

12
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,498
I had no other choice.

13
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,961
May I take it that you want to

14
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,797
preserve your marriage?

15
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,717
Ms. Ma.

16
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,971
What's the…

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,431
purpose of this divorce?

18
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,853
What do you mean?

19
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,814
Your contempt for Chairman Seo,

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,441
the long-awaited revenge…

21
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,278
Are those really your reasons?

22
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,867
You wear the crown

23
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,077
of pain and disgrace.

24
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,040
So it's no wonder
you'd want to take it off.

25
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,876
But then again,

26
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,920
you've already held out for so long.

27
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,132
Why don't you

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,801
hold on to that crown?

29
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,306
Are you telling me not to divorce him?

30
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,849
Chairman Seo,

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,727
you're only getting divorced
because Ms. Ma wants to.

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,814
And Ms. Ma wants to secure
her dear grandson's financial stability,

33
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,192
even if it means divorce.

34
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
That's the situation between you two.

35
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,864
Interesting.

36
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,158
So?

37
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,994
I'd like for both of you

38
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,247
to focus on the essence of this matter.

39
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,501
Give Ms. Ma her share.

40
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,796
Do it while you're married.

41
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,259
I know that

42
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,138
you have always done
your best for Gi-yeong.

43
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,309
I'll also do my best for him.

44
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,811
However,

45
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,397
I hope your decision for Gi-yeong…

46
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,902
This is how I feel, at least.

47
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,740
I hope it won't be
a sacrifice on your part.

48
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,500
I see.

49
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,589
So what's Shin Sung-han's endgame?

50
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,928
Didn't you come this far
because of what happened to your sister?

51
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,138
So tell me.

52
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,059
What's Shin Sung-han's true endgame?

53
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,936
My endgame?

54
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,398
My endgame is…

55
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,653
to file for the termination
of parental rights over Gi-yeong.

56
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,952
You're determined to go all the way

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,872
whether I get divorced or not, correct?

58
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,375
Yes.

59
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,735
Let's call off the divorce.

60
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,237
I'll give her her share.

61
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,034
Wouldn't you say
my attorneys are very competent?

62
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,870
Yes, I think they're excellent.

63
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,207
My divorce suit is about to end

64
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,210
before they get to show off their skills.

65
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,463
Is that so?

66
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,591
Maybe this is for the best.

67
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,344
This old couple's divorce suit
was just a warm-up.

68
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,766
They will now be focusing solely

69
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,351
on keeping my grandson.

70
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,978
And you're…

71
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,814
going to lose.

72
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,612
I'll talk to your attorneys

73
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:07,116
regarding the settlement
between you and Ms. Ma.

74
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,993
And…

75
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,496
as for the lawsuit over my nephew…

76
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm going to win.

77
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,720
You sure are an artist.

78
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,930
How naive.

79
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,895
You really won't tell me?

80
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,152
I need to know what you talked about
with Uncle Sung-han.

81
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,613
Gi-yeong.

82
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,325
This is your home, and I'm your parent.

83
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,786
Why do you keep going back to your uncle?

84
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,233
Right.

85
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,444
Can I tell you something?

86
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,112
What?

87
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,072
About going back on the radio.

88
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,117
I still can't make up my mind.

89
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,161
Why not?

90
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,538
I don't think this is the right time.

91
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,415
How so?

92
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,712
You know how Attorney Shin helped us
when we were having a hard time?

93
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,381
And he even let me work for him.

94
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,426
That's why we can live safely right now.

95
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,471
It's a bit complicated,
but that's how it is.

96
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,723
And the thing is,

97
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,019
Attorney Shin is going through
a hard time right now.

98
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,770
Why?

99
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,440
Just like I wanted to live with you,

100
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,902
he wants to live with his nephew.

101
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,071
But apparently,
it's very hard to make that happen.

102
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,035
I think it's time for me
to return the favor.

103
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,372
I support you
whether you're a streamer or a radio DJ.

104
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,083
Just…

105
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,087
don't let the haters get you down.

106
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,173
That's my request.

107
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
NOTARIAL DEED

108
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,975
Go find a place for your café.

109
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,274
Goodness, how can I ever thank you?

110
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,694
PAYMENT AGREEMENT

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,156
Now that I got you a café like you wanted,

112
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,450
we have nothing to do with each other.

113
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,287
I got my severance pay,
so I'd be happy to back off.

114
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,294
PETITION TO TERMINATE PARENTAL RIGHTS

115
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,549
This is the nonsense
Shin Sung-han is up to.

116
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,344
He filed for the termination
of parental rights.

117
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,432
If you try to do something stupid,

118
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,393
we'll go down together.

119
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,562
I'm not going down alone.

120
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,902
I heard Park Yu-seok is
looking for a spot for his café.

121
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,279
He didn't come to you?

122
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,864
Not after I doused him
with all the cockroach spray.

123
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,158
He was just testing the water that day.

124
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,868
Why the heck would he feel me out?

125
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,953
Not you.

126
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,414
Like I said, it was a show
to feel out Jin Yeong-ju.

127
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,543
So like, "You better shut my mouth
before I do something"?

128
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,672
That jerk will never change.

129
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,468
So Mr. Jung said he'll testify.

130
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,554
What about Ms. Ma?

131
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,556
She can't testify.

132
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,391
See?

133
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,144
She's a mother after all.

134
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,813
Of course she'd put her son
before her grandson.

135
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,403
Termination of parental rights?

136
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,573
That's too harsh.
Why would you take it that far?

137
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,992
Here's the thing.

138
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,580
I don't really remember…

139
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,416
my mother's cooking.

140
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,961
I just remember that it was delicious.

141
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,422
But what I do remember is…

142
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,843
how she held me in her arms, supported me,

143
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,472
and scolded me at times.

144
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,309
That's what I remember.

145
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,978
Do you think…

146
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:52,026
one could live a good life
from nourishment alone?

147
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,866
I'm…

148
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,620
taking a step back from this lawsuit.

149
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,873
Do you understand?

150
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,418
Yes, I do.

151
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,882
Let's look into this café
he's getting from Jin Yeong-ju.

152
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,512
If we can prove
that Seo Jeong-guk and Jin Yeong-ju

153
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,806
broke any laws during Ju-hwa's divorce,

154
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,600
-we definitely have a chance.
-Right.

155
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,145
Imagine if Gi-yeong grew up
and found out about it.

156
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,189
How will he live with them?

157
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,984
I'll look into the average
severance pay at Keumhwa.

158
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,904
A café is an unusual severance pay.

159
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
You're back.

160
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,793
Why are you still here?

161
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm just…

162
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,338
a bit lost.

163
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,008
Child support suits are tough,
aren't they?

164
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,802
Yes.

165
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,805
I think Jun-hui's mom already knows

166
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,225
that it's hard and time-consuming
to get a court order for child support.

167
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,188
Did you say
her grandmother is filing the suit?

168
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,231
Yes.

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,984
That might be why it's taking so long.

170
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,404
How could the law be so ineffective?

171
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,948
That's how the law is.

172
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,535
At times, it sides
with the worst of our kind.

173
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,080
The woman took her mother-in-law's recipe
and started a franchise.

174
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,665
She's raking in money.

175
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,751
But she says she has no income
because it's all her husband's, man.

176
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,628
I'm not your "man."

177
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,464
Sorry, sir.

178
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,260
Why don't you try looking at it
from a different perspective?

179
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,471
What do you mean?

180
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,847
The recipe…

181
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,183
The grandma's recipe…

182
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,934
At this point,

183
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,896
I'm on the verge of holding a protest
in front of Corn Sujebi,

184
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,398
saying, "Everything made
by these jerks is poison!"

185
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,359
-That could work.
-What?

186
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,028
The recipe wasn't patented,

187
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,238
so we can't prove
that the grandma invented it.

188
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,032
What should we do then?

189
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,535
We leave it up to customers' sentiments.

190
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,539
Corn sujebi isn't exactly common.

191
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,083
She took the recipe

192
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,836
from her mother-in-law's restaurant

193
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,215
that she used to help run
alongside her late husband.

194
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,675
And now she's neglecting her child,

195
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,761
using the recipe to…

196
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,262
You scared me.

197
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,223
Find out what she's most desperate for

198
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,434
and put a leash

199
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,228
around its neck.

200
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,565
A leash.

201
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,110
Something she's most desperate for.

202
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,329
I wish you had discussed this
with me first.

203
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,166
Why did you make
such a big deal out of this?

204
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,505
We both got to save our faces
thanks to that clever attorney.

205
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,675
We should eat together more often

206
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,802
and go on trips too.

207
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,972
Let's just live as we always have.
That's easier.

208
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,433
Will you go back to Hawaii?

209
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,646
Gi-yeong is lucky.

210
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,314
His grandmother has his back.

211
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,525
It must be reassuring.

212
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,027
Just eat your food.

213
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:28,409
I know you have a soft spot for him
because he's Ju-hwa's son.

214
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,161
I was just worried about Yeong-ju.

215
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,580
Anyhow,

216
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:37,001
I think it's a good idea
to secure Gi-yeong's share.

217
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,211
However,

218
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,257
he can't live with his uncle.

219
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,183
Do you want his uncle to take
everything that belongs to the boy?

220
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,894
Is that what you think?

221
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,604
You never know.

222
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,564
Isn't Yeong-ju brazen?

223
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,441
It's all because of money.

224
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,610
Shin Sung-han is no different.

225
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,528
In the end,

226
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,947
it's all about money.

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,411
Remember how you said

228
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,249
you'd set aside money for Gi-yeong
once you get your share?

229
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,461
I don't think you should give it to him.

230
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,046
Honey.

231
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,009
You do know it's all thanks
to Ju-hwa's brother

232
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,262
that we got to save face
and patch things up, right?

233
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,388
Yes.

234
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,142
He agreed to meet and negotiate with you

235
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,061
on one condition.

236
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
And that condition was

237
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,151
to not give my share to Gi-yeong.

238
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,656
He said he'd put Gi-yeong through college

239
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,075
and marry him off with his own assets.

240
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789
You say it's all about money in the end,

241
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,959
but that only applies
to those who are foolish.

242
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,337
There are those who live life
by different standards.

243
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,092
Are you different?

244
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,594
I just became different.

245
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,888
Yes.

246
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,642
I considered divorcing you
out of my concern for Gi-yeong.

247
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,104
I didn't see a point in it otherwise.

248
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,481
Not at my age
and after holding out for so long.

249
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,483
But now,

250
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,360
I have to divorce you.

251
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,073
I can't live with Seo Chang-jin anymore.

252
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,243
Let's pick up where we left off.

253
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,870
Let's get divorced.

254
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,556
Ms. Yang!

255
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,224
Ms. Yang!

256
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,976
-Here.
-Thank you.

257
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,354
Let's see.

258
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,606
And…

259
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,943
No, that's not it.

260
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,864
There's got to be something.

261
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,782
Where is it?

262
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,245
What is this?

263
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,914
-Happy birthday to you
-I can't do it like you.

264
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,957
What's going on?

265
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,419
Happy birthday to you

266
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,505
Happy birthday, dear Mommy

267
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,675
Happy birthday to you

268
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,968
Thank you!

269
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,512
-Did you prepare this, Jun-hui?
-Good girl.

270
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,809
-Thank you!
-What a good girl!

271
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
Ma'am, may I take just one photo?

272
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,521
-Just this one.
-Okay.

273
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:49,026
CORN SUJEBI

274
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,282
The original place is much better.

275
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,369
Man, that ruined my appetite.

276
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,797
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-I guess.

277
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,050
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,552
But there's no "original place"
for Corn Sujebi.

279
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,887
We came up with the recipe.

280
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,639
Really?

281
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,974
That's not what Jun-hui said.

282
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,020
Who are you?

283
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,189
I'm…

284
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,024
Ms. Yang Bok-sun's attorney.

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,946
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE
ATTORNEY CHOI JUN

286
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,155
Mr. Choi.

287
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,368
I honestly feel really bad for my husband.

288
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,787
Don't you feel bad for Jun-hui?

289
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,455
Of course I do.

290
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,915
But what can I do?

291
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,711
My husband and I
agreed not to have children.

292
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,549
So how could I ask him
to support my child?

293
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,717
With all due respect,

294
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,637
when you decide to have a child,
aren't you supposed to

295
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,140
raise and protect them as best as you can?

296
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,267
That's just a stereotype!

297
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,977
Not all parents feel that way!

298
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,271
Do as you wish.
Let's settle this in court.

299
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,607
Child support suits…

300
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,526
Yes, they do take a while.

301
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,695
Meanwhile, the kid grows up.

302
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,489
It's a shame
because the kid needs support now.

303
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,200
But I'm not going to stop.

304
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,911
Once the court order is out,
you'll have to pay

305
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,038
all the overdue payments at once.

306
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,166
I get what you're saying.

307
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,001
But I feel a bit uncomfortable.

308
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,043
You two can talk.

309
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,046
No, please stay with us.

310
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,840
You both need to hear the next part.

311
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,678
The recipe for making
the dough and soup for corn sujebi.

312
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
It belongs to Ms. Yang.

313
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,391
What kind of nonsense is this?
Are you insane?

314
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,727
How dare you barge in
and interrupt my business?

315
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,146
Your wife's ex-mother-in-law
runs Forsythia Sujebi.

316
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,315
It used to be run by her late husband.

317
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,276
Would it be weird for a chef
of a Chinese restaurant

318
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,361
to start his own jjajangmyeon place?

319
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,448
Come on, that's different.

320
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,950
We're not talking about
such a common dish.

321
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,077
You dry corn,

322
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,998
grind it, and mix it with flour
in the golden ratio of 6.5 to 3.5.

323
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,083
It's all about the ratio.

324
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,128
He came up with the recipe!

325
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,379
I did.

326
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,965
Mr. Jo Yeon-cheol.

327
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,760
You used to supply the corn flour, right?

328
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,056
This was a local dish
from Ms. Yang's hometown.

329
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:28,227
How did you come to know about it
when you're from Seoul?

330
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,357
I used to travel there often.

331
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,359
Is that so? Where exactly?

332
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,610
Where?

333
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,154
Cheongyang!

334
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,198
Is it a crime to travel to Cheongyang?

335
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,492
That's right, Cheongyang!

336
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,162
Like husband, like wife.

337
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,959
I'm going to file a suit
for the ownership of the recipe first.

338
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
And I'll also be…

339
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
using this.

340
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,216
I'll be sending her this story.

341
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,842
Hey.

342
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,428
I don't care if you're a lawyer.
You can't blackmail me!

343
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,723
I have evidence.

344
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,393
I got a picture for my protest picket.

345
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,186
Protest? What protest?

346
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,605
I'm going to hold
a one-man protest out front.

347
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,648
Have a look.

348
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,908
The people of Korea

349
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,288
happen to be warmhearted
and emotionally intelligent.

350
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,959
Will they bombard
all your restaurants with compliments

351
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,129
or with criticism?

352
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,423
Let's see how they'll respond.

353
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,605
Gi-yeong.

354
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,858
Uncle Sung-han!

355
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,735
Did you eat dinner?

356
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,278
-Yes.
-I see.

357
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,155
Are you coming back from your academy?

358
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,866
Have you been exercising regularly?

359
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,200
-Yes.
-I see.

360
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,077
Gi-yeong has to head inside.

361
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,746
He's my client.

362
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,540
Please tell them
that he's seeing his attorney.

363
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,714
Gi-yeong.

364
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,675
There's something I need to tell you.

365
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,345
When you grow up,

366
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,849
you'll be extremely rich.

367
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,770
If you stay here, that is.

368
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,147
But you know,

369
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,734
your grandfather…

370
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,863
He left me and your mom a small building.

371
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,616
I did some calculations,

372
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,868
and I think I have enough

373
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,412
to put you through school

374
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,124
and marry you off when you grow up.

375
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,087
If we run out of money,
I can always give piano lessons.

376
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,465
Is that what you needed to tell me?

377
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
Are you okay with…

378
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,389
not being as rich as you are now?

379
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,184
I think I'm rich now,

380
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,522
but I don't feel good.

381
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,440
I don't

382
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,859
feel happy.

383
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,779
We can't have you not feeling good.

384
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,450
So let's make you feel better

385
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,120
and live happily, okay?

386
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:47,008
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

387
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,465
You can go now.

388
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,593
It's a closed trial.

389
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,095
I'll be in the hallway.

390
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,265
I'll be quiet.

391
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,405
You have asked to terminate
Mr. Seo Gi-yeong's parents' rights

392
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,075
and appoint Shin Sung-han as his guardian.

393
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,952
-Is that correct?
-Yes, Your Honor.

394
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,580
And you are his uncle, correct?

395
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,540
-Yes.
-Could you tell us why

396
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,460
you're asking to terminate
his father's parental rights?

397
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,086
Yes.

398
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,468
Three years old.

399
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,138
It is a crucial age for children
to form a bond with their parents.

400
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,475
And it was at that age that Gi-yeong was

401
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,019
suddenly separated
from his biological mother.

402
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,898
He also had to deal with a stranger
living in his mother's room

403
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,484
and the birth of his stepsister.

404
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,445
Gi-yeong had no choice

405
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,365
but to accept this confusing situation.

406
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,953
However, from then until now,
when he's turned 11,

407
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:42,082
neither of his parents
noticed his depression.

408
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,708
As a result,

409
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,755
he is currently suffering
from severe child depression.

410
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,926
Please refer to the psychiatric diagnosis
for the petitioner that I have submitted.

411
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,427
Your Honor.

412
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,139
This diagnosis was issued
in the presence of his uncle.

413
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,141
It can't be seen as objective.

414
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,185
I'll be questioning the witness.

415
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,272
Gi-yeong often had binge episodes,

416
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,524
after which threw up everything he ate.

417
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,110
On my last day of work,

418
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,654
Gi-yeong suddenly disappeared

419
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,156
while I was briefing the new driver.

420
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,743
I later found out that
he went to see his uncle.

421
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,830
Witness.

422
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,000
Did you inform Gi-yeong's parents

423
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,168
of his unstable condition?

424
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,169
Yes.

425
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713
I informed his stepmother.

426
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,672
And?

427
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,757
She told me
not to treat him like a patient

428
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,635
and just do my job as his driver.

429
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,638
And then a week later, I was fired.

430
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,726
How old was the petitioner

431
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,021
when you started working with him?

432
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,981
I've been there since he was born.

433
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,233
I see.

434
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,403
Throughout his life,

435
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,032
the petitioner has spent more time
with Mr. Jung than with his own father.

436
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,452
So how would he have felt
when Mr. Jung was suddenly dismissed?

437
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,496
He was not only separated
from his birth mother

438
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,124
but also banned from seeing
her only family, his uncle.

439
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,502
The petitioner, this 11-year-old child,

440
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,173
became helpless, depressed, and distressed

441
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,884
when he was faced with such losses.

442
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,722
This was caused by indifference
and bad decisions of his parents.

443
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,435
You must have been
upset about being fired.

444
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,436
No.

445
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,064
I was just worried about Gi-yeong.

446
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,024
I'd been in need of rest,

447
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,901
so I wasn't so upset.

448
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,069
Is that so?

449
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:39,199
You were fired after working
with Gi-yeong for a decade.

450
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,325
Didn't you feel wronged?

451
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,993
No.

452
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,162
You have great character.

453
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,042
You're not giving a biased testimony
out of spite, are you?

454
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:49,959
Your Honor.

455
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,253
That was a rude leading question.

456
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,380
Sustained.

457
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,132
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

458
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,313
Please tell us about the day
when the petitioner disappeared.

459
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,650
Gi-yeong seemed to feel awkward with me.

460
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,027
I thought it was natural.

461
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,656
At the end of that day,

462
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,409
he told me he wanted to go see his uncle.

463
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,202
Do you mean

464
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,247
he went to see his uncle
with your permission?

465
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,998
Yes.

466
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,710
I informed Ms. Jin of it as well.

467
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,880
Is it true that someone
tailed you for three days

468
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,092
while you were driving Gi-yeong around?

469
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,094
Yes, I was…

470
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,929
quite frightened.

471
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,681
So I called the police.

472
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,433
Who had been tailing you?

473
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,686
A friend of his uncle.

474
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,190
So how did that end?

475
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,693
Ms. Jin showed him mercy,

476
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,445
so there was no more conflict.

477
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,447
That is all.

478
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,660
I'd like to give you
a little welcome gift.

479
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,999
If I'm going to give you a gift,

480
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,251
I want it to be a car you want.

481
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,088
-I…
-It's just a gift.

482
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,924
Please think of us as your family.

483
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,718
Witness.

484
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,346
You said the last place
you saw Gi-yeong that day

485
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,768
was his science academy, correct?

486
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,353
-Yes.
-Do you mean

487
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,357
he shared his destination with you

488
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,901
before leaving?

489
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,943
Yes.

490
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,867
LOBBY

491
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,292
Then please explain this.

492
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,095
If he shared his destination with you,

493
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,057
why did you rush into his classroom?

494
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,725
And look.

495
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,109
Why did Gi-yeong

496
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,071
hide his backpack in the classroom?

497
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,540
Does that look like a child
who's leaving with permission?

498
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:34,958
I'm not sure.

499
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,002
It was my first day,
so I wasn't familiar with his character--

500
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,005
Yet you chose to testify.

501
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,300
All right.

502
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,934
Gi-yeong doesn't eat much.

503
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,103
He refuses to eat
any food that he dislikes.

504
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,105
But if he likes the food,

505
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,315
he eats so much of it that it worries me.

506
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,568
That's why we keep
digestive medicine at home.

507
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,611
Thank you.

508
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,989
Your Honor.

509
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,617
It's a one-sided argument
that he binges due to stress.

510
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,121
Picky eating and gluttony
does not equal binge eating.

511
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,550
Witness.

512
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:31,389
What kind of food does Gi-yeong dislike?

513
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,976
He doesn't like namul
or any kind of soup or stew.

514
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,187
He doesn't like Korean food very much.

515
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,232
But most elementary schoolers

516
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,359
don't like namul, soups,
or stews, do they?

517
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,279
-Sorry?
-In that case,

518
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,409
what kind of dishes does he eat
so excessively that it worries you?

519
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,912
Mostly junk food.

520
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,081
Things like ham, sausages,
and instant food.

521
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,459
He eats a lot of ramyeon too.

522
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,585
Ramyeon?

523
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,255
Does he eat so much
that he needs digestive medicine?

524
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,592
He eats two servings
with some rice on the side.

525
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,844
That's not too bad, is it?

526
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,138
Here's what binge eating looks like.

527
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,642
A boy in fourth grade

528
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,645
who prefers two servings
of ramyeon to namul.

529
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,397
That's normal.

530
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,648
Literally speaking,

531
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,900
it's perfectly normal.

532
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,709
Come on.

533
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,845
You insisted on not coming,

534
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,638
but you couldn't disobey the judge.

535
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,306
Tell me about it.

536
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,518
Why drag me into this family feud?

537
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,395
This is your last chance.

538
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,105
Try to live decently.

539
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,607
I decide how I live.

540
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,444
Move.

541
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,414
You may start questioning.

542
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,921
Witness.

543
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,550
You used to be the attorney
for Mr. Seo's ex-wife,

544
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,762
Ms. Shin Ju-hwa, correct?

545
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,597
Yes.

546
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,683
The factor that affected
their divorce and custody suits

547
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,144
more than anything was

548
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,813
Shin Ju-hwa's psychiatric records.

549
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,149
-Do you remember this?
-Yes, I do.

550
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,692
However, the records had been

551
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,322
unknown to not only her husband
but also her parents and siblings.

552
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,866
They were from
when she was studying in the US.

553
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,245
Were you aware of her medical history?

554
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,580
No.

555
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,125
Had I known, I would have hidden them.

556
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,294
I was her divorce attorney.

557
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,171
I see.

558
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,632
Witness.

559
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,343
While Ms. Shin Ju-hwa was

560
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,596
preparing for her custody suit,

561
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,308
you were made a partner at Keumhwa,
who was defending her husband.

562
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,226
Is this true?

563
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,395
I received an offer.

564
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,940
So one of the top law firms in Korea

565
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,483
offered a job to an attorney

566
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,902
who had just lost a case
and specialized in family law?

567
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,530
I guess they saw something in me.

568
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,991
Did you know the respondent,
Seo Jeong-guk,

569
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,369
even before his divorce suit?

570
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,662
No.

571
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,830
Isn't that strange?

572
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,499
Sure, they might have
seen something in you,

573
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,085
but the timing is just too suspicious.

574
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,677
Are you failing to remain objective
since this concerns your sister?

575
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,054
Is it so strange that I got a job

576
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,849
at a company
I became acquainted with in court?

577
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,891
No.

578
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,395
I wouldn't say it's strange,
but it's suspicious.

579
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,859
Witness, you recently resigned
from Keumhwa Law Firm.

580
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,443
And as your severance pay,

581
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,572
you received a branch of a café franchise.

582
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,157
Yes.

583
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,783
Why was that?

584
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,953
What reason do I need
to get my severance pay?

585
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,580
Well, from what I found out,

586
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,168
the average severance pay
for Keumhwa attorneys

587
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,881
is far less than the value
of the café that you received.

588
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,632
What's more suspicious is

589
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,303
that you worked on much fewer cases

590
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,222
and had a far lower winning rate
than your colleagues.

591
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,849
So why the huge severance pay?

592
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,560
It just doesn't make sense.

593
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,357
Maybe that's why I got the café.

594
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,985
I wasn't as good as
they thought I would be,

595
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,821
yet I was getting paid every month.

596
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,157
And I didn't seem to be leaving
anytime soon.

597
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,577
"Let's give him a huge severance pay
and kick him out."

598
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,204
I guess that was it.

599
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,455
Is that so?

600
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:54,003
However, about that café
you received as your severance pay…

601
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,090
It has nothing to do
with the CEO of Keumhwa.

602
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,761
It was offered by the respondent,
Mr. Seo Jeong-guk.

603
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,681
Among the 450 branches that he owns,

604
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,433
you got the Gangnam branch.

605
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,977
Don't you think
that needs to be explained?

606
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,604
-Your Honor.
-I'll hear him.

607
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,233
Attorney Shin Sung-han.

608
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,237
You're an attorney yourself,
so stop playing dumb.

609
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,989
Witness, show some respect.

610
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,450
I mean, it's just so frustrating.

611
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,246
Don't you know Daenam is
one of Keumhwa's key clients?

612
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,250
Then what do you think about
Daenam's daughter-in-law

613
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,335
landing a PR director position at Keumhwa?

614
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,255
Everyone in this field knows about this.

615
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,048
Your Honor, there is no connection

616
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,051
between the witness
and Gi-yeong's custody.

617
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,637
Wrong. You think there's no connection?

618
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,265
He was the attorney
for his biological mother.

619
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,685
As soon as the divorce was finalized
and she lost her son's custody,

620
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,272
Attorney Park Yu-seok,
her divorce attorney,

621
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,108
was recruited by a big law firm
through her ex-husband's connections.

622
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,318
Does this sound natural to you?

623
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,114
Witness.

624
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,284
Witness.

625
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,288
I'm sure you already know
that perjury is a serious crime.

626
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,415
Let me ask you again.

627
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,583
Witness.

628
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:19,088
You were aware of Shin Ju-hwa's
psychiatric records from the US.

629
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,386
The biggest factor
in her losing the custody suit.

630
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,597
Weren't you?

631
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,950
I wasn't.

632
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,073
Attorney Shin.

633
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,616
You majored in classical music, correct?

634
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,660
Yes, that's correct.

635
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,164
I don't know much about classical music,

636
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,542
but I wanted to find a way
to get this tragic situation across.

637
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,087
So I looked up some examples.

638
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,299
Are you talking
about Beethoven and his nephew?

639
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,843
There you go.

640
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,262
He also fought for his custody.

641
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,139
Yes, and he won.

642
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,017
His nephew was not living
in a healthy environment.

643
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,645
That's one interpretation.

644
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,858
What I want to ask you is

645
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,028
if Beethoven and his nephew
lived a good life afterward.

646
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,155
What happened to them?

647
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,741
The nephew became a delinquent teenager,

648
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,701
repeatedly dropped out of school,

649
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,497
then attempted suicide
by shooting himself in the head.

650
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,666
You're focusing solely on the outcome.

651
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,336
I can't agree with such a generalization

652
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,131
based on a single person
from 200 years ago.

653
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,758
Yet the music from 200 years ago
still moves our hearts.

654
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,637
And that single person happens to be
a great classical musician.

655
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,434
You're a pianist yourself, right?

656
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,979
I think you have a lot in common with him.

657
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,274
What makes you so confident

658
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,194
that you can raise the child
better than his own father?

659
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,534
That is all.

660
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,632
A custody investigator will be sent
to the home of the petitioner.

661
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,844
His living environment
will be thoroughly inspected

662
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,637
and he will be interviewed

663
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,514
before the next trial.

664
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,952
-Hey, are you okay?
-He's obviously not okay.

665
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,287
Look at his face.

666
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,372
You should eat. How about chicken soup?

667
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,249
Guys, I'm sorry.

668
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,044
-I need to see a doctor.
-A doctor?

669
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,421
-Okay.
-Is it that bad?

670
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,722
With all the coffee and the all-nighters,
it's no wonder you got stomach cramps.

671
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,600
It's not that. It was the trial.

672
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,436
It was really tough.

673
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,313
You were outnumbered.

674
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,440
Take Attorney Choi with you next time.

675
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,817
Why can't the paralegal go in?

676
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,112
Stop yelling. You're embarrassing me.

677
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,156
Darn it.

678
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,018
DIVORCE ATTORNEY

679
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,062
Come in.

680
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,981
-Attorney Shin.
-Hey.

681
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,698
I threw an awesome breaking ball.

682
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,367
Really?

683
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,536
I laid out how things would go for them.

684
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,622
Are you sure they weren't lousy batters?

685
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,999
They weren't that easy.

686
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,834
They were willing to go all the way.

687
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
"Suspend our licenses. We'll take cabs."

688
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,755
"We don't have to go abroad."

689
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,590
"Go ahead and put a travel ban on us."

690
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,717
They weren't afraid of going to court.

691
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,097
How could she do this
when her child's life is at stake?

692
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,224
So?

693
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,309
How did you tell them it would go?

694
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,064
My breaking ball was turning it into
a dispute over the recipe.

695
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,276
The court won't be able to determine
who the recipe belongs to,

696
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,570
but once Jun-hui's story got out,

697
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,531
they'd lose customers.

698
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,908
She got scared.

699
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,536
You were right.

700
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,664
I put a leash on something
she was most desperate for,

701
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,582
and she gave in right away.

702
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,586
She'll pay 1.8 million won a month,

703
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,924
and she'll cough up
all the overdue payments.

704
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,343
Good work.

705
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,512
It's all thanks to you, the great--

706
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,222
I don't think so.

707
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,933
-Sorry?
-Well…

708
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,102
It's not just about finding a solution.

709
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:34,022
It's the way you executed that solution
that was impressive.

710
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,820
That's a compliment, right?

711
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,865
I'm wondering why I'm like this.

712
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,367
I'm reflecting on myself.

713
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,540
Right.

714
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,835
Okay.

715
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,983
I hope your café does well.

716
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,902
Sure.

717
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,406
I only just made the down payment.

718
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,910
But thanks anyway.

719
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,954
You won't be a lawyer anymore, right?

720
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,291
You don't want to start a firm,

721
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,460
and no one will hire you.

722
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,505
Is that so?

723
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,216
Testify for him.

724
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,384
You're the one…

725
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,931
who leaked Ju-hwa's medical history.

726
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,349
Please confess.

727
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,228
I looked into the Attorney-at-Law Act.

728
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,647
You'll get suspended
and fined for breaching it.

729
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,113
That will cover the fine.

730
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,620
What are you trying to do?

731
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,705
You can't be a lawyer anyway.

732
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,250
You'll be running a café.

733
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,669
Ju-hwa can't come back to us,
but Gi-yeong…

734
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,465
We've got to do something
to get him out of that place.

735
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,217
Goodness.

736
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,554
Your friendship is one of a kind.

737
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,393
Please, I'm asking you.

738
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,605
Ju-hwa never would have met you
if it hadn't been for me.

739
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,191
I didn't do it.

740
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,195
I don't have anything to confess.

741
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
Hey.

742
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,345
Both of you better call chauffeurs.

743
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,305
You can't sleep over.

744
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,059
I sold my… I mean, I didn't drive.

745
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,477
You're getting another car?

746
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,271
No, I didn't sell it.

747
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,732
Let him be. He loves cars.

748
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,941
Let him live his life.

749
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,402
I'm not buying another car.

750
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,237
Like I said, I'll buy a bicycle.

751
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,822
Like the poet from Il Postino.

752
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,449
Have you even written anything?

753
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,909
Why did you sell it?

754
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,121
Are you in debt?

755
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,372
Jeez.

756
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,083
You messed with crypto, didn't you?

757
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,754
Hey.

758
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,757
-Hey, we aren't in the mood for that.
-Look.

759
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,091
It's the money I got for the car.

760
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,768
Why are you carrying cash?

761
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,102
They didn't wire you the money?

762
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,646
It was for Park Yu-seok.

763
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,276
I was going to pay him.

764
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,933
Should I call a cab?

765
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:39,810
Should I

766
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,770
just get lost?

767
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,908
You know,

768
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,828
I don't know a lot about classical music,

769
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,582
but I did some research to cheer you up.

770
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,835
Rach…

771
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,380
Yes, Rachmaninoff. This guy.

772
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,092
He wrote this piece
after some really rough times.

773
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,344
You know that, right?

774
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,221
This guy…

775
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,057
He was going through hell.

776
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,518
But then he pushed beyond his limits

777
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,981
and put everything he had
into making this piece.

778
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,070
Just like Jeong-sik is giving
this everything he's got.

779
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,742
And I'll give it all I've got to help.

780
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,288
So try to stay strong.

781
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,417
So that

782
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,377
we can go beyond our limits.

783
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,718
You idiot.

784
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,432
Let's cry together.

785
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,486
Sung-han, I'm so sorry.

786
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,875
Damn it.

787
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,940
I'm not giving up on Gi-yeong's custody.

788
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,401
I'm…

789
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,861
I'm his dad.

790
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,655
No parent would give up
their parental rights.

791
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,076
How can you call yourself his dad?

792
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,997
What if you found out

793
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,166
what Jin Yeong-ju said to Ju-hwa
on the phone from Hawaii?

794
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,459
What if

795
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,046
you found out that call was
cruel enough to shake up Ju-hwa,

796
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,132
and that's why

797
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,135
she died in that accident?

798
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,179
Would you be okay with that?

799
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,307
As if…

800
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,810
nothing happened?

801
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,647
I don't even know that driver.

802
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,232
That phone call.

803
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,902
Has it never occurred to you
that I might have overheard it?

804
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,323
You're her brother. Do you know?

805
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,200
Why take things this far?

806
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,995
Because I need to save Gi-yeong.

807
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,497
I'm here doing this as his uncle.

808
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,749
You're supposed to be his dad.

809
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,250
Why do you live with your eyes closed?

810
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,379
You know what?

811
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,467
Even if I lose, I'll keep filing
the same suit over and over again.

812
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,427
I'll let Gi-yeong know he's not alone.

813
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,096
That someone out there
loves him with all his heart!

814
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,473
I'll make sure he knows that.

815
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,392
People laughed at me

816
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,022
when I said I wanted to quit the piano
and become an attorney.

817
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,816
They called me a lunatic.

818
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,444
They thought I had lost it.

819
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,947
But look.

820
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,575
I've already started.

821
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,716
-This is much better.
-Right?

822
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,678
That's why I bother
to go all the way there.

823
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,726
We should give some to those guys
while it's hot.

824
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,814
Hello.

825
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,941
-Hello.
-These are from down the street.

826
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,694
From that old gentleman's stall.

827
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,529
Try some. It's great.

828
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,780
-Thank you.
-For dessert.

829
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,325
-Come by often.
-Sure.

830
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,412
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

831
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,205
He keeps losing cases recently.

832
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,249
I told him to come by often.

833
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,630
I'm closing down the restaurant.

834
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,049
What? For good?

835
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,388
I'll decide if I'll open it again
after taking some time off.

836
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,603
I've always been working,
so I've never been to Europe.

837
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,605
Come to think of it,

838
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,525
I guess I've been there on business trips.

839
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,154
I'm going to go for a couple of months.

840
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,240
Sounds great.

841
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,411
Jeong-sik has been to Spain,

842
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,747
and Sung-han studied in Germany.

843
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,585
I've been too busy
trying to make ends meet as well.

844
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:40,879
Do you want to come?

845
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,464
Me?

846
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,928
You want to travel together
for two months?

847
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,891
Sounds great.

848
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,481
No pressure.

849
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,817
You can't suddenly drop everything
and fly off to Europe.

850
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,778
I was going to go alone anyway.

851
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,741
It's good.

852
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,704
I know you're stressed out.

853
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,165
I'm sorry for barging in.

854
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,542
It's okay. Don't worry.

855
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,586
It's my responsibility.

856
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,422
Attorney Shin.

857
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,299
Yes?

858
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,968
Thank you for winning
Seo-jin's custody suit

859
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,638
and giving her a job here

860
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,015
so that she can keep Hyeon-u with her.

861
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,392
I appreciate it.

862
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,858
I don't think you came here to say that.

863
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,486
Well…

864
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,822
I want her…

865
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,326
to come back on the radio.

866
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,873
I heard that things are
very tough for you right now.

867
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,710
Seo-jin said she should
stay and support you.

868
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,714
Director Jang managed
to secure the 4 p.m. slot,

869
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,467
but she says it's not the right time.

870
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,805
I sound so selfish.

871
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,349
No, not at all.

872
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,978
She should definitely make her comeback.

873
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,772
I won't…

874
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,153
I won't be okay until she comes back to…

875
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,574
I set her up with that guy.

876
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,661
She helped me get a job,

877
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,289
but I ended up…

878
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,926
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

879
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,978
To be honest, I'm an awful cook.

880
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,023
But I've been trying out
some recipes I found online.

881
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,442
The food doesn't taste so bad,

882
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,736
but it doesn't look as good.

883
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,365
When I made sweet and sour pork
for the first time,

884
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:18,244
I let my most beloved
family member have a taste.

885
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,498
I was really nervous when I set the table.

886
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,375
I still remember

887
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,128
how much he enjoyed it.

888
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,047
AREYOURLIPSSWEET: YOU SURE LIKE MEN.
ARE YOU TAKING A BREAK?

889
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,591
I'm sure all of you

890
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,135
have made something delicious

891
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,845
-This jerk.
-for someone you love.

892
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,313
IT'S OKAY IF YOU CAN'T COOK.
YOU'RE GOOD AT PUTTING OUT.

893
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,689
I SAW YOUR VIDEO.

894
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,024
I'LL COOK FOR YOU
IF YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

895
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,818
Just don't let the haters get you down.

896
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,488
That's my request.

897
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,497
Dear AreYourLipsSweet.

898
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,959
What a pathetic username.

899
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,877
You need to see this.

900
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,421
So you're a good cook?

901
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,339
What is it?

902
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,174
What are you good at in bed?

903
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,969
I bet you only know how to sleep in it.

904
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,222
Man, that's harsh.

905
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,477
Who'll ever date an asshole like you?

906
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,814
I feel bad for you,
so you'll be getting a coffee coupon.

907
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,692
Instead of writing
these comments with your fingers,

908
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,654
you can shove them up your ass,
AreYourLip-Shit.

909
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,699
Shall we move on to the next story?

910
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:46,124
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

911
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,835
Do you think…

912
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,630
that jerk's fingers are up his ass?

913
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,676
Well, who cares?

914
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,645
I love your streams,

915
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,773
but when I get drowsy around 4 p.m.,

916
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:16,821
I wouldn't mind hearing your voice
on the radio.

917
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,490
Will you let me do that?

918
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,245
Support me from afar.

919
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,999
In your seat, in the radio booth,

920
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,044
being the awesome DJ you are.

921
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,340
That's where you belong.

922
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,981
The traffic should be getting better now.

923
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,776
Shall we?

924
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,364
About tomorrow…

925
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,451
Good luck.

926
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,663
Thanks.

927
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,791
And these stay…

928
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,460
right here.

929
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,860
Please.

930
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,348
IN SESSION

931
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,892
To have one's parental rights terminated,

932
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,229
there must have been authority abuse,
gross misconduct, child abuse,

933
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,023
or another significant reason
for termination.

934
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,736
One of these four reasons
must be apparent in the case.

935
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:24,031
Also, the said reason must
either have harmed or be likely to harm

936
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,784
the well-being of the child.

937
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,579
I want to know this.

938
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,457
Has the parent, Seo Jeong-guk,

939
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,127
ever abused his rights
or committed gross misconduct?

940
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,379
Has he abused his son?

941
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,591
Or is there a significant reason
that he can't maintain his rights?

942
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,094
Has he ever starved him?

943
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,054
Is the child not dressed?

944
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,516
Or is he not receiving
appropriate education?

945
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,396
He's been living with his stepmother
since his parents' divorce.

946
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,815
It is unfortunate indeed.

947
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,067
However, I would like to ask

948
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,989
if his father deserves to lose
his parental rights.

949
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,660
That is all.

950
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,051
Well, last time,

951
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,888
the respondent's counselor
mentioned Beethoven and his music.

952
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:34,644
"The music from 200 years ago
still moves our hearts."

953
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,021
Yes.

954
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:40,107
I couldn't agree with him more.

955
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,737
I'd like to ask how music…

956
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,947
No, not just music.

957
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,450
How paintings, architecture,
and other artistic creations

958
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,869
from 500 or even 1,000 years ago

959
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,580
still touch our hearts.

960
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:56,958
Emotions.

961
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,168
It's thanks to our emotions.

962
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,546
Emotions are

963
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:05,883
what have kept
those works alive to this day.

964
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,427
So what do emotions…

965
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,973
mean for children?

966
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,018
Can their emotions be developed
just from being fed?

967
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,980
Sufficient emotional support,

968
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,942
love, and comfort.

969
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,613
These are the things
that a child should be surrounded by.

970
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:33,995
Is the respondent's family
an emotionally safe place

971
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,831
for Gi-yeong?

972
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,375
Does your family provide

973
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:44,005
enough love and support for Gi-yeong?

974
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,725
Do you have to know?

975
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,146
Yes.

976
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,691
Your relationship with Yeong-ju
may be jeopardized.

977
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,401
Is that why you couldn't tell me?

978
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,445
Because I might leave her?

979
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,698
I'm not sure.

980
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,535
Ju-hwa's brother wanted to know too.

981
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,662
But I didn't tell him.

982
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,875
I thought it would be better
if I kept it from both of you.

983
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,258
I need to know what that call was about.

984
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,512
I need to know for Gi-yeong's sake.

985
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,937
This may sound out of place,

986
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,855
but I once heard

987
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,232
this metaphor for marriage.

988
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,235
Marriage is a union between a sea turtle

989
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,323
and a mountain rabbit
who decide to live together on the beach.

990
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,619
And divorce is when
they begin to miss their homes,

991
01:05:57,244 --> 01:06:01,707
their seas and mountains,
after living together for a while,

992
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:06,921
and decide to part ways.

993
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,425
In that case,
what should be done for the child

994
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,136
born between these two?

995
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:18,933
Shouldn't we at least ask
if he prefers the sea or the mountain?

996
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,019
Shouldn't the child's opinion come first?

997
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:23,980
Please.

998
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,856
Just once.

999
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,276
Please try…

1000
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,321
to think about…

1001
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,366
how the child feels.

1002
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,036
I ask of you.

1003
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,605
Let me bear witness.

1004
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,275
What are you talking about?

1005
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,573
Whatever you say can be used against you.

1006
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,805
Your Honor.

1007
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,392
The petitioner's attorney asked

1008
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,519
to question the respondent.

1009
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,065
The respondent had initially refused,

1010
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:52,943
but he just agreed to be questioned.

1011
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,893
How did you obtain
Ms. Shin Ju-hwa's medical records

1012
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,979
from when she was in the US?

1013
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,317
I visited the hospital in New York
and obtained them myself.

1014
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,904
Was Ms. Shin aware of this?

1015
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:41,283
No, I made sure she didn't know.

1016
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,829
We were still married then,

1017
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,124
so I prepared
the necessary paperwork for it.

1018
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,630
How did you first find out

1019
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,551
about her medical records
and the hospital?

1020
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,511
I was informed

1021
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,807
by Ju-hwa's attorney, Park Yu-seok.

1022
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,899
I see.

1023
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,406
What if Gi-yeong

1024
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,784
found out about this one day?

1025
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,832
That his father did something like that…

1026
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,836
to take his custody
from his biological mother.

1027
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,339
Could you really say
the respondent's family

1028
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,260
is a suitable environment…

1029
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,264
for the petitioner to…

1030
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,643
For Gi-yeong to grow up in?

1031
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,285
That is all.

1032
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:38,859
Decision.

1033
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:45,491
The respondent's parental rights
over the petitioner shall be limited.

1034
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,163
Among his parental rights
over the petitioner,

1035
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,793
the rights to protect, educate,
designate residence, and discipline,

1036
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:00,047
along with other rights
regarding his custody, shall be limited.

1037
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:05,594
Regarding the rights to protect, educate,
designate residence, and discipline,

1038
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,180
along with other rights
regarding his custody,

1039
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,684
the court appoints Shin Sung-han
as the petitioner's guardian.

1040
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,769
As his guardian,

1041
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,272
Shin Sung-han has duties as follows.

1042
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,190
First,

1043
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,402
submit a guardian's report
at the end of every year.

1044
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:22,444
Second,

1045
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:27,157
cooperate actively to facilitate
the visitation of the respondent

1046
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,451
with the petitioner.

1047
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:33,247
However, the visitation will be…

1048
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,160
Jang Guk-yeong,
why won't you eat these days?

1049
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,619
You're not pooping well either.

1050
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,580
Come here.

1051
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,875
Lunchtime?

1052
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:19,960
Come on.

1053
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:22,796
So…

1054
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,007
About your trip to Europe.

1055
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,093
Have you booked the tickets?

1056
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,511
Yes.

1057
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,060
I'm coming with you.

1058
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,272
Hold on.

1059
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,153
Really?

1060
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,016
Seo Gi-yeong!

1061
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,393
Wake up.

1062
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,311
Seo Gi-yeong, wake up.

1063
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,439
Seo Gi-yeong, wake up.

1064
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,066
Seo Gi-yeong.

1065
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,317
Gi-yeong.

1066
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,360
Wake up.

1067
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,570
Time to get up, Gi-yeong.

1068
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,365
Rise and shine.

1069
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,908
Here we go.

1070
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,537
You'll be late for school.

1071
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,454
Come on.

1072
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,207
Get up.

1073
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,584
Come out.

1074
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,254
Gi-yeong.

1075
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,588
Hurry up.

1076
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,048
Good boy.

1077
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,468
Did you get the sandwich?

1078
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,220
Of course.

1079
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,848
Look.

1080
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,852
Ham, cheese, eggs,

1081
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,104
no tomatoes, no onions…

1082
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:05,941
Must this old uncle of yours
go out at the break of dawn…

1083
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,944
Do you know what "break of dawn" means?

1084
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,654
I feel like I don't need to know.

1085
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:13,365
Is that how you feel?

1086
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,450
Uncle Sung-han.

1087
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,119
When does your intermittent fasting end?

1088
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,662
Why?

1089
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:20,247
I always eat breakfast alone.

1090
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,915
Then give me a bite.

1091
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:29,882
Look at you go.

1092
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,467
-Is it good?
-Yes.

1093
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:34,595
Mr. Jang.

1094
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,139
I'm so jealous.

1095
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,601
Please be more jealous.

1096
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,936
It's my first trip to Europe.

1097
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,733
I envy Ms. Kim.

1098
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:53,071
I guess it'll be just you and me
for a while, Ms. Yu.

1099
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:56,283
Why don't we go for dinner
in the spirit of teamwork?

1100
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,244
No, I have plans with my dog tonight.

1101
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,121
Okay.

1102
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,957
Mr. Jang, eat with me before you leave.

1103
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:09,254
Is Gi-yeong doing well?

1104
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,757
Yes, thanks to you.

1105
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,009
That's good to hear.

1106
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,223
So…

1107
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,308
You're saying

1108
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,102
you have to get divorced, correct?

1109
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:26,939
You see,

1110
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,608
this crown of mine is so heavy

1111
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:33,612
that my discs are about to slip.

1112
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,782
So please hurry it up.

1113
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,495
-Goodness.
-This crown is way too heavy.

1114
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,038
Yes, ma'am.

1115
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,250
We're all ready, aren't we?

1116
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,043
Of course.

1117
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,143
Honey.

1118
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:18,740
I think it's time…

1119
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:23,036
we started talking to each other.

1120
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:30,919
During the trial,

1121
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,672
I suggested that if I testified,

1122
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,383
my parental rights should be limited.

1123
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,804
If my rights had been terminated,
you would've been happier.

1124
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,017
It means Gi-yeong would be
gone forever from Daenam.

1125
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:52,316
Let's live with the consequences
of our wrongdoings

1126
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,444
as Ha-yul's mom and dad.

1127
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,487
Let's just live quietly.

1128
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:18,967
ATTORNEY PARK YU-SEOK

1129
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,511
DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

1130
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,848
The number you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.

1131
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:27,809
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep.

1132
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:31,146
You have to keep your end of the bargain.

1133
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,191
The number you are trying to reach…

1134
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:35,776
Why won't you pick up?

1135
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:37,611
A charge will be incurred after the beep.

1136
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,154
Jin Yeong-ju!

1137
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,406
You little…

1138
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,324
The number you are…

1139
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,367
You…

1140
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,535
Damn you!

1141
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:47,954
Damn it!

1142
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,123
Damn it!

1143
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,460
Give me my café, damn it!

1144
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:56,421
Give me my café!

1145
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,174
Give me my café!

1146
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,552
"Everyone has that one annoying friend."

1147
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,389
"Do you have a friend like that too?"

1148
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,517
"If you do, please tell me
what I should do with them."

1149
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,104
There's always that one friend.

1150
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,855
They're annoying.

1151
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:18,318
I used to just let it go
when something like this happened.

1152
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,987
But these days,
I choose not to meet that friend.

1153
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,073
Why don't you make new friends?

1154
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,327
They say it's hard to make
good friends when you get older…

1155
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,707
but I think that depends on the person.

1156
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,047
YOU WERE ALWAYS MY FRIEND…
YOUR VOICE IS SO SOOTHING.

1157
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,716
I WAITED FOR SO LONG.
FORGET ABOUT THE HATERS.

1158
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,426
SAE-BOM: YOU'RE THE BEST! I LOVE YOU.

1159
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,275
I'll be back after
our producer's favorite part.

1160
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,818
The commercials.

1161
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,498
-Hey.
-Where are you?

1162
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:39,000
-Why?
-Where are you? I'm bored!

1163
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:42,087
Why do I have to tell you where I am?

1164
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,714
Because your friend is asking!

1165
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,259
What do you mean, why?

1166
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,010
-Hey, Jeong-sik.
-Yes?

1167
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,097
-Want to know something cool?
-What?

1168
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,516
-It's about wine.
-Okay.

1169
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,103
You can decant it with a paper cup.

1170
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,771
I knew it! You're drinking!

1171
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,940
Where are you? I'll be there!

1172
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,066
I want to go!

1173
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:04,150
Paper cup?

1174
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,528
You're at a convenience store!
Stay right there, you--

1175
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,341
When's your flight?
You start in Switzerland, right?

1176
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,719
Tomorrow morning.

1177
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,471
And you're out here drinking?

1178
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,181
Yes.

1179
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,308
Good grief.

1180
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,935
Hey, don't go. How dare you?

1181
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,813
You can stay here and drink wine with us.

1182
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:42,731
What?

1183
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:44,399
Guys.

1184
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,236
The three of us need to get divorced too.

1185
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,071
Otherwise, we'll all be screwed.

1186
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:53,408
I love you.

1187
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,411
I think

1188
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,079
I do too.

1189
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,084
You're drunk.

1190
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:06,171
Come on.

1191
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,089
Sung-han.

1192
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,968
I can't drink this anymore. Time for soju.

1193
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,219
-Are you in?
-I'm in.

1194
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,888
Damn it, I'm leaving…

1195
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,140
-I'm in.
-"I'm in."

1196
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:20,226
Try that again. That was weird.

1197
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,020
What is this? "I'm in!"

1198
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,355
Use your finger.

1199
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,440
Thank you.

1200
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:31,613
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

1201
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:07,500
