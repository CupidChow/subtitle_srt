DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,017
EPISODE 11

3
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,688
So about Hawaii…

4
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,732
I heard you recommended
that she move there.

5
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,360
You told her you'd visit often
with Jeong-guk.

6
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,071
But guess who's here right now?

7
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,740
It's me and my daughter.

8
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,409
Why do you think that is?

9
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,999
Because I put my mind to it.

10
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,835
And this is what happens when I do.

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,670
Do you understand?

12
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,547
Ms. Shin.

13
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,382
Know your place.

14
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,343
It's in your best interest.

15
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,098
If I put my mind to kicking your son out,

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,309
where do you think he'll end up?

17
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,980
Why would you do this?

18
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,943
I don't need Daenam Electronics' money.

19
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
I just need Gi-yeong.

20
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,239
Please send him to me.

21
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,619
He's so young.

22
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,124
-He's much too young.
-Exactly. So please.

23
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,587
Get out of his life before your face
is etched in his brain, okay?

24
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,966
Go live with your brother in Germany
or just drop dead!

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,261
I've had enough, Ms. Shin.

26
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,304
I'm warning you.

27
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,433
And don't bother studying the law.
It won't do you any good.

28
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,187
Unless you want your son to suffer.

29
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,374
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

30
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,005
I didn't want to get in the car
after my science class.

31
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,049
I see.

32
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,636
I get it. Sometimes you just
don't want to do anything.

33
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,639
Uncle Sung-han.

34
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,558
Yes?

35
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,769
Why did my mom pass away?

36
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,316
Right.

37
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,735
She got in an accident.

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,278
A car accident.

39
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,488
Why did she get a divorce?

40
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,532
Well…

41
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,495
You see,

42
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,707
-when grown-ups don't get along--
-Did my stepmom

43
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,542
kick her out?

44
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,004
Gi-yeong.

45
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,174
Who told you that?

46
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,969
The kids at my school.

47
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,603
Can't I come with you to Germany
and study there?

48
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,273
Of course you can.

49
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,067
That'd be great.

50
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,320
Is there nothing you can do

51
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,908
because you're not my parent?

52
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,496
Then how will you protect me?

53
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,717
I will.

54
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,512
Guess what?

55
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,556
That's exactly why I became an attorney.

56
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,892
Although…

57
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,271
I don't know
how I'm going to protect you yet.

58
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,650
But I'll find a way.

59
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,319
So do me a favor.

60
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,780
Let's not…

61
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,741
Let's not think about

62
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,078
giving up or anything.

63
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,252
So can you tell me?

64
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,966
What happened today?

65
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,971
You know…

66
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,599
I feel the most comfortable in the car.

67
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:20,231
Mr. Jung drives me to school

68
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,442
and to my lessons.

69
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,777
It's even better

70
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,779
when there's traffic.

71
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,535
Because Mr. Jung

72
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,080
turns a blind eye to everything.

73
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,917
He says I'm a good boy.

74
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,295
But the thing is,

75
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,630
he'll be leaving soon as well.

76
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,426
I'll be completely alone, Uncle Sung-han.

77
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,970
Why is Mr. Jung leaving?

78
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,181
I have…

79
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,642
no one left on my side.

80
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,773
His violin school
doesn't have enough parking space.

81
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,734
So you can drop Gi-yeong off here,

82
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,862
and use the parking lot
about 100m past the building.

83
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,281
They're really strict
about parking around here.

84
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,619
It sounded like she'll be sending him
to all new classes as well.

85
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,371
I see.

86
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm so sorry.

87
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,770
Why are you sorry?

88
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,897
I thought…

89
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,360
you were doing well.

90
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,824
I thought things were fine with you.

91
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,286
I just made an assumption.

92
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,540
But I was wrong.

93
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,751
That's why I'm sorry.

94
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,050
Look at me.

95
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,137
Gi-yeong.

96
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,268
You need to go home for now.

97
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,813
Do you understand?

98
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,319
I'm going to start looking right now.

99
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,074
For a place where you'll be
more comfortable…

100
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,328
than when you're in traffic.

101
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,290
And for people who'll make you

102
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,292
feel that way.

103
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,337
I'll make sure I find them.

104
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,176
But it might take a while.

105
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,054
I need you to be patient.

106
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,851
I need you to eat well, exercise,

107
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,562
and stay positive.

108
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,274
Can you do that for me?

109
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,916
Hi. Say hi.

110
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,336
Sorry.

111
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,548
I'll drop him off after dinner.

112
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,383
After dinner?

113
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,349
He can eat at home.

114
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,309
No, I'll eat with him.

115
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,895
It's already dinnertime.

116
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,231
All right then.

117
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,908
Where is he?

118
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,951
I'll pick him up right now.

119
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,036
Let him be.

120
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,747
He's just having dinner with his uncle.

121
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,250
Is it normal for him to eat
with his grandmother's divorce attorney?

122
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,670
You can't put it like that.

123
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,255
It's his uncle.

124
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,301
It drives me crazy to see
how much of a pushover you are.

125
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,471
Why is everyone stuck in the past?

126
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,308
You're so good.
Is there anything you can't do?

127
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,021
She's Uncle Hyeong-geun's girlfriend,

128
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,440
and he's helping her cook.

129
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,276
Good looks must run in the family.

130
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,528
You're so handsome.

131
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,280
Sorry, I'll leave you alone.

132
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,618
The ramyeon here is amazing.

133
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,829
You might want to order
two bowls to begin with.

134
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,541
Can I have some rice with it?

135
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm all out.

136
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,045
So-yeon.

137
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,841
-Gi-yeong!
-Welcome.

138
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,842
Gi-yeong!

139
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,844
-Hi, Gi-yeong!
-Just in time.

140
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,138
Go get us some instant rice.

141
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,682
How have you been, Gi-yeong?

142
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,393
He wants some rice with his ramyeon.
Is that so hard?

143
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,312
You want some rice with your ramyeon?

144
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,607
Then I'll go get
some steaming hot rice for you.

145
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,192
Stop baby-talking, will you?

146
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,819
"Stop baby-talking, will you?"

147
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,284
Should I try it?

148
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,036
Hyeong-geun, are you done
chopping the green onions?

149
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,248
So-yeon?

150
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,749
Sorry.

151
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,668
I'm sorry, kid.

152
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,588
-I won't do that again.
-Okay.

153
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,631
That wasn't too bad.

154
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,884
Right, Gi-yeong?

155
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,260
It's not okay?

156
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,888
Please tell her that it's okay.

157
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,264
Say it.

158
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,432
Jeez.

159
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,450
Let's go in.

160
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,485
Sung-han must be heartbroken.

161
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,655
I thought Gi-yeong just came by to say hi.

162
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,241
It seemed like he came by himself.

163
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,743
I hope everything's okay.

164
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,495
Do you think Sung-han went home?

165
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,754
The number you are
trying to reach is currently….

166
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,713
His phone is off.

167
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,508
Hey.

168
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,468
He shouldn't be alone right now.

169
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,553
Let's go.

170
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,277
His car isn't here either.

171
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,529
I don't think he's home yet.

172
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,324
He should be home by now
after dropping Gi-yeong off.

173
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,454
Where the hell is he?

174
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,627
We should know his door code
for emergencies like this.

175
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,677
What the hell?

176
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,305
It's the office door code.

177
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,723
How did you think to try it?

178
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,893
I use the same passcode for my house too.

179
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,020
No way. Hey.

180
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,646
You should break up with So-yeon.

181
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,441
-Why?
-You're meant to be with Sung-han.

182
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,943
Shut your nonsense hole.

183
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,904
I got goosebumps.

184
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,781
You knew what it was, didn't you?

185
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,366
No, I didn't.

186
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,558
Stop it.

187
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,394
We're ordering sandwiches.

188
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,229
You want avocado?

189
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,147
Club?

190
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,565
I want to go to one.

191
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,609
-You lunatics.
-I'll get you ham and egg.

192
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,069
What's your address?

193
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,988
You're getting this, right?

194
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,322
Yes.

195
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,825
I'm not drinking soda with my breakfast.

196
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,743
What do you want then?

197
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,327
-Coffee.
-Coffee.

198
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,504
I'm getting a bicycle.

199
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,924
What for?

200
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,136
Have you seen that movie?

201
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,596
Il Postino.

202
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,640
The one about the postman.

203
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,019
He writes poems and travels on his bike.

204
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,396
What about that?

205
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,023
I write poems too.

206
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,200
You idiot.

207
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,117
What?

208
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,119
You made it worse.

209
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,167
Did Gi-yeong get home all right?

210
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,753
Yes.

211
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,005
Where was Mr. Jung? On vacation?

212
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,008
He got fired.

213
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,926
What?

214
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,138
It was that crazy woman, wasn't it?

215
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,682
Gi-yeong must have been shocked.

216
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,975
Of course.

217
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,436
Mr. Jung's been around since he was born.

218
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,063
She fired him?

219
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,481
What the hell is her problem?

220
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,233
Why did she suddenly fire him?

221
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,445
-Answer us, man.
-I don't have any answers.

222
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,531
I wish I did.

223
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,790
What a crazy woman.

224
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,798
Thank you for staying behind
and taking care of Gi-yeong.

225
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,842
Don't mention it.

226
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:59,221
I did it for his late mother's sake.

227
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,765
Thank you for everything, ma'am.

228
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,644
Yeong-ju can be difficult.

229
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,939
She must have put you through
quite a bit of trouble.

230
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,484
I know you had to endure a lot.

231
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,155
I'm an adult. I can handle that.

232
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,616
But I'm concerned
about Gi-yeong these days.

233
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,870
He eats well at home.

234
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,123
But he's been binge-eating a lot lately.

235
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,833
Binge-eating?

236
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,626
Yes.

237
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,254
He asks me to drop him off
at a convenience store

238
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,255
and eats a ton.

239
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,842
And after eating all that,
he throws it back up.

240
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,886
Is Jeong-guk aware of this?

241
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,345
No.

242
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,055
I don't think so.

243
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,392
I told Ms. Jin about it,

244
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,436
but it must've ticked her off.

245
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,355
She brought in a new driver.

246
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,446
Where's Gi-yeong right now?

247
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,281
I'm not sure.

248
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,783
I was in no position to ask.

249
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:10,292
FORSYTHIA SUJEBI

250
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,919
This is it.

251
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,754
Seems like it is, right?

252
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,174
Shouldn't Attorney Shin know

253
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,301
that we're working so hard on a weekend?

254
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,429
Pose with me, Ms. Lee.
Let's take a photo for him.

255
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,557
I…

256
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,851
I'll send it to him.

257
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,189
Okay.

258
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,112
Ms. Lee.

259
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,156
Have you ever had corn sujebi before?

260
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,324
No.

261
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,743
I've tried it once,
and it's very light and savory.

262
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,078
-Here's your food.
-Gosh.

263
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,621
Let me.

264
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,958
I'm sorry, I have bad knees.

265
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,459
You should switch to self-service.

266
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,002
What?

267
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,422
What if I lose my regulars?

268
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,019
This is really delicious, ma'am.

269
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,146
Did you put corn flour in the soup?

270
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,107
That's right.

271
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,775
It's also in the dough.

272
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,568
-Isn't it nice and nutty?
-Yes, it is.

273
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,903
Isn't it tasty?

274
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,122
Coming back from work?

275
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,544
Are you Jun-hui's teacher?

276
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,171
No, I'm not her teacher.

277
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,465
Jun-hui, this is really good.

278
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,259
You know how I said
I've had this somewhere?

279
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,887
It was at a chain restaurant,
but this is much tastier.

280
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you, come again.

281
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,562
-Of course.
-The soup is amazing.

282
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,314
My grandma came up with the recipe.

283
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,193
-Did you enjoy the food?
-We loved it.

284
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,487
Thank you so much.

285
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
CORN SUJEBI

286
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,450
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

287
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,368
-Come again.
-Goodbye.

288
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,203
Having fun?

289
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,248
-Stop it.
-She started her own restaurant

290
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,001
with the guy she had an affair with.

291
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,837
My son used to run this place.

292
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,256
This neighborhood produced a lot of corn.

293
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,176
That's all that we had.

294
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,428
The restaurant

295
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,807
did well enough to support
the three of them.

296
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,977
But they just didn't get along.

297
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,565
There's nothing you can do
when people don't get along.

298
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,150
You're right.

299
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,277
There's nothing you can do.

300
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,404
My son wasn't any better than her.

301
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,909
They fought like cats and dogs.

302
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,869
And then my daughter-in-law…

303
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,042
She had an affair.

304
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,796
She ran off with a younger guy

305
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,299
who had been supplying
corn flour to the restaurant.

306
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:10,472
And then my son was
so devastated that he fell ill.

307
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,610
I don't care what kind of life she leads,

308
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,572
but she should still look after her kid.

309
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:32,285
She's never paid any child support.

310
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,207
Have you ever asked her for it?

311
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,918
Yes, I visited her several times.

312
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,044
But she said

313
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,507
the restaurant was her husband's
and she had no money.

314
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,427
Even without income,
she's obligated to pay the minimum amount.

315
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,180
We have a law for that now.

316
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,765
You can sue her for it.

317
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,016
Really?

318
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,144
Can I really do that?

319
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,145
You bet.

320
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,271
Really?

321
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,064
Well, that's…

322
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,735
Please help me get
that child support for Jun-hui.

323
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,737
Please.

324
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,826
Please.

325
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,268
So you're at church?

326
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,311
I see.

327
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,273
Jo Jeong-sik Real Estate is open 24/7.

328
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,609
Yes, I sent you the file.

329
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,652
So please take a look.

330
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,613
Goodbye.

331
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,575
This little punk.

332
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,802
DOMESTIC RELATIONS, INHERITANCE,
AND HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS

333
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,691
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

334
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,236
What are you planning?

335
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,322
What do you mean?

336
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,866
It just seems like a suspicious way

337
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,411
to prepare for resignation.

338
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,415
I went to a real estate office
to find an office.

339
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,251
What's wrong with that?

340
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,088
There are plenty of other realtors.

341
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,425
Did you forget?

342
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,055
If it weren't for Jo Jeong-sik,
you never would have met me.

343
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,182
Then what would have happened?

344
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,853
What we did wasn't just suspicious.
We committed a crime.

345
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,692
Sure, I handed over
Shin Ju-hwa's medical records.

346
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,987
But not many attorneys would
betray their own clients.

347
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,198
It was just a stupid divorce suit.

348
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,660
And you gave up your morals
and your life for it.

349
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,289
You should watch your mouth.

350
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,082
You married into a conglomerate,

351
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,918
but I guess wealth can't fix
your lack of class.

352
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,878
Mr. Park.

353
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,797
What's your plan then?

354
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,467
What are you trying to get from me
using this picture?

355
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,221
Make your offer.

356
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,734
What do you want?

357
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,365
Mr. Seo's coffee franchise
seems to be doing well.

358
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,035
Just get me a store in a nice spot.

359
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,996
Consider it my severance pay.

360
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,547
DOMESTIC RELATIONS, INHERITANCE,
AND HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS

361
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,362
You don't look too well.

362
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,572
Really?

363
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,533
I didn't get much sleep.

364
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,207
You must be concerned about Gi-yeong.

365
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,626
I am.

366
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,756
I asked to see you today…

367
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,761
because I don't think I can finish

368
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,013
our Beethoven operation.

369
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,975
What do you mean?

370
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,064
To others, his score
may have seemed incomplete.

371
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,942
But in Beethoven's head,

372
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,154
he must have had
a complete understanding of the piece.

373
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,576
I'm not sure I follow.

374
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,912
All the evidence
you put together for the case,

375
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,372
Gi-yeong,

376
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,416
this cakewalk of a lawsuit,

377
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,794
Gi-yeong running away from home,
Mr. Jung suddenly getting fired…

378
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,004
There's…

379
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,506
something going on.

380
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,258
There's definitely something.

381
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,636
But I can't interpret it.

382
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,266
You must be having second thoughts

383
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,227
-after seeing Gi-yeong suffer--
-I even visited

384
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,355
Ju-hwa's old home.

385
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,734
I even went to the street
she passed away on.

386
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,114
But I'm still lost.

387
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,532
It feels like I'm…

388
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,870
walking in a haze.

389
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,998
So I'm sorry,

390
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,167
but I'm dropping your case.

391
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,963
This is very irresponsible of you.

392
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,591
I've already negotiated
with Daenam's attorneys.

393
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,968
They can't give you 50%.

394
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,680
And you know very well
that we didn't expect them to either.

395
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,809
You'll be receiving 27%.

396
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,895
But we're almost there.

397
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,313
I know.

398
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,815
But the thing is…

399
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,277
I don't think I can perform a piece

400
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,531
that I don't fully understand.

401
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,367
As for the rest of the case,

402
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,370
no attorney could make a difference,
for better or for worse.

403
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,839
Thanks to this weapon you gave me.

404
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,317
Bye.

405
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,480
CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

406
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,858
You don't have personal reasons.

407
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,569
Did you go cycling?

408
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,364
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

409
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,453
-Have a sweet potato.
-Thank you.

410
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,622
Mr. Jang.

411
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,541
Ms. Lee and I did a pro bono consultation,

412
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,877
and the client wishes to file a suit.

413
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,963
-Can we go ahead with it?
-I'll take care of the fees.

414
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,883
Is the client struggling financially?

415
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,427
It's LifeSucksAnyway's family.

416
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,845
Come on.

417
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,722
The one you wanted to sue?
You caught them?

418
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,890
She's a kid.

419
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,433
-Elementary schooler?
-Middle schooler.

420
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,518
Well, a middle school dropout.

421
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,773
So you're telling me

422
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,275
that she needs to file a lawsuit, correct?

423
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,527
I assume it's not a divorce suit.

424
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,739
Her mother refuses to pay child support.

425
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,491
That's why she dropped out of school.

426
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,076
Oh, dear.

427
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,578
Shouldn't we talk
to Attorney Shin about this?

428
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,704
Exactly.

429
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,666
There's no need for that.

430
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,251
You can take care of it.

431
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,380
I can't take Ms. Lee's money.

432
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,049
Her money?

433
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,717
I thought you were helping this poor kid.

434
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,262
Well…

435
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,139
Thank you, Attorney Choi.

436
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,724
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

437
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,018
Okay.

438
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,817
No, thank you.

439
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,820
About Ms. Ma Geum-hui's suit.

440
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,571
Could you hand me all her files?

441
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,864
I'm handing them over.

442
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,282
Why?

443
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,244
We agreed to end it here.

444
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,079
Please give her a call.

445
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,455
You have her number, right?

446
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,667
Give her a full refund.

447
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,839
The sauna should be open, right?

448
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,193
Is this your sauna?

449
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,405
I was sunbathing.

450
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,450
Mr. Jang sure is your friend.

451
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,953
He said you'd be at the park
since you don't like saunas.

452
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,372
And he was right.

453
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,758
Look.

454
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,679
I never asked
because I didn't want to be rude.

455
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,725
About why

456
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,104
you quit the piano
and became a divorce attorney.

457
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,109
About what happened to your sister.

458
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,031
About why Ms. Ma came to you for help.

459
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,533
Or why…

460
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,535
you're backing out.

461
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,292
It's so complicated.

462
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,463
I don't even know where to begin.

463
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,593
Attorney Choi told me a bit

464
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,763
about your relationship with Daenam.

465
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,057
So I have a rough idea.

466
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,354
What do you want the most right now?

467
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,775
What do you need?

468
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,194
For example,

469
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,071
back then,

470
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,658
all I wanted was
to keep Hyeon-u by my side.

471
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,035
Something like that.

472
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,291
I want Gi-yeong to live a happy life.

473
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,002
Then do that for him.

474
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,630
The law won't allow me to.

475
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,510
I'd never be granted custody of my nephew.

476
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,890
The law even allowed
a mom like me to have my rights.

477
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,518
And you're the one who made it happen.

478
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,691
So your nephew's name is Gi-yeong.

479
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,319
Let's look for a way.

480
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,072
There could have been
similar cases in the past.

481
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,076
And I've been looking very hard.

482
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,537
It took a toll on my eyesight.

483
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,207
I'm becoming farsighted.
I'm sick of reading.

484
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,255
When's your next shoot?

485
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,799
Probably when I get the script.

486
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,301
I think it'll be soon.

487
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,011
Right.

488
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,972
I heard you caught him. LifeSucksAnyway.

489
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,184
It wasn't a "he."

490
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,269
It was a middle school girl.

491
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,354
Jeez, a middle school girl?

492
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,155
STATION DIRECTOR JANG

493
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,909
You fired Mr. Jung
after hearing about my divorce.

494
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,661
You made the right call
if you're trying to block me out.

495
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,039
That's not why she did it.

496
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,583
Tell her.

497
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,172
But you could have taken your time
for Gi-yeong's sake.

498
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,176
I did it for his sake.

499
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
Mr. Jung talked as if
something was wrong with him.

500
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,015
Any parent would be offended by that.

501
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,893
A proper parent would
worry about their child, Yeong-ju.

502
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:09,977
Mother.

503
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,021
Can I ask you something?

504
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,108
Why do you hate me so much?

505
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,864
You look at me as if I'm subhuman.

506
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,408
That's not true.

507
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,328
Then why do you look at me
with such contempt?

508
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,622
That's enough.

509
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,958
She's worried about Gi-yeong.
This is irrelevant.

510
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,544
I need to hear her answer.

511
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,424
Mother.

512
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,011
I went to the same schools as Jeong-guk

513
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,389
when we were growing up.

514
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,934
You know my family used to be well-off.

515
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,519
Why does that matter?

516
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,145
Because you treat me

517
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,816
as if I'm dirt poor.

518
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,276
Money?

519
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,444
That's not important.

520
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,239
I couldn't care less.

521
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,825
It's about how you look at others.

522
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,869
The insecurity and hostility in your eyes
make me uncomfortable.

523
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,957
Even after moving away,
you found jobs near Jeong-guk.

524
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,167
You even took out a loan

525
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,628
to follow him to New York
and move in with him.

526
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,256
Don't you think you tried too hard?

527
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,341
It's beyond desperate.

528
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,594
Had you not stepped in,

529
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,431
he wouldn't even have gotten a divorce.

530
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,768
I pity you for thinking that way.

531
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,062
But enough about you.

532
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,690
Let Gi-yeong go.

533
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,277
I want him to live with his uncle.

534
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,405
He'll be going through puberty soon.

535
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,781
We're his parents.

536
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,782
His parents?

537
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,162
His parents?

538
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,874
That time in Hawaii.

539
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,335
That morning.

540
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,589
His mom got into that accident
right after your phone call.

541
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,674
You know that, don't you?

542
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,636
This is ridiculous.

543
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,181
Are you blaming me?

544
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,687
Do you think I staged
the accident somehow?

545
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,857
I don't even know that driver.

546
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,108
That phone call.

547
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,363
Has it never occurred to you
that I might have overheard it?

548
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,243
What is she talking about?

549
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,792
It's nothing.

550
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,421
It's nothing?

551
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,099
I'd like for you

552
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,060
to apologize to Ju-hwa, Jeong-guk.

553
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,312
And I'd like for you

554
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,773
to let Gi-yeong live with his uncle.

555
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,108
That's what he wants.

556
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,362
Please stay out of this.

557
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,597
Welcome… Hi!

558
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,724
Hold on. We're having ramyeon?

559
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,809
This place is great.

560
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,103
-They're also our only sponsor.
-Hello.

561
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,229
Long time no see.

562
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,356
By the way, I'm giving out two bowls now.

563
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,317
So don't please call
my sponsorship humble again.

564
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,569
Okay.

565
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,072
-Three bowls?
-I already ate.

566
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,949
Make it three. Two won't be enough.

567
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,242
We'd also like some wine.

568
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,452
You didn't drive here, did you?

569
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,580
Why would you have wine with ramyeon?

570
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,050
Why does this work?

571
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,927
We're picky about our sponsors.

572
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,888
Verified businesses only.

573
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,682
I have to go pick up Hyeon-u soon.

574
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,933
So what's this about?

575
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,815
I'll have you know…

576
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,861
I jumped through hoops for this.

577
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,363
For what? My comeback?

578
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,407
Come on, you ruined it.

579
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,243
Is she making a comeback?

580
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,329
It's not the 9 a.m. slot though.

581
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,415
What the heck?

582
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,083
Are you serious?

583
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,503
You're not kidding?

584
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,545
It's the 4 p.m. slot.

585
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,883
DJ Yeong is going to the UK to study.

586
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,719
I did my absolute best.

587
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,430
I suited up and went to
the vice president--

588
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,558
It only worked out
because our stream was a success.

589
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,685
Hey! Don't be ridiculous.

590
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,855
You think the radio is so easy?

591
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,776
If I were to line up all the soju bottles
that I had to drink to give her a slot,

592
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,778
they'd reach all the way…

593
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,696
Down to the Supreme Court in Seocho?

594
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,323
That's right.

595
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,534
Gosh, I'm getting all worked up.

596
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,245
Excuse me, could we get
another bottle of this château?

597
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,287
Château.

598
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,289
Call me a baron, because I'm loving this.

599
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,459
"Bring me wine!" "Yes, My Lord!"

600
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,253
I'm sorry.

601
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,630
But I have to close early today.
I have a date.

602
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,259
It must be going well between you two.

603
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,177
I'm so jealous.

604
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
Any news from Mr. Jo?

605
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,138
I haven't seen him lately.

606
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,181
Ho-yeong.

607
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,685
I'm sitting right here.

608
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,770
-So I went--
-I should get going.

609
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,146
I can't make Hyeon-u wait.

610
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,524
Okay, let's call it a night then.

611
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,192
-Should we?
-Ms. Kim has a date too.

612
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,986
That'll be 35,500 won.

613
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,530
Why is it so hectic here?

614
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,532
-Thank you for the meal.
-Don't mention it.

615
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,909
-It was only ramyeon, not beef.
-Thank you.

616
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,786
Wait, was there beef in it?

617
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,913
-Thank you and goodbye.
-Goodbye.

618
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,290
Bye.

619
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,584
-Thank you for the meal.
-Come again.

620
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,960
Have fun on your date.

621
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,171
There's a nice fried chicken place nearby.

622
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,715
You two can get some beer.

623
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,051
Thank you so much, sir. I'll stop by soon.

624
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,094
Okay.

625
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,431
Get home safe.

626
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,935
Let's go have some chicken.
We need to plan the show.

627
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,771
I'm going to hire another producer.

628
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,774
Come on, Mr. Jang.

629
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,900
Let's go!

630
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,694
You'll get me divorced.

631
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,571
It's okay. I know a divorce attorney.

632
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,281
The 4 p.m. slot?

633
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,074
That's not bad.

634
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,577
"It's 4 p.m., and I'm Lee Seo-jin."

635
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,912
Break time?

636
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,373
I could do that.

637
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,250
I could totally do that.

638
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,502
Bye, Hyeon-u.

639
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,339
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay. Bye.

640
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,049
-Hyeon-u.
-Mom!

641
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,844
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

642
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,931
-Where's your car?
-I left it at home so we can walk back.

643
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,099
Really?

644
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,560
-There's something I want to do with you.
-What?

645
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,734
I saw it on the internet.

646
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,569
This is supposed to be a good pairing.

647
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,821
Isn't it good?

648
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,366
I'm going to gain so much weight.

649
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,375
When is your next shoot?

650
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,878
A lot of people are
asking about that today.

651
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,172
Who else asked?

652
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,550
My old boss at the radio station.

653
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,052
Did you meet him?

654
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:41,887
Yes.

655
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,349
Hyeon-u.

656
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,894
He suggested that

657
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,522
I should make a comeback.

658
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,565
Do you know what that means?

659
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,568
It means starting again, right?

660
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,112
Yes.

661
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,030
Will you be doing a morning show?

662
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,783
They're giving me the 4 p.m. slot.

663
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,869
That's even better.
I'll be able to listen to it.

664
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,625
Nothing's for sure yet.

665
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,668
Just maybe.

666
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,753
I hope it works out.

667
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,172
You're great on the radio.

668
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,550
What did Attorney Shin say?

669
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,009
I haven't told him.

670
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,012
Nothing's set in stone.

671
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,265
I'll tell him when it is.

672
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,809
I'm sure he'll be happy for you.

673
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,904
I think we've seen all the new movies.

674
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,032
You're right. There's nothing left.

675
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,247
Water?

676
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,874
No, thank you. I'm full.

677
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,844
Please don't take this the wrong way.

678
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,306
But since we've seen all the movies,

679
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,184
if it's okay with you,

680
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,395
we could go to my place and…

681
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,900
I mean, we could watch
some dramas and chill--

682
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,761
Should we change the channel?

683
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,639
Sure.

684
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,140
You're not going home tonight.

685
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,649
He's hilarious.

686
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,150
He's so lucky.

687
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,510
I'm okay.

688
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,804
-Wipe your nose.
-Okay.

689
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,575
Gosh, my foot.

690
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,916
What's wrong?

691
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,002
What's the matter?

692
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,461
My foot is asleep.

693
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,046
-Your foot?
-Yes, it's asleep.

694
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,214
Let me see.

695
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,674
Here.

696
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,551
Stop it!

697
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,969
Gosh.

698
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,012
Are you okay?

699
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,847
Yes.

700
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,516
You don't look okay.

701
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,601
I'm okay.

702
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,812
I'm okay. Are you okay?

703
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,400
Hyeong-geun.

704
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,152
Yes?

705
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,238
So…

706
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,991
About your former wife.

707
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,576
"Former wife?" That's not it.

708
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,620
Your ex-wife.

709
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,539
Ji-eun?

710
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,583
Yes. Her.

711
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,963
Why did it take you so long
to break up with her?

712
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,263
Because I was a lousy husband.

713
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,226
I was away all the time.

714
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,731
She said she was very lonely.

715
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,319
And I just couldn't forget those words.

716
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,491
So I wanted to treat her well
if she came back.

717
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,910
That's why.

718
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,374
Are you okay now?

719
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,626
Have you

720
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,671
really moved on?

721
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,007
Of course.

722
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,679
She looked happy.

723
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,895
Does that mean

724
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,524
it's okay for me to be happy

725
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,610
without feeling guilty?

726
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,290
Hold on.

727
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,213
Where are we going?

728
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,048
I don't know.

729
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,301
I think I do.

730
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,098
I said I would come to you.

731
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,975
You didn't have to.

732
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,644
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

733
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,605
So this is your office.

734
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,485
I've always wanted to come.

735
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,569
I see.

736
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,740
She wants 27%?

737
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,534
That's not a bad rate.

738
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,704
They initially demanded 50%
and we got it down to 27%.

739
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,582
Why is she getting so greedy?

740
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,129
She had donated all her money
as if she were Mother Teresa.

741
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,965
And now she wants her share?

742
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,259
So she's…

743
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,596
never taken Gi-yeong to a doctor?

744
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,682
No.

745
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,228
He was in third grade

746
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,690
when he suddenly became
quiet and depressed.

747
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,861
He would only brighten up
on the days when he'd see you.

748
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,991
Since he started fourth grade,
he's gotten a lot worse.

749
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,412
I have told her, but…

750
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,833
You know.

751
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,126
Did you tell his dad too?

752
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,671
No, I rarely got to see him.

753
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,507
I told Ms. Jin about it a couple of times.

754
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,386
And what did she say?

755
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,305
Not much.

756
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,184
I'm sorry.

757
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,853
I should have taken better care of him.

758
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,272
It's not your fault.

759
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,858
I'm his uncle,

760
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,444
and I had no idea.

761
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,365
I couldn't do anything for him.

762
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,206
Gi-yeong…

763
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,752
always seemed so happy
whenever he was with me.

764
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,213
That boy

765
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,674
grew up too fast.

766
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,762
Maybe it's because
he was raised by his stepmom,

767
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,347
but he catches on quickly.

768
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,393
He's too nice to complain.

769
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,937
It really breaks my…

770
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,109
Look.

771
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,069
I'm sorry.

772
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,786
Thank you…

773
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,498
for being so good to him.

774
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,792
And for telling me

775
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,837
all of this.

776
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,673
I appreciate it.

777
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,383
Don't mention it.

778
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,511
Please let me know if you need any help.

779
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,688
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

780
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,441
CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

781
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,249
Hey, what's up?

782
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,918
You little…

783
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,920
Why is your office still closed?

784
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,296
What are you up to?

785
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,298
Come on, man.

786
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,175
I'm busy. We'll talk later.

787
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,426
I'm driving.

788
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,644
Come in.

789
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,607
Did Mr. Jung leave?

790
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,566
Yes.

791
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,276
I wish he stayed for a meal.

792
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,071
I asked him,
but he had plans with his family.

793
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,827
It's tough, isn't it?

794
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,872
Yes.

795
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,134
You'll get Gi-yeong out of there, right?

796
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,303
Of course.

797
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,764
All right then.

798
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,141
Let's do this.

799
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,190
Are you done with this?

800
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,817
Can I have a look?

801
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,902
It's no use.

802
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,865
I couldn't find a case where an uncle
sued for his nephew's custody.

803
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,074
Let's keep looking.

804
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,702
I'll help out.

805
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,180
CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

806
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,724
I hope he's not causing trouble.

807
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,311
Jeez, when will he grow up?

808
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,689
Did he answer his phone?

809
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,983
Yes, but he said he was driving
and hung up.

810
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,693
Driving?

811
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,865
-He must be driving a taxi.
-To pay rent?

812
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,241
That little--

813
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,746
Hello?

814
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,706
Yes.

815
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,333
Yes, that's me.

816
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,460
Okay.

817
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,339
Where are you calling from?

818
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:35,850
Look.

819
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,936
I'm sorry about him.

820
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,437
I apologize.

821
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,482
I understand why he acted that way.

822
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,777
But Ms. Park must have been
really frightened

823
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,071
to have called the police.

824
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,740
A suspicious car tailing her for days?

825
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,534
That's creepy.

826
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,535
A suspicious car?

827
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,205
I'm very sorry about that.

828
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,751
Can I have a word with you?

829
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,341
Why are you so obsessed with Gi-yeong?

830
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,345
Sorry?

831
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,848
You coaxed an old lady
who had no interest in money

832
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,809
into demanding a large amount of money.

833
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,062
And now you want Gi-yeong's share
of the inheritance too?

834
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,942
Is that why you're being so stubborn?

835
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,444
Ms. Jin.

836
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,362
Don't you think this is too much?

837
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,491
She bought a shabby farmhouse
so she can live a simple life.

838
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,327
She sold her one and only building

839
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,164
and donated the money
to some international relief organization.

840
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,582
So why would someone like her

841
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,667
suddenly demand her share?

842
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,669
For her contributions?

843
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,172
Please get me as much as possible.

844
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,132
I need the money.

845
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,758
You should be content with what you have.

846
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,094
Why won't you leave me alone?

847
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,431
Your sister was just like you.

848
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,893
So desperate to get custody of her son.

849
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,729
But what gives you the right to do this?

850
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,274
Look.

851
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,027
Are you incapable

852
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,237
of filtering your words

853
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,656
before you say them?

854
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,826
I just can't hold back anymore.

855
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,203
What is it?

856
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,662
Did it hit home?

857
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,999
Is this how you treated my sister?

858
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,126
What did you say

859
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,837
to my sister over the phone that day?

860
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,633
I have no reason to answer that.

861
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,347
Your words are…

862
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:39,974
like daggers.

863
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,479
They can rip someone to pieces.

864
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,939
Did I say something wrong?

865
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:49,234
She should have known
there was nothing she could do,

866
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,694
no matter how much she prepared
or studied the law.

867
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,072
It's not like I pushed her.

868
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,326
Why are you acting like it's my fault
that she got herself killed?

869
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,515
Damn it!

870
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,821
I'll make this short.

871
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,198
I just have to know. Please excuse me.

872
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,450
Is something wrong?

873
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,202
Why do you

874
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,454
need so much money?

875
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,417
I heard you sold your building
and donated the money.

876
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,130
That run-down building was
barely worth one billion won,

877
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,298
but I had to pay a hefty tax.

878
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,094
Why do you need that money?

879
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,762
Where will you spend it all?

880
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,848
I won't die anytime soon.

881
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,809
I need the money to age gracefully.

882
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:06,894
No.

883
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm finally starting
to understand the score.

884
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,068
I'm starting to understand
why you need so much money.

885
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,448
It's for Gi-yeong.

886
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,163
You want to secure his share for him
before Jin Yeong-ju can get to it.

887
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,626
You must have heard
their conversation that day.

888
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,212
I'm not sure I follow.

889
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,756
You were always afraid.

890
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,176
You needed someone
who was fearless enough to challenge her.

891
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,303
So you must have been delighted

892
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,181
to find out that I had
the motivation to do so.

893
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,023
You're right.

894
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,692
You interpreted the music perfectly.

895
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,571
Do you finally understand
why you have to win this case?

896
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,866
After all,

897
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,452
I gave you a very powerful weapon.

898
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,079
Why are you backing out?

899
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,706
Tell me the reason.

900
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,336
Most people put their children
before their grandchildren.

901
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,756
So why are you going to such lengths
to protect Gi-yeong?

902
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,092
Ju-hwa.

903
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,262
Because he's her son.

904
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,394
Ju-hwa was like

905
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,771
a daughter

906
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,149
that I never had.

907
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,988
Ms. Ma.

908
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,866
Shall I drive you to a hotel?

909
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,413
What for?

910
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,706
This is my house.

911
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,253
I had returned from a long trip,

912
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,880
and my husband had brought
his former secretary home.

913
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:04,470
I couldn't bring myself to go inside,
but I was too proud to turn around.

914
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,564
You can't tell Jeong-guk about this.

915
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,650
I used to go there a lot before I met him.

916
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,985
It's my secret place.

917
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,571
We could have had Mr. Jung drive us.

918
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,906
I want it to be just us two.

919
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,867
It'll be more fun.

920
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,537
We'll go to the beach tomorrow.

921
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,081
We'll watch the sunrise
and have breakfast.

922
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,419
Why didn't you take me with you?

923
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,297
I wanted to go on a date with her.

924
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,258
Where are you headed? I'll be there.

925
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,385
Then it wouldn't be a date.

926
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,263
You can tag along next time.

927
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,432
Fine. Have a safe trip.

928
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,813
She knew everything
but never once asked about it.

929
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,483
Here.

930
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,526
Thank you.

931
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,154
Let's eat.

932
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,332
You must be too tired to eat.

933
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,877
I've been having indigestion
for the past few days.

934
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,754
I feel nauseous too.

935
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,091
Have you seen a doctor?

936
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,260
An OB-GYN.

937
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:27,720
Sorry?

938
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,599
How could you not know
that you're pregnant?

939
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,810
I can drive, Mother.

940
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,062
Don't be ridiculous. Let me.

941
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,355
Goodness.

942
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,233
I could do this countless times.

943
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,276
I'm not tired at all.

944
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,488
And that's how

945
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,949
I first met…

946
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,244
my dear Gi-yeong.

947
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,087
I couldn't stop their divorce.

948
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,632
I didn't have a say in it.

949
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,096
It was between the two of them.

950
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,726
There was nothing I could do.

951
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,448
You should have at least rented a car.

952
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,159
How could you tail her for days
in your flashy car?

953
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,078
How could she not notice?

954
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,747
Don't tell me you were dense enough
to open the roof.

955
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,376
Hey, Jo Jeong-sik!

956
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,546
You crazy bastard!

957
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,299
What the hell were you thinking?

958
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,177
You idiot.

959
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,765
You could have gotten convicted.

960
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,559
Jeez.

961
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,770
I did it because I love you.

962
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,898
You're unbelievable.

963
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,733
Don't pay rent anymore.

964
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,277
Our friendship is rent enough.

965
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,780
You stupid, kind-hearted landlord.

966
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,035
You bastard.

967
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,329
You must have been terrified
at the police station.

968
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,581
I was.

969
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,552
CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

970
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,013
-Have a drink.
-No, thanks.

971
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,098
He did it out of love.

972
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,183
Have a drink.

973
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,561
I'm busy. I'll get busier from now on.

974
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,480
Then I'll get busier too.

975
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,357
Hey, listen to this.

976
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,693
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

977
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,989
"Concerto for Two Violins."

978
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,369
Hi, Gi-yeong.

979
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,956
It's a concerto for our two clients.

980
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,424
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

981
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,052
Have you been eating well
and sleeping well?

982
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:13,970
Yes.

983
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,182
Gi-yeong.

984
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,809
How much do you have on you?

985
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,311
Me? Why do you ask?

986
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,646
Give it to me.

987
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,903
You're too young to have this much.

988
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,155
All right.

989
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,200
This is your down payment.

990
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,663
Mr. Seo Gi-yeong.

991
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:45,626
I, Attorney Shin Sung-han,
will do my best…

992
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,044
Seo Gi-yeong!

993
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,387
…to get you out of that
suffocating castle.

994
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,389
What do you say?

995
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:32,840
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

996
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,161
Find out what she's most desperate for
and put a leash on it.

997
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,038
Please, I'm asking you.

998
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,624
Support me from afar.

999
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:09,627
In your seat, in the radio booth.

1000
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,172
If we can prove that laws were broken
in the process of Ju-hwa's divorce,

1001
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,965
we definitely have a chance.

1002
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,258
Let's go down together.

1003
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,885
I'm not going down alone.

1004
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:21,180
You're supposed to be his dad.
Why do you live with your eyes closed?

1005
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,307
You're going to lose.

1006
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,768
Don't lose, Mom.

1007
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,103
I'm going to win.

1008
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:31,941
