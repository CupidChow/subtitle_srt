DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

2
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,808
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,309
This way, please.

4
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,981
ATTORNEY PARK YU-SEOK

5
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,279
PR DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,837
Goodness, look who it is.

7
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,339
Goodness. Isn't this place nice?

8
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,716
Please have a seat.

9
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,974
I was surprised to find out
you made an appointment.

10
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,184
We could've talked on the phone.

11
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,769
I didn't have your number.

12
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,813
We've spoken over the phone several times.

13
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,981
Regarding Gi-yeong.

14
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,366
I'll save it.

15
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,996
So what brings you here?

16
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,456
Are you here to take my head

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,625
now that you're done with your grapes?

18
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,877
Come on.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,253
What would I do with your head?

20
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,088
You're not even that big of a villain.

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,006
"Villain"?

22
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,591
Never mind.

23
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,928
I just had one last thing
to check with you.

24
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,474
You said you did your best as an attorney.

25
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,770
Do you still stand by your words?

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,024
Should I write it down
and have it notarized?

27
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,817
So you do.

28
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,987
All right.

29
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,449
Is that really why
you came all the way here?

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,992
Despite your busy schedule?

31
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,076
Of course.

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,204
I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

33
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,501
There's something I've learned
while working as an attorney.

34
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,379
Aren't you curious?

35
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,507
There's a fine line

36
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,969
between an attorney and a con artist.

37
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,933
When the incompetent but money-hungry
types become attorneys,

38
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,185
they can easily destroy people's lives.

39
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,479
It's an enormous disaster

40
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,773
for such people to become attorneys.

41
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,487
Those people have
neither competence nor conscience.

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,698
And they all end up
being a figurehead or a puppet.

43
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,330
That's right.

44
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,667
I'm talking about you, Mr. Park.

45
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,924
Why is your hand shaking?

46
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,176
Do you want to throw that at me?

47
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,722
They don't even do that
in morning dramas anymore.

48
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,227
I actually came by to give you this,

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,812
but I joked around for too long.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,441
Tell her I said this.

51
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,527
"1225."

52
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,738
"Nice timing."

53
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,714
DIRECTOR JIN YEONG-JU

54
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,923
Did you give it to him?

55
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,009
-Yes.
-Did you meet him?

56
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,677
No.

57
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,097
When I heard I didn't have to meet him,

58
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,100
it made me want to meet him even more.

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,395
I worried he'd miss the bait,

60
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,105
but I guess he didn't.

61
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,109
It's a happy day, so put on a big smile.

62
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,320
-Say cheese!
-Look at the camera.

63
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,612
I'll take it now.

64
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,573
One, two, three.

65
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,782
Smile!

66
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,243
Take a good photo, please.

67
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,955
Dinh Thi Hoa!

68
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,707
Goodness.

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,001
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,919
Come here.

71
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,171
-Go talk to him.
-Okay.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,757
Let's go already!

73
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,092
PRO BONO CONSULTATIONS
WITH KEUMHWA LAW FIRM

74
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,678
Move.

75
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,515
This is none of your business,

76
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,725
so move!

77
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,809
Sir.

78
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,936
Ms. Dinh Thi Hoa and her child
are under our protection.

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,107
-You can't take them.
-You must be in charge here.

80
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,945
When you see a wife who ran away
with the baby, you should send her home.

81
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,989
They don't need your protection.

82
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,868
They'll both be safer at home.

83
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,827
Move.

84
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,413
Dinh Thi Hoa, come here right now.

85
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,374
Or you're going to regret it!

86
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,542
Sir.

87
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,630
Your wife is going to file for divorce.

88
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,757
If you intimidate her like this,

89
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,802
she'll have to file
for a restraining order.

90
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,844
A restraining order?

91
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,764
You've got to be kidding me.

92
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,058
What restraining order?

93
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,018
What restraining order?

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,979
Come here right now!

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,899
Do you want me to drag you out of there?

96
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,194
Hey, stop right there!

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,405
Let me go!

98
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,116
Dinh Thi Hoa, stop right there!

99
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,242
-Call the police!
-Hey!

100
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,661
Stop!

101
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,081
Let me go!

102
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,416
Get off me!

103
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,168
Move!

104
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,141
Damn it.

105
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,187
Are you upset?

106
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,398
Get lost.

107
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,776
Or I'll throw you on the ground.

108
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,197
You should meet
with Attorney Shin Sung-han.

109
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,034
He'll do his best to help you.

110
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,330
Make sure you show him this business card.

111
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,708
He won't help you otherwise.

112
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,796
He'll be better than a public defender.

113
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,945
I didn't expect him to fall
for such an obvious trick.

114
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm almost disappointed
that he took it so easily.

115
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,453
He must have seen through
your ulterior motive.

116
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,999
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come
all the way here with this himself.

117
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,962
-Do your best.
-Yes, ma'am.

118
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,298
Sorry? Me?

119
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,718
I can't be the one offering
the pro bono legal service, right?

120
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,763
I want you to take the case.

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,933
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,435
It's been a while
since I dealt with a divorce suit.

123
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,021
Also,

124
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,775
Does the number 1225 mean anything?

125
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,737
He mentioned the last four digits
of your phone number.

126
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,614
He said, "1225."

127
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,158
"Nice timing."

128
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,509
You could easily find that out yourself.

129
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,637
You could check Jin Yeong-ju's

130
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,889
travel records around that time

131
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,849
to find the answer.

132
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,768
I thought you would tell me.

133
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,647
Were you close to your sister?

134
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,317
You shouldn't be wasting
your life away like this.

135
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,861
Don't you think it's a waste of time?

136
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,741
I'm sure Ju-hwa is
resting in a better place.

137
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,161
You see,

138
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,958
I couldn't tell you
that I cherished my sister…

139
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,879
or that I loved her.

140
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,632
When I went abroad as a teenager,

141
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,386
I never felt bad about leaving her behind.

142
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,055
So why are you doing this?

143
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,265
I don't know.

144
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,477
All I know is…

145
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,106
that if I could go back in time,

146
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,361
I'd go where she was that night

147
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,615
and make sure she didn't die.

148
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,410
But as I looked more into it,

149
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,663
I found that there were
better times to go back to.

150
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,834
I'd go back to the time when she hadn't…

151
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,630
married your son.

152
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,052
She used to call me often
around that time.

153
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,847
Our father was trying to set her up
for marriage against her will.

154
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,807
She wanted me to stop him.

155
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,103
But I failed to do that.

156
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,315
No, I didn't do anything.

157
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,525
Instead…

158
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,865
I told her that she was a grown woman,

159
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,035
so she should deal with it herself.

160
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,412
That was it.

161
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,582
Because back then,

162
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,628
my graduation recital
was more important to me.

163
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,466
It was the final recital
before getting my doctorate degree.

164
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,220
Although now…

165
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,515
it doesn't mean anything.

166
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,310
You're asking as Ju-hwa's brother, right?

167
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,021
Yes.

168
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,067
The night of her accident…

169
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,237
At that very moment…

170
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Was Ms. Jin in Hawaii?

171
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,005
Yes.

172
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,477
CHAIRMAN SEO CHANG-JIN

173
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,822
Ma'am, the chairman called.

174
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,908
He's worried that he can't reach you.

175
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
Okay.

176
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,539
He wants you at his house
in Ichon-dong this evening.

177
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,582
All right.

178
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,724
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE
ATTORNEY SHIN SUNG-HAN

179
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
Call me if you need me.

180
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,906
Can you guarantee
that you can win any case?

181
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,116
No.

182
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,619
But I can guarantee

183
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,663
that I'll put up a fight.

184
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:19,507
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

185
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,250
Sung-han suited up.

186
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,841
What's today?

187
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,637
Just another ordinary day.

188
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,561
Something's up.

189
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,896
I second that.

190
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,821
-You did it, didn't you?
-No.

191
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,781
What do you think we're talking about?

192
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,199
Whatever it is, no.

193
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,742
So you did do it.

194
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,579
You got a new suit as soon as
you finished the grapes.

195
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,290
-It's been seven years.
-Look how clean-shaven he is.

196
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,624
Are you guys bored?

197
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,959
Does she have friends?

198
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,169
I'm good.

199
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,170
Let's see a photo.

200
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,338
What photo?

201
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,383
I'm sure you saw a photo of the girl
before going on a blind date.

202
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,052
After all,
it's all about the looks for you.

203
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,054
Get out.

204
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,640
Get out of here holding hands
and look for an academy.

205
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,977
Find some intensive course on growing up

206
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,186
and sign yourselves up.

207
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,313
I guess we were wrong.

208
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,230
He didn't do it.

209
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,024
You idiot.

210
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,484
If it's just another ordinary day
with no blind date,

211
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,404
then why would you get
all dressed up and shit?

212
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,655
"Idiot? Shit?"

213
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,991
Didn't you ask for a new sink?

214
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,411
Let me tell you all the words
that rhyme with "shit."

215
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,454
Go.

216
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,414
Hit, bit, pit…

217
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,374
What about "idiot"?

218
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,001
I was kidding.

219
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,588
I have a perfect spot for the sink.
Do you want to see it?

220
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,633
Let me install a ventilator
in that perfect spot instead.

221
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,217
-You smell like poop.
-Hey.

222
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,969
-What, asshole?
-That's enough.

223
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,638
Don't be so immature.

224
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,890
Exactly. Let's get it together.

225
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,310
How about we go on a group blind date?

226
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,811
Hyeong-geun is single again.

227
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,230
-No, thanks.
-Hyeong-geun isn't like you.

228
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,567
Do you think he'll go on bind dates
as soon as his divorce is finalized?

229
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,486
"Bind dates"? Bind what?

230
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,196
Come in.

231
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,907
Mr. Jang, the noodle shop called.

232
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,951
The owner lady wants you
to stop by for lunch.

233
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,247
Mr. Jang.

234
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,501
Really? As soon as
your divorce is finalized?

235
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,128
They just won't leave me alone.

236
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,883
Why is he getting so cocky?

237
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,842
Hey.

238
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,052
Do you want this?

239
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,638
I prefer the natural look.

240
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,518
You look naturally ugly.

241
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:19,937
Enjoy.

242
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,900
BREAK TIME

243
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,779
-Did you always have break times?
-No, just for today.

244
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,031
Just for today? Why?

245
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,242
This is a limited-edition menu.

246
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,743
Don't tell anyone.

247
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,667
It's good. I made it myself.

248
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,003
But why?

249
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,548
She was happy to hear about your divorce
and told me to feed you well.

250
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,883
-Who?
-My mom.

251
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,762
I told her about the hospital incident
and the stroller.

252
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,350
But still…

253
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,479
I prepared it to keep her
from doing it herself.

254
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,398
She's too unwell to move.

255
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,400
Eat up before it gets cold.

256
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,545
Did you give her the stroller?

257
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,682
Isn't her brother a pianist?

258
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,726
He's an attorney now.

259
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,729
An attorney?

260
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,483
Gi-yeong never told me that.

261
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,402
I told you myself a few years ago, Father.

262
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,613
Did you?

263
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,907
So what about it?

264
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,658
He's a stranger now.

265
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,536
With Ha-yul growing up,

266
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,289
I feel uncomfortable
about Gi-yeong visiting him.

267
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,085
But why is his profession
a problem for you?

268
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,170
It's not a big deal.

269
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,297
He specializes

270
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,800
in divorce suits.

271
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,762
-Divorce suits?
-To tell you the truth,

272
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,391
Mother has been meeting
with him regularly.

273
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,061
I wonder why.

274
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,606
Hey.

275
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,400
Can you look for this curved piece?
Number four?

276
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,902
Where the heck is it?

277
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,201
Maybe she wants a divorce.

278
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,079
Let her be. It's not going to happen.

279
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,957
She knows that better than anyone.

280
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,919
I have an inferiority complex.

281
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,507
It's become worse
since Gi-yeong's mom passed away.

282
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,052
I don't want any ties with her anymore.

283
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,974
We're working on a pro bono divorce case,

284
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,561
and we're up against Shin Sung-han.

285
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,815
I want to use this lawsuit
to cut all ties with him.

286
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,236
I came here to tell you not to worry
even if it gets messy.

287
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,781
Ju-hwa is long gone.

288
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,117
Why are you so concerned about her?

289
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,329
If Jeong-guk gets sick of you,
that'll be the end.

290
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,585
Get over it and move on with your life.

291
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,304
Let's do an interview
on the Dinh Thi Hoa case.

292
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,058
"Keumhwa's pro bono law service
gives hope to the socially disadvantaged."

293
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,061
Let's begin with something
along that line.

294
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,947
Jin Yeong-ju.

295
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,659
She's trying to destroy Shin Sung-han.

296
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,748
If she goes overboard,

297
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,958
we're all doomed.

298
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,669
Dude.

299
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,713
Are you sure her mom told her to do it?

300
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,340
Why do you ask?

301
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,968
Are you sure So-yeon didn't
just say that as an excuse?

302
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178
She didn't.

303
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,805
Be honest. You thought the same.

304
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,058
You got all excited.

305
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,351
No, I didn't.

306
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,978
As if. So what did you have?

307
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,188
Just a regular meal.

308
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,774
Be more specific, you dunce.

309
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,859
Braised short ribs.

310
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,820
Beef radish soup.

311
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,323
-What else?
-Her geotjeori was pretty good.

312
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,534
Geotjeori?

313
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,122
As in freshly-made kimchi

314
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,750
that's crunchy and spicy?

315
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,419
Yes. It was pretty delicious.

316
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:55,837
Throw it.

317
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,089
And you didn't invite me?

318
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,800
Come on.

319
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,385
How could I?

320
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,471
She just wanted to cheer me up.
I couldn't bring a freeloader.

321
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,182
So that's how it is?
You think I'm a freeloader?

322
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,392
That's not what I meant.

323
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,772
Come on.

324
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,358
Sung-han, I caught it!

325
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,734
Nice.

326
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,029
It felt like I had to come here.

327
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,948
This has nothing to do with the sink.

328
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,866
-I know.
-Do you have a bat?

329
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,743
Don't come any closer. Halt.

330
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,495
Stop. Turn around and leave.

331
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,746
I have an appointment.

332
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,582
Hey, leave your glove.

333
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,501
Let's play. It's been a while.

334
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,086
-Here.
-I have a client too.

335
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,297
-Those bastards…
-What?

336
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,257
I said, good luck with the consultation.

337
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,718
Jeong-sik.

338
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,094
Yes, Sung-han?

339
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,264
-You look like something.
-What?

340
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,308
-What's that called?
-What is it?

341
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,727
A long-haired Chihuahua taking a poop.

342
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,816
Totally.

343
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,862
Damn it.

344
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,117
Ms. Lee.

345
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,453
When will I meet the client?

346
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,955
I'm all ready, you see.

347
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,623
I even bought clothes.

348
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,125
To wear to mediation sessions?

349
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,209
You startled me.

350
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,961
You sure have good hearing.

351
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,757
I bought hiking clothes. Look.

352
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,679
You're wearing that to mediation?

353
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,056
What are you talking about?

354
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,767
I'm going to start hiking.

355
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,936
I need to look after my mind and body
to defend my clients well.

356
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,980
Hiking would be perfect.

357
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,483
Hello, Ms. Jo Min-jeong.

358
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,242
Isn't this Ms. Jo Min-jeong's phone?

359
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,703
Yes, it is.

360
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,123
May I speak with her?

361
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,960
Who is this?

362
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,131
I'm sorry, but who am I speaking to?

363
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm her father.

364
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,177
Who is this?

365
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,974
She can't talk on the phone right now.

366
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,102
She's been hospitalized.

367
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,770
Hospitalized?

368
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,855
Is it serious?

369
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,024
Who is this?

370
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,028
I'm an intake coordinator at a law office.

371
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,949
I called to schedule a meeting with her.

372
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,450
A meeting?

373
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,580
Did she visit a law office?

374
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,667
Yes, sir.

375
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,920
What did she discuss with you?

376
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,759
She overdosed.

377
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,846
We found her in the nick of time.

378
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,766
What did Min-jeong

379
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,852
consult you about?

380
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,024
May I tell you in person?

381
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,777
I'll come right over.

382
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,905
A left ulna fracture…

383
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,073
Left…

384
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,034
Come in.

385
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,289
I need to head out for a minute.

386
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,124
What's wrong? Is it about Hyeon-u?

387
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,167
No.

388
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,836
I must have made a mistake
during the consultation.

389
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,338
Calm down. What's going on?

390
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,884
Ms. Jo Min-jeong, the lady I spoke with…

391
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,471
Attorney Choi's client.
She's in the hospital.

392
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,931
She overdosed.

393
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,309
Sure. Go ahead.

394
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,978
Don't panic.

395
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,065
-Damn it. Attorney Jun!
-Yes, sir.

396
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,484
Give Ms. Lee a ride.
I don't think she should drive.

397
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,612
My car's to the right. The number's 4839.

398
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,032
I've never driven this model.

399
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,950
-Should I get a cab?
-Just go already.

400
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,369
-I don't care if you crash it. Go.
-Yes, sir.

401
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,668
What a nice car.

402
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,505
I could win every case
if I drove this to work every day.

403
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,506
Right?

404
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,967
Sorry?

405
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,970
You must be shaken up.

406
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,474
Are you worried?

407
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,393
Yes.

408
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,770
She had an illness.

409
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,522
I've done some research,

410
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,567
and apparently,
schizophrenia can't be cured.

411
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,364
She had been betrayed by her husband
and was considering divorce.

412
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,574
She must have been under stress.

413
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,536
What I'm trying to say is,
there's no way this is your fault.

414
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,460
Do you think she'll agree to meet with us?

415
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,297
Even if she does,

416
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,382
it's not like

417
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,468
we've officially taken her case.

418
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,263
The whole situation's a bit…

419
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,899
She wants a divorce?

420
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,860
Yes, sir.

421
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,238
That's what she told us.

422
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,243
She went there alone.

423
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,787
I would've gone with her if she asked.

424
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,455
Getting a divorce isn't easy.

425
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,918
Why can't they just talk things out?

426
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,337
Talk what out?

427
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,214
Look at her state right now.

428
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,468
Then do you want her
to live alone for the rest of her life?

429
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,514
We're going to turn 80 soon.

430
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,810
We can't live with her forever.

431
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,438
Have you forgotten why she's in there?

432
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,899
-She tried to take her--
-I'm just so upset.

433
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,444
I'm worried.

434
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,158
If she files for divorce,

435
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,119
what will be the outcome?

436
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,665
I'm afraid I can't answer that
since I'm just a coordinator.

437
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,584
But Attorney Choi--

438
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,793
Min-jeong!

439
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,964
-Hyeon-tae.
-How's Min-jeong?

440
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,258
Is she okay, Mother?

441
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,386
How did you know she was here?

442
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,680
I mean…

443
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,683
I thought he should know.

444
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,602
Of course I should be here.

445
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,563
I insisted on staying with her,

446
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,400
but she urged me to leave.

447
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,571
This is all my fault.

448
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,574
I should have taken better care of her.

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,368
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,370
It's all my fault.

451
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,662
That's enough.

452
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,291
Let's not cause a scene.

453
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,630
You two should go home and rest.

454
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,800
You must be so shocked.

455
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,470
I'll stay here, and when she wakes up…

456
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,055
You should go.

457
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,182
We can talk later.

458
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,562
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,649
I should have been there for her.

460
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,070
I'll wait in the lobby.

461
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,032
I can't go…

462
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,202
without her.

463
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,999
I'll be nearby, so let me know.

464
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,084
All right. Go on now.

465
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,399
Park Si-hyeon again?

466
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,984
It's getting old.

467
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,112
We have no choice.
She always has nice stories.

468
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,822
She's a great storyteller.

469
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,699
Come in.

470
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,783
Hello.

471
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,244
-Hello.
-Hello.

472
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,705
I was passing by
and brought your favorite bread.

473
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,543
Isn't this bakery in Bundang?

474
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,003
Did you go all the way there?

475
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,713
I heard you had a lot of work.

476
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,799
She needs her carbs
when she's stressed out.

477
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,302
I see that you have coffee.
Anything else you need?

478
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,512
No, we've got everything.

479
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,098
He went all the way to Bundang.
It's true love.

480
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

481
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,852
-Should we take a break?
-Sure.

482
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,062
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

483
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,191
-This one?
-Yes, please.

484
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,590
You should have gone home.

485
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,342
I said I'd be late.

486
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,261
You could have lied about the meeting
and gone elsewhere.

487
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,640
I should surprise you sometimes
to keep you in check.

488
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,350
I've never betrayed your trust.

489
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,768
That's what they all say.

490
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,979
No one admits to having an affair
from the beginning.

491
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,121
I couldn't tell anyone
that I was suffering.

492
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,708
Since I chose to marry him,

493
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,213
I thought I had to carry the burden.

494
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,092
Maybe things would have been different

495
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,011
had I confided in others
and asked for help.

496
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,516
You chose to harm yourself,

497
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,228
and I chose to have an affair.

498
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,107
And the pain that follows

499
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,776
is for each of us

500
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,279
to bear.

501
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,698
Tomorrow,

502
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,450
next year,

503
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,704
I'll be miserable just the same.

504
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,249
All that I can do…

505
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,586
is to end it all.

506
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,089
I just have to die…

507
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,885
before things get even worse.

508
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,853
Maybe I'm shameless…

509
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,316
but I want to be happy.

510
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,069
I'm still afraid to go grocery shopping.

511
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,574
I'd rather be stuck in traffic
than take the subway.

512
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,329
But I want to be happy someday.

513
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,748
"Shameless."

514
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,919
"Shameless."

515
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,553
I tried making a different choice.

516
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,642
I became a coordinator at a law office.

517
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,396
I hope you can try
making a different choice as well.

518
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,067
When we make our own choices,

519
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,612
we might finally become happy.

520
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,675
I'm going to speak with Ms. Jo.

521
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,137
Please keep an eye on her husband.

522
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,515
Where is he?

523
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,727
Come in.

524
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,355
Should I call Attorney Choi?

525
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm sure they'll be fine.

526
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,406
I'm worried.

527
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,659
What are you doing?

528
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,620
I'm reading the consultation notes
for his case.

529
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,747
You're going to take it?

530
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,999
I'm just reading up on it
so I can advise him.

531
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,171
Shouldn't you be preparing
for Mr. Ma Chun-seok's case?

532
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,881
I did.

533
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,424
I even got a suit.

534
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,092
Did you meet with him?

535
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,761
No, I met with Park Yu-seok.

536
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,597
You dressed up for him?

537
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,639
It's a uniform.

538
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,100
My combat uniform. It's nice.

539
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,894
It makes me look wealthy too.

540
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,272
-You're obnoxious.
-I know.

541
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,984
Park Yu-seok is so weird.

542
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,029
Why does he keep provoking you?

543
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,782
He was the one who sent Mr. Ma, right?

544
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,325
No, Jin Yeong-ju was.

545
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,951
Jin Yeong-ju?

546
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,162
I remember her.

547
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,414
-Why?
-Beats me.

548
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,832
I must bother her.

549
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,543
What a weird woman.

550
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,129
So? Did you see her too?

551
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,423
What for?
I don't even know what she looks like.

552
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,592
Why did you meet Park
if she's the mastermind?

553
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,011
To annoy him.

554
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,264
His nostrils are huge to begin with,

555
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,351
and they flare so much
when he gets annoyed.

556
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,103
You could fit a coin in there.

557
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,729
Are you serious?

558
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,608
What if you end up losing
after you annoyed him?

559
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,361
What are you doing?

560
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,655
Hold on.

561
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,657
Let me see.

562
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,663
Yes. That's exactly it.

563
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,666
Are you wearing your crazy uniform today?

564
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,459
What the heck was that?

565
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,336
I was experimenting. Don't yell at me.

566
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,379
You're so annoying.

567
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,880
Experimenting what?

568
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,310
DIAGNOSIS
DINH THI HOA

569
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,355
I may be uneducated,
but I've never hit anyone.

570
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,484
Farming is exhausting enough.

571
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,628
Apparently, she fractured her left arm
trying to protect herself

572
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,213
from getting hit with a bat.

573
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,384
But Mr. Ma can't raise his right arm
due to his frozen shoulder.

574
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,635
Maybe he used his left arm.

575
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,304
Do you think so?

576
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,264
If I did this…

577
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,390
See?

578
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,018
If I hit with my left arm,
you block with your right arm.

579
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,395
If I hit with my right arm,
you block with your left arm.

580
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,480
Left, right.

581
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,317
-Left.
-You're right.

582
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,526
It's just natural.

583
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,197
But let's not jump to any conclusions.

584
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,158
Because he could have hit her like this.

585
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,160
Or like this.

586
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,912
There are many variables.

587
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,498
Let's look into it in more detail.

588
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,210
In that sense… All right.

589
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,253
You should go.

590
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,089
-Where?
-To Haenam.

591
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,135
Jeong-sik got a new car.

592
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,595
You should break it in.

593
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,305
A cross-country trip with Jeong-sik?

594
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,765
At least you'll have a car.

595
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,060
As long as you're fine with me
taking over a week to get there.

596
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,229
He's going to stop at
all the good restaurants,

597
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,980
so I'll need a sizeable budget.

598
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,857
That's not good.

599
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,692
How about this?

600
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,028
Why don't you take So-yeon?

601
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,795
GRANDMA'S NOODLE SHOP

602
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,387
Welcome.

603
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,403
Do you like braised short ribs?

604
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,757
I just told him to come by for lunch.

605
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,760
I never said he had to come alone.

606
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,305
I'm glad he did. This is great.

607
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,349
You can only appreciate
what you've experienced.

608
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,101
Same goes for food.

609
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,272
I just remember
what my mom used to cook for me.

610
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,524
-Isn't it good?
-It's delicious.

611
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,319
I'll pack some for Hyeon-u.
There's just enough left for him.

612
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,836
I heard about what happened.
It sounded pretty bad.

613
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,049
But why are you blaming yourself?

614
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,552
She only came in because she was
in a bad place to begin with.

615
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,350
I didn't realize how bad it really was.

616
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,062
I treated her story
like one from my listeners.

617
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,313
But did you really?

618
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,565
Maybe.

619
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,691
See?

620
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,320
You can't even tell me
what you did wrong.

621
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,283
Normally, when we make mistakes,

622
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,328
we know what we did wrong
and whom we offended.

623
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,916
We may end up just buying them coffee
because it's too awkward to apologize,

624
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,833
but we know.

625
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,337
But you're feeling guilty
for no apparent reason.

626
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,214
That's just ridiculous.

627
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,300
Save your repentance for church.

628
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,345
None of this is your fault.

629
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,185
The soup is really delicious.

630
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,525
It's all thanks to the good beef I put in.

631
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,119
My first case ended
before I even met my client.

632
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,372
I'm disappointed in you, Attorney Choi.

633
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,000
How are you disappointed
when I didn't even get to do anything?

634
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,253
That lady could have died,

635
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,755
but you're grumbling
about not having a case anymore.

636
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,798
I wasn't grumbling.

637
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,800
How do you explain
those dark circles then?

638
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,051
They're the proof.

639
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,637
They reached all the way
down to my ankles.

640
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,806
That's how sad I am.

641
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,599
You really are a pathological liar.

642
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,935
How could your dark circles
reach that far down?

643
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,437
You're not a cartoon character.

644
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,188
This is so frustrating.

645
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,399
I genuinely feel bad for her.

646
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,193
I saw Ms. Jo's husband.

647
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,947
He was bawling
and apologizing to her parents.

648
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,031
But something…

649
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,743
just didn't seem right.

650
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,539
I had this uneasy feeling about him.

651
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,124
Seriously?

652
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,792
So I quietly watched him

653
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,669
when he was alone.

654
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,629
And?

655
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,175
He was hiding in a crowd
and watching something on his phone.

656
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,721
But he was so sly and meticulous.
He only had one earphone in.

657
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,765
And he kept glancing around him.

658
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,725
Something's fishy.

659
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,060
And I caught on to it.

660
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,979
Man, I'm good.

661
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,481
-And then?
-Are you curious?

662
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,608
-Are you?
-Yes.

663
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,567
As curious as George.

664
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,783
I took a peek at his screen.

665
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,244
Quietly and quickly.

666
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,417
-It was a variety show.
-What?

667
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,835
Do you still not get it?

668
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,296
His wife attempted suicide,

669
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,715
but he was giggling
while watching a variety show.

670
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,717
-What does that make him?
-An asshole.

671
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,843
A bastard.

672
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,637
Hence the dark circles.

673
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,974
Despite my keen sense of justice,
my client is dejected.

674
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,560
I feel so bad.

675
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,686
My heart

676
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,438
breaks for her.

677
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,359
You're quite intuitive, Attorney Choi.

678
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,445
How did you think
of keeping an eye on her husband?

679
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,366
Only after two years into this job

680
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,744
did I have that kind of hunch.

681
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,497
-Right, Sae-bom?
-Really?

682
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,249
Yes.

683
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,378
You must be tired, Ms. Lee.

684
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,797
I'm fine thanks to Attorney Choi.

685
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,803
About Ms. Jo's husband--

686
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,806
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

687
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,225
It's quiet here.

688
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,687
Attorney Choi.

689
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,148
Copyright law is serious business.

690
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,027
This could be considered plagiarism.

691
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,114
You took credit for someone else's

692
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,116
intuitive decision

693
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,909
and excellent reasoning.

694
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,828
That's plagiarism.

695
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,454
It sure isn't an homage.

696
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,374
Show-off.

697
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,377
Whatever. Let's go have some tteokgalbi.

698
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,297
-I found a great restaurant.
-I don't like tteokgalbi.

699
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,757
But where are we going?

700
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,718
Haenam.

701
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,677
Haenam…

702
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,306
Can I record a mukbang there?

703
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,933
Okay.

704
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,394
I have to think of a theme.

705
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,783
Take me to the hotel in Myeong-dong.

706
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,996
But Mr. Seo told me
to bring you to his place.

707
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,290
That place must have bad energy.

708
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,626
I feel exhausted
just thinking about going there.

709
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,253
Wake me up when we get to the hotel.

710
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,089
Yes, ma'am.

711
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:33,003
I guess it's no use to plead with you

712
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:39,885
Your heart has already changed

713
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:49,728
I can't even bring myself
To beg you to stay

714
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:56,860
I'll just be on my way

715
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:20,801
The lights that resemble our memories

716
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:28,100
Are weeping tonight

717
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,438
Why did I bring myself

718
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:37,025
Down this path

719
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:43,907
That would only break my heart?

720
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,577
That's a nice song.

721
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:07,181
I guess it's no use to plead with you

722
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:13,228
Your heart has already changed

723
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:23,322
I can't even bring myself
To beg you to stay

724
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:30,787
I'll just be on my way

725
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:38,921
The lights that resemble our memories

726
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:45,427
Are weeping tonight

727
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,474
Why did I bring myself

728
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:54,269
Down this path

729
00:46:55,103 --> 00:47:02,069
That would only break my heart?

730
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,453
Why have you been staying

731
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,872
everywhere but our house?

732
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,793
And why have you never visited me
since you got back?

733
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,546
I went to see our grandkids,

734
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,589
and our house doesn't feel like home.

735
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,050
It's more comfortable this way.

736
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,636
It's better to grow old together.

737
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,221
What is it?

738
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,765
Can you not stand growing old with me?

739
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,231
I promise to treat you well,
so move back in.

740
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,860
I'm going to make up
for all the trouble I've caused you.

741
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:44,987
Think about it.

742
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,408
With all the mistakes I've made,
I'll have to treat you like a queen.

743
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,911
You're supposed to have good fortune
in your later years, remember?

744
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,831
That reading was a waste of money.

745
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,668
I'll tell Mr. Jung
to bring your belongings.

746
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,796
So move back in with me.

747
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,759
Why don't we have pufferfish soup
for old times' sake?

748
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,803
I had it yesterday.

749
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,471
It doesn't taste the same anymore.

750
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,808
It tasted fine to me.

751
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,811
Subtle changes are hard to notice.

752
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:21,189
But in my case,
I had it for the first time in years.

753
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,527
You're just like that soup.

754
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,239
I can see you've changed
after all these years.

755
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,534
Is that so?

756
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,953
I guess I might have.

757
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,706
I'm going back to Hawaii.

758
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,375
Move back in with me.

759
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,419
You can't wander around forever.

760
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,674
Let's keep living like we always have.

761
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,968
Why change now?

762
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,518
To tell you the truth,

763
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,357
Mother has been meeting
with him regularly.

764
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,109
I wonder why.

765
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,785
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

766
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,804
SHIN SUNG-HAN LAW OFFICE

767
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,941
Seo-jin.

768
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,610
Ho-yeong!

769
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,905
Hi, I used to work with Seo-jin.

770
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,199
Hello.

771
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,702
-Would you like some tea?
-Sure.

772
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,037
Seo-jin, don't I look like Léon?

773
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,581
How do you like this lemon tree?

774
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,958
Where should I put it?

775
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,126
How about here?

776
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,753
Why don't we go out?

777
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,755
-There's a cafe nearby.
-Seo-jin.

778
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,050
I'm loving this office look on you.

779
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,261
Mr. Jang, I'll be back after a cup of tea.

780
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,304
Feel free to use the consultation room.

781
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,266
Were you the writer of her radio show?

782
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,102
The producer.

783
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,228
The producer? Goodness.

784
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,773
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Attorney Choi Jun.

785
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,860
Did you guys work
on that morning show together?

786
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:30,819
Yes.

787
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,612
What are you doing nowadays?

788
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,073
The same show that she was on?

789
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,325
Me? Of course not.

790
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,703
She got me that job.

791
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,289
I'd be a jerk
to have remained on the show.

792
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,749
-Of course.
-Right?

793
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,959
-Bang Ho-yeong.
-"Ho-yeong"?

794
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:49,629
Oh, my. I love your name.
It sounds so friendly.

795
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,672
I'm Sae-bom.

796
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,882
Thank you.

797
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,135
This place has good energy.

798
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,179
It's old but cozy.

799
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,055
It feels like home.

800
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,724
Please take a seat.

801
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,268
It's too late to leave now, Ms. Lee.

802
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,937
Sir.

803
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,815
She's a former colleague of Ms. Lee's.

804
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,067
-She's a radio show producer.
-Hello.

805
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,988
Aren't you Attorney Shin Sung-han?

806
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,989
Yes, I am.

807
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,825
Excuse me.

808
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,286
-She just came.
-Hello?

809
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,371
I'm sorry.

810
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,831
There was nowhere else to park.

811
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,751
-Is that Jeong-sik?
-The parking lot was full.

812
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,212
Me? No, I'm not going
to the real estate office.

813
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,421
Tell him you're here.

814
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,465
They say I can park there.

815
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,384
Sorry? The law office.

816
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,055
Don't worry about it.
You don't have to move your car.

817
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm going home after a meeting.

818
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,267
-Goodbye.
-Have a good night, sir.

819
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,602
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

820
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,024
Does he have a girlfriend?

821
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,276
I've never seen one. We're not that close.

822
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,821
He's been single for years.
Isn't that shocking?

823
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,989
Have you been counting down, Sae-bomb?

824
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,492
-I love it here!
-Don't you?

825
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,576
Have a seat.

826
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,620
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

827
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,997
JO JEONG-SIK REAL ESTATE

828
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,959
Why did she park her car here?

829
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,711
Damn it.

830
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,093
She did your makeup?

831
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,261
Yes.

832
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,596
When was that again?

833
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,683
Back then… How do I put it?

834
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,642
I looked

835
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,103
a bit "classic."

836
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,106
"Classic" isn't a synonym
for "old-fashioned."

837
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,524
Right. I was old-fashioned.

838
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:36,611
But suddenly, she grabbed my hand.

839
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,322
She said my makeup would shock the judges.

840
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,533
She gave me a makeover.

841
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,578
I almost had a heart attack.

842
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,414
The DJ of my dreams

843
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,500
was right in front of me, doing my makeup.

844
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,169
I'll never forget that moment.

845
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,255
Ms. Lee, can you do mine too?

846
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,465
-I just need to fix my eyebrows, right?
-No.

847
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,053
You can't just park anywhere you like!

848
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,056
It's peak hours for business right now,

849
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,726
but she parked her car
right in front of my workplace.

850
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,144
This isn't right!

851
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,771
Since when do you have peak hours?
Today?

852
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,856
You little…

853
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,940
Where's the landlord?

854
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,193
The parking lot, the offices,

855
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,987
and the sink…

856
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,697
Everything is a total mess!

857
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,074
I'm sorry. She was about to leave.

858
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,910
-Is she your friend?
-Yes.

859
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,037
You should have said something.

860
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,288
Right, you couldn't.

861
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,124
You should have left a note
saying you were here for Ms. Lee.

862
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,085
She was the producer
of Ms. Lee's radio show.

863
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,337
Exactly.

864
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,633
Look at these goosebumps.
My hair's standing on end.

865
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,593
I'm an avid listener.

866
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,803
The moment I arrive at my office,

867
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,097
I turn on the radio right away.

868
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,807
"Good morning to you."

869
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:52,687
That's their rival show
from another station, Jeong-sik.

870
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,607
My mistake.

871
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,901
Ms. Lee, do you see these goosebumps?

872
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,362
-You see those?
-You have goosebumps all the time.

873
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,488
You got me.

874
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,573
Please sit down.

875
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,034
Have a seat.

876
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,204
Go. It's your peak hours.

877
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,332
JAPANESE RESTAURANT
SILVER

878
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,340
Why don't you get media exposure?

879
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,009
-Sorry?
-A lot of doctors and lawyers

880
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,970
appear on TV shows these days.

881
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,805
Maybe I can look into it.

882
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,224
No, thank you.

883
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,934
I don't mean anything by it.

884
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,854
Whether you become notorious
or renowned for your competence,

885
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,940
I just want you to make it big.

886
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,080
You told me to call you

887
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,041
if I ever wanted a divorce.

888
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,752
But I'm too afraid.

889
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,714
You said you'd put up a fierce fight.

890
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,967
But against Daenam Electronics'
team of attorneys,

891
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,221
you'll look much shabbier
from the beginning.

892
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,350
If that's why,
you really don't need to worry.

893
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,645
It's a lawsuit, not a show.

894
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,190
But thank you for telling me.

895
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,239
I'm going back to Hawaii soon.

896
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,749
Excuse me.

897
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,710
Hello, sir. I'm in a meeting right now.

898
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,670
-I'll call you in an hour or--
-What the heck is this?

899
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,216
Why is my divorce on the news?

900
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,843
Pardon?

901
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,596
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

902
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,270
VIETNAMESE WIFE
SUBJECTED TO VIOLENCE AND ABUSE

903
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,732
VIETNAMESE WOMAN ABUSED
BY HUSBAND IN HAENAM

904
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,775
WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE.

905
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,318
DID HE WANT A YOUNGER WIFE THAT BADLY?

906
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,402
WE NEED THE DEATH PENALTY.

907
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,076
VIETNAMESE WIFE ABUSED

908
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,788
KEUMHWA OFFERS HELP
TO VIETNAMESE WIFE

909
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,923
KEUMHWA LAW FIRM

910
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,592
Damn it.

911
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,021
Pork belly would be too heavy, right?

912
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,731
But it's great for drinking
during the day.

913
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,526
Ramyeon is pretty good
with drinks as well.

914
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,320
That's for college students.

915
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,571
Come on.

916
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,747
Something's up again.

917
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:16,808
ATTORNEY SHIN SUNG-HAN

918
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,899
DIAGNOSIS
DID MA CHUN-SEOK ASSAULT HER?

919
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,041
I'm at Jeong-sik's office.
Call me if you need me.

920
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,222
LEAVE FOR VIETNAM?
GIVE UP PERMANENT RESIDENCY?

921
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,434
DID MA CHUN-SEOK ASSAULT HER?
DINH THI HOA'S FRACTURE

922
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,948
This is Shin Sung-han.

923
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,622
Hi.

924
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,964
I wasn't so sure
when I first went to Vietnam.

925
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,928
I only went there
because my mother had begged me to.

926
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,305
So I thought I'd just go sightseeing.

927
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,850
It was my first time getting a passport.

928
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,269
When I got there

929
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,399
and met Dinh Thi Hoa for the first time…

930
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,990
I knew I had to

931
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,618
bring her back.

932
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,040
She lived with her siblings
and her widowed mother.

933
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,751
They had no hope.

934
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:11,464
I knew I could support them
if I worked a bit harder.

935
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,466
So I decided

936
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,843
to start a family with her.

937
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,308
But who was I to pity her?

938
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,022
I shouldn't have been so naive.

939
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,568
I was happy to be a father at 50.

940
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,945
But guess what?

941
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,282
People call me

942
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,536
an old man who bought in
a poor woman.

943
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,540
They say I'm despicable.

944
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,514
Do you like that song?

945
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,642
I listen to it often.

946
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,354
It's one of my favorites too.

947
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,984
It's nice to hear it over the phone.

948
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,821
Do you listen to trot music too?

949
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,406
Of course.

950
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,702
I suddenly became fond of it one day.

951
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,873
All of a sudden.

952
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,004
Mr. Ma.

953
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,840
You should get your honor back.

954
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:39,302
What honor do I have to get back?

955
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,348
You need to prove to everyone

956
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,476
that you didn't buy or abuse
a young, foreign woman.

957
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,518
There's your honor.

958
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,488
This lawsuit is going to get messier.

959
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,741
I called to warn you in advance.

960
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,577
I'm going to do something.

961
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,247
I'll become the talk of the town.

962
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,041
And I'll get

963
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,086
your honor back.

964
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,172
Good night.

965
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,653
They just won't leave me alone.

966
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,749
DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN

967
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,237
There's something else that bothers me.

968
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,822
Your wife left home

969
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,366
but returned the next day.

970
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,953
The public opinion
is in support of Dinh Thi Hoa.

971
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,581
We need the public's attention
to turn the tables.

972
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,874
We'll find a way.

973
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,627
Why was Park Yu-seok there?

974
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,087
What was he up to?

975
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,924
We need to find him and hide him.

976
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,552
This is a very important question
for reclaiming your honor.

977
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,513
So please be honest with me.

978
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,602
