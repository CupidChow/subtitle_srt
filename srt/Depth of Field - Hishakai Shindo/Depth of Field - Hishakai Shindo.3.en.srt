1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,800
It's so noisy.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,660
It's your straightforward attitude
that really gets me fired up.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,180
Will beating me up really
make you feel better?

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,860
I'm just worried about you, Hayakawa...

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,500
Shaken, are you?

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Konno-chan...

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,400
Do you want to have sex with me?

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Have sex.

9
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,000
What's with the way he gets angry?

10
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,300
"Depth of Field"

11
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,300
(Episode 3)

12
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Hayakawa, you're really late.

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,580
Huh?

14
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
What's wrong?

15
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I get it.

16
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,559
Did you try to hit on a girl who already
has a boyfriend and end up getting punched?

17
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,200
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

18
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,500
I want to use it as a necktie, too.

19
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,876
Are you Hayakawa's
junior from middle school?

20
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Yes.

21
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to know what happened
with Hayakawa back then.

22
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,100
Did something happen to him?

23
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,500
I don't know everything either.

24
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think it'd be quicker if you
just ask Hayakawa directly.

25
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
Do you think he'll talk about it?

26
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,500
Hayakawa has a friend he's been making music
with since they were kids. That's Yamashita.

27
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,600
- How is it?
- Hmm... it's too hard.

28
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,810
- You're back.
- Yeah, I'm back.

29
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,730
Dad, welcome home.

30
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,569
Dad, help me, I can't play the chords.

31
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,580
Can't do it?

32
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
Alright, come over here.

33
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Let me take a look.

34
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Not bad.

35
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

36
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,549
Impressive, really impressive.

37
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,940
All the chords came out!

38
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,616
You must have practiced for a long time.

39
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,976
- I really practiced for ages.
- Did you really practice that long?

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,546
I've probably practiced
for about a thousand hours.

41
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:41,639
That's incredible! I
could never pull that off!

42
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
- It's about time to head home, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

43
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,400
Want to practice one more time?

44
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,676
Well then... make sure you
practice hard when you get home.

45
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
Because there's not much
difference from before.

46
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Okay.

47
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,740
Do you want to go to the
amusement park later?

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,669
How about we grab a bite to eat first?

49
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,400
Not bad, where should we go eat?

50
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,840
A new place just opened up in front of
the station recently... What was it again?

51
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,170
Gyudon place.

52
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,949
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I've been
wanting to try it for a while.

53
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,950
Do you want to eat there?

54
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,311
- That place always puts in a ton of bean sprouts.
- Really?

55
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,719
Alright, I'll let everyone know too.

56
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
Thanks!

57
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,000
Right now, only Yama-chan understands me.

58
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,503
Hey, you must be hungry,
right? Come over to my place for dinner,

59
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,830
and we can get some
practice in while we're at it.

60
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,800
- Yeah, sure.
- Awesome!

61
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Even if you say that.

62
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,349
It's not that we don't want to practice at home.

63
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,260
It's just too noisy, and my
parents won't allow it.

64
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,350
Hayakawa must be pretty well-off, huh?

65
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,070
I heard his dad is a professor
at a music university, too.

66
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,500
It's only natural that he has a
place where he can practice.

67
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't hold us to the same standards.

68
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,220
Seriously.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,970
Yamashita, you really
do get along with him, huh.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,100
You really are best buddies. I could never do that.

71
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
We're not best friends.

72
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,500
I... It's not like I'm with
Hayakawa because I like him.

73
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,520
Huh?

74
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,000
Haven't you two always been really close?

75
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,700
Because... his family has a piano.

76
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,315
If my family had one, I wouldn't have gone to his place.

77
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,376
I wouldn't have wanted to
hang out with him, either.

78
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,480
-For real?

79
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,499
Um... if Hayakawa hears that...

80
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,620
So what does that even mean…

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What did you just say?

82
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Ah! So you're saying you're
not with me because you like me?

83
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
That's right.

84
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
But...

85
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,000
Weren't you only with me
because you felt sorry for me?

86
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,100
Always looking down on me, the pathetic one
with a terrible relationship with my parents.

87
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
That's not it at all.

88
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,849
So that's why you gave up the piano
for me and started playing guitar yourself.

89
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,400
That's really not how it is.

90
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,299
I just genuinely like the way
Yama-chan plays the piano.

91
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,500
What does that even mean?

92
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,380
Learning music in such
a privileged environment.

93
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
You've actually been pitying
me all along, haven't you?

94
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
So what am I supposed to do?

95
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,900
What should I do?

96
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,300
You just don't get it.

97
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,540
As long as you don't
give up that environment.

98
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,069
I... was just thinking, no
matter what form it takes,

99
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,449
as long as we can keep
making music together...

100
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,500
Are you serious when you say “always”?

101
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
So disgusting.

102
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,420
He hasn't come to club practice since then.

103
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
But, I...

104
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,161
I thought that starting high school
and being in a new environment...

105
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
Maybe...

106
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I see.

107
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,160
Thank you for being willing to tell me.

108
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
Mind if I borrow this guy for a moment?

109
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
I want to apologize for
what happened last time.

110
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sorry.

111
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,019
If there's nothing else you
want to say, I'll head back now.

112
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,500
About that guy named Yamashita.

113
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You.

114
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,000
You gave up music just to
understand how he felt, didn't you?

115
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,900
But... you really haven't given up at all.

116
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,199
- I've already given up.
- I haven't given up.

117
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,399
- Gave up.
- Didn't give up.

118
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,100
I told you, I've already given up!

119
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Well then...

120
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,600
Is it really that funny to laugh at me?

121
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
No, I'm not laughing at you. I
just think it's really interesting.

122
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
You're really something.

123
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
Doing what you love and
being understood for it.

124
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,060
You've never thought about
giving up photography, have you?

125
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
No.

126
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,300
You're really annoying.

127
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,620
I don't want to have anything
to do with you anymore.

128
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,200
Hey! Don't be mad!

129
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,700
- What kind of face is that? Are you about to cry?
- No way!

130
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,300
You know, your expressions keep changing.
It's really entertaining.

131
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
When I'm with you, I
just start acting weird.

132
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Negative emotions just keep bubbling up.

133
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,840
And then I end up feeling
really miserable about myself.

134
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Yeah.

135
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's nice.

136
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,000
You look really happy.

137
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
I wish I could be like you, too.

138
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,200
Even after doing something that bad.

139
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,400
But I still don't want to be disliked.

140
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
But...

141
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
Do what you love.

142
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,500
But I'll end up being disliked.

143
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,500
So... I have to give it up.

144
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Stop worrying so much about
whether people will dislike you.

145
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,100
What you're feeling isn't
the whole picture, is it?

146
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,000
There are still people out there
who love your music, Hayakawa.

147
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
The most important thing is

148
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,460
you really like it yourself, don't you?

149
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Alright then.

150
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's not about giving up for someone else.

151
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
But rather, it's about
making choices for yourself.

152
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
You belong to yourself, don't you?

153
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,100
I belong to myself.

154
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,689
Alright, alright, alright!
Easy, easy, easy!

155
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,400
I told you, don't do that.

156
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,020
Konno-chan... I'm about to get mad.

157
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,640
Are you going to cry?

158
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:42,719
I'm not going to cry.

159
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Stop messing around!

160
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Alright!

161
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
Let's take a nap.

162
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,060
The weather today is perfect for a nap.

163
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,100
About what happened before...

164
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
So fast...

165
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,900
I'm really sorry.

166
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
And then...

167
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Once again... I'm really sorry.

168
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
You're back.

169
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,100
It's pretty rare for you
to come into this room.

170
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, is that the one I gave you before?

171
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

172
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,100
Can't break this bad habit.

173
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,000
That's good, then.

174
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,200
There's definitely someone out there who
can love even this bad habit of Shuichiro's.

175
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,520
That's what Mom was
thinking when she gave it to you.

176
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,100
Let me explain the conversion
formula and the rewriting formula for d.

177
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,100
The condition for a in d is that it
must be a positive number, not just 1.

178
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
For some reason

179
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,480
things that used to seem so
ordinary now look completely different.

180
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Sorry, Hayakawa, can I borrow
your red pen one more time?

181
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,200
Hayakawa, has anything
good happened to you lately?

182
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
Huh...? No, not at all.

183
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,039
Do you have someone you like?

184
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
- You really have someone you like?
- Really?

185
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,530
No, no, no! Every girl likes this guy.
So there's no way!

186
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm really sorry.

187
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
And then...

188
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Once again... I'm really sorry.

189
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,000
This time... please don't hit me again.

190
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,675
(Next Episode)

191
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,020
If it's just me alone, I don't think I can
keep playing music like this anymore.

192
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,840
Hayakawa's been in pretty good form lately.

193
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,840
Is he dating a girl or something?

194
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,580
We're supposed to be friends,
but it doesn't really feel that way.

195
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,300
That's exactly how I feel.
