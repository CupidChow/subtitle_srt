1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,900
I get really weird when I'm with you.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Negative emotions just keep bubbling up.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,476
And then I start to feel
really miserable about myself.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,200
Stop worrying so much about
whether people will dislike you.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,800
What you're feeling isn't
the whole picture, is it?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are still people out there
who love your music, Hayakawa.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,480
The most important thing is

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
you really like it yourself, don't you?

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,258
Do you have someone you like?

10
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,500
- You really have someone you like?
- Really?

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Do it again.

12
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,193
Sorry for reaching out to you so suddenly.

13
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:46,194
It's all right.

14
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,700
Is something wrong?

15
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
I want to apologize for
what happened last time.

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Sorry.

17
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,980
My attitude was really bad.

18
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,500
No, I was the one who
acted without thinking.

19
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
I was thinking that maybe a
change of environment... might help...

20
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Um...

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm really sorry.

22
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Kohane.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Me...

24
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm planning to give music another try.

25
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,700
It's also because of what you said to me.

26
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,300
So I'm really grateful to you.

27
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,500
Will I be able to hear
your music again, Senpai?

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, I promise you.

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
That's great!

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
It's all thanks to Konno-senpai!

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
That's really great.

32
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,099
To have made such amazing friends!

33
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,500
Friend.

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,239
I'm starving!

35
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,300
Go get changed.

36
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Hayakawa?

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here he comes.

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
Even though we're just friends.

39
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
But...

40
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,400
The feelings I've never dared to
face have suddenly swelled all at once.

41
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,400
"Depth of Field"

42
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,600
(Episode 4)

43
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,700
There are still people out there
who love your music, Hayakawa.

44
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,100
The most important thing is, you
really like it yourself, don't you?

45
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Kon-chan!

46
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,999
Feels like it's been a while since
we last saw each other, right?

47
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:19,023
Is that so?

48
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, right.

49
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
This is for you.

50
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,776
But I bought the wrong one.
It's not the kind you usually drink.

51
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,500
(Banana milk)

52
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:37,800
Is it really that funny?

53
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
- Thanks.
- No problem.

54
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,275
What are you doing?

55
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:49,055
I was thinking of taking some of my old tracks
and adding a bit of arrangement to them.

56
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,900
Can't really make sense of it.

57
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,250
To me, your camera is
even harder to figure out.

58
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,450
Is that so?

59
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,969
Not bad!

60
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,691
Time flies.

61
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,400
Remember to prepare for exams with a plan.

62
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,467
Did you all know?

63
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,667
Alright.

64
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,091
Everyone's high school days have
come to an end in the blink of an eye.

65
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,800
You have to review your
schoolwork every day.

66
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,960
Alright, it can't be helped.
Let's all go study together next.

67
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,640
Hayakawa, do you want to come with us?

68
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
I have something to take
care of somewhere! Sorry!

69
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:45,948
Sorry.

70
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,740
Has Hayakawa been kind of
distant from the group lately?

71
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
That's true.

72
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Good job.

73
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Good job.

74
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
-What's up?

75
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,700
No, it's nothing, just now... You and that
girl from last time seem kind of similar...

76
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,802
She wanted more than just
my thoughts on the photos.

77
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:50,000
She even wanted me to
teach her how to take photos.

78
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,181
I'm not really good enough
to be teaching anyone, though.

79
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
That's all?

80
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah.

81
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,780
What are you talking about!

82
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
No, it's nothing.

83
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,767
She definitely has another motive.

84
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:17,000
And besides, Kon-chan, you
wouldn't pay attention either.

85
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Huh?

86
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,860
By the way, is it really okay for you to be
hanging around here when your exams are coming up?

87
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,000
Kon-chan, aren't you the same?

88
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
So, are you coming?

89
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Huh?

90
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Let's go.

91
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Huh?

92
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,900
Wait a second.

93
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,100
Why choose this place of all places?

94
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
It's nothing...

95
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,700
Completely off guard.

96
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,033
What?

97
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,133
No, not really.

98
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,980
You're not even studying at all.

99
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,600
Right now, I'm more
interested in making music.

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
But I haven't told everyone yet.

101
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,800
Just go at your own pace.

102
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,200
But you can't just keep
running away forever.

103
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,300
And I also want to be able
to honestly say what I like.

104
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,400
And also... I want to go sing
karaoke with everyone, too.

105
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Not bad.

106
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,707
Kon-chan should come along too.

107
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,708
Not going.

108
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah, that's true.

109
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't feel like studying anymore, either.

110
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,500
Hey! Don't go scribbling
on other people's stuff!

111
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
What are you drawing?

112
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
An acorn?

113
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
I'm drawing you.

114
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Held it in!

115
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,200
How much can Kon-chan
really tolerate me and accept me?

116
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I couldn't help but think
about something like that.

117
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,499
- Senior.
- Good morning.

118
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Good morning.

119
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,700
How have you been lately?

120
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,005
No matter how much time I have, it's never
enough, so I want to finish one song first.

121
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,036
Oh! Not bad!

122
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,200
What kind of song is it?

123
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,200
If it were just me alone.

124
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't think I'll ever
make music like this again.

125
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
- Good boy! - I'm not your brother!

126
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,100
It's… that kind of song.

127
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,400
What kind of song is that, exactly?

128
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Stay tuned!

129
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,629
I'm really looking forward to it.

130
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,058
- Finally done with exams.
- Want to go sing karaoke?

131
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,374
Great idea!

132
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,400
Hayakawa! You're not really going, are you?

133
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,100
What song should we sing?

134
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,500
I'll go too.

135
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
KTV

136
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Huh?

137
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,400
- KTV.
- KTV

138
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,568
I'm honestly so moved I could cry!

139
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:25,199
Hey! You were lying when you
said you were tone-deaf, weren't you?

140
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,108
Yeah, Hayakawa, you sing really well!

141
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm not really good at
singing in front of people...

142
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
But...

143
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,600
Actually, I really love singing, and
I've always wanted to go with everyone.

144
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
So...

145
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
thank you.

146
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
You rascal, let's go sing one more time!

147
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,831
Sing it again!

148
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,100
Heading there right away!

149
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,260
Let's do it tomorrow, then.
Let's go tomorrow.

150
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh! Hayakawa!

151
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,600
- Where's Konno?
- He just went out with the underclassman.

152
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,246
The underclassman is...

153
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,446
Yeah, the girl who was wearing the
photography club uniform last time.

154
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,599
Huh? Aren't they dating?

155
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,039
Oh, really? But they do make a good couple.

156
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,880
Yeah, that makes sense.

157
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,400
Nice job, Konno!

158
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,464
Is Konno dating that girl?

159
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:46,606
Whoa, that really shocked me!

160
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:48,348
When did it start?

161
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,380
Thanks for your advice.

162
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,600
No, not really. I was just casually sharing my thoughts.
I didn't actually help much at all.

163
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
That...

164
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Let me treat you to a meal sometime.

165
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,876
Oh, don't worry about it at all!

166
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,600
I didn't really do anything.

167
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
I'll head out now.

168
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,920
You worked hard on the exam.

169
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
I got it right this time.

170
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,800
(Strawberry milk)

171
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Thank you.

172
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't you have plans?

173
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Got plans?

174
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
-Nope.

175
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,920
Speaking of which, just hanging out
here and taking it easy isn't so bad.

176
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,300
But how about grabbing a
meal together sometime?

177
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,200
Oh, not bad!

178
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,228
You look a bit out of it.

179
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:19,500
Did you fail all your exams?

180
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,943
Yeah, that's one of the reasons too.

181
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,100
Is that so?

182
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,075
Don't overthink it.

183
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,562
There's still time before
the exams.

184
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,538
You've only just started getting back to
doing what you really want.

185
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
You've got a point...

186
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,100
After you graduate, you're planning
to pursue photography, right?

187
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,400
- Yeah.
- Don't you ever feel lost?

188
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,700
It's not like I never feel lost.

189
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
How can I become as composed as you?

190
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
You...

191
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,700
Have you ever looked at someone
and thought, "I wish I could be like that"?

192
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Yeah, I have.

193
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,700
But even if I think that way.

194
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,000
But I can't actually become that person.

195
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
You've got a point there.

196
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
And also...

197
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,700
I belong to myself, right?

198
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,700
Feels pretty good!

199
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,000
I said something really impressive.

200
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Hey, Kon-chan!

201
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
What's wrong?

202
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
Actually, this piece is already finished.

203
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,740
If possible, I hope you
can be the first to listen.

204
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Sure!

205
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,989
But maybe it's better for someone
who really gets it to listen, right?

206
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:21,282
I want Kon-chan to hear it.

207
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, got it.

208
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,000
Did you make this?

209
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
You're really amazing!

210
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,700
This... this song...

211
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
I...

212
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,220
I think that's the sense I meant.

213
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
I like Kon-chan.

214
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,200
Hayakawa... you...

215
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,183
(Next Episode)
Was all of that real?

216
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,379
It's not a lie, I've
really thought it through.

217
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:03,590
Hayakawa doesn't need to
escape to the rooftop anymore.

218
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:07,969
As long as the person I meet is someone I
truly like, gender doesn't matter to me at all.

219
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,700
There's something that's
been on my mind for a while.
