1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
At that moment,

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,400
I gave up everything.

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,800
Hayakawa, it's about time you
became mine, don't you think?

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Sure.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,800
You definitely say that to other girls too.

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
You really are a player.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
You've finished.

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,900
Welcome back.

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,500
Even though I should have let it all go.

10
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,060
But I still can't catch my breath.

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,274
Stop messing around.

12
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,417
You look like you could
fall asleep any second!

13
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:09,100
- Haven't I always been like this?
- Hey! I get the feeling someone's watching us.

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,124
Good morning.

15
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,149
Good morning.

16
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,174
Good morning.

17
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,200
Good morning.

18
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:22,505
- Those girls keep staring at me.
- They're probably looking at Hayakawa.

19
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,799
I heard that whenever you talk to
him, he always responds with a smile.

20
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:27,565
So actually, Hayakawa is
pretty popular behind the scenes.

21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,498
Behind the scenes?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,824
- Nice! Hayakawa, you're such a sly one!
- Hayakawa really is popular, just as expected.

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, after school today, let's all go...

24
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
What's wrong, Hayakawa?

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,976
I need to go to the bathroom,
my stomach hurts so much!!!

26
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,729
What's going on?! The morning
assembly is about to start!

27
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,462
I'll be right back.

28
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,200
You really do whatever you want.

29
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,300
I can barely catch my breath.

30
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Got it on camera!

31
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Oh! I took the shot because
your expression was just perfect.

32
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
This was the day.

33
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,018
Focused and dedicated
dedicate to what you love.

34
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,300
I met a man named Konno Ryohei.

35
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,100
"Depth of Field"

36
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,700
From that day on, we
became friends on the rooftop.

37
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,200
(Episode 1)

38
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,220
- Kon-chan, are you like this in the classroom too?
- Yeah... I guess so.

39
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,500
That's just how it is...

40
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Yeah, pretty much.

41
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Do you have any friends?

42
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
None of your business.

43
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
You really love taking photos, don't you?

44
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
It's probably the happiness I
feel when I'm taking photos.

45
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I see.

46
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
I'm jealous.

47
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
What?

48
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
Nah, it's nothing.

49
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh no, I need to get back to class.

50
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,100
Konno, let's skip class.

51
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Sorry, if I skip the
next class, I'm done for.

52
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:28,515
No way!

53
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
No way, no way, no way!

54
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
What about you? Are
you heading back to class?

55
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
Hey, hurry up and pull me up!

56
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,916
Otherwise, we're going to be late.

57
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:59,000
The relationships between the trigonometric
functions are these three: sine, cosine, and tangent.

58
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,860
Hayakawa, can I borrow
your red pen for a moment?

59
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
You can figure out the other two values.

60
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,600
You have to remember this.

61
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,600
During this era, people's lives
also underwent significant changes.

62
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,740
That's right.

63
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:27,141
One of these changes was the
adoption of the solar calendar.

64
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Before that, Japan had always used a
calendar known as the lunisolar calendar.

65
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,200
This is a calendar system based on the phases of
the moon, so the length of a year isn't fixed.

66
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,415
Hey! Don't jump the gun, Hayakawa!

67
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,091
Everyone's going to karaoke later.

68
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,964
If it's karaoke, sorry,
I might have to pass.

69
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,880
You're tone-deaf, right?
We don't care about that at all.

70
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,650
No, no, it's not that I can't sing.
I just don't really like singing.

71
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,450
So I'll sit this one out this time.

72
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,617
You're really not a team player.

73
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,141
Alright! I got it.

74
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,799
Other than singing, I'm
good with any other activity.

75
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Also, the teacher asked me to see
him today, so I really can't make it.

76
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,542
- Then let's go grab something to eat.
- Sure! Let's eat, let's eat!

77
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:19,383
- Let's go eat at the usual spot.
- Sure! Let's go have hamburger steak.

78
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Hey!

79
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,220
You don't actually dislike singing, do you?

80
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
You probably still like it a lot, right?

81
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,420
I think you sing really well. Go ahead
and enjoy karaoke without worrying.

82
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,200
So you actually heard it yesterday.

83
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
And you, too.

84
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,600
Are you always this cheeky?

85
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,162
Goofing around with that cheeky grin...

86
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:06,300
Don't do that anymore.

87
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,400
You actually look more normal here.

88
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
Is it really that exaggerated?

89
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Yeah.

90
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,340
Always comforting others, but in the end,
aren't you the one who ends up the most exhausted?

91
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Mm... thank you.

92
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
That's exactly how it is.

93
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,200
When I grow up, I'll get plastic surgery
to look like the kind of face Kon-chan likes.

94
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,700
That's not what I meant.

95
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
How should I put it...

96
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
When I'm with Kon-chan

97
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
sometimes I just feel really frustrated.

98
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
You're so annoying!

99
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,099
- Hayakawa! Why haven't you gone back yet?
- Hey there.

100
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,500
- Is something up?
- Nah, nothing. I'm just bored and wandering around.

101
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Well then...

102
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you want to go again?

103
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
The rain has stopped.

104
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hayakawa.

105
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Does it feel good?

106
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
That scared me.

107
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's nothing.

108
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,600
Kon-chan...

109
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,400
Would you also do these kinds
of naughty things with girls?

110
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Why does this feel a little off?

111
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,200
Why

112
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
makes me think...

113
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
What's this?

114
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,300
How should I put it... it's just that...

115
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,099
Hush money?

116
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
That's how it is.

117
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,800
But seriously, doing that with
your girlfriend in a place like that...

118
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,220
You've really got some guts.

119
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,193
No... we're not dating.

120
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:00,900
What you did

121
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
i it were me, my parents
would've killed me by now.

122
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,200
My parents are really strict.

123
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's great.

124
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,500
- Kon-chan, you're still the same with me.
- What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,100
Everything should have
already been given up.

126
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Hayakawa, you know, you kind
of remind me of my little brother.

127
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Huh?

128
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,976
When something happens, he just
shuts himself off and doesn't say a word.

129
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,240
It takes quite a bit of
time to get him to open up.

130
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,400
So you have a younger brother.

131
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
He's eleven this year.

132
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
So he's an elementary school student.

133
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
So sleepy.

134
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,523
I'm going to sleep a bit more.

135
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah, good night.

136
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,200
Should I wake you up in a bit?

137
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
Out like a light.

138
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,300
If it gets broken, will you be mad?

139
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,400
What a beautiful face.

140
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,486
Ah! Damn, it didn't go in.

141
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,810
One more ball.

142
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,813
Honestly, this is probably the last
time we'll get to play together like this.

143
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,200
That's really sad.

144
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,776
Has everyone already
decided to keep studying?

145
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,770
- For now, yeah.
- Yeah, I'm going to a culinary school.

146
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:28,771
What about Hayakawa?

147
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,033
I haven't really thought that far yet.

148
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,753
Because there's nothing in
particular I really want to do.

149
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Are you always this goofy and carefree?

150
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,344
Goofing around with that cheeky grin...

151
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:43,345
Don't do that anymore.

152
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Your expression here
looks a lot more normal.

153
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Hayakawa passes the ball!

154
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Sink the final shot.

155
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,199
Ah, let's not decide the
match with the last point.

156
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,655
You're making fun of me.

157
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:01,566
You're laughing at me.

158
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,021
Are you making fun of me?

159
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:02,400
That's not it.

160
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,458
No, no, that's not it.

161
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,459
Can someone make a move?

162
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,200
I know...

163
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Why?

164
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:27,268
Good morning! Why are
you reacting so strongly?

165
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:28,747
Good morning...

166
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,524
See you on the rooftop in a bit.

167
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Alright.

168
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,200
We're just “rooftop friends.”

169
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,635
(Next Episode)
It's not like I'm doing this because I like it.

170
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,908
Does saying those things
make it any easier for you?

171
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:54,700
Kon-chan, you... you're
always this straightforward.

172
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Senior, are you still
staying away from music?

173
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,685
It was all a lie.

174
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,526
It's your straightforward attitude
that really gets on people's nerves.

175
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,020
I just... when it comes to you...
