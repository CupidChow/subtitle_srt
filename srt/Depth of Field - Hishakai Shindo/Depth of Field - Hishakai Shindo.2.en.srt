1
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Why?

2
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,160
- Hey! You're so late.
- You're leaving already?

3
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,500
I have to work part-time, but honestly,
I'm just helping out my dad, so the pay isn't much.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I see...

5
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,900
I'm not your little brother!

6
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm heading out, then.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
Ryohei, did you get taller again?

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,920
You're getting more and more like your dad.

9
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,233
Oh right, I got a call
from New York yesterday.

10
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,544
Leave everything about Mr. Tada to me.

11
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:12,700
What are you talking about! I'm
supposed to be your coach here.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Speaking of which, you'll be a
senior in high school next year, right?

13
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,597
What are your plans for the future?

14
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:24,701
I want to apply to a university
with a photography department.

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,220
Oh, you're still as focused as ever.

16
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,000
That's pretty normal, isn't it?

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Ordinary? Not everyone in
this world is like you, you know.

18
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,100
"Depth of Field"

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,500
(Episode 2)

20
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,671
What's that?

21
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,420
The homeroom teacher asked me to submit some
photos that can be used for promo for the school.

22
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,930
I'm being treated like a total gofer.

23
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,295
Are these the photos you
usually take with your camera?

24
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,108
Yeah, they are.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let me take a look.

26
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
It doesn't matter.

27
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Is something wrong?

28
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
These are really well shot.

29
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,599
These photos are absolutely amazing.

30
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,233
I'm really moved.

31
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:37,433
I'm really moved.

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm really moved.

33
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Thank you.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,816
Then... why are you drifting
further and further away from me?

35
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm not drifting further away
from you! Really, I'm not.

36
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm not drifting further away...

37
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I really haven't.

38
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,529
- Wait!
- I'll pay you back, I promise!

39
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,900
- Hold on a second!
- Hurry up!

40
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Alright.

41
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
What's wrong?

42
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,420
Sometimes you're really a
strange one, you know that?

43
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
So-so.

44
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
When did you start
getting into photography?

45
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,660
I probably started back
in elementary school.

46
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Break time

47
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,767
I've always been taking photos of
the playground equipment on campus.

48
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,511
You really don't have many friends, do you?

49
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,980
I told you to mind your own business.

50
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
Is your camera pretty old too?

51
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Yeah, it was passed down
to me from my parents.

52
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,360
Do you want to give it a try?

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,761
Huh? Why does the whole
scene look blurry today?

54
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:49,762
Today?

55
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,800
- Nah.
- Probably just missed the focus.

56
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Focus?

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Come here.

58
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Use your left hand.

59
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,400
Look through the viewfinder.

60
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,700
- How is it?
- Got it, it's in focus now.

61
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
But everything around it is blurred.

62
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Let me take a look.

63
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,883
Ah! That's because the
depth of field is pretty shallow.

64
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,500
So this kind of blur actually
becomes a unique feature.

65
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,500
Kon-chan has always been straightforward.

66
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
How about you, Hayakawa?

67
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,281
Is there anything you've been
doing since you were a kid?

68
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Ah... music.

69
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,871
- What do you mean?
- Because you're always singing.

70
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,011
And you sing so well, too.

71
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,371
Singing again.

72
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
So gross.

73
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,300
It's honestly pretty gross.

74
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
You're back.

75
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
What's wrong?

76
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Got called disgusting again.

77
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Singing during class.

78
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
Got scolded by the teacher, too.

79
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
I really have been holding it in.

80
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,700
Don't cry anymore.

81
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Oh, right. Mom's got something good for you.

82
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Don't cry, don't cry now.

83
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,700
- Here you go.
- What's this?

84
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,700
Try to hold back from singing during class.

85
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,200
When class is over, just sing
into this and record your songs.

86
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,400
This way, we can keep all the songs
you create safe and sound, right?

87
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,000
I think it's wonderful that
you love to sing.

88
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look.

89
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Press here.

90
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Try recording and see how it goes.

91
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,300
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,100
Stop, play.

93
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,400
- Amazing!
- Right?

94
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
And also, if you're willing...

95
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm not going to show any
special favoritism toward you.

96
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,529
You have to learn it on your own.

97
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,029
Okay.

98
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,000
Yamashita, how do you
practice to play so well?

99
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
Go ask the coach.

100
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Isn't she your mom?

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
I want to learn from Yamashita.

102
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,500
Break down the piece,
then play it in your own way.

103
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
That's really impressive!

104
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,100
Dad! Mom! Look, I won the championship!

105
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,870
You really gave it your all.

106
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,756
Let's celebrate together when we get home.

107
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:49,300
Yeah.

108
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm going to say goodbye to everyone.

109
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
That kind of award
doesn't mean anything at all.

110
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,423
If you want to keep playing
piano, you have to show results.

111
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:08,700
Didn't Mom say that?

112
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,132
Okay.

113
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,200
Sorry.

114
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,700
Why Hayakawa?

115
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,860
Do you want to try a
different piano school?

116
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
That kid definitely got special treatment.

117
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Hayakawa.

118
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,100
Hayakawa's performance
was really great.

119
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
It's all thanks to you, Yama-chan.

120
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,100
What kind of nickname is that?

121
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,300
All this time.

122
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
Thank you for your guidance.

123
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
I should be the one thanking you.

124
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Take care of yourself.

125
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,064
Huh?

126
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,500
Has Yama-chan already gone back?

127
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,200
Yamashita has decided
to leave the piano class.

128
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Huh?

129
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,257
It seems like it's because
of some issues at home.

130
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,300
I heard they're even
getting rid of the piano.

131
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,300
That's really a shame.

132
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
He always looked so happy
when he was playing the piano.

133
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,500
Shu!

134
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
Wait, Yama-chan.

135
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What's wrong?

136
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
My dad has a guitar.

137
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,800
So... um...

138
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,100
I think playing the guitar
must be a lot of fun too.

139
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,100
What are you talking about?

140
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
I just came up with a great idea.

141
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Will you start a band with me?

142
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Huh?

143
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:36,800
Yama-chan plays the
piano, and I'll play the guitar.

144
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,975
So...

145
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Yama-chan is always welcome
to come play the piano at my place.

146
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's do it together.

147
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,220
Let's start a band together.

148
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Hayakawa?

149
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Hayakawa!

150
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,686
Hey!

151
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:28,900
Are you okay?

152
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not really sure, but are you the kind of
person who feels better after talking things out?

153
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,038
Kon-chan, you're really a good person.

154
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,568
- You think of me as your brother again?
- That's not the case.

155
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:49,486
- Bro~ - Cut it out! You're just
trying to change the subject again.

156
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,324
Can I come over to your place today?

157
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,600
Yeah, come over if you want.

158
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,040
Ah! I said the wrong thing!

159
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,300
Said it wrong?

160
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,200
No, that's not it. I was
just imitating how girls talk.

161
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,624
What the heck!

162
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,500
So? Do you want to come
over to my place or not?

163
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,500
I should be happy when I'm with Kon-chan.

164
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,900
Why am I feeling so restless?

165
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:28,734
Right?

166
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:29,734
That's right.

167
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,600
Hey! Hayakawa, wait up!

168
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,681
Konno! So you have other
friends besides us, huh?

169
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,683
Isn't that the Prince of
Smiles from Class 3?

170
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,845
What's that?

171
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,725
- That nickname is super lame, isn't it?
- It's not lame at all! I came up with it.

172
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:45,351
Sorry, can we talk about this tomorrow?

173
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,272
Alright! Sorry for making
an unreasonable request.

174
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:50,669
No worries! This guy
just loves helping others.

175
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,100
Yeah! Konno.

176
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
I'll ask for your help again next time.

177
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,018
Of course I have friends.

178
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,100
Kon-chan is always the same, no
matter who he's with or where he is.

179
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
She's different from me.

180
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,100
Hey! Don't walk so fast.

181
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,578
Kon-chan's friends look really energetic.

182
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:16,742
The girl who showed you the photo.
Was she a junior?

183
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:20,052
Yeah, she said she wanted to
hear what I thought about the photo.

184
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:23,600
It's the first time anyone's said that to me.
It feels so weird.

185
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:24,524
That's great!

186
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Senior Hayakawa.

187
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Kohane.

188
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Long time no see.

189
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
I've always wanted to say hi to you.

190
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What's wrong?

191
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Senpai, you...

192
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Are you still not playing music these days?

193
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah, I haven't been playing anymore.

194
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,920
- So you're not singing or playing guitar anymore?
- Nope, I'm not doing any of that now.

195
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
I

196
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,800
Back in junior high, I joined the music
club because I admired your band.

197
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,466
I've always loved the
songs you wrote the most.

198
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,233
I see.

199
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:10,867
Thank you.

200
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,427
But I'm not writing music anymore.

201
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
See you.

202
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Please come in.

203
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,260
Go on in first, just head up
the stairs and you'll be there.

204
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,420
A room that really reflects his style.

205
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Seriously... this is so infuriating.

206
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,940
What are you doing?

207
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,300
Have a seat wherever you like.

208
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,700
Hmm, you're acting even
stranger than usual today.

209
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,620
If there's anything on
your mind, I'm here to listen.

210
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Nothing.

211
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,114
This is really impressive.

212
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:58,938
Have you already decided
on your future path?

213
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
What?

214
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
You...

215
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Full of lies!

216
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,313
What lies?

217
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,100
That look just now.

218
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
And just now, too.

219
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
That junior high underclassman

220
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,435
- said something about a band or whatever.
- Just forget about that.

221
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,700
If you want to play dumb, go ahead.

222
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,692
If you keep putting on that carefree smile,
you'll just end up pushing yourself into a corner.

223
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
It's nothing...

224
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,211
If it hurts, then stop doing it.

225
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:39,212
That's just how it is.

226
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,220
It's not like I'm doing
this because I enjoy it.

227
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,500
Then just don't do it.

228
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:48,051
Telling lies I don't even want to say,
I just don't get the point.

229
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,272
You wouldn't understand!!

230
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,400
Not everyone can be like you
able to do whatever they want, whenever they want.

231
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
What does that mean?

232
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,400
So, do you feel accepted
the way you are now?

233
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,799
Are you just going to keep going through
life with that goofy grin on your face?

234
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,052
You're so annoying.

235
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,500
It's your straightforward attitude
that really gets on my nerves.

236
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,580
Will beating me up really
make you feel better?

237
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm just worried about you, Hayakawa...

238
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Are you shaken?

239
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Kon-chan...

240
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,780
Do you want to have sex with me?

241
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Sex.

242
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,038
(Next Episode Preview)
Being with Konno makes me feel so strange.

243
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,030
What's going on with Shuichiro?

244
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:09,312
I feel really uncomfortable.
What should I do?

245
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,506
There will definitely be
people who like Shuichiro.

246
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,800
This isn't someone else's;
you are your own person.
