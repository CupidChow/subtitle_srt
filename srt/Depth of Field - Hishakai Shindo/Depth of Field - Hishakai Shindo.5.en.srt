1
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,400
This is your doing.

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
You're really amazing!

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
I... this song.

4
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,599
I...

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
I think that's the sense I meant.

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,700
I like...

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Hayakawa... you...

8
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
Um...

9
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,500
Are you serious?

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Are you serious?

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,000
So gross.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Just kidding! I was messing with you.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,065
Because Kon-chan, you never
talk about girls at all.

14
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:11,751
I thought you might be into guys, but it
looks like that's not the case!

15
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:13,900
- No...
- I'm really sorry.

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm a pretty easygoing person
so I'll give anyone a quick kiss, really.

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,481
I'll be more careful next time!

18
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:24,681
I'll head out first.

19
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,900
Hey! Hayakawa.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
From this day on,

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,600
Hayakawa never came to the rooftop again.

22
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,700
"Depth of Field"

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,699
(Episode 5)

24
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Konno.

25
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
Hey! Konno.

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,860
You're going to be late for class.

27
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,986
Oh, right!

28
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:49,423
We're about to go take some photos for
our assignment. Do you want to come?

29
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,400
Ah! I have to work today.

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,944
- Is it at Tada-san's place?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,500
Let's talk about it next time then...

32
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
I guess you can't really say that anymore.

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah.

34
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
Let's all get together again sometime!

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Ryohei, you've really packed
your schedule with part-time jobs!

36
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,439
Is it really okay to just leave
your girlfriend hanging like that?

37
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,585
We broke up a long time ago.

38
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,921
Huh? When did that happen?

39
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:30,070
Is it that one? The girl you
dated back in junior high,

40
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,321
the one you broke up with and
then got back together with, right?

41
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,948
How do you remember that so clearly?

42
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:34,760
What does it matter?

43
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:38,268
- I just love hearing about relationship gossip.
- Wait, what? Relationship gossip?

44
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,476
I want in on this too.

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Even Ume-san is joining in on the fun, give me a break!

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Hey, so why did you two break up?

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Is it because you're always too
busy playing with your camera?

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Hmm... Yeah, that was definitely
the case back in middle school.

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,900
But... this time, it
feels a little different.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
Three years apart,
I'm sure we've both changed a lot.

51
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,200
I see.

52
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,666
See more, listen more, and experience more.

53
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,500
For you,

54
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,600
this experience from high
school might have had a big impact.

55
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,300
For just a casual chat while standing
around, this topic sure goes pretty deep.

56
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,300
How about the three of
us go grab a drink later?

57
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,739
I'm in.

58
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,900
Let's go to that one! The
izakaya with island cuisine.

59
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,155
- Not bad!
- Right?

60
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Hayakawa...

61
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,200
There's no need to escape
to the rooftop anymore.

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,138
Oh right, I went to karaoke with Hayakawa
again yesterday, just the two of us.

63
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,600
- Huh, really? Invite me too!
- For real.

64
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,615
Let's all go together next time!

65
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:18,608
What about today?
Today?

66
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:19,815
Not today.
Come on, let's go!

67
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:21,600
Singing karaoke today!

68
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,283
I can't make it today.
I really can't do it!

69
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,717
Why, though?

70
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,000
And just like that, graduation arrived.

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
It's just...

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,700
That face of his,

73
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,500
it's always been weighing on my mind.

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
Cheers!

75
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
Drink up a little more!

76
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Today's all about cheering
you up after your breakup.

77
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,700
I told you, that was a long time ago.

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,300
Hey, Ryohei! Now that you're single,
how about giving it a shot with me?

79
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Ume-chan, you sure are straightforward!

80
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Ume-san, the person
you like isn't me, right?

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,743
Ah! I've been found out.

82
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:35,744
Huh?

83
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,867
Could it be that Ume-chan
has someone he likes?

84
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:39,976
Who is it? Who is it?

85
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,300
It's nothing!

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,500
Alright then... I'll just ask straight out.
Ume-chan, do you like guys?

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,886
Because you joke around like that with both
guys and girls, it really makes me curious.

88
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,598
Do you actually like boys or girls?

89
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,600
Hmm... Do I really have to decide?

90
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,581
It doesn't really matter whether
you like guys or girls, right?

91
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,417
If I fall for someone of the
opposite sex, then I'm straight.

92
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,574
If it's someone of the
same sex, then I'm gay.

93
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,300
As long as I meet someone amazing,
I can go with whatever their gender is.

94
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Ume-san.

95
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,100
You're amazing.

96
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,779
Let's give dating a try!

97
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,019
No, that's not it! What I mean is...

98
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,400
Hey! So, what does that mean...?

99
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,272
-What's that supposed to mean?

100
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,912
What are the chances we
could actually start dating?

101
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:45,913
Zero.

102
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
That was a lightning-fast answer!

103
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,206
So delicious!

104
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,865
Thank you for hosting me today.

105
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
We can still go for another round!

106
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,386
- Hold on, I want to take some photos around here.
- Still as dedicated as ever!

107
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:06,526
After all, I won't be able to
capture this view again for a while.

108
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,900
Ryohei.

109
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Don't just take pictures of the scenery all the
time, try shooting people once in a while, too!

110
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,504
You have to focus on the
ever-changing hearts of people.

111
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,286
It's tough, but that's exactly
what makes it so interesting.

112
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah... I get that too.

113
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,820
Is there something that's
been weighing on your mind?

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
No, not really...

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's a pretty good
photography gig this time.

116
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:41,800
I've also invited Minami.

117
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,340
If you're interested, would
you like to come along?

118
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,767
This is my first time shooting a concert.

119
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,800
Thank you so much for the invitation.

120
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,249
Even though they're an indie
band, they seem to be pretty popular.

121
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,947
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

122
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,500
Ah! Konno will be coming too, right?

123
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,800
Hmm... I just thought it would be a
good experience for him, so I invited him.

124
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,400
But it seems like he's not really
interested. He probably overslept.

125
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,640
With his personality, it really
wouldn't be surprising if he overslept!

126
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,380
Why not try shooting some
portraits once in a while?

127
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:20,035
Excuse me, can I still go in now?

128
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm Konno, here for photography.

129
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
Let me check, please wait a moment.

130
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,100
What's your connection to this band?

131
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,000
A photographer friend of mine
knows the bassist in the band.

132
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Tada-san.

133
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,577
What's wrong?

134
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,537
Even though it's a
bit late to say this now.

135
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
But it's not my first time meeting
the band's lead singer, Hayakawa.

136
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Huh?

137
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,179
Great job.

138
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,512
Thanks for helping out with the filming.

139
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:41,983
No worries, you worked hard too!

140
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,222
Sorry, I just couldn't find the place,
so we had to come to my place instead.

141
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,949
Really sorry about that.

142
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Hello.

143
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Good night.

144
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Kon-chan...

145
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,800
I didn't expect Hayakawa and
Konno-kun to be classmates.

146
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,203
Seriously, they say it's a small
world, but this is just unbelievable!

147
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:06,200
Yeah, it really is!

148
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,660
It's not often we get this chance.
Please tell me your contact information.

149
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,813
I might have to trouble you with
a lot more things in the future.

150
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,000
Of course, no problem.

151
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you.

152
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Alright, it worked.

153
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Does Hayakawa know?

154
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,900
No, I don't know.

155
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,585
What's wrong?

156
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,400
Aren't you two pretty close?

157
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,120
Well... I still have work,
so I have to head out first.

158
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,389
Leaving so soon?

159
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,500
I'll let you young folks have your fun.

160
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,866
Great job! See you!

161
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:53,906
I'll walk you out.

162
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:54,907
Thank you.

163
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,487
You guys did great.

164
00:15:58,488 --> 00:15:59,574
That was absolutely amazing.

165
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,575
That's great!

166
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
I watched the concert.

167
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Yeah.

168
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,400
You've really stuck with it.

169
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
You too.

170
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
You haven't changed a bit.

171
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,000
You cut your hair short.

172
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,039
Because it's easier to wash my hair.

173
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,200
- So why did you keep it long before?
- Because getting a haircut was a hassle.

174
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,500
That's such a Konno answer.

175
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,899
Thanks for waiting.

176
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,342
- Konno, do you drink alcohol?
- Oh! I do.

177
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,500
Then let's drink to our heart's content.

178
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Even though Tada-san is treating us.

179
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,244
If you miss the last train, just stay over!

180
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,126
But this is my place!

181
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,226
Is that not okay?

182
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,337
It's not like it's impossible...

183
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,328
Alright, it's settled then!

184
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,962
Cheers!

185
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,908
When did you start
getting into photography?

186
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:54,949
I'm going to the restroom.

187
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,255
Huh?

188
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:57,736
What do you usually take pictures of?

189
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,329
What?

190
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,135
What do you usually shoot?

191
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:03,779
Playground equipment on campus.

192
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:04,979
Playground equipment?

193
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,367
By the way, how long has
your band been together?

194
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:38,566
This three-member lineup has been
together for a little over two years now.

195
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:44,121
He originally played with Iriya, the
drummer, but Iriya isn't here today.

196
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:49,700
Later, we were looking for a vocalist who
could also play guitar, and we met Hayakawa.

197
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,250
Even though I'm the band leader, he's the
one who really takes charge of composing.

198
00:18:56,617 --> 00:19:00,016
I guess you could say we just follow
the direction Hayakawa wants to go.

199
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Oh, really?

200
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,499
What was he like in high school?

201
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
He doesn't really talk to me much. Did he ever sing
at events like the school festival or anything?

202
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,192
Ah... Even though he never really
did anything that showey,

203
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I think.

204
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,500
He faces music and himself
with complete honesty.

205
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,100
All I know is that lately,
Hayakawa feels full of freshness.

206
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,700
On the other hand,

207
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,600
I have absolutely no idea what
Hayakawa has been like lately.

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Sorry, did I wake you?

209
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,100
Where did you just go?

210
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,480
I went to the convenience store for a bit.

211
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
You took that long to buy something!

212
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,500
I've always... been bothered by something.

213
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
The reason you stopped
coming to the rooftop.

214
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,900
Think about your reason
for staying there, Hayakawa.

215
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,500
I just feel like that's
not really a bad thing.

216
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
But...

217
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,600
I've always had it on my mind.

218
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Hayakawa.

219
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,340
Was what you said back then really a lie?

220
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I...

221
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,300
I think that's what I meant.

222
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,300
I like Kon-chan.

223
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,922
What happened back then...

224
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:56,300
If it wasn't a lie, would
you seriously consider it?

225
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,100
You go to bed first! I'm
going to take a shower.

226
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Hayakawa.

227
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,292
It's really great to see you again.

228
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,100
There's a side of Hayakawa
I don't know over there.

229
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,300
It feels like I've seen how much he's
grown and changed over these three years.

230
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,100
What are you laughing at?

231
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
It's nothing.

232
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,000
Hey! I have a small favor to ask you.

233
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,011
The lead singer of that band
last time is your friend, right?

234
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,400
Yeah.

235
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,000
I want to see that person one more time.

236
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
What?

237
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,200
No matter what, I just want
to see him one more time.

238
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,509
(Final Episode)
I've always wanted to talk to you again.

239
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,453
I thought I had to keep it hidden.

240
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:21,133
Is this just the kind of affection you have
for a friend? Or is it something more...?

241
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,576
Maybe it's just an illusion
from being apart for so long.

242
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
No turning back.

243
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:27,200
Konno has already gone to New York.
