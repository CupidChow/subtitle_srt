=Hello Mr. Gu=

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,775
=Episode 2=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
(One is proven wrong too soon.)

31
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,680
Marry me.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,360
Why must you marry me?

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,959
We have only known each
other for a few days.

34
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,519
It's because I am handsome, outstanding

35
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,639
and blind.

36
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,320
You've stepped on my foot.

37
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,559
Make way.

38
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,639
Mr. Gu.

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,279
Mr. Gu.

40
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,039
Mr. Gu.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,919
Mr. Gu had an accident
when he was young.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,520
He'll be facing stress

43
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,199
once relevant memory is triggered.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,919
It will happen more frequently
when he is stressed out.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,039
He might even faint.

46
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,399
Therefore, he tries to avoid
this kind of situation.

47
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,759
He even needs me to speak

48
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,360
for him in a meeting.

49
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,559
Who is the patient's family member?

50
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,119
Me.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,639
Do you know whether

52
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,320
the patient is allergic to any medicine?

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
He has an allergy

54
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,279
of penicillin

55
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,240
and adrenocortical hormone.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
He had a serious cold two days ago.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,160
He took cephalosporin.

58
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,720
Please take note of it.

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,440
Okay.

60
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,759
Come with me to sign a document.

61
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,199
Okay.

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360
(An assistant who can
do that much for him.)

63
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,279
(They're)

64
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,880
(certainly intimate.)

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Sorry.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
I really had no idea of your illness,

67
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,759
but I'll be responsible for it.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
Can you marry me then?

69
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't you want to be responsible?

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,440
It's not that.

71
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I don't need anything.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
I just need you to marry me.

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Mother.

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't mind me.

75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,119
Carry on.

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,279
Go on.

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,399
Mother.

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't get me wrong.

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,679
Do you want to propose or not?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,359
If not, do it another day then.

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,720
You're Nanzhou's girlfriend, aren't you?

82
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,679
You're

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,600
quite beautiful.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,200
What is your name?

85
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,480
How old are you?

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,720
What do you do?

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,399
Mother.

88
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,399
She is Zhou Jianqing.

89
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,119
She's 22 years old.

90
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,399
She's a senior student
of Nancheng University.

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,720
She's so young.

92
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,279
You...

93
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,640
It's fine.

94
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,640
Difference of a few years is fine.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,119
Well,

96
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,239
an older man is more loving.

97
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,119
Qingqing, right?

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,119
Qingqing.

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,519
What are you studying?

100
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,600
How did you meet Nanzhou?

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,239
He and I...

102
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,320
I'll triple the service charge.

103
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,160
Aunt,

104
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,160
I study arts and design.

105
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,640
I met him at work.

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,519
Back in the company,

107
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,559
I learnt about his comment on my comic.

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,519
He gave me a deep impression.

109
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,279
You can even draw comic.

110
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,640
You're considered

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,440
to be in the same field as Nanzhou.

112
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,959
He has a girlfriend at last.

113
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,799
I won't have insomnia anymore.

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,519
Didn't Nanzhou have
any girlfriend before this?

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,320
I'd never

116
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
seen one after so many years

117
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,399
and he had been putting
blind dates on hold.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I was so worried.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,519
That's not right.

120
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:57,920
Mother.

121
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,399
Don't you have
a yoga class in the evening?

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,320
Xiaochuan.

123
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,519
Send my mother to her yoga class.

124
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay.

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
Qingqing.

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,799
Are you free tomorrow?

127
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,799
I'm quite busy this afternoon.

128
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,920
If you are free tomorrow,

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
let's chat over a meal.

130
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,239
Sure, aunt.

131
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,200
I'll surely

132
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,239
have the time for you.

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,760
Wonderful.

134
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,119
Nanzhou, remember to pick up
Qingqing tomorrow.

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
If you feel better,

136
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,799
you should see her off.

137
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,279
Got it, mother.

138
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,480
I have a class this afternoon.

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,279
See you tomorrow.

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,359
Bye.

141
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,079
Aunt, let's go.

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,679
Mr. Gu.

143
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,760
Let's talk about
the service charge tomorrow.

144
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,799
Well,

145
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm curious.

146
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,920
You used to pursue me aggressively.

147
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,679
You are not into me, right?

148
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,760
I knew it.

149
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,200
Unless one is blind,

150
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,799
everyone can tell that you dislike me.

151
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Why would you pursue me suddenly?

152
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,119
Was it

153
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,760
a personal reason?

154
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,279
You can put it that way.

155
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,799
You want us to get married,

156
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,799
but you don't need us to go on a date

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,920
and be a real married couple, right?

158
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,079
Yes, you're right.

159
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,440
I just need you to marry me

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,799
and let me take care of you.

161
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm glad that I'm smart.

162
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,720
Other girls

163
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,760
would have been deceived
by your handsome face.

164
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,839
I can give you a safe and stable life

165
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,239
for the rest of your life.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sorry.

167
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,200
The price of simply marrying
someone is too high,

168
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,399
especially when it's someone like you.

169
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,839
I'm a sought-after bachelor,

170
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,920
the perfect choice
for getting a husband.

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,559
Actually,

172
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,320
marriage is not as
complicated as you think.

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,399
So long as we can look after each other

174
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,320
and need each other,

175
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,600
we can achieve a perfect marriage.

176
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,359
I think it's impossible for us

177
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,320
after learning your view of marriage.

178
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,359
I'll come to pick you up
at 11:30am tomorrow.

179
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,279
Sure. See you tomorrow.

180
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,359
Qingqing.

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Qingqing.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
Be honest.

183
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,799
What happened?

184
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,640
Wasn't he the handsome man
who proposed the other day?

185
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,799
Have you really gotten together?

186
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,359
Not bad.

187
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,039
Don't get the wrong idea.

188
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,479
You're not a good friend.

189
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,359
You wouldn't have

190
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,919
gotten off his car if you're unrelated.

191
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,200
You must have accepted him

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
after he pursued you so passionately.

193
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,239
That's right.

194
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,440
When have you gotten into a relationship

195
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
and what's the progress?

196
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,679
We didn't start. Nothing is going on.

197
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,440
It's impossible.

198
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,080
He is urged to get married
by his family.

199
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,479
I'm pretending to be his
girlfriend temporarily.

200
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,719
He's so handsome.

201
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,479
Does he need anyone to
pretend to be his girlfriend?

202
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,320
I know, right?

203
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
He doesn't like me.

204
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
He is only acting like
he is pursuing me.

205
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,840
Is it true?

206
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
I'll tell you the truth.

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,679
It can't be.

208
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,960
How is it possible?

209
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,200
He is so handsome.

210
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,239
Exactly.

211
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,559
You should've taken
psychotherapy earlier.

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
I told you before

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
that it's a psychogenic disease.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,479
It can't be cured with
complimentary medicine alone.

215
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,960
It might even lead to drug dependence.

216
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,520
It's unnecessary.

217
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,440
Doctor,

218
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,719
you just need to
prescribe medicine today.

219
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,200
Mr. Chen.

220
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,359
You have yet to delete the video

221
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:39,919
with the ID 4586279.

222
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,719
Yes, thank you.

223
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:42,960
It's really violated

224
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,239
Mr. Gu's portrait rights

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,320
and it has a bad impact
on Gu Group and Xingyun.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,719
Yes, thank you.

227
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,320
Thank you.

228
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,080
Marry me.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,479
Has Nanzhou proposed to the girl?

230
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,479
She has yet to say yes.

231
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,559
Is Nanzhou serious?

232
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,880
He is determined to marry her anyway.

233
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
Are you wearing this to meet my mother?

234
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
I was dressed even
more casually yesterday.

235
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,559
Do as I say later.

236
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,159
Give my mother a good impression.

237
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,799
I don't want to marry into your family.

238
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Why should I impress her?

239
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,159
Moreover,

240
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,200
isn't it better if your
mother doesn't like me?

241
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,440
No one will urge you to get married.

242
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,039
You've arrived.

243
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,400
Aunt.

244
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,840
Why didn't you order first?

245
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,719
Qingqing,

246
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,320
this isn't our first meeting.

247
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Take it easy.

248
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,000
Take a seat.

249
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay.

250
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,679
Mother, what would you like to eat?

251
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,159
Anything.

252
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,039
Order a glass of tomato juice.

253
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,719
Two glasses.

254
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,000
By the way,

255
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
I forgot to ask you yesterday.

256
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,080
What do you want to do after graduation?

257
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,919
I want to do something
related to animation.

258
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,280
Then join Xingyun.

259
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,559
You can assist Nanzhou in the future.

260
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,080
-It's all right.
-Forget it.

261
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,039
Her drawing style is different

262
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,840
from Xingyun's.

263
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,200
That's right.

264
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,320
Nanzhou has great pursuit of art

265
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
and he has high standards.

266
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,000
My work

267
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
is certainly not up to his standard.

268
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,919
What do you usually like to draw?

269
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,599
Romance comic.

270
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,000
Something like the richest
man in the world

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,559
falling for a broke university student.

272
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
To please the girl,

273
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,679
he brings a company

274
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,640
down effortlessly.

275
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,919
Is that

276
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,799
your preference?

277
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,320
She wants to seek opportunities
to train herself.

278
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,640
It's not that.

279
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
It's just to make money.

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,280
Do you need money that much?

281
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,400
She is a very self-disciplined girl.

282
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,119
She earns her own
pocket money and tuition fees.

283
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Anyway, I need money.

284
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,440
Walk a dog.

285
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,919
Food delivery.

286
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,200
Printing service.

287
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Save a seat for someone.

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,719
Be a tutor and so on.

289
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,599
I accept whatever job for money.

290
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,159
Qingqing.

291
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,599
Stop talking.

292
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,719
If you go on,

293
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
I'll feel bad.

294
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

295
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,840
I could hardly imagine

296
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,799
an intimate relationship between Nanzhou

297
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,320
and a girl.

298
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,400
By the way,

299
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,359
I baked some egg tarts

300
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,960
before coming out this morning.

301
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,799
Try one.

302
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,039
Thank you, aunt.

303
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,719
Don't mention it.

304
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:54,799
How does it taste?

305
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,719
Is it not nice?

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,919
It is nice.

307
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,559
It tastes exactly like my mother's.

308
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,000
She also likes to add

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,919
pecan and roses into egg tart.

310
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,479
It's my unique recipe.

311
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,559
From whom did she learn it?

312
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,320
I think she learnt it from a lady.

313
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,799
You're Zhou Jianqing.

314
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,400
Is your father Zhou Mingyong?

315
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,119
Yes.

316
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,479
That explains why I found
you familiar when we first met.

317
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,159
So you're Zhou's daughter.

318
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,320
Qingqing,

319
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,400
don't you remember?

320
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,000
You came to play at my house
in summer vacation.

321
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,799
I baked egg tarts for you every day

322
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,679
and then I shared the recipe
with your mother.

323
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,760
Aunt Egg Tart.

324
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
You remember now, right?

325
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,400
Back then, Nanzhou

326
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,719
was a quiet person.

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,760
Eat it.

328
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,159
Why are you spacing out?

329
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,359
Sure.

330
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,119
Here we are.

331
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:12,719
Aunt,

332
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,520
isn't this

333
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,559
too soon?

334
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,559
Relax.

335
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,719
It's not like you're
getting married tomorrow.

336
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,559
I've always

337
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,520
wanted Nanzhou to take a set of photos.

338
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,119
He has a girlfriend now.

339
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,520
It's perfect.

340
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,440
Hello.

341
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,960
These are the latest wedding
gowns and evening dresses.

342
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,119
We won't go through the pictures.

343

Just try every one of them.

Go now.

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,200
Don't waste time.

346
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,520
Don't dilly-dally. Hurry.

347
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,559
I'll wait for you here.

I still have something to do.

366
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
I've been waiting for years.

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm about to see

368
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,760
the wedding photos of my son.

369
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,799
Can't you fulfill

370
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,960
this little wish of mine?

371
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:39,960
I really have something to do.

372
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
Aunt.

373
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,719
Are you okay?

374
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,679
I'm suffering from chest pain.

375
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,320
Fine.

376
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,239

377
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,599

Look into the camera.

382
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,280
Good.

383
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,719

Look into the camera.

Look at the bridegroom.

387
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,159
Look at the bridegroom.

388
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:07,599
Good.

389
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,440

(Master Shu)

399

My school is two stations away.

400
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,280
Would you marry me?

401
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,760
No.

402
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,599
Walk home then.

403
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,799
How can a man like you propose?

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,159
You deserve to stay single forever.

405
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,520
I have never seen anyone like that.

406
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,599
He despises me

407
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,000
yet he proposed to me.

408
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,599
I said no

409
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,239
and he even refused to give me a lift.

410
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,439
You should stop hanging out with him.

411
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,479
I feel that he's odd.

412
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,560
He is not just odd.

413
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,239
He's a freak.

414
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,920
The famous macaron.

415
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,319
Susu,

416
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
you are not a great friend.

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
You've bought the famous macaron,

418
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
but you didn't share it with me.

419
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,119
I...

420
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,319
I thought of sharing it now.

421
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Wasn't this the shrimp

422
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,959
that Zhou Zixuan usually
drew to mock you?

423
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
Why did you draw it?

424
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,199
Did he give this to you?

425
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,839
You're hiding something.

426
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Has he returned from overseas?

427
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,479
I've brought you a pack of noodles.

428
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,839
Why are you taking so many pills again?

429
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,760
Did you finish the dosage for a month?

430
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Mr. Gu,

431
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,319
since you decided

432
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,880
to propose to Zhou Jianqing,

433
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,760
you've been taking more medicine.

434
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,280
Do you think marrying her

435
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,439
can relieve your burden?

436
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,680
One can be bothered by work.

437
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,199
Not all matters

438
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,160
are desirable.

439
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
Work and marriage

440
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,119
are two different matters.

441
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,900
(Mother)

442
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,479
Hello, mother.

443
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
Hello, Nanzhou.

444
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,439
Do you have Qingqing's phone number?

445
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
Why are you looking for her?

446
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
I saw

447
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
a wonderful set of wedding
photos taken in Paris.

448
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,280
I want to discuss with her.

449
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
I'll book it

450
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
if she is okay.

451
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,119
She is busy lately.

452
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,280
Don't look for her.

453
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,239
She should have the time
to talk over the phone.

454
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,640
Besides,

455
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,079
there is no need to take
wedding photos right away.

456
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,920
We can wait after her graduation.

457
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,920
Mother,

458
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,400
don't worry about it.

459
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I'm still working. Let's talk later.

460
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:11,520
I...

461
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,079
Hello, aunt.

462
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,719
Hello, Xiaochuan.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
Do you have Zhou Jianqing's
contact number?

464
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,199
Yes, I have,

465
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,199
but...

466
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
What is the matter?

467
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,479
Do you know something?

468
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,000
Aunt,

469
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,439
I need to tell you this.

470
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,079
Mother?

471
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,680
What brings you here?

472
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,199
Did you decide to marry Zhou Jianqing

473
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,640
merely to fulfill your
father's last wish?

474
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:06,959
Now I know.

475
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,520
It's your father's decision after all.

476
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,280
He was a dictator.

477
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,199
That's why I couldn't stand him.

478
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,119
I've learnt everything.

479
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,920
My father was indebted
to Zhou Jianqing's father.

480
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,040
So he asked me to look after her
for the rest of her life

481
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,239
and fulfill his last wish.

482
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,400
So you want to do as he wished.

483
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,920
You don't even care
about your own marriage.

484
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,359
Take it as the last thing

485
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,239
that I can do for my father.

486
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,959
There're many other ways

487
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,359
to make it up to the Zhou family.

488
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,199
Why must you marry his daughter?

489
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,400
Moreover,

490
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,400
is Qingqing willing to marry you?

491
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,959
If not,

492
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,280
it's not even making it up to them.

493
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,060
(Street 151, Huaming West Road)

494
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,959
I'll get the money.

495
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,040
Leave my sister alone.

496
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,199
We've found your sister.

497
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,520
Don't think she

498
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,680
can live well if you don't pay the debt.

499
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:12,920
Besides,

500
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,160
having two people to pay
a debt is better than one.

501
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,400
She has nothing to do with the debt.

502
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,280
Just turn to me in the future.

503
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,680
Turn to you?

504
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,959
Can you pay us?

505
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,920
RMB2 million is a big amount.

506
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,439
It's merely RMB2 million.

507
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,239
I'll bear

508
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,280
the debt with him.

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
Pretty girl.

510
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,479
You're here, too.

511
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,719
Good.

512
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,359
I can save a trip.

513
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,719
Mr. Shao needs money lately.

514
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,599
It doesn't matter if you want

515
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,079
to drag the payment.

516
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,760
They have many ways to deal with you.

517
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,599
I said

518
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,640
it's my personal matter.

519
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,079
I was the one who signed
the guarantee agreement

520
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,400
and it's my debt.

521
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
Don't think you can get a penny

522
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,079
if you go to my sister again.

523
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll go to you in a few days.

524
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,439
Don't worry.

525
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,119
I won't run away.

526
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,000
Zhou Zixuan.

527
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,839
How many things have you
been hiding from me?

528
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,160
When have you returned from overseas?

529
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,000
Why did you say you're
almost done paying the debt?

530
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,359
What are you doing lately?

531
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,520
Don't get too far.

532
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't need

533
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,880
to report everything to you.

534
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
Have you been

535
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,239
working in the country to pay the debt?

536
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,079
I thought

537
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,079
you're living well in overseas.

538
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,479
Don't pull a long face.

539
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:38,040
Brother.

540
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,640
What should we do now?

541
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,640
It's RMB2 million.

542
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,119
We?

543
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,000
It's my personal debt.

544
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,880
It is unrelated to you.

545
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,160
Of course it is related.

546
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,760
You're my brother,

547
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,920
my biological brother.

548
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,079
Take good care of yourself

549
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,959
if you really want to help me.

550
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,079
Stay out of the debt.

551
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,760
Why are you worried?

552
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,400
Leave now.

553
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,560
Let go of me, Zhou Zixuan.

554
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:02,959
Leave.

555
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,599
No.

556
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,479
Are you taking a passenger?

557
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes.

558
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:06,800
Get into the car.

559
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,280
Nancheng University.

560
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,760
Okay.

561
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,359
Marriage is an important matter in life

562
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,400
to both you and her.

563
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,239
You have been stressed due to
your brother's incident for years.

564
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:30,000
You only listened to your father.

565
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,839
Many years passed.

566
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,800
It's time for you to live
the life you want.

567
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,640
I indeed like Qingqing,

568
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,920
but follow your heart

569
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,040
to decide whether you
want to marry her or not.

570
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,000
All right.

571
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,839
I promise you

572
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,920
that I'll think it through.

573
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,760
Now that's my good boy.

574
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,800
I'll feel at ease

575
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,719
when you're happy.

576
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,199
Lu Ziming wants to call

577
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,479
20 to 30 people to a meeting today

578
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,599
and he told the shareholders

579
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,680
that he wanted to shut down Xingyun.

580
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,319
It needs more than

581
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,000
half of the shareholders' agreement

582
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,560
to do that.

583
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,800
However,

584
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,280
he might have a trick up to his sleeve

585
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
for the shareholder meeting.

586
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,760
Xiaochuan.

587
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:30,920
Settle

588
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,359
the properties under my name
in the next two days.

589
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,079
Cash them.

590
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,119
I need you to do one more thing.

591
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,000
I can do my best to look after you

592
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,040
if you agree to my request.

593
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:48,000
You won't encounter
the same danger anymore.

594
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:52,000
I can also solve the trouble caused
by your brother, who signed

595
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,280
the guarantee agreement for your mother.

596
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,620
(Gu Nanzhou)

597
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,860
(Zhou Jianqing)

598
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,400
Hello.

599
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,280
Can you do me a favour

600
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,520
if I promise to marry you?

601
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,079
I don't need a marriage anymore.

602
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,000
Please.

603
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,199
Can you give me another chance?

604
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,119
I don't know

605
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,680
who else I can turn to.

606
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,959
Come over now.

607
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,199
I'll send you the location.

608
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,599
Here.

609
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,800
Stop.

610
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,479
Change your shoes.

611
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,680
(Fine. I'll just help her)

612
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,199
(to fulfill my father's last will.)

613
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,800
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

614
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,439
Can you lend me some money

615
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,959
if I marry you?

616
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,599
How much?

617
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,880
RMB2 million.

618
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,760
I can assure you

619
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,319
that I won't fall for you

620
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,040
and I don't need a real marriage.

621
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,719
I can appear whenever you need me.

622
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,839
I won't disturb your life.

623
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,719
I'll pay you back slowly.

624
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,400
How can you pay me back as a student?

625
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
I know

626
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,280
I'm earning very little now,

627
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,760
but I'm healthy and I can live long

628
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,800
I'm smart.

629
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,680
I can pay you the money eventually.

630
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,079
I'll also pay

631
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,839
interest according to market rate.

632
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,520
In my opinion, it's totally unnecessary

633
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,239
to get married for this.

634
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,319
It's necessary.

635
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,280
By marrying me, you'll be at ease.

636
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,640
For example?

637
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
For example,

638
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,839
I can help you when your mother
is urging you to get married.

639
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,680
You can also act like

640
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,640
a normal married man in front of others.

641
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,839
I don't care what you want to do

642
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,719
with anyone in private.

643
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,199
What did you say

644
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,880
about my abnormality?

645
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,119
No.

646
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,280
I don't mean to discriminate you.

647
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,400
Whether or not you
have interest in women,

648
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
it's normal.

649
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,680
Did I say

650
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,760
I had no interest in women?

651
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,880
Why would you want to marry
someone you didn't even like then?

652
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,479
Could that be the one and only reason?

653
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,439
Do you have a secret illness

654
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,680
that stops you from getting married?

655
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,199
I'll make it clear to you

656
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,319
that I'm healthy

657
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,439
with all organs functioning well

658
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,880
and I only have interest in women.

659
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,880

Sorry for disturbing you.

So I brought it here.

684
