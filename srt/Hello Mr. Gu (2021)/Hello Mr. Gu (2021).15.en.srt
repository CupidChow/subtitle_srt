1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,540
=Hello Mr. Gu Theatre=

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,159
(Although Mr. Gu)

3
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,440
(is bad-tempered and fussy,)

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,520
(I have to admit)

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,680
(that he is a really handsome guy.)

6
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:25,879
(Also, he loves sports.)

7
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,680
(He leads a healthy lifestyle.)

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,479
(He's conscientious
and responsible in work.)

9
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,879
(He neither smokes nor drinks.)

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,360
(He has no bad habit.)

11
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:35,279
(After getting along with him,)

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,479
(you will find that his character)

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,840
(is rather adorable.)

14
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,799
(The last key point is that)

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,720
(he is really handsome.)

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,639
(So handsome.)

=Hello Mr. Gu=

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,095
=Episode 15=

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,780
(The so-called Asura)

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,639
Why? Couldn't I do so?

48
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,639
Are you jealous?

49
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,160
Zhou Jianqing?

50
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,520
Why are you here, too?

51
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,119
Xiaochuan,

52
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,559
what a coincidence.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,119
What are you doing?

54
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,720
Who are you?

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,080
Tell him

56
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,240
who I am.

57
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,320
Who is he?

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
He is

59
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,600
my friend.

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,240
Your friend?

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,440
Say it again.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,399
Should I say

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,279
he's my landlord?

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,839
Landlord?

65
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,839
Let go of my girlfriend!

66
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,839
She is my fiancée.

67
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,080
Fiancée?

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,399
Let's talk outside.

69
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,039
Mr. Gu!

70
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,399
How did you

71
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,919
get to know this girl?

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,360
She's with someone else.

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,240
She even has a fiancé.

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,759
Let go of me.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,520
Slow down!

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,440
So, the so-called celebration

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,039
is having a meal

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,759
with an unknown man.

79
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,039
An unknown man?

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,520
That's my senior.

81
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,679
What kind of senior

82
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,160
would require you

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,039
to be so intimate with him?

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,079
What are you thinking?

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
I was pretending to be his girlfriend.

86
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,839
If I didn't get close to him,

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
how could we handle his
cheating ex-girlfriend?

88
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,200
Look at what you've done.

89
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,399
You pulled me out in front of everyone.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,239
Instead of helping him, I messed up.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Have you forgotten

92
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,000
our agreement?

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,079
You're now

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,320
my fiancée nominally.

95
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,799
What will other people think of me

96
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,640
when you dined with another man?

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
You dated Jiang Jingxuan

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,959
behind my back tonight.

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Have you ever thought

100
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
about what other
people will think of me?

101
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:39,959
Behind your back?

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm with her every day.

103
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,559
Do I have to hide it from you?

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Yes.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
She is gentle and sensible.

106
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,679
She is your best business partner.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
I just don't understand.

108
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,880
Since you have her,

109
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,320
why must you get me

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
to be your fiancée in name?

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,799
She's my business partner.

112
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,320
You're my fiancée according
to the agreement.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,679
You two are different.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,959
Of course we are.

115
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,320
She is your business partner

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,839
who helps you in your business.

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,279
I'm just your debtor who
simply signed an agreement

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,359
with you over RMB2 million!

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,880
Then, you'd better remember

120
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:15,920
not to do anything tasteless like this

121
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,519
in the future.

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,920
Do you have no principle

123
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,519
and allow people to boss you around?

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
Principle in life?

125
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,959
You should marry a woman

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,279
like Jiang Jingxuan then!

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm not like you,

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,559
who have dreams and noble feelings

129
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,880
and can afford to do what you want.

130
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,359
I need to make a living.

131
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,600
I have to pay my debts.

132
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,359
You think I'm cheap.

133
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,320
So do I.

134
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,160
However, do I have a choice?

135
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,920
Can you, who make all the empty talk,

136
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,160
live my life?

137
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,959

Why are you here?

148
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:49,760
I...

149
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
I happened to pass by.

150
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,760
Then, I overheard you and Gu Nanzhou...

151
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,920
What did you hear?

152
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,440
I heard that you owed him RMB2 million.

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
In order to repay the debt,

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
you signed an agreement
to pretend to be his fiancée.

155
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,399
You must keep it a secret.

156
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
You can't tell anyone.

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,640
If I break the contract,

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
I have to compensate him
with a large sum of money.

159
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
Why would you owe him so much money?

160
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,640
It's RMB2 million.

161
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,359
That's not a small amount.

162
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a long story.

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
Stop asking.

164
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
I am bothered

165
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,920
whenever I am thinking of it.

166
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,959
To pay off the debt,

167
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
you pretend to be his fiancée.

168
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,160
Did Gu Nanzhou

169
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,359
do anything to you?

170
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,119
He

171
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,640
thinks he's too good for me.

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm just a tenant and a debtor

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,880
living in his house.

174
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,160
It's good then.

175
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I am relieved then.

176
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,119
What did you say?

177
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
I mean, Qingqing,

178
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,160
your relationship is
really dramatic, right?

179
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,839
It's crazier than a drama series.

180
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,399
Stop teasing me when
I'm already like this.

181
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,839
Let's eat something nice.

182
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,600
Forget it, I have no appetite.

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Think about it.

184
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,279
Hot pot, barbecue or crayfish.

185
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,279
You can have whatever you want.

186
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
It will be my treat.

187
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,519
Okay, let's go.

188
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Nanzhou,

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,080
are you okay?

190
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,799
I am sorry.

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I messed up your birthday.

192
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,119
It's okay.

193
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,799
Happy birthday.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,799
Thank you.

195
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,359
Let me take you home.

196
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,719
It's okay.

197
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,119
I'll just take a taxi.

198
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go.

199
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,719
Was Qingqing dating someone just now?

200
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,200
Don't blame her.

201
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,359
After all, she is just

202
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,880
a little girl who hasn't
graduated from university.

203
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,119
It's normal that she's still playful.

204
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,719
Though she's just pretending to
be your fiancée temporarily,

205
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,320
it would've caused you a lot of trouble

206
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,359
if anyone of your acquaintances
saw that.

207
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,679
Actually, I always think

208
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,599
that you should get someone reliable

209
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
to pretend to be your fiancée.

210
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,200
You did it in haste.

211
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,400
Otherwise,

212
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,840
I could actually help you with this.

213
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,159
You just need to manage
Xingyun's affairs well.

214
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,080
I will deal

215
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,359
with my personal affairs.

216
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,919
Nanzhou,

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
with our relationship...

218
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,719
Drop it.

219
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,740
(Huangting International Centre)

220
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,119
Nanzhou,

221
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,919
you look tired today.

222
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
Do you want to go to my house?

223
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,679
I will make you a cup of soothing tea.

224
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm good.

225
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,280
I just want to go home and sleep.

226
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,919
Drive safe then.

227
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,840
Okay.

228
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,280
Mother?

229
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,000
Why are you still up?

230
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,000
What happened?

231
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:12,919
Explain this.

232
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,000
What is this?

233
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,400
Who sent you the photos?

234
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
It doesn't matter who sent them.

235
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,520
Don't get it wrong.

236
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
She was just trying to help him.

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,479
I know.

238
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,679
She was pretending to
be her senior's girlfriend

239
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,239
to save face for him, right?

240
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,440
This month,

241
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,799
she not only works part-time
in a comic company,

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
but also attends classes,

243
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
delivers food,

244
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,960
walks dogs for others, delivers
flowers and tutors someone.

245
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,280
She does all these

246
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,280
to repay her creditor, Gu Nanzhou.

247
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:51,640
Mother,

248
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,640
you...

249
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,719
What's the matter?

250
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:54,960
Do you still have anything to say?

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,159
Why don't you tell me

252
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,760
the reason she borrowed money
from you?

253
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,919
Why did you

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,359
pretend to be an engaged couple?

255
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,919
I didn't want that,

256
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,159
but...

257
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,880
So,

258
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,599
you really signed an agreement for that?

259
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:14,960
You...

260
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,359
Was it because of that will again?

261
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
I've told you already.

262
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,679
Don't care about what
your father thought!

263
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,159
Mother.

264
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,359
It's not because of my father.

265
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,239
What's the reason then?

266
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,400
I

267
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,080
am in love with her.

268
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,840
So you lent her the money

269
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
and signed an agreement with her

270
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,440
in order to bind her to you

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,799
using the debt?

272
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,520
No.

273
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,400
Do you love her or not?

274
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,400
Yes!

275
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,400
I love her.

276
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,679
My goodness.

277
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,479
In the end,

278
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,400
you resorted to such a lame trick

279
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,039
because you weren't
able to win her heart.

280
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,479
Why were you so stupid?

281
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,440
Qingqing is adorable,

282
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,080
but she doesn't

283
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,960
seem difficult to pursue.

284
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,760
She is.

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,280
My silly son.

286
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,119
Come on, sit down.

287
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,520
If you want to court a girl,

288
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
being straightforward

289
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,119
is not going to work.

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell me

291
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,239
how far you've gone.

292
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,880
I can give you an idea.

293
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:37,919
No, thanks.

294
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,440
Can you handle her by yourself?

295
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,760
Listen to me.

296
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,479
You can't be so straightforward

297
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,200
in courting a girl.

298
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,280
You must be subtle and apply strategies.

299
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,919
You need skills.

300
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,760
Okay, got it.

301
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,640
I'll do as you say.

302
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,559
Qingqing.

303
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,119
Aunt?

304
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,280
Haven't you gone to bed?

305
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,239
Why did you come back so late?

306
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,440
Sit down and take a rest.

307
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,239
Have some fruits.

308
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,280
Okay.

309
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,039
Qingqing.

310
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,640
Xiaozhou told me

311
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,320
your comic was nominated for an award.

312
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,119
I wanted to make more dishes today

313
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:42,840
to celebrate it for you

314
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,239
when you're back.

315
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,679
I went out to celebrate
with my friends tonight.

316
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,000
You went out to celebrate?

317
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,840
Why didn't you call Xiaozhou?

318
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,840
Did you quarrel?

319
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,359
No.

320
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,320
I

321
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,119
will celebrate with him on another day.

322
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,679
You really didn't fight?

323
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,400
Why did Xiaozhou

324
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,119
come back angrily today?

325
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,719
All right.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,479
Don't cover up for him.

327
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,400
I know my own son

328
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,479
the best.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
When a girl is with him,

330
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
they would of course quarrel.

331
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,320
No.

332
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,599
Have the fruits.

333
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:26,880
Qingqing.

334
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,719
What do you think

335
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,080
about Xiaozhou?

336
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,359
He works hard. He is
perseverant and enthusiastic.

337
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,200
Anything else?

338
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,760
He's handsome and he has a nice figure.

339
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,440
What else?

340
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,200
He's kind.

341
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Is that all you notice

342
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
after being with him for so long?

343
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,359
Did you realize

344
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,719
that Xiaozhou is actually

345
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,960
soft-hearted despite sounding mean?

346
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,679
He's sharp-tongued,

347
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,119
but in critical times,

348
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,880
he is still very considerate.

349
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,159
I think

350
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,080
he is rather considerate.

351
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Also, he is very smart.

352
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,320
He's calm and decisive.

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,520
Also, he's very organized.

354
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,320
He's definitely someone who's
meant to do great things.

355
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,799
This is correct.

356
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,400
Also,

357
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,159
once he sets a target,

358
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,320
he never gives up,

359
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,400
be it his career or
a romantic relationship.

360
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,479
Moreover, he never lets go.

361
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,640
Do you

362
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,760
adore and admire him,
even just a little?

363
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,799
Actually, Xiaozhou's strengths

364
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,239
are much more than this.

365
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,840
Let me tell you.

366
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
When he was young,

367
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,400
he's very good in handicraft.

368
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,840
During his first day in kindergarten,

369
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,479
he made me a card.

370
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,359
It said,

371
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,080
"mother, I love you".

372
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,919
It melted my heart.

373
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,320
I didn't know he'd
do this kind of thing.

374
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,479
Also, he is very meticulous.

375
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,799
When he noticed that
the toys in kindergarten

376
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,719
weren't placed in order,

377
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,919
he tidied them up silently by himself.

378
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,640
So he has obsessive-compulsive disorder
since young.

379
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,160
He is also super loving.

380
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,719
Listen.

381
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,680
When he was a little boy, he went out

382
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,160
and shield the stray cats with
an umbrella whenever it rained.

383
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,880
In the end,

384
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
he's all drenched.

385
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,880
Mother.

386
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,760
Xiaozhou,

387
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,000
I happened to be talking
about you to Qingqing.

388
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,680
It's late. Go to bed.

389
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,880
Isn't it just past 10 p.m.?

390
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
It's still early.

391
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
Go back to your room and rest.

392
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,000
Qingqing,

393
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,640
have an early night today.

394
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
We will talk another day.

395
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:56,839
Okay.

396
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:57,959
Aunt, good night.

397
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:58,800
Good night.

398
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:26,760
Well,

399
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,760
today, when I

400
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,839
saw that man,

401
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,400
your senior,

402
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,880
doing that

403
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,000
in front of my colleagues,

404
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,119
I...

405
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Drop it.

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,800
All right.

407
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,599
Good night.

408
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Are you kicked out?

409
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm just here for a glass of water.

410
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,359
Stop pretending.

411
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,000
To be honest,

412
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,959
it's my first time

413
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,359
seeing you give in to someone.

414
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,119
I told you I was not.

415
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,359
It's not something bad.

416
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,479
It's good to give in.

417
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,359
You've been living an uptight life

418
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,640
all these years.

419
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
You're almost sick.

420
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,239
Actually, I think

421
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,520
it's good for you and
Qingqing to be together.

422
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,239
At least,

423
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,119
you are different now.

424
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,319
Therefore,

425
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,319
even if it doesn't turn
out well for you,

426
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,239
I'll root for you.

427
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,959
Why won't it turn out well for us?

428
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,640
No, she obviously

429
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,599
doesn't understand your feelings.

430
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,479
Look at yourself.

431
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
You pull a long face all day long.

432
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,599
She doesn't owe you money...

433
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Wait, she does owe you money,

434
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,800
but you can't always do that.

435
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,400
You can't always keep it to yourself.

436
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,319
You won't end up well if you
look cold but is wild deep down.

437
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,079
Mother.

438
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,119
How can you make such a remark about me?

439
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,280
All right.

440
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
I won't nag you.

441
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,160
Just

442
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,839
do as I say.

443
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:33,160
Please make her my daughter-in-law.

444
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,760
I'm tired.

445
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
I will go to bed now.

446
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,079
Have an early night.

447
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,119
Good night.

448
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,599
Good night.

449
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,880
Apologize nicely to me

450
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,319
and I will forgive you.

451
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,400
I am sorry.

452
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,000
I was being too much today.

453
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,959
Then, you have to buy me
snacks for a month

454
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,400
as compensation.

455
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,880
Okay.

456
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,239
Then,

457
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,959
can you not

458
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,160
pretend to be anyone else's
girlfriend in the future?

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's not because I find it embarrassing.

460
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,599
I'm just worried

461
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,959
that you'll be in danger

462
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,839
if it's a bad guy.

463
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,719
Okay, I got it.

464
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,560
Go back and get some rest.

465
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,439
What happened

466
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,680
to your face?

467
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,359
I got injured that day.

468
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,439
I didn't contact you these days.

469
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Are you angry with me?

470
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,520
No.

471
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,959
It's good then.

472
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,199
My parents say

473
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,920
you are a sensible girl.

474
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I think they are right.

475
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,839
A girl like you

476
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,839
is the best candidate to be a wife.

477
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,199
What are you chatting?

478
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,119
Why are you talking
about getting married?

479
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,439
Xuan.

480
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,959
Why are you here?

481
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,160
My good friend is on a date.

482
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,400
I surely have to come here
and check it out for her.

483
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,920
What if you come across a womanizer?

484
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,359
Didn't you say that
you're not close to him?

485
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,239
When did we say that?

486
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,520
Last time, I was just saying

487
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,040
that she was a VIP of the restaurant.

488
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,199
I'm not in that restaurant anymore.

489
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
We are friends now.

490
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
Have you resigned?

491
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,520
It's thanks to your friend.

492
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,479
Xiaxia,

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
why don't we go to my house for dinner?

494
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,839
My aunt and uncle

495
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,719
happen to be there.

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,400
She doesn't want to go!

497
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,359
Who are you to make
the decision for her?

498
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,520
How are you related to her?

499
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,079
She is my sister's best friend.

500
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,079
She's also my friend.

501
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't care whether
she's dating anyone,

502
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,239
but one thing is for sure.

503
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,719
I don't want her to date a bad person.

504
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,000
What's going on?

505
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,079
Have you

506
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,560
met before this?

507
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,359
Of course we have.

508
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,439
The wound on his face

509
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,680
was caused by me.

510
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:54,920
No wonder.

511
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,839
You come at me like a mad dog

512
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,560
whenever you see me.

513
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,199
So

514
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,839
you're in such a messy relationship.

515
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,119
Don't talk nonsense!

516
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,280
We are

517
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,800
just friends.

518
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,560
You're just friends?

519
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,199
He did this to me

520
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,239
and you claimed that
you're just friends?

521
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,079
I'll talk to my mother when I go back.

522
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,479
A girl

523
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,959
who looks innocent like you

524
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,880
is actually not trustworthy.

525
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,239
Who knows

526
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,479
what she's doing on the sly?

527
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,239
If you continue,

528
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,280
I'll beat you till you can't talk.

529
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,880
Try me!

530
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,359
Xuan.

531
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,079
So what if I say that?

532
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,239
I'm telling the truth!

533
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,479
If there's nothing going on between you,

534
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,640
would you have been
so protective of her?

535
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,920
-You...
-Xuan!

536
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,959
Don't fight.

537
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,479
Xuan!

538
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,479
Let's go!

539
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,800
Su Youxia!

540
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,119
Let me remind you before I leave.

541
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,760
I have seen a lot of men

542
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,880
like him.

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,359
Don't think

544
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,599
that he's sincere to you.

545
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,520
Being a cook, he doesn't
have to work so hard

546
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,800
if he's in a relationship with you.

547
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,599
All he wants

548
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,439
is just your family's wealth.

549
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,239
I'm kind enough to give you the advice.

550
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,479
Have dare you slap me!

551
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,439
A rich silly girl with a poor man.

552
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,800
What a perfect match!

553
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,239
I will send these pictures

554
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,800
to Xiaxia's parents.

555
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,959
If you want your parents

556
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,439
and these girls with whom
you're having relationships

557
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,640
to receive these photos,

558
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,199
you may continue with what you're doing!

559
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,199
Let's go!

560
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,479
Can you keep your eyes open

561
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,839
when you go on a date?

562
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,959
Get a normal man.

563
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,800
You asked me to date them.

564
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,319
Why did you look for me?

565
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,239
Moreover,

566
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,119
does it matter what
kind of person he is?

567
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
You and my parents are the same.

568
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,599
You all ask me to get in touch

569
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,000
with the returnees and elites,
saying that it's good for myself

570
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,959
and to pave the way for my future.

571
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
Has any of you

572
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,959
asked what I want?

573
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,079
What do you want?

574
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,959
I...

575
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,400
Answer the call.

576
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,439
I don't want to answer my parents' call.

577
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,119
I don't want to socialize either.

578
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,079
It's up to you.

579
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:17,839
Tell me.

580
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,839
Where do you want to go now?

581
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,800
Let's go.

582
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,920
Xuan,

583
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,800
do you remember?

584
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,040
When you were 18 years old,

585
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,800
you're accepted

586
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,839
by an overseas school.

587
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,000
Before you left,

588
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,800
you, Qingqing and I

589
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,479
spent time together

590
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,160
the whole afternoon.

591
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,599
That day,

592
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,280
the three of us took a group photo.

593
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,479
That's the only picture of you

594
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,359
that I have.

595
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,479
I've kept it secretly for many years.

596
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,880
That day, I was struggling

597
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,400
whether to tell you about my feeling.

598
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,719
However, I didn't say anything

599
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,839
even after you and Qingqing

600
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,079
went home.

601
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,839
I cried all night long.

602
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,900
I think that I'm useless.

603
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,359
This is

604
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,239
what I want to say to
you all these years.
