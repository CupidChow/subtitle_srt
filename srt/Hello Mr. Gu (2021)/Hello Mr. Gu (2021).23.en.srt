(Hello Mr. Gu Theatre)

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm right here!

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
What are you thinking?

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm thinking about
a very serious question.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
What kind of question?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,880
What fruits do you like?

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,440
Apple.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,000
What about strawberry?

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
It's not bad.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,280
(I never thought)

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,240
(that a serious person like him)

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,840
(would someday secretly)

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,320
(The innocent is implicated.)

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
(Wanshi Mall Self-Select Chocolate)

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,440
(Not only he did not apologize,)

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,040
(what does he mean)

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,920
(by sending me a chocolate voucher now?)

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
(Am I not worth your effort)

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,920
(of choosing chocolate?)

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
What exactly is going on?

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,480
If you keep doing that, your
mobile phone will be broken.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Nothing.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Let's continue drawing.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,000
Did she see it or not?

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,880
She didn't reply to my message.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Nanzhou,

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
you haven't eaten lunch, right?

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,240
I brought you fish congee and salad.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,120
Eat some.

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Thank...

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
In the future,

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,640
you can only eat congee
prepared by your girlfriend.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,120
Otherwise,

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,560
you're dead meat.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
Give it to Jiang Xiaochuan.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm not hungry.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,920
I thought Zhou Jianqing was only joking.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,920
I didn't expect you
to take it seriously.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Girls nowadays are
really different from us

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
when they're in love.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,200
What do you mean?

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
I have a niece

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,720
who treats relationships lightly.

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,920
She's about the same age as Qingqing.

76
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,400
She sets a lot of rules

77
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
for her boyfriend,

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
not allowing him to do this and that.

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,480
If he talks

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,640
to a girl for slightly longer,

81
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
she'll get angry.

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,760
However, for herself,

83
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
it's a different story.

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,440
She can have close interaction
with other men

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
and play with them,

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
but her boyfriend is not allowed
to say anything about her.

87
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
If he does, it means he doesn't love her

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
or understand her well enough.

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
Don't you think it's a joke?

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
You can't eat the fish congee,

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,880
but salad should be fine, right?

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
You have a meeting this afternoon.

93
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,040
Are you really going to starve yourself

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,840
because of this?

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,960
(According to our promise,)

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
(can I eat this or not?)

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
What's up?

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,720
Come here.

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,160
Look,

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
this is my favorite movie collection

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
over the years.

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,640
How about this?

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
Tonight, let's have

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
a classic movie marathon.
What do you think?

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Sure.

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Then, later,

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,320
I'll order fried chicken and beer.

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,920
We'll eat while watching movies.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
Okay!

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Give me my mobile phone.

111
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,840
Sure.

112
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,320
What's wrong?

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,360
What happened to you?

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,760
It's because of you

115
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,400
that I spent the entire night

116
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,560
sleeping on the bench last night.

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
My back still hurts now.

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
Then, I'll massage you.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,560
How about this?

120
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Are you feeling better now?

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
A little better.

122
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll keep massaging.

123
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,000
It won't hurt anymore after this.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I suffered the entire
night because of you.

125
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
Think about

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
how you'll make it up to me.

127
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,480
How do I do that?

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,000
I

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
will listen to you.

130
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Are you sure?

131
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Susu!

132
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,520
Susu, are you home?

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
-Xuan.
-Susu!

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,320
You'd better hide.

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Are you in or not?

136
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,360
She keeps shouting like this.

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
If the neighbors hear her,

138
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,360
they'll tell my parents.

139
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,960
Xuan, please.

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,040
-Xuan.
-Susu, are you there?

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
Zhou Jianqing.

142
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Hurry.

143
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,440
Susu!

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,480
Susu,

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
what were you doing?

146
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
What took you so long to open the door?

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,760
Did you fall asleep again?

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
Why are you here again?

149
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,040
Didn't you say you're
just staying for a day?

150
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
I was about to go home.

151
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
However, Gu Nanzhou

152
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
didn't even say a word of apology.

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,040
How can I go back?

154
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,560
Maybe he's proud

155
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,800
and doesn't know how to put it.

156
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,240
He might be reflecting
on himself as we speak.

157
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,040
Why don't you go back early

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
and give him a chance to apologize?

159
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Look.

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,160
Is this an act of reflecting
on his actions?

161
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
A chocolate voucher?

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,880
That's right.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
It's a chocolate voucher.

164
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,360
Not even an extra line.

165
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,360
He thinks I'm easily pleased.

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,080
Where are you going?

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm going to take a beverage.

168
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,480
I'll take it for you.

169
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,240
Have a seat.

170
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,720
I'll do it.

171
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,880
If I go back now,

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
how am I going to face him?

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
Anyway, before he

174
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
sincerely apologizes to me,

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
I'll never go back.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Tell her to go right now.

177
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,240
Susu,

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
what are you doing?

179
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
What would you like to drink?

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,040
Cola will do.

181
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Sure.

182
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
Tell her to go.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Here you go.

184
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,840
Thank you.

185
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
I...

186
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,400
I think

187
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,400
maybe he's not good at
expressing his feelings.

188
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,440
Look,

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
he gave you a self-select voucher.

190
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,080
Isn't he giving you

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
the right to choose?

192
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,000
Susu,

193
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,120
why are you siding with him?

194
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,920
You used to take my side.

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
People say

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,240
it's better to advise a couple
to reconcile than break up.

197
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,240
I got it.

198
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,120
If I stay here, are you worried that

199
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
Zhou Zixuan will bother you again?

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
You really dislike him.

201
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,320
No, I don't dislike him.

202
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,280
Not at all.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,240
He's a good person.

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,240
Don't worry.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
He's busy lately.

206
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,320
He seems to be dating someone.

207
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Did he?

208
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Well,

209
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,760
did he mention

210
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,880
his girlfriend to you?

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,120
It seems to be the lady
who looked for him,

212
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
a super gorgeous lady.

213
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
He told me that

214
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,480
she's proactive

215
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
and she has a good figure.

216
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
She approached him daringly.

217
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
He couldn't even refuse.

218
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,160
Zhou Zixuan

219
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,080
doesn't have strong willpower.

220
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,040
I guess he'll give in after a few days.

221
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,360
Why haven't I heard him
mentioning that before?

222
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,000
How can he possibly

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,720
tell you about these things?

224
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,840
He keeps saying

225
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,280
dating a good girl like you

226
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
is tiring.

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
He always has to keep
this and that in mind.

228
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Maybe

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,280
he can let his guard down

230
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
in front of a woman
with a wild personality.

231
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Of course he won't tell you

232
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
about this kind of adult topic.

233
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
I didn't expect him

234
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
to lead such a secretive

235
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,280
adult life.

236
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
What is that sound?

237
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,480
Nothing.

238
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Try this.

239
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
Maybe I shouldn't send
her a chocolate voucher.

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,520
(RMB20 voucher.
RMB50 voucher. RMB100 voucher.)

241
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,760
(Send to my wife.)

242
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm afraid I'm the only person

243
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
who understands you the most.

244
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,840
Gu Nanzhou,

245
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,080
are you an idiot?

246
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,760
What about him?

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,480
Not only he sent me a chocolate voucher,

248
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,400
he even sent me all these
promotion vouchers.

249
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,360
Does he think he is
distributing leaflets?

250
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,880
(Miyamoto)

251
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,840
(Zhou Jianqing is at Su Youxia's house.)

252
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,160
(Come and bring her away immediately.)

253
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,000
(If you want her to forgive you,)

254
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,480
(don't send her a chocolate voucher)

255
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
(nor promotion vouchers.)

256
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,920
(Apologize properly for a few times)

257
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
(and swiftly)

258
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,280
(corner her.)

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,520
How come he knows everything?

260
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,760
Unexpectedly,

261
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,840
he's quite supportive of me.

262
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,440
(Thank you.)

263
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,040
(I'll try my best.)

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,480
Nanzhou,

265
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,240
can we set out now?

266
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Do you know

267
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,680
Miyamoto's itinerary in China?

268
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,400
He seems to be

269
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,920
giving a speech at
the St. Regis Hotel today.

270
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,680
What's wrong?

271
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
Postpone the meeting.

272
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
We are going to the St. Regis Hotel.

273
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
Thank you.

274
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
You're welcome.

275
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,920
Hi, Mr. Miyamoto.

276
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,920
Glad to meet you.

277
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Glad to meet you.

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm Gu Nanzhou.

279
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,920
Mr. Gu.

280
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,680
Can you draw another one for me?

281
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,880
What?

282
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,800
This drawing is completed. I'm sorry.

283
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,800
Mr. Miyamoto,

284
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
wait.

285
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,760

So, you postponed the meeting

303
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,680
to get an autograph for Qingqing?

304
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,480
After all, I dirtied the drawing.

305
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm envious of Qingqing

306
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
for having such a kind

307
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,360
and considerate

308
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,320
boyfriend like you who puts her
above everything else.

309
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
Even after you quarrelled,

310
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
you did so much for her.

311
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm just doing what I should do.

312
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,600
If I have

313
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
such a boyfriend like you,

314
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
I won't even bear to quarrel with him.

315
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,520
Too bad

316
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm not as lucky as Qingqing.

317
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,800
If you wish to have a boyfriend,

318
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,160
I'll ask Xiaochuan

319
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,320
to pay more attention

320
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,200
and introduce suitable
candidates to you.

321
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,160
What is the urgent matter?

322
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,960
You're being so mysterious.

323
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
You even insisted on
talking it face-to-face.

324
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,680
Qingqing,

325
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
I know

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,840
a really good western restaurant nearby.

327
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
Let's try it out. It's on me.

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,600
Junior,

329
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,960
you're generous.

330
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
You know I like good food.

331
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
I'll return the favor next time.

332
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,200
Come on, let's go.

333
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
What is this guy doing here again?

334
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,360
Calm down.

335
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,840
Don't be angry.

336
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,960
The restaurant's spending
per person is so high.

337
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,280
So, there's a reason for it.

338
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
It's delicious.

339
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,400
Eat more if it's delicious.

340
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,360
Try this.

341
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
Try this.

342
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Sure.

343
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,200
You should eat more, too.

344
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,920
Qingqing,

345
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,840
try this.

346
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,880
It's super tender.

347
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,280
What's wrong?

348
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,640
Do you regret

349
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,320
treating me to such an expensive meal?

350
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
Why would I?

351
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,600
Eat first.

352
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
I'll go to the washroom.

353
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,760
Go ahead.

354
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,080
I'll save some for you.

355
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,680
(Where are you now?)

356
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,080
(Who are you with?)

357
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,040
(It has nothing to do with you.)

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
I love you.

359
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,320
Qingqing,

360
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,040
I love you.

361
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
When I first met you,

362
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,200
I felt that...

363
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
I was wondering

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,160
why would there be such a brave girl.

365
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
When I started working with you,

366
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,080
I began

367
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
falling

368
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
in love with you.

369
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,040
In fact, I don't like comic that much.

370
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,400
However, because you like it,

371
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
comic became my dream.

372
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,160
Can I take care of you?

373
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,440
I would like to achieve your
dream together with you.

374
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,080
You're here.

375
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,560
Qingqing.

376
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,840
What is Gu Nanzhou

377
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
thinking?

378
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
You and I work

379
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,280
and eat together.

380
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,960
What's wrong with that?

381
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,040
He's like a control freak

382
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,040
who has to meddle with everything.

383
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Did you two

384
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,240
quarrel because of me?

385
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,080
Yes.

386
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,400
He always gets suspicious,

387
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,480
thinking that you're into me

388
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,080
or that we'll fall in love.

389
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,800
If it's true,

390
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
seeing how we've known
each other for so long,

391
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,560
I wouldn't have been with him then.

392
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,840
Besides,

393
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
what's wrong with us working together?

394
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
I can't possibly stop accepting jobs

395
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,680
just because he overthinks.

396
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Without you,

397
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,840
how am I going to find

398
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
another reliable work partner?

399
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,320
Excuse me, sir.

400
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,920
Sorry.

401
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
Gu Nanzhou!

402
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
What are you doing here?

403
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm here for lunch.

404
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,520
You happened to come here

405
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,480
while Zhang Yin and I are here?

406
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,680
What a coincidence.

407
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
Why did you text me just now,

408
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,840
asking where I am

409
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
and who I am with?

410
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm here to apologize to you.

411
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,800
Is that the right attitude to apologize?

412
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,280
Let's talk at another place.

413
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,240
If you have anything
to say, just say it here.

414
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm really sorry.

416
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,760
It's my bad

417
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
for suspecting you and Zhang Yin.

418
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,000
What else?

419
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,320
It's also my fault

420
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,200
for dirtying your idol's drawing.

421
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
What else?

422
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,000
I brought you a present.

423
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,840
I'll say this beforehand.

424
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,800
If you give me another discount voucher,

425
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
I'll finish you off on the spot.

426
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
It's not a discount voucher.

427
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,560
I cooked crayfish for you.

428
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,960
There're other gifts.

429
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
However,

430
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120
I'm still very angry with you right now.

431
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Earlier on, you said

432
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
all those hurtful words.

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
You're also childish, petty,

434
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,440
mean

435
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,120
and...

436
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,080
What are you doing?

437
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm earnestly apologizing to you.

438
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,160
Let me go.

439
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,400
Didn't you say

440
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,880
you had other gifts?

441
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
♪Put my life♪

442
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,760
♪In your life♪

443
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,600
How did you do that?

444
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
Would you forgive me?

445
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Yes.

446
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,560
♪The gloomy cloud♪

447
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,120

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,560
Please enjoy, Ms. Zhou.

454
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
We haven't seen each
other for just a few days.

455
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,360
Your cooking skills improved.

456
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,280
I'm impressed.

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
The crayfish made by a perfect man

458
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,720
must be perfect, too.

459
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,680
Tell me how you cooked it.

460
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,480
First, clean the crayfish with
a brush under tap water.

461
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
Remove the tip of their claws,

462
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,360
stomach and intestines.

463
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,880
Add ginger, spring onion, garlic slices,

464
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
Sichuan pepper and dried chili.

465
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,680
You memorized the recipe well.

466
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,200
Of course.

467
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,760
Go ahead and try it.

468
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,680
If it's tasty,

469
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,520
I'll order for you again next time.

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,720
Gu Nanzhou,

471
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,320
come over.

472
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,600
Come nearer.

473
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,520
Gu Nanzhou!

474
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,280
It hurts!

475
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
How dare you lie to me.

476
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,000
You ordered this.

477
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,480
Well, I ordered food delivery

478
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,240
to learn how to cook it.

479
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,360
When I master it, I'll cook for you.

480
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,480
Very well.

481
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
You're so good at

482
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,640
telling lies now.

483
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,080
Anyway,

484
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
since you did such a good job

485
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,920
memorizing the recipe,

486
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,600
I'll forgive you.

487
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,440
You can eat whatever
you like in the future.

488
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,560
I'll memorize the recipes for you.

489
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,920
Tell me.

490
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,080
Fiery red lips?

491
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,880
Sexy and attractive?

492
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,040
A super gorgeous girl?

493
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,840
Xia,

494
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,800
don't believe

495
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Zhou Jianqing's nonsense.

496
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
She runs her mouth.

497
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,360
I...

498
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,080
The lady is just my client.

499
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,280
It's not a romantic relationship.

500
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
If it's not,

501
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,000
why did you talk so happily to her?

502
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,960
You know what?

503
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,160
The more a person loves someone,
the more nervous he is in front of her.

504
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
If he's not interested in her,

505
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,120
he'll act like a seasoned person.

506
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,760
You seem seasoned to me now.

507
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,120
Look for her then.

508
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,520
Xia,

509
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
don't be mad at me.

510
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,960
If I was really seasoned,

511
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,880
would I have had to

512
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,840
hold a rose in my mouth

513
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,080
to apologize to you now?

514
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,840
Once you accept the rose,

515
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,800
it means you've forgiven me.

516
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,840
In the future,

517
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
you aren't allowed to fall
for any super gorgeous girl,

518
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,120
gentle and virtuous lady

519
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,960
or intellectual and elegant woman.

520
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
You're the only one I love.

521
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
(Qingqing)

522
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Hello.

523
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,640
Hello, Susu.

524
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,200
What are you doing?

525
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,880
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

526
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,400
I...

527
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,160
You seem hesitant.

528
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,520
Are you on a date?

529
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,680
Give me the phone.

530
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,360
You...

531
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,560
What are you doing?

532
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,080
Why is there a male's voice?

533
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I choked when I drank water just now.

534
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960
I was only joking.

535
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,240
At this hour,

536
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,600
a good girl like you

537
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,440
must be home.

538
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
That's why I can disturb you.

539
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
Qingqing,

540
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,040
I'm busy now.

541
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
Why don't we meet tomorrow?

542
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,320
I know a really good

543
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
soufflé place.

544
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,200
That's enough.

545
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,040
I know you.

546
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,880
At this hour, other than
scrolling through WeSee,

547
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,360
you are only playing with
your miniature house.

548
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,320
What else can you do?

549
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,360
I really have to talk to someone

550
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
about it

551
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,000
or I'm going to burst.

552
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,360
Okay.

553
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,080
Go ahead then.

554
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,880
You have no idea

555
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,800
how cute Gu Nanzhou is.

556
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,320
He came to apologize to me.

557
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,040
But before that, he
went to see Mr. Miyamoto

558
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,840
and got a redrawn portrait.

559
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,600
It's even better than the original.

560
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,960
Besides, he also cooked crayfish for me.

561
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,560
A poker-faced CEO like him

562
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,160
knows how to cook crayfish?

563
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,080
Of course he doesn't.

564
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,920
He accidentally spilled the beans.

565
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,440
It's actually food delivery he ordered.

566
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,120
However,

567
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,560
he did memorize

568
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
the recipe quite thoroughly.

569
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
I didn't know

570
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,680
he's quite adorable in person.

571
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I know, right?

572
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,360
You know what?

573
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,320
When he watched a horror film with me,

574
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
he pretended to keep a straight face,

575
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,160
but he's actually
holding my hand tightly.

576
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,320
Who knew

577
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,320
a grown man like him

578
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,720
would not even dare
to watch a horror film?

579
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,640
He's so timid?

580
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,680
What is that sound?

581
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,320
Susu?

582
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,640
Zhou Jianqing, little devil!

583
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
Stop pestering my Su Youxia!

584
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,440
Go to whoever you think is adorable!

585
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,520
We're dating here!

586
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,720
Zhou Zixuan?

587
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,360
They're dating?

588
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,600
I need to go out for a while.

589
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,280
It won't take long.

590
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,200
Where are you going at this hour?

591
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
I have to go to Susu's
house to check on her.

592
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
My brother said they're dating.

593
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't go there.

594
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,000
I must.

595
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,040
We're talking about Zhou Zixuan.

596
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
How can I allow my best friend
to be fooled by him?

597
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,600
Outsiders should not

598
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
meddle in a relationship.

599
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,640
Who knows? Maybe they're
suitable for each other.

600
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm not an outsider.

601
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Besides,

602
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm very sure that

603
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,160
Zhou Zixuan is evil.

604
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,600
Their relationship is quite stable.
