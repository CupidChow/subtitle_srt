There.

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Don't push.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,600
Speed up.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Everyone gets a seat.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,760
What is the hurry?

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,880
Why are you wearing a
pair of sunglasses, uncle?

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,440
Are you blind?

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
Why?

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,760
Don't spout nonsense.

You!

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
Can you stop screaming?

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,360
And you!

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Can you stop asking questions?

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
You're the worst.

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,400
You poked at me and kicked my seat.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,960
Can you manage your
kids as their parents?

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,160
Why are you yelling?

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
She is just a kid.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
What is wrong with you?

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,040
You're blaming a kid.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,840
-How terrible.
-Exactly.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
He has no manners.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
All right. Stop crying.

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Stop crying, honey.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,560
(Stay calm.)

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
(They're just kids.)

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,920
(I'm a loving adult.)

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,240
(It's okay.)

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
(Bear with it.)

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,520
(Bear with it.)

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
Mother, he is blind.

65
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,000
He can't see.

66
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
All right. Sit down.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,200
Qingqing!

68
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
It's just a plot discussion.

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Do you need to dress up so formally?

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,240
Actually, I didn't ask you out

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,120
to discuss the plot.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Do you still remember

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,720
the time you suddenly asked me to be

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
your assistant in the self-study room?

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,000
Before I agreed to it,

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,040
you negotiated both remuneration

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,240
and bonus plans with me.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,880
I didn't want to be rejected by you.

79
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,720
The truth is

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
when I was working as your assistant,

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
we rushed for deadline every day.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
We had no time to rest.

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,840
I wanted to quit many times,

84
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
but I couldn't when I saw

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,160
how serious you were at work.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,920
Were you moved by my hard work?

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Qingqing.

88
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
I just want to say

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,440
that whenever you're beside me,

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
I feel happy

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,640
even when we have to stay up every day.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
So long as you're around me every day,

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
I feel blissful

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
no matter what I do.

95
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
What's wrong with you today?

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,400
Why have you suddenly
become so sentimental?

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,960
I...

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,600
I love you.

It's also noisy that
I couldn't hear him.

he had something to say the other day,

00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,000
but I just couldn't hear him.

122
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
I couldn't help thinking after that.

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
Was he trying to say

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
that he's into me the other day?

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
It also could be something else.

126
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,160
Maybe he just wanted me
to lower my voice.

127

What a coincidence.

136
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,840
You're also at the summit.

You two...

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,120
We plan to go for a movie.

It's rushed,

143
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,480
but I need to make a grand confession.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
I know I'm difficult to deal with.

145
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I'm picky and particular.

146
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm always mean

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
and I close my heart to almost everyone.

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
However, ever since I met you,

149
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
I sensed a lot of changes in me.

150
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,520
I once feared crowded places.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,760
With you around,

152
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,800
they seem less frightening.

153
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
I disliked going to the hospital.

154
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
With you around,

155
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,280
it seems less terrible.

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
I refused to lose to anyone,

157
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,320
but I don't mind losing to you.

158

Zhou Jianqing,

159
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,920
I love you.

but can you not leave me?

for me to become better for you.

167

I went through several channels

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,800
and took a lot of effort

412
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,040
to convince the owner
to sell this house to me.

413
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
You bought it?

414
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Let's take a look inside and see

415
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,600
if it's the same as the way
it was in your childhood.

416
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,280
The former owner told me

417
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,240
that the house basically remained

418
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,600
the same when he bought it.

419
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,720
Let's get in.

420
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520

buy the house back again.

to fulfill it for us.

424
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,320

go in to take at look at the environment

452

479
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,160
I only opened the door slightly.

480
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,080
You even buttoned your shirt wrongly.

481
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,520
What are you doing, Gu Nanzhou?

482
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Why do you wake up
so early at the weekend?

483
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Go back to sleep.

484
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800

488
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,080
You don't like me

489
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,120

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,840
