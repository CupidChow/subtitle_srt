00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
This way, please.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
May I have your order?

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Why don't you order?

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm not picky.

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,920
Why don't you order instead?

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,560
Then,

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,920
we'll have spicy and sour mussel,

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,920
bitter melon and pork rib soup,

- A glass of soda water please.
- I don't want any drinks.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Then,

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
what about fresh juice?

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,920
Okay.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Thanks.

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Please wait a moment.

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,880
Actually there's something

72
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
I've been wanting to tell you.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,880
At that time,

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,440
I didn't know something
happened to Xingyun

75
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
and I didn't mean to break up with you

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,080
at that time.

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,440
So,

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
did you receive the letter I sent you?

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,080
You never replied to me.

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,520
So, I thought

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
you hadn't decided on the matter

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
about me helping you out.

83
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,160
You want to help me?

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,480
If you want,

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
you're welcomed anytime.

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,160
Fine,

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,840
let me know

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
after you've arranged a time.

89

(Gu Nanzhou,)

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
(you showed up by my side)

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,520
(and helped me.)

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,320
(You helped me out)

93
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
(during my most difficult times.)

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
(I don't care why you approached me)

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
(in the first place.)

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,320
(I'm still grateful for everything)

97
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,440
(you've done for me.)

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
(I'm willing to give you)

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
(my shares of Gu Group)

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
(to help you to get
the decision-making power)

101
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,360
(if you need it.)

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,560
Why does she have Gu Group's shares?

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,480
(Did she misunderstand?)

104
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,800
Hello?

105
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Gu Nanzhou,

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,960
your mother just called me.

107
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,360
She said she's at your house

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
and there were strangers

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
saying they're living there now.

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
What did you say?

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
I didn't know how to explain.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
So I pretended that the coverage was bad

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
and hung up. I called you right after.

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,280
Also,

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
didn't you tell your mother

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
that we broke up?

117
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,720
You...

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,720
Can you help me again?

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Okay,

120
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,440
this will be the last time.

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,800
Okay.

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Come over now.

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
What did I owe him to do this?

124
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,960
Allow me.

125
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,840
Which room is it?

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,160
This one.

127
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
You can just place these
the way you want.

128
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
Just simply display them.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,560
It doesn't matter if it's not neat.

130
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,040
Okay.

131
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,680
Qingqing,

132
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I'm sorry

133
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,840
to bother you again.

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
Not at all, aunt.

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,280
By the way, Qingqing,

136
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
why did you suddenly move?

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,960
This place doesn't look too big

138
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,960
nor comfortable.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
This is closer to Xingyun.

140
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
So it's more convenient
for me to go to work.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
Also,

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,400
Qingqing prefers this environment.

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,400
There are more malls.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,280
So we don't have to go
too far for our dates.

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
It's indeed convenient

146
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
since it's Ms. Jiang's house.

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
This is Ms. Jiang's house?

148
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,600
I mean

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,040
we're renting this place from Ms. Jiang.

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,680
She has good taste.

151
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
What Qingqing means is that

152
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,960
she likes this environment.

153
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
I've been worrying all afternoon

154
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,680
that I haven't had dinner yet.

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Qingqing,

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
can you recommend

157
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
any restaurant nearby?

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,800
Restaurant?

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Sure.

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Mother, what do you want to eat?

161
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
Why don't we walk around and decide?

162
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,480
Let's go then.

163
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Why do I feel sleepy

164
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
after eating?

165
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Why don't I

166
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,080
stay over at your place?

167
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,720
It will be too late for me to go home.

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
You don't mind, right?

169
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
No, we don't.

170
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,800
Let's go then.

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,520
Let's go back early.

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,600
Help me out

173
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,520
just for once.

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Qingqing.

175
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,320
No way.

176
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Just for once.

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,320
-Help me.
-No!

178
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,040
Help me.

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
No!

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Just help me for once.

181
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
What are you two doing?

182
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,040
Don't you want to go home?

183
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
Qingqing is fixing my tie.

184
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,640
We'll be right there.

185
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,520
Okay,

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,880
I'll wait for you in front.

187
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,280
Just for once.

188
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,280
Help me just for once.

189
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Qingqing,

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,280
don't go. Listen to me.

191
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,440
Gu Nanzhou, let me go.

192
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,320
Let me ask you.

193
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
What should we do now?

194
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm not going to sleep

195
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
in the same room with you tonight.

196
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
Listen, Qingqing.

197
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,200
Actually, I...

198
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,760
I don't want to hear it.

199
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
I just read that letter today.

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Did you break up with me

201
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,680
because you thought I approached you

202
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,160
for the shares?

203
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,200
Is that why?

204
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes.

205
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,320
Son,

206
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
take me to the supermarket.

207
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
It's already late. What
do you want to buy?

208
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
I forgot to pack up when I left today.

209
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I need to buy some daily necessities.

210
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,280
Hurry up.

211
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,480
The supermarket is closing soon.

212
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Qingqing, we'll be back soon.

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,640
Mother,

214
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
you've been going around all day.

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Are you buying or not?

216
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,760
Do you really think I'm buying things?

217
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,520
Stop pretending.

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,760
I know

219
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,080
you two broke up.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,360
Tell me.

221
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,080
Why did you break up?

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,880
Xingyun encountered some issues.

223
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,120
I was too busy to accompany her.

224
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,840
She felt neglected.

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,960
Of course you should accompany her.

226
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
Brat,

227
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
you're such a workaholic.

228
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
You have to pay more attention to this.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
What else?

230
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,120
She seems to misunderstand

231
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,400
my relationship with Jiang Jingxuan.

232
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
No offense.

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,520
But I know

234
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
Jiang Jingxuan has feelings for you

235
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
from the beginning.

236
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,160
She's also full of dirty tricks.

237
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,640
You have a girlfriend.

238
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
Keeping someone like this

239
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
is only inviting trouble.

240
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,520
Mother,

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,960
there may be another reason.

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
She seems to misunderstand

243
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,360
that I got engaged with her
because of the shares.

244
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
Let me ask you this.

245
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
You can't move on from her, right?

246
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,640
All right,

247
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
I'll figure out a way.

248
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,640
You don't have to.

249
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,120
Can you take care of this?

250
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,320
No.

251
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Then just listen to me.

252
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,840
Let's go.

253
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,480
We'll just enjoy breakfast

254
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
and let Xiaozhou perform.

255
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,400
Milk.

256
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,760
Stop.

257
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,400
Be careful, it's hot.

258
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,520
Drink it later.

259
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,160
Egg.

260
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you.

261
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
You prefer it a little charred.

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,360
Mother, you like it with ketchup.

263
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
You prefer strawberry jam.

264
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
Xiaozhou

265
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,320
has always been this attentive

266
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,800
and warm since he's a kid.

267
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,200
Qingqing,

268
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,280
don't you think so?

269
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,640
Your favorite pickled mustard green.

270
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you.

271
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,800
Eat up, Qingqing.

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
I'm sore all over lately.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Let me give you a massage.

274
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,960
It's okay.

275
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,080
If you're free today,

276
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
why don't you accompany me

277
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,720
to the hot spring villa at Mount Qilin?

278
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,560
Aunt, I...

279
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,120
Sure,

280
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
let's go together then.

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
I know

282
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,120
you youngsters are very busy now.

283
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,280
Our whole family used

284
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
to visit the hot spring villa then.

285
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
After that, Licheng and
Nanxing passed away.

286
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,240
So, I don't want

287
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,480
to go there alone.

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
I was thinking

289
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,800
you could accompany me to go there

290
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,080
if you're free.

291
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,560
Sure, aunt.

292
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,240
We'll go there after breakfast.

293
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,560
This is the private hot spring service

294
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,840
I specially requested
the manager to reserve.

295
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,240
Come on in.

296
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,160
What do you think?

297
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
It's pretty good.

298
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,600
Qingqing,

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,680
come to my room and
enjoy the hot spring.

300
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,560
We can have our own private
talks behind Xiaozhou's back.

301
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,920
Sure, aunt.

302
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
I'll go back to my room
and get ready then.

303
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
See you later.

304
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,480
Xiaozhou,

305
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
I'll head back to my room.

306
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
You two should take some rest.

307
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,040
Okay,

308
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,600

booked this room.

316
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,240
Maybe

317
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040

Qingqing,

336
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,440
Xiaozhou has told me last night.

337
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
I knew you two broke up.

338
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
I also knew your contract, too.

339
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
After that, you found out

340
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,360
your father owned Gu Group's shares.

341
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,240
Aunt,

342
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,600
you knew everything?

343
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
Actually, Xiaozhou didn't approach
you because of the shares.

344
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,240
We only found out about
the shares recently.

345
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,440
He wanted to marry you because
of Licheng's last wish at first.

346
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,240
I tried to stop him after
I found out about it.

347
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,680
Marriage is his own decision to make

348
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
no matter what.

349
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,720
Licheng shouldn't have interfered

350
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
in his marriage even if he's his father,

351
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,800
right?

352
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,800
However, Xiaozhou told me

353
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,960
he started to have feelings for you

354
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,440
and wanted to be with you.

355
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,040
Aunt,

356
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,280
what if Nanzhou said that

357
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,440
because he didn't want
to let his father down?

358
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
Nanzhou has always been
a filial child since young.

359
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,120
Ever since Nanxing's demise,

360
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,840
he never defied his father.

361
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,640
In order to make his father happy,

362
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
he gave up animation to study business.

363
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,680
Actually, I know

364
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,280
he felt guilty because of Nanxing.

365
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,160
So, he forced himself

366
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
to live up to his father's expectations.

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
(So, he wanted to marry me)

368
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,080
(with such a heavy burden on him.)

369
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,120
However, he wanted to be with you

370
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,440
because you let him break away
from those expectations

371
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,120
and make him live a different life.

372
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,760
He may have cried in secret

373
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
after you two broke up.

374
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,040
Have some water.

375
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,320
Qingqing!

376
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,760
What's wrong?

377
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,760
Qingqing!

378
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,320
Qingqing!

379
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,560
Are you okay?

380
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,080
Qingqing!

381
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,400
Qingqing, wake up!

382
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,800
Mother, allow me.

383
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,320
Be careful.

384
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,520
Be careful.

385
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Be careful.

386
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,040
You're awake.

387
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,960
Did you stay up late

388
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
often lately?

389
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,760
Not really.

390
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Have some warm water.

391
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,920
Thank you.

392
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,440
Actually, you don't have
to be so meticulous

393
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,520
when your mother is not here.

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Just rest if you're tired.

395
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
I'll be right here.

396
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,680
Call me if you need anything.

397
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
I feel comfortable after
enjoying the hot spring.

398
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
My whole body feels so relaxed.

399
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,320
If you want,

400
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,600
I'll come with you next time.

401
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay.

402
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,080
Are you feeling better now?

403
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,240
A lot better.

404
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,320
Xiaozhou, come and see this.

405
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,400
They still keep

406
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
our family's photo here.

407
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,640
I remember

408
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,480
we came here often then.

409
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,760
Those were happy times.

410
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
So many years passed by.

411
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,320
Qingqing,

412
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,200
look.

413
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,960
It's Xiaozhou's elder brother.

414
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,360
He's pretty handsome, right?

415
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Yes, he was.

416
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,360
I remember my father scolded me,

417
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,840
saying I was not as good
as him in any way.

418
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
He's just saying that in front of you.

419
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,360
He kept praising you to others

420
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
for how smart you were

421
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,080
as you're good at creating stories.

422
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,880
Xiaozhou,

423
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
don't think about your father

424
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,440
in everything.

425
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,600
It doesn't matter what he thought.

426
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
What's important is what you think.

427
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
I approached you because
of my father's last wish.

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,880
However, falling for you

429
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
has nothing to do with the rest.

430
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Actually, I'm grateful
about that last wish.

431
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,240
It allowed me to meet you.

432
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,960
I...

433
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,920
You might get cold
from sleeping like this.

434
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
So I covered you with my coat.

435
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you.

436
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,080
Well,

437
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
it's already late.

438
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,800
I'd better go home now.

439
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,600
I'll give you a ride.

440
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
It's okay.

441
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I can take a taxi.

442
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,960
Let's go.

443
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,600
This is one of Xingyun's
benefits for our employees.

444
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,160
Thank you for sending me home.

445
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,720
Actually,

446
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
I didn't want to break
up with you at the time.

447
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,600
However, there was too
much mess to clean up.

448
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Lejiabao wanted compensation

449
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,320
and investors wanted to
pull out of the project.

450
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,640
I felt defeated at the time

451
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,160
and doubted myself.

452
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,280
Why are you telling me this?

453
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,480
I don't want you to
misunderstand me anymore.

454
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,040
I know

455
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,880
I was a selfish

456
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,360
and conceited person.

457
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,840
I didn't want you to see me

458
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,000
looking defeated.

459
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
Nor did I want you to
face all the pressure with me

460
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,280
and find me useless.

461
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,560
However, if you want to be in the know,

462
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
I can tell you.

463
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,160
Qingqing,

464
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
let's start over.

465
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,200
I think

466
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
we should reconsider

467
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
this matter carefully.

468
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
I can't give you an answer now.

469
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll leave now.

470
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,120
What are you doing here?

471
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm waiting for Zhou Jianqing
to come home.

472
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
I didn't expect to see such a show.

473
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
I can hear everything clearly

474
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,360
from the front row.

475
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,280
I really love her.

476
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
I love her a lot.

477
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,600
I know.

478
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,880
Seeing how sincere you are,

479
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
I can count on you to take care of her.

480
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,280
Don't give up.

481
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,400
Good morning, Yuan.

482
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,920
Good morning.

483
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,680
Zhang Yin,

484
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,480
I heard Mr. Gu arranged you

485
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,360
to join the animation
summit in Jiangcheng.

486
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm so jealous of you.

487
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,520
Mr. Gu is sending you there?

488
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
Not bad.

489
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,080
Since when are you that close to Mr. Gu?

490
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,760
He's sending me to Jiangcheng?

491
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,360
Didn't he assign Xiaochuan?

492
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,840
How am I supposed to know?

493
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,240
You'd better get ready.

494
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,720
The flight is in the afternoon.

495
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
You should prepare
the things you need to bring.

496
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,320
Hello, Mr. Gu.

497
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry

498
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,760
that I'm late.

499
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,440
Hello.

500
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
Is Zhou Jianqing not coming?

501
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,240
Our boss

502
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,000
sent her to join the animation
summit at the last minute.

503
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
I was in a hurry.

504
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,000
I forgot to inform you.

505
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,600
Animation

506
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
summit?

507
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,040
Yes,

508
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
the animation summit in Jiangcheng.

509
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,000
Mr. Gu,

510
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,680
why did you send me to Jiangcheng?

511
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
You're just getting in my way

512
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,520
so that you'll have the upper hand.

513
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,720
This is not fair.

514
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Many elites will gather at this summit.

515
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
It's a good opportunity for you

516
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,120
to get acquainted with them
on behalf of the company.

517
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,440
Tell me

518
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
about the itinerary of
the animation summit this time.

519
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
It seems to be similar
to the previous one.

520
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
It'll be the summit meetings
during the day.

521
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,720
At night...

522
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,880
There's a fireworks show at night.

523
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Fireworks show.

524
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,400
Why are you asking about this suddenly?

525
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,200
Reserve a hotel and a flight for me.

526
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040
A flight ticket?

527
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,720
Where are you going?

528
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,840
Zhou Jianqing

529
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,080
has been sent to the animation summit.

530
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,160
I'll book it right away.

531
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,840
I'm going now.

532
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
(Jiang Cheng Hotel)

533
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,680
Qingqing?

534
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,560
What are you doing here?

535
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,840
You guys are here, too?

536
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,080
Yes, what a coincidence.

537
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I just arrived today.

538
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,960
The company sent me
here as a signed creator.

539
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,600
I didn't expect to see you here.

540
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,560
Yes,

541
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,880
I didn't expect to see you, too.

542
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
Let's take a group photo

543
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,240
to commemorate our
encounter in Jiangcheng.

544
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,560
Let me take it for you.

545
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,560
Thank you.

546
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,600
Get ready.

547
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,120
Look here.

548
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,640
(Air Nancheng)

549
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Please enjoy.

550
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,520
Thank you.

551
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
(What a small world.)

552
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,840
(We bump into each other here.
Let's pursue our dreams.)

553
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,040
Hello,

554
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,080
check

555
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,920
if there's any flight to Jiangcheng

556
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,200
before 2.20pm.

557
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,360
Okay, Mr. Gu.

558
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,160
I'll check it right away.

559
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
There is a flight

560
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,560
but only economy class is available.

561
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,800
Economy class?

562
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Yes.

563
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
Your symptoms may be better,

564
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,160
but economy class will...

565
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,960
Change it.
