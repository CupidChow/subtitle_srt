00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,775
=Episode 12=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,251
(Beyond the obligation...)

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Gu Nanzhou,

32
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,519
why are you

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,599
being so mean to me lately?

34
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,279
Is it because I split
water on your book?

35
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,039
Is it because

36
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,720
I washed your pants

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
together with bed sheets?

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,240
Are you angry that
I barged into the bathroom

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,639
and saw you taking a bath?

40
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,559
Product placement

41
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,559
in an animation

42
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,960
is a common method nowadays.

43
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,720
(Product Placement)
We get paid for advertising

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,559
and get to lower the risk.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,839
When the animation is released,

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,199
the sponsor will help us

47
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,000
to promote it.

48
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,440
Sorry.

49
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,399
We can't accept it.

50
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,559
I can accept partial product placement

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,679
in the scenes about real life,

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,919
but after the characters
enter Lake Xingling,

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,919
I want the sense of
reality to be minimized.

54
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,440
There can't be any product placement.

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
The scene of real life

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,800
only covers 10% of the animation.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,759
We can't slot in

58
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,960
so many advertisements,

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
unless you lengthen this part.

60
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:24,960
Lake Xingling's structure

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,919
can't be changed.

62
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
We can't accept

64
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,199
Yingqi's proposal.

65
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,440
Mr. Gu,

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,160
according to our agreement,

67
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,880
as the investor, Yingqi

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
can request Xingyun

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,639
to have reasonable amendment.

70
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,399
If Xingyun doesn't do that,

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,399
Yingqi can pull out from
the project anytime.

72
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,080
I got you.

73
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,600
However, this project

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,600
is what I've been wanting to do

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,559
for ten years.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
I know exactly how

77
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,119
to present it at its best.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,440
Okay.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,160
I'll let Mr. He know

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
your stand.

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
We need to amend these four parts.

82
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,240
The atmosphere in this chapter

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,160
has to be refreshing.

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,800
Mr. Gu,

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Mr. He of Yingqi called.

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,519
What did he say?

88
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,600
Mr. He said that

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,519
after comprehensive consideration,

90
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,359
he thought investing
in Xingyun was risky.

91
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:22,720
So he decided to
withdraw the investment.

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,359
However, we're going

93
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,359
to pay Bule Ray soon.

94
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,640
If they withdraw it now,

95
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,320
Xingyun will face an issue of cash flow.

96
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,440
According to the agreement,

97
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
when do we need to make

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,399
the first payment to Bule Ray?

99
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,480
We need to do it on 13th.

100
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,079
I heard that

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,799
Mr. He of Yingqi and Lu Ziming

102
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,640
are good friends.

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,799
Do you think

104
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,040
it's Lu Ziming's conspiracy

105
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,239
to make us sign an agreement
with Bule Ray

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,519
before Yingqi withdrew the investment

107
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,320
to ruin us once and for all?

108
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,000
Qingqing meant well but
she landed us in trouble.

109
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,920
She got Yingqi to invest in us,

110
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,160
but we didn't expect

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Xingyun to be in big trouble.

112
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,799
It's my decision

113
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,640
to collaborate with Yingqi.

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,160
It has nothing to do with her.

115
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Just discuss with Bule Ray

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,519
first.

117
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,119
Ask if we can postpone the first payment

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
to a few days later.

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,119
Okay.

120
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,420
(Jiang Jingxuan)

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,119
Hello.

122
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,040
Bule Ray

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,959
called and asked

124
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,320
about the first payment.

125
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,519
Following what you said,

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,519
we discussed it

127
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,359
and it's postponed for a week.

128
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,559
Thank you.

129
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,359
Even though we have one more week,

130
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,399
our company doesn't have enough money.

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,920
Don't worry about the money.

132
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,279
I'll figure it out.

133
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,839
Haven't you found the right company?

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,959
Those companies that offered me jobs

135
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,079
are not the ones I want.

136
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,760
Those I want to join didn't look for me.

137
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,279
Here you go.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,279
Listen.

139
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,359
Stop torturing yourself.

140
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,920
Instead of working in
our family's company,

141
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,799
you want to suffer out there.

142
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,880
Mother,

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
I told you...

144
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Got it.

145
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
You're not interested in
your father's business.

146
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,519
I just want to do something on my own.

147
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,519
Everyone around me has a goal,

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
but I don't even have a direction.

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,399
You're a girl.

150
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Why do you have to exhaust yourself?

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,720
You should make more new friends.

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,799
Expand your social circle

153
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,000
and you won't be isolated.

154
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,200
You're always like this.

155
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,640
You don't like being nagged.

156
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,000
Are you free at noon?

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
The son of Antai's Uncle Liu

158
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
came back from overseas.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,200
He invited us for lunch.

160
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,880
Mother,

161
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
I told you no more blind date.

162
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
It's not a blind date.

163
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,480
It's just a meal.

164
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,959
You're young adults.

165
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,959
Maybe you can talk to him

166
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,880
and befriend him.

167
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
Your social circle is small.

168
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,399
Where else can you get
to know new friends?

169
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,959
I don't need so many friends.

170
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,239
The more friends, the more options.

171
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,480
Finish the fruits.

172
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,839
The vitamin is good for your complexion.

173
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,160
Remember. 12PM.

174
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,559
Your restaurant serves great dishes.

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,279
It's exactly the same as what I had

176
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,000
in Provence.

177
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,119
Thank you, sir.

178
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,040
I had a chance to learn it overseas.

179
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,320
I hope you like the dishes.

180
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Waiter! Come here.

181
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,959
Please enjoy.

182
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,559
Sure.

183
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,440
It's diverse.

184
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,519
Not bad.

185
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,399
Let's order Ratatouille

186
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,440
and blanquette de veau.

187
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,040
Xiaxia.

188
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:04,679
Help yourselves. Come on.

189
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,519
Come on.

190
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,440
Well,

191
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,839
anything will do.

192
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:09,959
Waiter,

193
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,760
Ratatouille

194
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
and blanquette de veau.

195
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,880
Please hold on, sir.

196
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,040
Come on, Xiaxia.

197
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,239
Come on, try the fish.

198
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,880
It's really delicious.

199
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,160
It's good for the complexion, too.

200
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
We'll be a family.

201
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,559
I know, right?

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,519
Come on.

203
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,600
Excuse me,

204
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
I want to go to the bathroom.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,119
Xuan,

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,599
I didn't want to come here.

207
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,239
His parents did.

208
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:50,919
Don't get the wrong idea.

209
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm happy

210
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,719
that you came to our restaurant.

211
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,039
Then the chefs,

212
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,679
can get more bonus.

213
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,559
About just now...

214
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,080
Did your family bring you out
for a social gathering again?

215
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,679
It's good.

216
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,760
Getting in touch with others

217
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,840
is good for you.

218
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,520
Xiaxia,

219
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,239
I saw you walking this way.

220
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,919
I thought the bathroom was over here.

221
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,760
Do you know each other?

222
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,119
He's...

223
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:16,760
Look,

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,599
Ms. Su is our restaurant's VIP.

225
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,320
I serve her regularly.

226
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,880
Of course we know each other.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,719
You suggested another restaurant.

228
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,559
I thought

229
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,679
you didn't like the food here.

230
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,280
I like it here,

231
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,479
but

232
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,679
I didn't want your parents
to spend too much.

233
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,400
It's all right.

234
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,479
It's time for us to go back.

235
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,760
Our parents are waiting.

236
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
I'll play host to you next time.

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,799
Sure.

Uncle, aunt

240
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
and Xiaxia,

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll send you home.

242
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,719
It's all right.

243
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,799
Just take care of Xiaxia.

244
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,119
All right.

245
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:55,880
We'll go back first.

246
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:56,960
Okay.

247
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,440
We'll make a move first.

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Uncle and aunt, bye.

249
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,520
We're leaving.

250
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,840
Mother!

251
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,559
Bye.

252
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,159
Your son is great.

253
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,080
How is he? Not bad, right?

254
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,679
Xiaxia,

255
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,159
I know a great bar around here.

256
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,719
Why don't we go there?

257
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,320
Not today,

258
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,080
I have something on.

259
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,520
You...

260
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,159
Mr. Gu.

261
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,880
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

262
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,440
We're only left

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,760
with one investor, Jialuo.

264
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:25,799
However, there's a problem

265
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,880
with their company this year.

266
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,479
They might not agree to invest.

267
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,440
What about Qihe Capital?

268
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,719
In our last meeting,

269
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,159
didn't Mr. Sun say it's almost done?

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
They're singing a different tune now.

271
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,640
After risk assessment,

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,919
they're reconsidering it.

274
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,880
It's okay.

275

Have a meeting with
the original draft team first.

276
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,679
I'll figure out the investment.

277
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,599
Okay.

278
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,760
Your background

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,039
is getting better.

280
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,039
I should call you

281
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,159
Zhang the Expert now.

282
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,039
Stop flattering me.

283
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,280
Just send me

284
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,239
whatever that's needed to be done

285
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,479
or we might not make it two days later.

286
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,559
That's all.

287
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,559
Thank you.

288
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,719
Maintain the quality and quantity.

289
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,559
No problem, don't worry.

290
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,799
Hello, Yan.

291
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,280
Qingqing, come to the company now.

292
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,599
Now?

293
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm rushing my work.

294
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,320
The deadline is approaching.

295
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,479
You may delay it for a day.

296
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,119
You must attend this meeting.

297
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,520
There's a big good news.

298
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,880

304
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,760
it might be made into an animation.

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,359
Seriously, Yan?

306
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,239
All right, I'll be right there.

307
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,400

308
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,440

Thank you, Yan!

312

You're welcome.

Where are you going?

314
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,000
Yan just told me

315
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,440
that our Romantic Starry Sky

316
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
might be turned into an animation.

317
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,599
You're awesome, Qingqing.

318
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,440
Is it confirmed?

319
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,799
Not yet.

320
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,799
Yan wants me

321
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,640
to talk to them.

322
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,520
Your senior is eloquent.

323
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,159
It's a piece of cake.

324
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,159
If we secure the deal,

325
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,599
seeing how you went all out to help me,

326
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,679
we'll split the bonus.

327
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,799

Hello.

Hello.

I'm looking for Mr. He.

334
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,280
Mr. He has something on.

335

growing up.

340
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,640
Forget about his minor flaws,

341
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
the worst thing is

342
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,159
he's willful and arrogant.

343
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,280
He lost most of the Gus' fortune

344
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,760
that was entrusted to him.

345

Yingqi withdrew our investment in time

347
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,719
instead of walking into the trap.

348
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,559
I think he's simply inexperienced.

349
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,640
He even wants

350
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,080
to work with top special
effects team overseas.

351
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
He's digging

352
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,119
his own grave.

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,960
That's why Gu Group

354
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,719
needs to be led

355
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,440
by someone like you, Mr. Lu.

356
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,200
If Gu Nanzhou

357
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,760
was half as smart as you, Mr. He,

358
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,359
I wouldn't have been so anxious.

359
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,280
As the saying goes,

360
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,880
a family's fortune can't last for
more than three generations.

361
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,119
Licheng and I

362
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,440
worked so hard to establish this.

363
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
When it's handed to the kid...

364
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,559
Ms. Zhou.

365
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,840
Mr. He, you still remember me.

366
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,039
Of course,

367
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,280
you're memorable.

368
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,000
I would like to discuss
something with you, Mr. He

369
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,880
and Mr. Lu.

370
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,960
Me as well?

371
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm all ears.

372
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,640
Although I'm new in the industry,

373
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,400
I have basic aesthetic sense.

374
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
If you ask me,

375
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
Lake Xingling is one

376
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,200
of the few best works in recent years.

377
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
It may not be perfect,

378
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,159
but each penny Gu Nanzhou

379
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,919
invests in it

380
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,119
is absolutely worth it.

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,119
If that's the case,

382
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,559
do you think it's my mistake

383
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,159
for Yingqi to withdraw

384
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,200
from Lake Xingling?

385
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,080
It's a grave mistake.

386
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,640
Enlighten me.

387
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,400
What did I do wrong?

388
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,640
Gu Nanzhou knows

389
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,159
how good this project is.

390
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,039
That's why he spent a lot of money

391
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,280
to make it.

392
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
However, you only care

393
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
about the risks and cost.

394
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,919
Gu Nanzhou's obsession

395
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,119
is seen as a spendthrift's ways.

396
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,000
One who only cares about the profit

397
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,679
can be a good businessman,

398
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,440
but he or she can never
produce good work.

399
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,239
I've been in the industry for years

400
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
and produced so many good works.

401
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,239
Young lady,

402
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,320
you're the first one

403
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
who spoke to me like that.

404
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,440
Am I wrong?

405
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,239
The Legend of the Valley

406
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,919
was eight years ago, right?

407
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,479
Did Yingqi produce

408
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,640
any reputable work after that?

409
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,919
I think you're

410
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,359
inexperienced.

411
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,760
That's why you're
brainwashed by Gu Nanzhou.

412
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,320
How well do you know about him?

413
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,280
Why are you defending him?

414
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,440
I might not know Gu Nanzhou well,

415
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,359
but I know Lake Xingling well.

416
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,239
If you give up a piece of great work,

417
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,559
in which Gu Nanzhou poured his heart,

418
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,080
over a personal grudge,

419
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,719
then you're

420
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,799
the stupid ones.

421
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,760
I don't know

422
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,479
how good Lake Xingling is,

423
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,679
but I know Gu Nanzhou

424
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,559
perfectly well.

425
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,080
You'd better ask him this.

426
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,679
15 years ago,

427
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,479
how did his brother

428
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,719
die in a stampede?

429
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,080
Obsession?

430
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,320
His obsession

431
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,840
is about having his own way for decades

432
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,840
and disregarding others' lives.

433
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,599
Ms. Zhou,

434
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,359
you're a great distance

435
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,000
away from our standard
for collaboration.

436
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,760
Therefore, there's no point

437
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,159
discussing this collaboration.

438
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,520
Wait till

439
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,719
you are more mature.

440
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,320
Ms. Li.

441
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,239
Ms. Zhou.

442
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
(Romantic Starry Sky)

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,980

444
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,020
(November 22 Chunyu Square Stampede)

445
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,300
(November 22)

446
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,280
It's his brother's death
anniversary today.

447
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,760
Gu Nanzhou.

448
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,400
Gu Nanzhou.

449
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:12,959
Gu Nanzhou!

450
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,560
Hello, Xiaochuan.

451
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,760
Hello, Qingqing.

452
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,880
Is Mr. Gu in?

453
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,199
I don't think so.

454
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:31,880
What's the matter?

455
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,199
Mr. Gu was absent
for an internal meeting

456
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:35,959
this afternoon.

457
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
I saw that his pill box was empty.

458
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,439
He's not picking up my calls either.

459
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I don't know where he went.

460
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,520
Is he suffering from anxiety again?

461
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,599
Did

462
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,839
anything bad happen again?

463
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,680
Mr. Gu negotiated

464
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,719
with several investment companies today,

465
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,479
but none went well.

466
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,199
According to Xuan,

467
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,079
Lu Ziming intentionally spread

468
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,680
news about a problem
with Xingyun's capital.

469
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,479
As a result, many companies

470
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,719
are reluctant to work with us.

471
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,520
Lu Ziming

472
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,599
is evil.

473
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,119
If I knew, I should've

474
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,319
scolded him even more today.

475
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,280
Did you see Lu Ziming?

476
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,239
Forget it.

477
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,800
It's pointless to scold him anyway.

478
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,959
Let's look for Gu Nanzhou first.

479
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
Where could he possibly go?

480
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
So you're here.

481
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,199
What a great night view.

482
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,040
I should've worked at
the balcony back then.

483
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,359
Who allowed you to come here?

484
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,599
Go out.

485
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,920
I pay my rental.

486
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,079
If you can be here,

487
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,079
why can't I be?

488
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,599
Just stay here

489
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,199
without making a noise.

490
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,680
Fine.

491
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,839
I'll lower my voice.

492
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,599
One needs to suck when eating crayfish.

493
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,560
Do you want to try one?

494
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Don't miss it.

495
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,599
I'm not lying.

496
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,000
How is it?

497
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,319
It's so-so.

498
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,560
You're boring.

499
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,359
You can't even appreciate

500
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,599
crayfish.

501
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,680
You've been peeling it for so long

502
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,560
and there's so little flesh.

503
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,800
Isn't it troublesome?

504
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,439
It's really simple.

505
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,680
Do you want to give it a try?

506
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,479
You're indeed from a rich family.

507
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,199
You look so stiff peeling it.

508
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,319
That's it.

509
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,359
Eat it.

510
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,280
It's not so difficult.

511
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,280
What's wrong?

512
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:23,839
Did I do it wrong?

513
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,000
No.

514
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,160
You peeled it quite well.

515
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,040
It's been a while

516
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,119
since someone peeled it for me.

517
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm not used to it.

518
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:00,920
Well,

519
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,560
you can have the rest.

520
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,920
I need to rush for my work.

521
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,040
Why can't I open the door?

522
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,280
Where's your key?

523
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,319
I think I forgot to bring it.

524
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,479
My phone is dead.

525
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,880
What about yours?

526
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,280
Mine...

527
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
Mine is dead, too.

528
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,599
You...

529
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,719
The cleaner will come tomorrow.

530
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
She'll open the door for us.

531
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,479
Just take a break.

532
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,719
What's so nice about stargazing?

533
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,520
I think it's interesting.

534
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,000
For example, the Milky Way

535
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,560
will be dimmer in winter than summer.

536
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,000
The Big Dipper

537
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,439
will be pointing to the north.

538
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,599
Also, Orion

539
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:47,040
is the shiniest in winter.

540
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,280
How do you know?

541
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,160
My brother taught me when I was young.

542
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,880
He'd been bright since young.

543
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,280
Astronomy, geography, music and arts.

544
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,479
You name it and he knew it.

545
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,239
If he didn't die,

546
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
my father wouldn't
have been disappointed.

547
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,439
Look,

548
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,959
what's that?

549
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,920
That's Cassiopeia.

550
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:32,800
What about that?

551
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,000
The constellation

552
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,640
is Draco.

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,359
Meteor!

554
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,160
That's a plane.

555
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,199
It's just a plane.

What is this?

580
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,319
It's the key to my office drawer.

581

It's actually the balcony's key.
