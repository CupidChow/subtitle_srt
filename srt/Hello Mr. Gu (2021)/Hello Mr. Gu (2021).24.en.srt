=Episode 24=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
(As long as you're here)

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,360
Outsiders should not

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,600
meddle in a relationship.

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Maybe they're suitable for each other.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm not an outsider.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Besides,

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm very sure that

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
Zhou Zixuan is evil.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
Their relationship is quite stable.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,720
So, don't interrupt their date.

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,400
Besides,

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
it's not safe to go out now.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
No way I'm believing that.

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,560
He's definitely finding ways

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,720
to pick on Susu.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,880
How do you know

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,160
their relationship is steady?

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
Sometimes, your brother and I will

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
talk to each other.

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
He told me.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
He kept it from me

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
but he told you?

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
They've been dating for a while now.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
What a rascal.

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,040
He must have plotted
this from the beginning.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
How could someone pure and innocent

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,280
like Susu resist
a cunning person like him?

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,800
How dare he target my best friend?

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
He's courting death.

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
Maybe it's true love.

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,120
Just don't get involved.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,320
How could you be so heartless?

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
I can't watch my best friend
walking into a trap.

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,040
What is it this time?

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
Have you left a review on
the animation elaboration

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,880
I asked you to watch?

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,760
It's urgent.

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,040
I did it already.

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,720
I attached it in your email.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,400
Didn't you read it?

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Okay, I'll read it now.

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
Don't leave.

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,880
(Zhou Jianqing will look for you
at Su Youxia's house.)

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,320
(She found out about you two.)

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,640
(Stop her.)

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
(We're in the same boat.)

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
(If she breaks Su Youxia and me up,)

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
(you can stop seeing my sister.)

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Don't you think

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,440
you're going too far?

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
It has already come to this,

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
I can't show mercy.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,400
What should we do if she really comes?

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
She's warned me so many times.

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
She's definitely going to lose it.

85
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Don't worry,

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,880
I have a backup plan.

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
Are you done?

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
Take your time, I'm going now.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,360
Are you okay?

90
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,600
What's wrong?

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,320
Are you okay?

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
Gu Nanzhou, don't scare me.

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Lie down first.

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,120
Which part hurts?

95
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,320
I don't feel so good.

96
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
Stay with me.

97
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,320
Tell me.

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,400
Which part is painful?

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
It's Lu Ziming.

100
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,200
He has been forcing me

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,480
to hold a board meeting
at the headquarters.

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
There are so many people there.

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
I can't do it.

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
It's too much pressure.

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,240
Too much pressure?

106
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
We can do something about it.

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,960
If it doesn't work,

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I'll speak on your behalf.

109
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,680
He won't agree to that.

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
If I don't go,

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,040
he'll withdraw the investment

112
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
from Lake Xingling.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
This wily fox

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
is really harsh on you.

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm very anxious now.

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,280
You must stay.

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
There's only one way out.

118
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
What is it?

119
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll accompany you

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
to psychotherapy starting tomorrow.

121
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,960
Never mind.

122
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll take my medication.

123
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Your psychologist said

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,080
your condition is psychological.

125
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
Medication only treats
the symptom, not the root.

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,440
Now that your condition has worsened,

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
we must not delay your treatment.

128
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,680
I really don't need it.

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm serious.

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,880
You know

131
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
I don't like going to
the psychological clinic.

132
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
I forbid you to avoid treatment.

133
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
I'll accompany you to
the clinic tomorrow.

134
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,560
You're not allowed to refuse.

135
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
Hurry up.

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Hurry.

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,600
Come here.

138
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
I have a meeting later.

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
Honesty

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
is the best policy.

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
I've asked Jiang Xiaochuan.

142
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,760
You're free the whole morning.

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,640
I...

144
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,880
Get in.

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
(Save me.)

146
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
(For the sake of helping you,)

147
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
(I'm being dragged to
a hospital by your sister.)

148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,720
We'll place a reception counter

149
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
at the entrance.

150
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
That way, the customers
will be briefly welcomed

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,840
when they enter.

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720
Next, we'll have a resting area

153
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
this side

154
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
or this area, perhaps.

155
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Come on.

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,880
Wait,

157
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,080
your brother is looking for me.

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,520
It's not important.

159
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
It can wait till
your treatment is over.

160
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,840
I want to talk to him, too.

161
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm not done with him yesterday.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
He's pretty anxious.

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

164
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,440
Fine,

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll call him.

166
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,640
As for this range hood,

167
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,960
it's carefully selected
from several brands

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
because western cuisine's cooking method

169
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
is different from Chinese cuisine.

170
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
So the requirement of functionality

171
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
(Qingqing)
is different, too.

172
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Then, look at this.

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,240
Wait a second.

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
(Qingqing)

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
Please continue.

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Gu Nanzhou.

177
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
You can go if you want.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,240
I won't stop you.

179
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,400
Okay,

180
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,320
I'll get the car then.

181
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,600
What's wrong?

182
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
I won't beg you anymore.

183
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,520
It's my fault we lost the baby.

184
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
It's all my fault.

185
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,560
I'll set you free.

186
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,440
I'll let go of you.

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,800
I wish you happiness.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,840
Fine,

189
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I'll go, okay?

190
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Enough, get up.

191
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Seriously?

192
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes, I'll go.

193
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,320
I'll go.

194
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,400
Get up.

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,320
Get up.

196
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
Follow the light

197
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,080
and walk towards the most familiar part

198
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,760
of your memory.

199
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,400
He has improved a lot recently.

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
Looks like the recent treatment

201
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,120
is more effective than before.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Then,

203
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
can his illness be cured completely?

204
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
His anxiety disorder and stress
response under high pressure

205
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,840
are all psychological.

206
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,840
If we can find ways

207
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,080
to help him to overcome his mental block

208
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,120
and confront the things
he refuses to face,

209
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
it may take a better turn.

210
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,800
Also,

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
we have you.

212
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,160
Me?

213
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
Have you heard

214
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,160
of Morita therapy?

215
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,960
It's making patients accept
the current situation

216
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,000
and adapt to their own feelings.

217
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,360
Will it be too provocative?

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,320
All these years,

219
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
he never wants to talk
about what happened.

220
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
The moment he relapses,

221
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,760
he suffocates.

222
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,520
Back then,

223
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,400
I wouldn't recommend

224
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,920
this therapy to him.

225
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
However, now I can see

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,080
that he trusts you.

227
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,000
The key of this treatment

228
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
is about having someone

229
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
comfort him

230
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,360
when he's accepting his situation

231
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
and let him know

232
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,480
that everything will be fine.

233
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
Can you tell me

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
what happened back then?

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
It's a form of treatment if you tell me.

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,040
The doctor told me

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,440
your condition would improve

238
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,920
if you had a listener

239
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,520
by your side

240
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
at this moment.

241
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,800
That night,

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,920
we went out to see fireworks.

243
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
My brother told me not to wander.

244
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
I didn't listen to him,

245
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,360
because I wanted to
pick up this Rubik's Cube.

246
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
To save me,

247
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
he got injured in a stampede.

248
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,280
After that...

249
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,160
Brother!

250
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,440
What are you doing?

251
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,600
Stop pushing!

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
My feet!

253
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
My feet!

254
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Stay there.

255
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,560
It'll be okay.

256
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,320
Brother!

257
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
He died because of me.

258
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,040
You should throw that away

259
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
if that's the case.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,560
No.

261
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,400
The dead can't come back to life.

262
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,480
Keeping it

263
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,400
will only remind you that
you're not allowed

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,320
to make any mistake.

265
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,360
That's why your condition

266
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
is getting worse.

267
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
I must remember it.

268
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,600
I should have died instead.

269
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
All of us hope

270
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,760
you can live happily.

271
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,680
I do.

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Your mother, too.

273
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,200
I think

274
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
your brother would think the same

275
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,000
if he could see you now.

276
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,040
I'm really sorry.

277
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I didn't mean it.

278
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,320
(Isn't this my signature?)

279
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,640
(This Rubik's Cube belonged
to me when I was young.)

280
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,960
Why are you crying?

281
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,360
This is too hard to solve.

282
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,200
I can't even match the colors.

283
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Let me try.

284
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,360
Here you go.

285
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,720
Brother,

286
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,080
you're really clever.

287
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,400
You're

288
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
the smartest Superman in the world.

289
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't expect

290
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,920
that this Rubik's Cube
was actually from me.

291
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
Actually,

292
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,880
I didn't want to give it to you.

293
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,360
However, your brother told me

294
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,960
you became more confident

295
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,720
when you're playing with it.

296
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,920
Although I liked playing with it too,

297
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,480
I think

298
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,040
it suited you even more.

299
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,320
I originally wanted this Rubik's Cube

300
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,160
to make you more confident

301
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,560
and more positive.

302
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
I didn't expect

303
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
it'd create so much burden on you

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,880
and even caused you

305
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,920
to suffer from
a psychological condition.

306
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,120
I wouldn't have given it
to you if I knew.

307
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,760
Since you're the cause

308
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,280
of this,

309
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
you should take responsibility then.

310
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,320
What should I do?

311
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,600
Stay by my side

312
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,840
and never leave me.

313
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,200
You'll have to pamper me,
dote on me and love me

314
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,840
and I should be
the only one in your heart.

315
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,640
Sure.

316
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,920
Then, you're all mine

317
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,160
from now on.

318
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
You exclusively belong to Zhou Jianqing.

319
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
So, you're not allowed to be sad

320
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,440
without my permission.

321
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,120
Okay.

322
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,720
Then,

323
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
you should make me happy now.

324
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,760
Come on.

325
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,160
I think

326
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,600
we should go somewhere else.

327
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,600
No,

328
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,920
you promised to come with me.

329
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,200
I'll reserve the whole
place some other day.

330
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Then I will come with you.

331
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,320
No!

332
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,200
Just have fun.

333
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,280
It'll be fun

334
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,240
with everyone around.

335
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
There are so many people.

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,480
We can use Morita therapy

337
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
to treat your condition.

338
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,760
You can only slowly

339
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
overcome the psychological barriers

340
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,560
when you're out in the public.

341
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
I know you're scared.

342
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
That's why you should

343
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,400
hang out with children first

344
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
to pave the way.

345
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,800
It's useless.

346
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,040
You haven't even tried yet.

347
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,080
I'm scared that

348
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,000
the crowd will overwhelm me

349
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
before I overcome the fear
of being in a crowd.

350
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:08,960
It's going to be fine.

351
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
We'll take our time.

352
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,840
Put this on.

353
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,680
Look,

354
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
everyone will know

355
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,080
that we're dating.

356
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,000
What do you think?

357
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,360
Just do it. There's nothing
to be scared of.

358
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,000
No!

359
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,640
-Hurry!
-No.

360
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,480
Just go down.

361
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,200
Hurry!

362
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,720
Are you too scared to go?

363
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,560
Me?

364
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,440
Scaredy-cat.

365
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
You're the scaredy-cat!

366
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
Go on!

367
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
What are you doing?

368
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,520
The adult is wearing rabbit's ears.

369
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,320
Exactly.

370
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I know, right?

371
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,480
Attack him!

372
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Attack him!

373
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,360
Attack him!

374
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,760
Attack him!

375
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,840
Don't run!

376
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,480
Attack him!

377
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
It's said that a lot of investors

378
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,080
are not satisfied

379
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
with Mr. Gu's decision.

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,360
Some even want to
withdraw the investment.

381
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,600
How could they not be upset

382
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
when the opportunity slipped away?

383
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,000
Investors are smart.

384
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,440
He has such poor insight

385
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
for giving up a lucrative project

386
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,840
to invest in a niche work.

387
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Xingyun may be independent,

388
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,480
but it's still related to the Gu Group.

389
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,560
We won't sit idly by.

390
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,480
Later, you shall tell other investors

391
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
that they don't have to be considerate

392
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
to Mr. Gu.

393
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
Tell them to just withdraw
their investment.

394
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,160
They don't have to lose their fortune

395
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,600
helping to achieve Mr. Gu's dream.

396
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay, Mr. Lu.

397
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,480
Mr. Gu.

398
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,280
What's wrong?

399
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,600
Dongcheng, Hanyu
and Lantian Investment request

400
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,000
to withdraw their investment from
Lake Xingling simultaneously.

401
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,440
Simultaneously?

402
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,680
Gu Group has also
withdrawn its investment.

403
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,160
I heard

404
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,840
Lu Ziming

405
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,360
has been telling investment companies

406
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,280
to withdraw as soon as possible.

407
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,600
Clear my schedule tomorrow.

408
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm going to Gu Group.

409
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,040
Okay.

410
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,080
(Mr. Gu,)

411
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,960
(Lu Ziming is calling all shareholders)

412
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,720
(to a meeting tomorrow.)

413
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
(Looks like he's making
a move on Xingyun again.)

414
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,480
Hello, Mr. Gu.

415
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
Mr. Gu is here.

416
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,680
Hello, Mr. Gu.

417
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,280
Hello, Mr. Gu.

418
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,040
Hello, Mr. Gu.

419
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Hello, Mr. Gu.

420
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,600
Hello, Mr. Gu.

421
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,720
Hello, Mr. Gu.

422
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,160
Mr. Lu,

423
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,760
I'll just be frank.

424
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm here today

425
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,920
so that you can give Lake Xingling

426
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,680
a chance.

427
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
(Plan of Attracting Investment
for Lake Xingling)

428
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
What do you mean, Mr. Gu?

429
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,600
I've seen Gu Group's plan

430
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,760
to withdraw its investment from Xingyun.

431
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
Lately,

432
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,520
there are many investors

433
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,680
who also have the same plan.

434
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,440
If you're a mature businessman

435
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,520
who's facing such a situation,

436
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
the last thing you should do

437
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,360
is to bow down to me.

438
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,600
I am not.

439
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm stating pros and cons instead.

440
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,600
If you're also a mature businessman,

441
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
you should focus on the product

442
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,840
instead of the disagreement between us.

443
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,760
So today,

444
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I hope you can have a good look

445
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,960
at Xingyun's work

446
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
to give it

447
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,080
and Gu Group a chance.

448
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
(Plan of Attracting Investment
for Lake Xingling)

449
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,600
All right.

450
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,520
I can give Xingyun a chance.

451
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,360
However,

452
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,320
I can't make the decision

453
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,040
on behalf of all investors.

454
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,760
What do you mean?

455
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,360
Next Friday,

456
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,320
there will be a shareholder
meeting of Gu Group.

457
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,440
I hope you can elaborate

458
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,840
to all the shareholders in person.

459
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
As for how much support you'll get,

460
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,240
it depends on your own performance.

461
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,720
What's wrong?

462
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
Do you have no courage to face them?

463
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,120
Then, I can't help you.

464
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

465
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,640
Xiaochuan,

466
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,680
we'll have a meeting next Friday

467
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,520
at Gu Group's headquarters.

468
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,840
Yes.

469
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,560
(Brother,)

470
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
(I'm finally taller than you.)

471
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,120
(I'm doing what I like)

472
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,400
(and I met a girl I truly love.)

473
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,520
(It's all thanks to her)

474
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,160
(that my condition is getting better.)

475
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,560
(I'll live better and happier)

476
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,920
(as you wished.)

477
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,040
(Brother,)

478
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,920
(you'll cheer me on, right?)

479
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,200
What are you doing?

480
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
I can't sleep by myself.

481
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,120
How did you fall sleep before?

482
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,800
It's because...

483
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm used to sleeping with you now.

484
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,960
The shareholder meeting is tomorrow.

485
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,080
You should go back to sleep.

486
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
The moment I think about Lu Ziming,

487
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,840
I have a hard time breathing

488
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,000

509
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,960
You can just talk about work.

510
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
Pretend I'm not here.

511
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,120
The meeting is about to start.

512
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,640
Lu Ziming brought many people with him.

513
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,800
The conference room is full of people.

514
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,960
Do you

515
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,360
need me to do it on your behalf?

516
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,440
No,

517
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,160
I can do it myself.

518
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,520
This meeting concerns

519
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,480
the fate

520
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,360
of Lake Xingling.

521
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,080
Do you really not need my help?

522
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Just give me the files and speech draft.

523
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,160
Wait.

524
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,800
Put this on.

525
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,680
What's this?

526
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
A secret weapon.

527
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,240
You can definitely defeat them all

528
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,360
by wearing this.

535
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,440
It's really rare to see Mr. Gu

536
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,400
at Gu Group's headquarters.

537
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,720
Mr. Gu,

538
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
can we start now?

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,240
Lake Xingling

540
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,440
has been planned

541
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
since Xingyun was established.

542
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,920
It has been more than a year

543
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
since it was put into production.

544
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,520
Xingyun wants to make
it a sensational classic

545
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,920
in the animation market.

546
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,640
As for the specific details
of Lake Xingling,

547
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,080
Mr. Lu

548
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
and everyone here

549
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,840
can take a look at the materials

550
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,880
we've prepared for you on the table.

551
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Since the planning phase,

552
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
Lake Xingling has been working with
a professional evaluation team.

553
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,720
Both the experts of the team

554
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,120
and the general audience

555
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,480
have given good reviews.

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
The quality of Lake Xingling

557
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,120
is absolutely guaranteed.

Mr. Lu,

569
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,600
you want to see me?

570
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,800
Ms. Jiang,

571
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,640
please sit.

572
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
What would you like to drink?

573
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,240
No, thanks.

574
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,920
Mr. Gu did well today.

575
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,600
He should be happy, right?

576
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
It must be extraordinary

577
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,800
for him to be able

578
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,320
to keep Gu Group's investment

579
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,560
from being taken away by you.

580
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,080
I know

581
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,920
he always thinks I'm making
life difficult for him.

582
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,360
Honestly,

583
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,240
this is nothing personal.

584
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,680
I'm doing it for the best
interests of everyone.

585
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,960
Gu Group's revenue increases yearly

586
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,880
under Mr. Gu's leadership.

587
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Xingyun has also made
great achievements.

588
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,560
I think

589
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
maybe you're overly cautious.

590
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,160
I watched Nanzhou growing up.

591
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,480
He's a smart kid.

592
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,200
He's just too stubborn.

593
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm just scared that

594
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,200
he can't see the risks or crisis

595
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,080
after he sets his mind on something.

596
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,840
If it leads to Xingyun's downfall,

597
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,240
Group Gu will also be affected.

598
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,720
There's a risk assessment
system within Xingyun.

599
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm sure he's aware of it.

600
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,160
Mr. Lu,

601
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,640
you don't have to worry about it.

602
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,080
By the way,

603
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,600
I've always been curious about this.

604
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,960
I don't know if you know

605
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,560
why Nanzhou

606
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,080
would marry Zhou Jianqing?

607
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
This is his private life.

608
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
It's not proper for me to ask.

609
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,560
This isn't a private matter.
