There was a mosquito on your face.

61
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,320
Mosquito in this weather?

62
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,800
Maybe I saw it wrongly.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,800

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,119
Am I so handsome?

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,880
Hello, Susu.

67
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,079
I want to ask you a question.

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,959
No.

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,720
My friend wants to ask you a question.

70
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,839
Is it Zhang Yin?

71
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,640
Not him.

72
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,200
It's another friend of mine.

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,839
Other than Zhang Yin and me,

74
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,760
who else is close to you?

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,239
You don't know the person anyway.

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,399
I just want to seek your advice.

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,519
Tell me.

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Here it goes.

79
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,480
There is a girl.

80
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,839
She has a crush on a boy.

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
However, due to her professional ethics,

82
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,440
she mustn't fall for that boy.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,160
The friend of yours

84
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,799
is quite similar to a friend of mine.

85
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,760
She falls for the wrong person.

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,880
She knew they couldn't get together,

87
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,239
yet she confessed her feelings to him.

88
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,160
What should she do?

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,679
It will be fruitless.

90
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,652
It would be great if love

91
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,209
is as easy as saving money.

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,079
So long as I work hard
to save enough money,

93
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,880
I could make him fall in love with me.

94
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,943
However, love isn't about

95
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,290
getting what you invest.

96
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,279
Susu,

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
are you talking about yourself?

98
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,200
Qingqing,

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,079
is Gu Nanzhou the person in your case?

100
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,279
I...

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,519
Have you fallen for Mr. Long Face?

102
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Seriously?

103
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,040
Have you really fallen for him?

104
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,959
However, he isn't your type.

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,519
I don't know if I love him or not.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,600
It's just that I feel my heartbeat

107
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,320
accelerates as soon as I see him.

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,160
You're doomed, Qingqing.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,839
You've fallen in love.

110
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,320
Who is the person you talked about?

111
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,844
Is it the elite that
returned from overseas

112
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,290
and introduced by
your parents last week?

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
The boy with the British style?

114
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,200
No.

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,050
Could it be that caring guy

116
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,609
from Ali Mountain two weeks ago?

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
How is that possible?

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,115
Then it must be the doctor
of polymer science

119
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,609
who just returned from
overseas last week.

120
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,880
Qingqing, stop guessing.

121
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,399
Who else is around you?

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
It's...

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,600
It's a man I met in
the photography class.

124
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,320
That cute man?

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
Why would you fall for him?

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,519
I...

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,440
We went out to take pictures together.

128
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,040
He is really gentle.

129
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,760
I fell for him after that,

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
but he doesn't like me.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,519
Why have you fallen for an artistic man?

132
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,200
Don't give up, Susu.

133
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:35,160
Maybe he has yet to
see the beauty in you.

134
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:39,079
You're the best girl in the world.

135
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,239
You, too.

136
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,661
I don't think Gu Nanzhou

137
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,209
deserves you at all.

138
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,119
Coming!

139
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,519
Who is it?

140
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,559
Xuan?

141
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,880
I told him to bring you
a basket of fruits.

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Eat some for me

143
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,137
or Gu Nanzhou will tell me to cut

144
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,649
and peel the fruits all the time.

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,760
All right, I'm hanging up.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
I'll go back to work.

147
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,440
I'll talk to you next time.

148
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,519
Xuan,

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,559
come in.

150
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,242
The meeting with the planning department

151
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,250
has been rescheduled to 4pm tomorrow.

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,920
Meanwhile,

153
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,440
your psychologist called.

154
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,200
She wished to arrange
the next treatment the soonest.

155
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,799
-Shall I make it...
-Make it this Friday.

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
Isn't the planning department
presenting the new plan tomorrow?

157
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,280
The meeting is tomorrow evening.

158
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,479
Can we make it?

159
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,909
Ms. Jiang has been in talks

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,329
about Different Worlds.

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,799
The company wants to work
on it as soon as possible.

162
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,400
It's almost time to sign a contract.

163
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,160
So Ms. Jiang wants to rush

164
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,569
for a more mature plan for them.

165
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,159
Ask her to come to my office later.

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay.

167
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,840
It fell.

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,159
It's cute.

169
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,000
You two look alike.

170
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,760
Am I that ugly?

171
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,320
No.

172
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,880
I mean...

173
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,119
I'll fetch you a glass of water.

174
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,239
It's okay. I'm not thirsty.

175
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,159
Are you still busy attending classes?

176
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,000
I've applied for a few more classes.

177
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,479
It's good to get busy.

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,760
Your life will be more fulfilling.

179
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,359
Xuan,

180
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,799
you can just get Qingqing
to tell me next time.

181
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,479
I'll collect from her myself.

182
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,479
I happened to be passing by.

183
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,679
So I brought it here.

184
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,689
Besides, a girl shouldn't carry

185
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,209
such a heavy basket.

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,679
-Hello.
-Xuan.

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,000
Where have you been?

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,239
The back-kitchen is in a mess.

189
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,359
Don't you want to get paid hourly?

190
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,320
Got it. I'll be right back.

191
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,799
I still have work to do.

192
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,159
I'll get going.

193
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,559
I'll see you out.

194
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,274
(Different Worlds)

195
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,919
Mr. Gu.

196
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,239
The statistics of
Different Worlds are good.

197
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,479
The plot makes sense.

198
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,245
It's also about parallel universe,

199
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,410
a theme favored by
young people nowadays.

200
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,950
Xingyun can definitely make money

201
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,449
from the production.

202
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,559
If Xingyun accepts this project,

203
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,039
we'll need manpower from Lake Xingling.

204
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,239
It'll affect the progress
of Lake Xingling.

205
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,119
The deadline given is really tight.

206
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,646
However, this project

207
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,530
is a rare opportunity for us.

208
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,239
As you know,

209
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,065
many projects fail to be produced

210
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,129
once they're put aside.

211
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,000
I know,

212
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,479
but this project is worth taking risk.

213
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,440
If Xingyun

214
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
can produce a successful
commercial product,

215
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,919
we'll receive more investment.

216
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,799
I've always wanted to discuss with you

217
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,039
on whether we should slow down
the progress of Lake Xingling.

218
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,239
After all, from a business perspective,

219
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,559
Lake Xingling isn't as
good as other works.

220
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,359
Xingyun needs money.

221
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Investors also want
Xingyun to make money.

222

(Different Worlds)
(Lake Xingling Project Plan)

223
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,520
Have some water.

224
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,039
Thank you.

225
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,420
(Different Worlds)

226
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,599
Do you like this project?

227
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,719
It's quite interesting.

228
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,880
How is it compared to Lake Xingling?

229
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,640
If you're assigned to produce

230
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,119
one of the projects,

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,760
which one would you choose?

232
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,479
Which one do you prefer?

233
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,559
Different Worlds

234
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,320
has a commercial theme.

235
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,679
It has a high degree of completion.

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,239
It'll make money for sure.

237
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,159
Lake Xingling

238
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
is niche

239
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,520
and less commercialized.

240
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,479
I know Different Worlds is good.

241
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,679
I'm asking which one you prefer.

242
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,840
Choose the one that you prefer.

243
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,080
Don't care about what others say.

244
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,919
A long time ago, there was a lake.

245
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,080
It is said to be where a star falls.

246
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,200
It's Lake Xingling.

247
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,468
It's an awesome story.

248
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,159
Brother,

249
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:23,320
present your favorite story.

250
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,039
More people will watch it

251
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,359
and like it.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,599
Sure.

253
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,719
Once I grow up,

254
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll turn it into an animation.

258
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,689

259
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,200
What are you thinking?

260
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,359
You're in a dilemma.

261

I'll help you then.

262

265
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,090
more questions in a minute wins.

266
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,239
So, are you ready?

267
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,080
Ready?

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
Do you prefer a cat or a dog?

269
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:07,679
A dog.

270
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,479
Do you prefer Transformers

271
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,200
or a plush toy?

272
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,080
A plush toy.

273
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,559
Do you prefer fried eggs or boiled eggs?

274
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,159
Boiled eggs.

275
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,840
Do you prefer a panda or a red panda?

276
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,440
A red panda.

277
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,760
Do you prefer sweet soy
milk or savory soy milk?

278
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,239
Sweet soy milk.

279
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:16,919
Do you prefer Lake Xingling

280
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,679
or Different Worlds?

281
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,200
Lake Xingling.

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,320
Do you prefer me or Jiang Jingxuan?

283
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,919
You.

284
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,119
I...

285
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,159
I was just asking.

286
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,520
I...

287
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,599
I was just answering.

288
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,280
It's a slip of the tongue.

289
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
I am not into you.

290
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,559
You're noisy, clumsy,

291

money-minded and chubby.

292
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,239
You always annoy people

293
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
and you have some bad habits.

294
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,119
Is there nothing good in me?

295
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,599
Even if you don't like me,

296
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,840
there is no need to belittle me!

297
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,039
The truth is

298
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,080
there is goodness in you.

I'll get to the point.

opened a new restaurant.

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,319
Sure.

342
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Uncle Li has sent me
the information of the restaurant.

343
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,680
Based on its current condition,

344
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,079
I've combined the popular
trends in recent times

345
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,079
and come up with a management plan.

346
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,359
Please go through it.

347
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,940
(Restaurant Management
and Positioning Proposal)

348
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,839
Look. This is not bad.

349
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,400
Yes.

350
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
We'll end the meeting today.

351
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,680
All departments of Lake Xingling

352
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
shall proceed according
to the original plan.

353
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,599
As for Different Worlds,

354
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,680
Ms. Jiang,

355
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,439
you'll talk to them.

356
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,239
We will turn down the project for now.

357
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:41,839
Dismiss.

358
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Mr. Gu,

359
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,214
why do you want to give up

360
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,850
such a good project
like Different Worlds?

361
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,839
I've already said it all in the meeting.

362
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,959
Also, I think Xingyun

363
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,599
should focus on Lake Xingling.

364
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,560
Lake Xingling is a niche subject matter.

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,439
If we invest all resources in it

366
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,680
and it fails, Xingyun might collapse.

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,560
Can I bother you to vote?

368
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,359
Lake Xingling and Different Worlds.

369
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,359
Which one do you prefer?

370
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,479
Set aside the cost, profit and risk,

371
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,479
which one do you prefer?

372
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,920
I prefer Lake Xingling.

373
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,199
Me too.

374
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,680
The story of Different Worlds
is too common.

375
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Mr. Gu,

376
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,599
I've been tortured by
Lake Xingling all this while,

377
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,280
but if given a choice,

378
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,439
I'll still go for Lake Xingling.

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,131
Our own preference

380
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,569
doesn't reflect the public's.

381
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,439
Ms. Jiang,

382
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,800
you're right.

383
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,439
Preference doesn't mean success.

384
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:55,959
However,

385
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,560
if we don't even like the story,

386
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,719
how can we produce a successful work?

387
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
-The risks...
-I know.

388
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,599
Therefore,

389
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,000
we should go all out.

390
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,800
In the proposal, you can see

391
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,839
our representative works,

392
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,560
such as Ant Paradise

393
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,760
and Lake Xingling.

394
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,079
Even our contracted authors

395
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,239
may roam freely in their works

396
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,359
because we offer ample space of freedom.

397
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,680
So I hope you can value their time.

398
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,599
-Sure.
-Trust me.

399
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,780
(Lake Xingling's Plan of
Attracting Investment)

400
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,000
Where should we go next?

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,719
There's no more.

402
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,359
We've visited six investment companies.

403
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,920
Put your work on hold.

404
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,079
I have something to say.

405
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,239
I have good news to share.

406
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,719
Xingyun has received
a new round of investment.

407
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,520
Two big companies are investing in us.

408
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,319
The agreements have been signed.

409
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,400
Lake Xingling has money again.

410
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,359
Thanks for your hard work.

411
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,959
Let's have a gathering tonight.

412
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,839
You got drunk last time.

413
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,959
No, it's you.

414
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,959
We'll bring him down this time.

415
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,439
It's you.

416
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,079
-That's right.
-All right.

417
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,839
Get back to work.

418
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:43,920
Hello.

419
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,079
Xingyun has a gathering tonight.

420
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,000
Come at 7pm if you are free.

421
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,239
Why are you suddenly
treating us to a meal?

422
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,319
I've secured new
investment for Lake Xingling.

423
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,839
Seriously?

424
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,359
That's wonderful.

425
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,488
Come early.

426
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:56,810
You mustn't be late.

427
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm not your employee.

428
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,962
Why should I, an outsider,

429
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,650
attend your company gathering?

430
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,839
You aren't an outsider.

431
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,439
Who am I?

432
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,359
Interim assistant

433
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,280
and mascot.

434
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,599
Moreover,

435
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,461
you helped me to decide through a game.

436
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,959
It's mildly useful.

437
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,920
Have some good food
to replenish your energy.

438
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,319
Fine.

439
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,439
I'll take it as a reward
of looking after you.

440
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,520
However,

441
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,479
can I cash it to offset my debt?

442
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,319
Zhou Jianqing!

443
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,040
Fine.

444
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
It's okay to be compensated
in the form of food.

445
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,628
Thank you, boss!

446
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,079
Cheers!

447
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,800
The lady boss is here.

448
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,439
Hi, lady boss.

449
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,199
Come on, have a seat.

450
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,040
Thank you.

451
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,719
Start with a drink.

452
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,920
Let's give a toast to the lady boss.

453
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,599
-Cheers!
-That's right. One glass.

454
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,160
Cheers!

455
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,599
Try this. This is really delicious.

456
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,800
Dig in.

457
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,640
Come on.

458
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,800
Nanzhou,

459
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,680
have some fish.

460
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,439
-It's nutritious.
-Thank you.

461
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,000
The fish is nice.

462
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
It's tender.

463
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,079
This is my first visit.

464
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,680
It's an expensive restaurant.

465
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,479
If it's not because of Mr. Gu...

466
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,359
Is it delicious?

467
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Yes.

468
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,079
Nanzhou,

469
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,119
your favorite chili.

470
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:36,680
There.

471
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,160
Have more.

472
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,479
Go ahead.

473
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,400
Nanzhou,

474
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,959
have some vegetables.

475
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,520
It's nutritious.

476
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,640
You don't know him.

477
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
He hates vegetables the most.

478
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,400
He likes

479
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,160
ginger.

480
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,479
Ginger can dispel coldness.

481
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,560
Am I right, Nanzhou?

482
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:12,719
Mr. Gu,

483
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,959
I'll give you a toast.

484
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
-Sure.
-Let's give Mr. Gu a toast.

485
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,319
Cheers!

486
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,199
To Mr. Gu.

487
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,800
Nanzhou.

488
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,319
Here.

489
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,640
I'll feed you.

490
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,160
Here.

491
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:40,839
I love ginger the most.

492
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,839
What a show-off.

493
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,000
Public display of affection.

494
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,199
That's right.

495
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040
I'll feed myself.

496
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,880
It's nice.

497
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,599
Carry on.

498
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm jealous.

499
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,479
I'll feed you.

500
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,560
Vegetables.

501
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
This is nice.

502
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,280
This, too.

503
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Fetch me the water.

504
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
I don't eat this either.

505
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,439
Here.

506
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,520
-Cheers.
-Come on.

507
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,880
Vegetables.

508
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,599
We don't gather so frequently.

509
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,800
Why don't we take some pictures?

510
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,479
-Sure, let's do it.
-Take some pictures.

511
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Qingqing,

512
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,400
can you take pictures
for us who work for Xingyun?

513
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,560
Sure.

514
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,400
She is considered one of us.

515
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:31,868
-Let her take pictures with us.
-Sure.

516
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,920
Let's take pictures.

517
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,119
-Let me tidy up my shirt.
-I'll take this side.

518
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,119
Three, two, one, cheese!

519
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
(Banshan Restaurant)
The meal today is really delicious.

520
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,959
What is that fish called?

521
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,400
-Isn't it Chinese soft-shelled turtle?
-Is it?

522
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,079
-It's very delicious.
-Yes, I agree.

523
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:49,959
It's superb.

524
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,000
You're a glutton.

525
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,319
Why don't we go for another round?

526
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,119
-What should we do?
-Karaoke.

527
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,599
-What do you think?
-Sure. Karaoke.

528
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,359
Not karaoke again.

529
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,560
You can't sing well.

530
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,079
Look at you.

531
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,479
I'm tired.

532
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,479
I want to go home.

533
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,560
Enjoy yourselves.

534
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Bye, Xuan.

535
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,040
Where should we go?

536
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,959
That's right. Where to?

537
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,439
Where should we go?

538
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,400
I know.

539
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,520
I saw a notice.

540
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,976
There is a performance
of fountain projection

541
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:17,049
at a square nearby tonight.

542
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,959
Why don't we go there
to watch the fountain?

543
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Sure.

544
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,479
It's a good idea.

545
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,027
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

546
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:25,760
-Move.
-Hurry up!

547
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
The fountain performance is free.

548
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,359
