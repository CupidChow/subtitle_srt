00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,520
(Hello Mr. Gu Theatre)

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,280
I think Gu Nanzhou

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,440
has never told you

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,840
about these shares.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Marry me.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,880
Gu Nanzhou wants to
take advantage of this

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,920
and buy the 5% shares of your father

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
with only RMB2 million.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,880
So your marriage

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,040
is a conspiracy for the shares
from the beginning.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
(Is all this)

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
(Our crossroads)

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Nanzhou,

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,600
where are you going?

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
I need to go home.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Someone from Lingyun
gave you a call earlier on.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
The person wanted to talk to you.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
They're our best bet

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
when it comes to investment.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,440
However, I...

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,920
Otherwise,

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,680
Lake Xingling will be halted.

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,080
(Sorry.)

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
(I can't make it as I
have an urgent matter.)

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,440
(Agreement Termination)

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,960
(Agreement Termination)

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,560
(Agreement Termination)

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,040
(Agreement Termination)

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,120
Nanzhou.

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Nanzhou?

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,920
What's going on?

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,960
Are you all right?

63
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
(Parties are Zhou Jianqing
and Gu Nanzhou)

64
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,840
So Zhou Jianqing wants to
terminate the agreement?

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,080
Actually she came to office

66
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,680
a few times for you earlier on.

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
You were busy then.

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
She was quite upset.

69
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,680
I asked her to be
more considerate to you.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
I thought she would understand.

71
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
It is unexpected.

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,840
For a girl of her age who's in love,

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,800
all she hopes

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,440
is for you to always be with her.

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
However, your hands are full

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,760
with the company's current situation.

77
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,840
Nanzhou,

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
don't be sad.

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,880
Both of you aren't
pursuing the same thing.

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
(Dear)

81
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Hello.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
Where are you?

83
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,240
I want to talk to you.

84
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,560
Have you read the file
of terminating the agreement?

85
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
I shall let you think about it.

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,560
Then we'll talk.

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
I've made up my mind.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
Where are you?

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm at a square near Xingyun.

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,840
Hello.

91
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Gu Nanzhou.

92
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
Let's just talk over the phone.

93
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,400
Now

94
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,960
are you even unwilling

95
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,760
to talk to me face-to-face?

96
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
I've made up my mind.

97
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,680
We should just terminate our agreement.

98
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,040
I'm breaking up with you.

99
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,320
You...

100
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,800
Are you sure about that?

101
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,640
Yes, I am.

102
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm tired of being upset because of you.

103
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want to put you
in a difficult position.

104
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,880
Qingqing.

105
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
I want to be with you.

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I need you so much.

107
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,720
Yes.

108
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,880
You need me very much.

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,600
Gu Nanzhou,

110
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,640
let's break up.

111

00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm coming.

138
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
What a feast.

139
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,360
Indeed.

140
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
I like your house.

141
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,840
How did you find this place?

142
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,920
It's thanks to me.

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,840
I met quite a number

144
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,240
of property agents with her.

145
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
You're awesome.

146
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you.

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Cheers!

148
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,000
Your sister-in-law and I

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,280
helped you to move in.

150
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,640
Aren't you going to say a few words?

151
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,400
You're right.

152
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm so grateful to Susu

153
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,160
for helping me to find this nice house.

154
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
It has a good environment
and it's conveniently located.

155
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,840
Most importantly, it's affordable.

156
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,560
So

157
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll drink to Susu.

158
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,200
Hold on.

159
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,600
What about me?

160
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,520
By the way, I'm grateful to you, too.

161
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,760
You've been of great help today.

162
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
Cheers.

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,160
Go easy with it.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
Eat something first.

165
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,800
What if you have stomachache again?

166
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,760
I know what's right for me.

167
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't even think of taking
it away from me.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,520
You've never liked duck blood, right?

169
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,160
The air is a little polluted lately.

170
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
Duck blood is good for the lungs.

171
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,920
I won't be a picky eater.

172
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,520
Are you still keeping in touch

173
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,400
with the rascal, Gu Nanzhou?

174
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,400
Not anymore.

175
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Good for you.

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,600
He didn't

177
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,320
cherish you at all.

178
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
He doesn't deserve a second chance.

179
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,360
Why are you poking at me?

180
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,040
I am just educating her.

181
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,520
You two have broken up. Stop
having anything to do with him.

182
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
Never go back to him.

183
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,800
She knows what to do.

184
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,920
Why are you saying so much?

185
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,080
What if she's soft-hearted

186
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
and she falls for his tricks again?

187
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,720
I...

188
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,400
Just eat.

189
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,640
I won't.

190
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,160
Qingqing,

191
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,240
here's some meat for you.

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,480
There you go.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,120
Thank you.

194
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
I'll do it myself.

195
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,440
Here.

196
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Some vegetables for you.

197
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,240
Okay.

198
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,280
Here.

199
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,040
Here's your favorite.

200
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,720
Open your mouth.

201
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Gu Nanzhou!

202
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,880
We'll watch this.

203
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Why?

204
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,800
Otherwise, you'll watch a horror movie.

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,880
You won't sleep even if it's late.

206
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,640
Give me the remote control.

207
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,280
No.

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Give it to me.

209
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,800
No.

210
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
Give it to me!

211
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,720
No.

212
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,880
Give it to me!

213
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,520
No!

214
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Gu Nanzhou!

215
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,120
Give me that.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,520
Hold it.

217
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
Yours is indeed sweeter.

218
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,640
In order to make the perfect noodles,

219
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,000
you have to master every detail.

220
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,040
First, take a small amount of noodles.

221
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,280
Then blow it.

222
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,360
Put it on the spoon.

223
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
Then, scoop some soup.

224
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Lastly, take a little
pickled mustard green.

225
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Most importantly,

226
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,720
you must down it in one go.

227
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Calory in strawberry mousse is too high.

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,680
Drinking cola at night
is bad for your teeth.

229
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,840
The grapes

230
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,640
are rich in sugar.

231
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,840
As for the bananas,

232
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,080
you can eat them.

233
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,720
Aren't you feeling uncomfortable
sleeping on the floor?

234
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,560
Let's make a deal.

235
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,760
Pay me RMB500

236
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,640
and I shall let you sleep on
the bed and I'll sleep on the floor.

237
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,280
How about that?

238
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,160
You always think about money.

239
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,720
Mr. Fang,

240
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,960
Lake Xingling needs the investment

241
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,640
from Lingyun a lot.

242
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
You used to think highly

243
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,080
of Lake Xingling, didn't you?

244
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
We can negotiate

245
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,720
the dividends and
profit-sharing ratio again.

246
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
Could you reconsider it?

247
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,120
I used to view the project positively.

248
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,400
However, I didn't expect

249
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,160
that Xingyun and Lejiabao

250
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,560
would be involved in
a copyright infringement lawsuit.

251
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
The case

252
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
has serious consequences.

253
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,600
We've hired

254
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,960
a professional legal team.

255
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
We'll do our best to
suppress the negative news.

256
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,960
We'll try to keep it under control.

257
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,440
Xingyun has over the years

258
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
produced countless
high-quality animations.

259
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,360
You should have confidence in us.

260
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,440
The market is different now.

261
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
The investment risk for this project

262
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,960
is much higher than before.

263
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Furthermore, I need to get

264
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
other shareholders' approval

265
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,720
for the fund.

266
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,440
I'm so sorry.

267
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,640
There's nothing I can do.

268
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,840
Mr. Fang,

269
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,160
just give me a month.

270
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm sure I can turn
the situation around.

271
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,280
Thank you for your time, Mr. Fang.

272
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,160
Nanzhou.

273
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,200
Mr. Gu,

274
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,120
I hope you understand our difficulties.

275
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,800
See you.

276
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,720
My neck.

277
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,040
Attention, everyone.

278
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
I just want to say a few words.

279
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,080
You all have been working hard

280
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,680
during this period of time.

281
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,640
I know many of you

282
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
have given your all

283
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,480
to the project of Lake Xingling.

284
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,640
All of you must be hoping
for it to be released

285
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,960
and that it'll become a hit.

286
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,080
However, the lawsuit
between us and Lejiabao

287
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
is almost a sure thing.

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
Many investors are aware of the risk.

289
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,080
They have decided to
withdraw their investment.

290
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
Currently, things aren't
looking good for us.

291
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,520
Our funds

292
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,600
don't allow us

293
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
to continue making Lake Xingling.

294
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,280
So now I'm announcing

295
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,280
the indefinite suspension
of Lake Xingling.

296
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
However...

297
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,280
Why the suspension?

298
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
You all can go home early.

299
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,960
What's going on?

300
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,200
We have been spending
so much time working on this,

301
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
yet it's suspended now.

302
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,840
Nanzhou,

303
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,040
you...

304
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,720
Are you free tonight?

305
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,160
Yes.

306
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,320
Why?

307
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,120
Let's go for dinner together.

308
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,800
Sure.

309
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
Nanzhou.

310
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,960
Let's have a toast.

311
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,200
Nanzhou,

312
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,320
are you still upset over the breakup?

313
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
Actually, you don't have to be so sad.

314
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,200
This is life.

315
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,960
Most of us share similar experience.

316
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,560
It's easy for one to spend
the good times with you,

317
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
but not when the days are bad.

318
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,960
She's still young.

319
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,640
You're having such a problem.

320
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
Naturally, she's leaving you.

321
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,200
You really don't have to be so sad.

322
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
This only shows

323
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,800
that she's not the one
you're looking for,

324
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,960
nor the one that suits you best.

325
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,160
Your life

326
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,200
will surely be full of challenges.

327
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,360
You should find someone

328
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,120
who can stay with you
through thick and thin

329
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,440
and help you to solve your problems.

330
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,360
Jingxuan.

331
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
How long have you been with Xingyun?

332
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,600
Four years and three months.

333
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,360
You're our senior employee.

334
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
There's one thing I don't understand.

335
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,080
Why did you make

336
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,000
such an elementary mistake?

337
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,520
Nanzhou,

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,720
what are you talking about?

339
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,240
The one responsible for verifying
the documents of the animation

340
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,120
was actually you.

341
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Nanzhou,

342
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,600
what makes you think so?

343
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,560
You replaced

344
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,160
the documents that
were verified by Liu Jun.

345
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
However, you missed a copy.

346
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
She gave it to me before she resigned.

347
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,800
I managed to contact her.

348
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,040
Many things were confirmed.

349
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,800
Now we're here

350
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
and I want to know

351
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,720
why you did that.

352
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,760
I remember that when
you first joined Xingyun,

353
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,600
I taught you something.

354
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
You're responsible

355
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,040
for your own mistakes.

356
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,280
It was all because of Zhou Jianqing.

357
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,960
What does this

358
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
have to do with her?

359
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,840
Only when you're in trouble,

360
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,080
you'll rely on me more

361
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
and be with her less.

362
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,680
It was beyond my expectations

363
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,400
that things turned out this way.

364
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
So Lake Xingling

365
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,360
was suspended indefinitely
because of this?

366
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,160
That's my fruits of labour for years.

367
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,560
I know.

368
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,640
I know you better than anyone else.

369
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,280
Then you should also know

370
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Xingyun's regulations.

371
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Nanzhou!

372
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't you know

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
my feelings for you at all?

374
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,520
I love you.

375
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,280
From the first day I met you,

376
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
I only have eyes for you

377
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,280
and you mean everything

378
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
to me.

379
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm not the same as you.

380
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,880
I didn't graduate from
a prestigious university.

381
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,680
My family background
isn't as good as yours.

382
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,240
My father is a compulsive gambler.

383
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,240
My mother is always sick.

384
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,080
Since I was a kid, I know

385
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,920
I have to fight for what I want

386
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
or I'll never get it.

387
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,840
Love and work aren't the same.

388
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
So it's pointless for
you to fight for it.

389
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,440
Do you understand?

390
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,960
Why did you treat me so well then?

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,280
When I made a mistake at work,

392
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,120
you corrected me personally.

393
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,720
When there's a problem
with the contract,

394
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,800
you took me along to
apologize to the client.

395
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
When I was sick,

396
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
you sent me to a hospital personally.

397
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,560
You shouldered the burdens

398
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,960
all by yourself.

399
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,520
When I was being questioned,

400
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,480
you were the first person

401
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,520
who stood up for me.

402
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,280
That's because you were once

403
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,480
the employee I trusted the most.

404
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,880
I

405
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,640
was just doing

406
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
what a superior should do.

407
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,920
However, I feel that

408
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
you treat me differently from others.

409
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,400
I've always thought

410
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
this will continue forever,

411
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
so long as nature takes its course.

412
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
The appearance of Zhou Jianqing
was beyond my expectation.

413
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
I've given my all to help you.

414
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,880
I've done everything

415
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,120
you want for you.

416
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,680
I've worked hard

417
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,840
to become someone worthy of you.

418
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Why her?

419
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
How is she better than me?

420
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
I love her.

421
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
It has nothing to do

422
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
with everything you said.

423
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,440
So

424
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,960
even if she left you,

425
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
it's impossible for us to be together?

426
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,400
My feelings for you

428
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
are purely professional.

429
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,560
If I've misled you in any way,

430
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,240
I shall apologize to you.

431
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,600
This matter

432
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
caused huge losses to Xingyun.

433
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
You're supposed to
take full responsibility of it.

434
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
However, throughout the time,

435
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,440
you've contributed greatly to Xingyun.

436
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,320
So I'll have to think

437
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
about your issue.

438
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,800
Nanzhou,

439
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,560
could you give me an opportunity
to make up for what I did?
