00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,280
Hello. I've arrived. Where are you?

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm behind you.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,959
Move forward.

5
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you doing?

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,280
Go on.

7
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,360
It's beautiful.

I love you.

We've just met.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
I love you.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,173
It has nothing to do with

17
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:28,530
how long we've known each other.

18
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,808
As soon as I first met you,

19
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,519
I confirmed that I fell for you.

20
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,639
I loved you deeply before you knew me.

Are you okay?

68
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,239
Did you ask me to come here for this?

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,959
It's purely an accident.

You have the remote control.

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
How can you call it an accident?

73
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,679
I don't want you to catch a cold.

74
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,720
I don't want this!

75
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,399
Are you okay?

76
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,440
Do I look okay?

77
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,880
It's purely an accident.

78
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Could it possibly be a coincidence?

79
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,559
I didn't want that to happen.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,119
I thought you came to apologize.

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
You don't even know how to apologize.

82
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,440
Go away!

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
Sorry, it's my fault!

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,519
Tell me.

85
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,320
What did you want to say at the park?

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,839
I can't say it under such a circumstance.

87
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,055
You spilled water on me!

88
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,440
Sorry.

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,839
Where are you touching?

90
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I didn't mean it.

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
Coming.

92
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,239
You've arrived. Come on in.

93
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,000
Why did you come here
early in the morning?

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,920
I...

95
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,279
I can't wait to tell you
a piece of good news.

96
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,079
Tell me now.

97
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,519
My oil painting won the first prize.

98
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,920
Isn't it a good news?

99
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,799
Is it true? First prize?

100
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Congratulations.

101
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,839
Here comes a new oil painting master.

102
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,640
Sit.

103
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,479
I've won a prize, right?

104
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,799
There's a big amount of cash prize.

105
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,679
Why don't we travel?

106
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,719
Treat it as celebration.

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Sure.

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,880
I haven't travelled for long.

109
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,640
What a great friend you are, junior.

110
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,599
Don't you need to rush your work?

111
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,359
Are you free to travel?

112
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,320
Forget it.

113
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,799
I'll go next time.

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Wait until I finish my work.

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,919
Also,

116
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,200
a judge of the contest

117
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,599
has introduced a job to draw
comic for advertisements.

118
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,359
Do you want to work with me?

119
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,159
It can make money.

120
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,479
Sure, no problem.

121
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
I have an appointment
with the company later.

122
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,840
Shall we meet them later?

123
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,119
Sure.

124
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,679
Do you want to skip breakfast?

125
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,280
Also,

126
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,080
there is a restaurant selling
nice pan fried buns below their office.

127
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Shall we try it?

128
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,919
Sure. Let's go.

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,479
Enjoy the breakfast yourself. Let's go.

130
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,799
Meeting in the big meeting room
in 10 minutes.

131
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,840
Sure, Mr. Gu.

132
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,280
You should treat the problem
I said seriously.

133
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,239
You'll get more than a scolding
if you make another mistake.

134
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,760
Okay, Mr. Gu.

135
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,119
I said I want creativity
and a sense of design.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,119
What is the point of
sending old ideas with new names to me?

137
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
Is punctuation mark a minor mistake?

138
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
This document has shown
your work attitude.

139
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,320
-Redo it!
-Yes, Mr. Gu.

140
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,080
The scene has collapsed completely.

141
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't think you can slack off,
though it only takes a few frames.

142
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,840
-Redo it!
-Yes, Mr. Gu.

143
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,102
Meetings for three consecutive days.

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,359
My eye wrinkles are coming out.

145
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,840
I don't think we're allowed
to get off from work.

146
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,479
Xiaochuan,

147
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,119
is something bothering Mr. Gu lately?

148
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,599
He has suddenly become so aggressive.

149
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,599
As the saying goes,

150
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
frustration in love

151
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,200
can only be healed with work.

152
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,359
He and Zhou Jianqing?

153
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,440
Have they broken up?

154
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,679
This explains why he is torturing us.

155
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,880
He wants to heal
a broken heart using work.

156
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,080
At first, they...

157
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,320
Mr. Gu,

158
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,919
I've made coffee for you.

159
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,239
Do you want to drink it here

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,359
or in your office?

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,679
Mr. Gu,

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,799
this is a love amulet I
brought back from Japan.

163
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
It's efficacious.

164
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,000
Wish you good luck in love.

165
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,799
Well,

166
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,679
Mr. Gu, I...

167
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,559
Mr. Gu, I wish you well in love.

168
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,336
Get ready for a meeting
in the big meeting room

169
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:46,449
in 10 minutes.

170
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:00,840
Nanzhou,

171
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,000
your work schedule is too full lately.

172
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,119
It's said that the new interns

173
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,039
intend to quit due to the high workload.

174
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,599
There're many problems to solve.

175
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,479
We need to work overtime.

176
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,080
You might be exhausted and collapse.

177
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,280
Those interns are
Zhou Jianqing's schoolmates.

178
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,239
Are you upset

179
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,479
by their conversations?

180
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,359
What did they say?

181
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,599
Don't you know?

182
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,440
I heard it randomly.

183
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,322
They said Zhou Jianqing

184
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:38,530
got quite close to a junior lately.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
I think they're about to go steady.

186
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,479
Students love gossip.

187
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,719
Do you love gossip, too?

188
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm just worried

189
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,919
it may affect the agreement
between you two.

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,440
You don't need to worry about that.

191
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
Nanzhou,

192
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,760
there is a new pub below our office.

193
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,159
Do you want to drink tonight to relax?

194
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Have you compiled the documents
I gave you this morning?

195
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,159
Not yet.

196
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,000
Work overtime on it tonight.

197
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,119
Submit it tomorrow morning.

198
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,679
Mr. Chen of Jiangcheng will
come over this weekend.

199
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,679
You shall meet him.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,919
You could talk about the new plan
of Lake Xingling.

201
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,080
Okay.

202
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,159
Camping at Mount Lumen?

203
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,320
It sounds interesting.

204
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,878
I have to check if I can make it

205
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,039
on the day after tomorrow.

206
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,599
I've checked it for you.

207
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:42,080
You don't need to go to school

208
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,200
nor meet any clients that day.

209
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,559
If you're okay,

210
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,440
we'll meet at Mount Lumen
on the day after tomorrow.

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,599
We'll come back after
spending a night there.

212
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,039
All right.

213
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,280
Let's do it.

214
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:56,919
See you in two days.

215
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
They will be alone.

216
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,599
They will even be camping.

217
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,440
In the real world,

218
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,919
bothered by his family and studies,

219
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,440
he is also estranged from
friends due to various reasons.

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,559
A'Ming gradually becomes dispirited.

221
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,559
Till one day,

222
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,154
he enters a bizarre world of stars

223
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,930
after a meteor shower.

224
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,080
Mr. Gu.

225
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,880
That's all for the adjustments.

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,080
Is it okay?

227
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,760
I heard all of you are
complaining about workload.

228
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,520
No.

229
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,159
Thanks for the hard work.

230
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,440
Tomorrow will be the company's holiday.

231
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,000
All of us will camp at Mount Lumen

232
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,440
to relax and get fresh air.

233
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Do I hear it correctly?

234
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,880
-Is it true?
-That's wonderful.

235
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,000
Long live Mr. Gu!

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,599
Yes!

237
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,479
Long live Mr. Gu!

238
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,559
Isn't that the comic
club from our school?

239
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,080
That's right.

240
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,280
(It turns out they aren't alone.)

241
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,359
Mr. Gu,

242
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,440
it's Zhou Jianqing.

243
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,520
-She is there.
-I see her.

244
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,159
Go for it!

245
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,679
What a coincidence.

246
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,320
You two are here.

247
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,000
My club came to
Mount Lumen for inspiration.

248
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,239
Can I join you?

249
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,280
Mr. Gu, you're here.

250
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,679
Yes.

251
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,159
Are you...

252
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,799
Are you going to camp here as well?

253
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,000
We do have the plan.

254
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,119
Does it happen to be
a day and a night, too?

255
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,080
-That's right.
-What a coincidence.

256
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,280
Indeed.

257
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,119
So the team building is fake.

258
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,880
He came to monitor his wife.

259
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Mr. Gu is really smart.

260
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,320
A man in love is scary.

261
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,239
That's certainly Mr. Gu.

262
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,960
Is there chocolate flavor?

263
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,599
How to open this?

264
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
Who wants chopsticks?

265
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,320
-Chopsticks.
-I want it.

266
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
There you go.

267
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
-Here.
-Move over.

268
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,719
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

269
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,000
What should I get?

270
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
I...

271
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,119
Here is the extra portion.

272
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,920
Do you want it?

273
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,199
Not bad.

274
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,839
Your staff meal is sumptuous.

275
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,040
No.

276
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,280
I don't think you can eat
seafood when you have a cold.

277
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,839
A little should be fine.

278
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,359
No, Qingqing.

279
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,040
Seafood is stimulating food.

280
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,719
Your flu might get worse.

281
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,760
Why don't we settle it for you?

282
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,160
Let's eat.

283
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,439
It smells so good.

284
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,040
Qingqing.

285
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,439
Try my pork knuckles in
fermented black beans.

286
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:43,239
It's very delicious.

287
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,920
It smells so good.

288
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,880
It contains fermented black beans.

289
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,119
I suppose it's spicy.

290
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,359
You mustn't take spicy
food when you're sick.

291
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,520
It doesn't taste spicy at all.

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,079
It's spicy anyway.

293
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,359
Let us settle it for you.

294
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
-Hurry up.
-Give it to me.

295
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
It smells great.

296
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,680
Nice food.

297
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,439
It smells so great.

298
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,959
Try this grilled beef.

299
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,239
No beef steak.

300
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,479
Beef steak is oily.

301
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,760
A sick person shouldn't take oily food.

302
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,319
Give it to us.

303
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,560
That's right. Give it here.

304
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,439
We'll take it instead.

305
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,040
Qingqing,

306
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,199
I made this nuts tart.

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,640
Try it now.

308
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
I like it very much too.

309
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
It looks really good.

310
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:32,800
It's sweet.

311
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,319
You should take less sugar
when you are coughing.

312
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
I am not coughing.

313
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:38,839
Okay.

314
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,439
It's delicious.

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,839
Let me try that.

316
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,400
You're so mean.

317
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,800
Give me that.

318
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
Here you go.

319
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,520
Grilled mutton fresh from the stove!

320
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,880
Thank you.

321
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,239
-Thank you.
-Let's drink.

322
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,520
-Come on!
-Cheers!

323
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,239
Let's play a game.

324
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,520
Sure.

325
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,479
How about omitting the multiples
of seven, the figure?

326
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,079
Sure.

327
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,280
Are you in, Mr. Gu?

328
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,520
-Mr. Gu.
-Join us.

329
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,040
You don't drink anyway.

330
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,599
I don't think you'll join us.

331
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,400
Don't provoke him.

332
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,319
He's really competitive.

333
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,160
What are you murmuring?

334
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,119
Why don't you rest if you're tired?

335
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,119
Who says I won't play?

336
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,040
Here.

337
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,040
One.

338
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:54,599
Two.

339
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,199
Three.

340
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,199
Four.

341
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:56,680
Five.

342
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,359
Six.

343
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,079
Seven.

344
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,079
Mr. Gu.

345
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,239
He lost.

346
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,119
Drink, Mr. Gu.

347
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,920
Carry on.

348
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,599
Okay.

349
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,160
10.

350
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,839
11.

351
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,359
12.

352
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,000
13.

353
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,640
14.

354
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
-It's Mr. Gu again.
-He lost again.

355
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,760
It's Mr. Gu again.

356
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,800
Mr. Gu, I'll drink for you.

357
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:14,880
It's fine.

358
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll drink it.

359
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,640
Good drinker!

360
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,479
Fantastic.

361
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Mr. Gu.

362
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,680
We'll make a move first.

363
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,239
Bye.

364
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,119
Roaming in the world of martial arts,

365
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,160
getting injured is unavoidable.

366
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,199
Four stabs to kill you.

367
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,000
One stab to kill you.

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Three stabs to kill you.

369
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,079
Drink it!

370
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:43,839
Drink it.

371
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,400
Go on.

372
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,079
Gu Nanzhou,

373
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,160
what were you thinking?

374
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,119
You're even so competitive in a game.

375
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,160
You took it seriously with Zhang Yin.

376
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,880
I love you.

377
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,119
Gu Nanzhou, wake up.

378
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
What did you say?

379
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Do you really love me?

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,880
Listen.

381
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,350
I'll take it seriously

382
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,650
if you say it again.

383
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,760
Zhou Jianqing,

384
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,239
come to your senses.

385
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
He is drunk.

386
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,479
He might not even know who I am.

387
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,839
It means nothing.

388
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,479
I'm not drunk.

389
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,599
I told you I loved you.

390
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,560
I love you.

391
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:04,380
♪Even if there's a distance♪

392
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,780

Gu Nanzhou!

394
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,479
Don't you love
Jiang Jingxuan all this while?

395
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,479
Why did you say you love me?

396
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,359
Wake up, Gu Nanzhou.

397
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,479
Gu Nanzhou.

398
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,199
Gu Nanzhou!

399
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
Make it clear.

400
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,319
Who do you really love?

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,860
♪End the shivering♪

402
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,319
Qingqing!

403
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,160
Qingqing!

404
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,760
Qingqing, where did you
go the whole night?

405
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,160
I woke up twice, but I never saw you.

406
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,719
You have deep dark circles.

407
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,040
Did you stay up the whole night?

408
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,040
I think so.

409
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,839
I can only sleep on my own bed.

410
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,119
I went out to enjoy the breeze.

411
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,359
Qingqing.

412
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,199
(Shasha Camp)
Mr. Gu, we may leave now.

413
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,880
You must be thirsty, Qingqing.

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,640
How nice.

415
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,640
There're bubbles.

416
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:38,719
Let's go.

417
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,599
Get close. I'll take a picture.

418
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
Say cheese.

419
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,680
What a coincidence.

420
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,880
You came to refill water, too.

421
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,199
Yes.

422
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,560
There.

423
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,239
There, right?

424
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll make a move first.

425
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
What a pleasant weather.

426
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,359
Isn't it cloudy?

427
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,680
Look at that beautiful tree.

428
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,160
It has withered.

429
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
Look at the grass.

430
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,359
It's dying.

431
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,959
Why do you have deep dark circles?

432
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,400
Your skin is dull.

433
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,599
Your hair is messy.

434
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,239
What happened to you last night?

435
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,000
Mr. Gu.

436
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,839
Yes, you know what?

437
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,439
-It's a nice trip.
-Yes, indeed.

438
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,520
I like that very much.

439
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,599
We're leaving.

440
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,000
Bye.

441
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,040
See you.

442
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,520
-Bye.
-Bye. I'll treat you next time.

443
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,760
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

444
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:09,880
Bye.

445
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:10,800
Be careful.

446
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,160
-Give me the bag.
-Come here.

447
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,479
Give it to me.

448
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,079
Let go of me!

449
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,199
Aren't you going to take my car?

450
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I'll take the school bus.

451
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,959
Do you want to go back by school bus

452
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
and walk home?

453
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,880
I can chat more with my classmates.

454
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Why do I feel like you're avoiding me?

455
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,920
Last night you...

456
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,642
You finished a carton of beer

457
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,020
with Zhang Yin yesterday.

458
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,520
I was the one who sent
you back to the camp.

459
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,719
Thank you.

460
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,439
Is that all?

461
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,119
How should I thank you then?

462
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
Just tell me what happened.

463
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,599
Qingqing, let's go.

464
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,239
Our classmates are waiting.

465
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,160
Mr. Gu.

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,040
Shall I beat Zhang Yin up?

467
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,040
Go.

468
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm outnumbered.

469
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,119
Next time then.

470
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,632
Nothing happened between you

471
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:57,419
and Zhou Jianqing last night, right?

472
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,479
Nothing happened.

473
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,760
Are you sure?

474
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,319
What are you trying to say?

475
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,719
After she sent you back to the camp,

476
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,892
I went to check on you

477
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:10,569
in case she couldn't handle it alone.

478
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,760
I saw her coming out and blushing.

479
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,959
-I thought...
-What were you thinking?

480
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,839
Aren't you busy with work?

481
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,959
I must have seen it wrongly.

482
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,839
I thought

483
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,971
maybe she did something wrong

484
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,370
when she took care of you.

485
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,239
You scolded her.

486
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,119
I'm not drunk.

487
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,160
I said I love you.

488
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,680
If...

489
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,280
It's just an assumption.

490
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,400
I have a friend.

491
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,260
He kissed a girl

492
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:57,329
while they didn't go steady.

493
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,719
-Did you kiss her?
-Not me.

494
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,000
I said it's my friend.

495
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,079
In this situation,

496
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,000
that's a forced kiss.

497
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,280
He is a terrible person.

498
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
What if he was drunk?

499
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,000
That can't be an excuse.

500
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,719
If you kiss a girl

501
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,359
before she agrees to date you,

502
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,560
she can sue you for sexual harassment.

503
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,319
Speaking of that,

504
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,439
it makes sense that she's angry.

505
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,199
I suppose your...

506
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,040
I mean your friend's

507
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,056
image in the girl's heart

508
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:38,850
has collapsed overnight.

509
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
Can it be restored?

510
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,079
Clarify it with her.

511
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,400
Tell her it's purely a drunken incident.

512
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,640
You had no intention to
take advantage of her.

513
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,839
After what happened,

514
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,178
you should display how calm

515
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,001
and polite you are as a gentleman.

516
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,160
Work hard to restore
your tainted image.

517
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,119
What else?

518
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,880
If it doesn't work,

519
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,400
bear responsibility for it.

520
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,599
Do you mean getting married?

521
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,319
You've made a deal with her anyway that

522
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,319
you two will get married
after her graduation.

523
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,599
It's just a ceremony.

524
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,119
We're not talking about me.

525
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes. My bad.

526
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,560
Tell your friend to think about it.

527
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,599
Otherwise,

528
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,599
that girl might not want
to see him anymore.
