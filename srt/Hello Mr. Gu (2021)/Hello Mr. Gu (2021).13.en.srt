Mr. He of all people?

61

Boss,

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,919
I didn't argue with him.

63
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,679
I reasoned with him.

64
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,240
Shut up!

65
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:02,080
You failed a project, which
was about to succeed.

66
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,720
Explain yourself.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Shall I

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,240
talk to him again?

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,639
I...

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
You...

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have no brain!

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,679
Leave at once.

73
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:18,880
We can't communicate.

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
From now on,

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,519
hand over all your work to Zhang Yin!

76
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,239
You called me a talent
during the recruitment,

77
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,000
yet you offered me a low salary.

78
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,239
Now you want to chase me away

79
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,399
after you think I stirred up trouble.

80
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,799
You think you call
the shots in everything.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,640
Sorry.

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
I have no plan

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,320
of wasting my future here.

84
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,440

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,559
Zhang Yin.

86
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,679
I'm glad that you came.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,920
From now on,

88
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,239
you'll replace Zhou Jianqing.

89
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,519
Sorry, boss.

90
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,600
I only work with Zhou Jianqing.

91
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,720
Think twice.

92
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:07,119
You shouldn't act willfully
at a workplace.

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,519
You don't get opportunities
all the time.

94
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,160
Boss,

95
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,959
maybe you're confused.

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,839
You've chosen to give Zhou Jianqing up.

97
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,959
Perhaps you're the one with no brain.

98

(SilverFir Animation)

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,239
I shouldn't have acted against him.

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,119
I tried hard to get a job
related to comic.

102
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,799
I've lost it.

103
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,200
Enough. Get over it.

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,799
It's fine for me to quit.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,239
Why did you quit?

106
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
He asked you to replace me.

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,359
Where else can you get
a good chance like this?

108
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,399
You've named all the reasons

109
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,600
that I don't want to stay.

110
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,359
I don't know what else to say about you.

111
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,799
Don't worry. I don't regret it.

112
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,279
I do.

113
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,359
I wouldn't have lost the job

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
if I didn't argue with Mr. He.

115
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,440
I could still draw comic
if I kept the job.

116
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,200
I could become a great
cartoonist one day.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Didn't you participate in
the platform's competition?

118
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Without the job,

119
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,720
we can focus on the competition.

120
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,119
If we win the first prize,

121
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,880
we'll win a cash prize of
hundreds of thousands of RMB.

122
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,279
You're right.

123
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,359
With the cash prize,

124
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,959
it's similar to working for
many years in SilverFir Animation.

125
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:29,671
Do you want to remain my assistant?

126
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,686
We will share the prize equally.

127
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,399
Do I have a choice?

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,239
I can only stick with you.

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

130
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,079
What do you mean you
can only stick with me?

131
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
There is no turning back.

132
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,839
We must win. We mustn't lose.

133
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Do you hear me?

134
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,359
Got it.

135
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,279
Let's go.

136
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,079
I heard Zhou Jianqing

137
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,959
was about to discuss with Yingqi

138
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,559
on turning her Romantic Starry Sky
into an animation.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,160
Will her comic be turned
into an animation?

140
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,000
It didn't happen.

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,519
They couldn't reach an agreement?

142
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,760
I heard she argued with them.

143
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,000
That's the way she was.

144
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,000
They argued over Lu Ziming.

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Lu Ziming?

146
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,399
She overheard Lu Ziming
persuading Mr. He

147
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,359
to withdraw investment from Xingyun.

148
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,519
So she argued with him.

149
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,440
Lu Ziming even mentioned your brother.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,559
She scolded Lu Ziming.

151
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,959
She argued with them because of me?

152
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,351
Don't be upset.

153
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,480
Although she's sacked by SilverFir...

154
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,200
She's sacked?

170
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Go back to work.

171
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,799
-Xuan.
-Go to work.

172
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,720
Let's go.

173
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:30,679
All the best.

174
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,679
-Xuan.
-Come with me.

175
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,719
What brings you here again?

176
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,320
My yoga class is nearby.

177
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,039
I came to see you on my way.

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,239
I'm busy today.

179
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I have no time for you.

180
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,919
Go back.

181
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,280
I can wait till you get off from work.

182
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,640
Why do you want to wait for me?

183
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,359
I...

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,039
I have something important to tell you.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,599
Speak up.

186
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,200
I...

187
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll shop around while waiting for you.

188
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,239
I'll come again when
you get off from work.

189
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,479
Don't wait up.

190
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,159
There're many reservations today.

191
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,960
It might end at around 11 to 12 at night.

192
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,599
Do whatever you should.

193
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,880
I'll always wait for you!

194
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,280
Xuan!

195
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:33,960
Have you finished work?

196
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,840
Here's milk tea for you.

197
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,520
However, it's turned cold.

198
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,840
Why are you still here?

199
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,000
It's dangerous for a girl
to be here alone.

200
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,520
I promised to wait till
you got off from work.

201
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,159
We have nothing to talk about.

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Do you think

203
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,000
we should talk about
cooking or photography?

204
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,479
I don't know

205
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,640
who else to go to except you.

206
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,719
My mother makes me

207
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,799
meet new people

208
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,359
unless I attend those classes.

209
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,080
My mother has arranged

210
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
the people I should meet

211
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,679
and the words I should say.

212
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,039
Isn't that good?

213
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,880
The friends introduced by your parents

214
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,159
are surely elites in the society.

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,799
Would they let you befriend me instead?

216
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I think you're fine.

217
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,719
Take my advice.

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,479
Just take the right way.

219
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,840
Don't waste time on me.

220
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,520
Come on.

221
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,640
Go.

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,159
-Xuan.
-Get into the car.

223
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
(Sea Whale. Paradise Street 19. Seaman)

224
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:11,799
Hello.

225
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,679
Look at it.

226
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,400
It's a fraud.

227
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,479
How could he possibly gain
300 votes in a minute?

228
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,840
It's pointless to join in

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,039
such a fraudulent competition.

230
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,080
Take it easy.

231
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,679
I'll get my buddies

232
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,400
and their relatives to vote for you.

233
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,400
Look at the voting speed.

234
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,719
It's clearly achieved by robots.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Humans can't vote so fast.

236
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Let's look for another way.

237
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Worst comes to worst,

238
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,479
we'll complain to the platform.

239
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,359
They didn't even see through the fraud.

240
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,039
It's so unfair.

241
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,140
(Sea Whale. Paradise Street 19. Seaman)

242
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,880
Mr. Han.

243
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,080
Yes.

244
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,880
Based on the voting mechanism,

245
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,640
only the top 50 most popular
can enter a playoff.

246
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
However, if the mechanism is unfair,

247
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,880
what is the point of
organizing the competition?

248
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,039
So I suggest a real-name voting.

249
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Recalculate the votes.

250
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,479
-Hello, Zhang Yin.
-Qingqing.

251
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,960
Check the competition page.

252
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,760
The number of votes has changed.

253
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

254
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,640
(What is going on?)

255
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,320
(Real-name voting?)

256
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,960
(It's so fussy.)

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,679
(Everyone can vote only once every day.)

258
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,039
(This is relatively fairer to authors.)

259
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,799
(It prevents vote fraud.)

260
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
(Not bad.)

261
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,080
-Hello.
-Qingqing.

262
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,359
Why didn't you tell us about your entry?

263
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,520
We learnt it from Mr. Gu.

264
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Mr. Gu?

265
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,960
What does it have to do with him?

266
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,719
Mr. Gu got Chuan to
contact the platform yesterday

267
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,200
to report a fraud

268
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,359
and tell them to investigate it.

269
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,719
Early this morning,

270
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,559
Mr. Han of the platform
called our office

271
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,679
and asked if we had an entry.

272
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,159
We saw your pen name

273
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,520
when we checked the platform.

274
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,400
Everyone can tell

275
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,840
that Mr. Gu is protecting you.

276
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,000
Everyone in Xingyun
will give you a like.

277
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,080
Everyone in the office
is voting for you.

278
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:17,880
Yes, Qingqing.

279
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,359
I've voted for you.

280
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,559
We're voting for you.

281
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,039
Thank everyone for me.

282
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,080
I'll treat each of you
to a cup of milk tea.

283
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,840
All right.

284
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,159
What a favorable weather.

285
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,039
One, two,

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,960
three, four,

287
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,919
five, six,

288
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,200
seven, eight.

289
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,440
Please have some water, Mr. Gu.

290
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,799
Thank you.

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,440
The truth is

292
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,159
I should thank you instead.

293
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,520
Why?

294
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,080
Those in Xingyun

295
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,599
told me that you resolved

296
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,679
the fraud in the competition,
in which I'm participating.

297
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
I saw it randomly.

298
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,559
Robot voting is never
fair to participants.

299
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,960
It's a loophole.

300
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,679
I also heard

301
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,039
that you asked everyone
in the office to vote for me.

302
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:09,799
I'm really thankful.

303
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,400
Winning the competition

304
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,119
will be an honor to the company.

305
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,159
Somehow,

306
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
you're half a Xingyun personnel.

307
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,159
I'm thankful anyway.

308
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,239
I heard

309
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,960
that you offended Mr. He

310
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,559
at Yingqi for defending me.

311
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,039
You've even lost your job.

312
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,599
I didn't want that job anyway.

313
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,119
If I didn't lose the job,

314
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,320
I wouldn't have had the time

315
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
to modify my work.

316
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,039
I could've lost the chance
to enter top 50.

317
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,239
I've gone through your work.

318
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,200
Your level

319
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,359
is one of the best in the competition.

320
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,159
It'd be a pity if you're affected

321
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,479
by the fraud.

322
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,039
Is it true?

323
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,159
Do you really think so?

324
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,599
Yes.

325
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,119
I've come to realize

326
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,359
that you're a good person.

327
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,000
You're righteous and tasteful

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
and you support your friend.

329
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,439
Do you view me as a friend?

330
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,160
If you disagree,

331
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,359
you can choose not
to see me as a friend.

332
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,800
You're still the Party A
who I respect the most.

333
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,640
I prefer being your friend.

334
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:36,880
A friend.

335
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
Thank you, my friend.

336
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,199
Not bad, Xuan.

337
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,640
You've been promoted to sous-chef.

338
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,520
Xuan,

339
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,599
don't forget us if
there is any good deal.

340
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,920
Listen.

341
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,199
Work well.

342
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,119
I'll cut your pay if you slack.

343
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,520
You know, baby.

344
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,479
I was forced to go on that blind date.

345
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,119
My parents forced me to do it.

346
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,520
Did you just listen to them?

347
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,079
I couldn't help it.

348
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,040
Baby.

349
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,719
You should know

350
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,280
that I won't take such a girl seriously.

351
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,680
What are you doing?

352
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,160
Apologise to the customer.

353
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,439
Would you dare to accept my apology?

354
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,040
You...

355
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:37,971
Mind your attitude.

356
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,319
You don't speak like
this to your customer.

357
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,000
I told you on your first day.

358
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,920
Customer is like a god
in our restaurant.

359
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,319
How dare you fight with a customer.

360
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,839
Leave here at once

361
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,359
unless you apologise.

362
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,959
I won't apologise to a bad person.

363
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,560
You...

364
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,880
I quit.

365
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,199
Zhou Zixuan!

366
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,800
Calm down.

367
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,439
(That man introduced by your parents)

368
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,319
(is not a decent person.)

369
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,079
Mr. Gu.

370
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,599
All teams are ready
for you to call a meeting.

371
00:19:58,959 --> 00:19:59,680
Got it.

372
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,359
Aunt?

373
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,319
Mother?

374
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,719
What brings you here?

375
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:07,920
Xiaozhou,

376
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,040
did anything happen to you lately?

377
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,040
I'm fine.

378
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,199
What happened?

379
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,800
Are you disposing of your assets?

380
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,719
That's a normal change
of property right.

381
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,800
Don't worry.

382
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,319
You've disposed of
almost all your houses.

383
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,959
Of course I'm worried.

384
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,599
Be honest with me, son.

385
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,880
Are you in trouble?

386
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,439
Mother,

387
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,680
I have a meeting.

388
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,040
Let's talk later.

389
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Xiaozhou.

390
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,199
Xiaozhou!

391
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:45,359
Aunt,

392
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,520
don't worry.

393
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,719
I'll watch over him.

394
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Tell me the truth.

395
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Is he in trouble?

396
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,359
Zhou Jianqing used to
be Nanzhou's assistant.

397
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,520
She helped secure Yingqi's investment.

398
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,319
So Nanzhou decided
to work with Bule Ray.

399
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,160
We didn't expect Yingqi

400
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,359
to withdraw investment
all of the sudden.

401
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,079
It landed Nanzhou in trouble.

402
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,079
So this is the reason.

403
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,199
No wonder.

404
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,959
Jianqing meant well actually.

405
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,599
However, there is something else.

406
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,959
It has placed a lot of
pressure on Nanzhou.

407
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,199
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

408
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,520
Of course you should.

409
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Tell me.

410
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,599
Yes!

411
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,280
I've entered top 50.

412
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,199
I'm awesome.

413
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,880
-Qingqing.
-Aunt.

414
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,199
What brings you here?

415
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,439
I happened to pass by.

416
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,199
So I came to visit you.

417
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,560
I brought these fruits from my house.

418
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,040
Thank you.

419
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,199
I've washed and cut it.

420
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,079
I don't know what you like to eat.

421
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,079
So I've brought a few types.

422
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,959
See if you like the fruits.

423
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay.

424
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,119
It's all my favorite.

425
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,800
Seriously?

426
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,520
Try it.

427
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,800
Aunt, after you.

428
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,680
All right.

429
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:43,920
You should have it, too.

430
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,959
Don't stand on ceremony.

431
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:45,839
Sure.

432
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:52,959
Qingqing.

433
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,199
Are you fine with Xiaozhou?

434
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,640
We're fine.

435
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,439
What's wrong, aunt?

436
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,079
Xiaozhou

437
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,719
has not been sociable
since he was a little boy.

438
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,560
He's a man of few words.

439
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,199
You ought to tell me

440
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,359
if he ignores

441
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,160
or upsets you.

442
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,439
I'll speak for you.

443
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,400
Aunt,

444
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,040
he is actually quite nice.

445
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
He's not that bad.

446
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,199
Seriously?

447
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,040
Mother?

448
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,439
You're home.

449
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,719
He is nice except the fact
that he likes pulling a long face.

450
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,400
You have no idea.

451
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,479
He was worse when he was a little boy.

452
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,040
What are you whispering?

453
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,479
Did I say anything wrong?

454
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,319
Xiaozhou.

455
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,199
Have some fruits with us.

456
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,239
I'm not eating.

457
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,319
I have work to do.

458
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,520
Enjoy yourselves.

459
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,079
Look at him.

460
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,079
He has a bad temper, too.

461
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,920
That's the way he is.

462
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,160
Tell him straight if you're
unhappy about it.

463
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:03,959
Otherwise,

464
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,520
he'll drive you crazy.

465
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,640
I'm glad that he
inherits my pretty face.

466
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,520
Otherwise,

467
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,479
he would've been dumped
100 times already.

468
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,680
Mother,

469
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,599
it's late.

470
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,439
I'll send you home.

471
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,839
Yes, it is late.

472
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm lazy to move.

473
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,959
Shall I

474
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,959
stay over tonight?

475
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,199
Sure, aunt.

476
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll prepare your room.

477
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Save the trouble.

478
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,239
I'll just take the guest room.

479
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Rest early.

480
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,719
Sure, aunt.

481
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,839
You shall rest early, too.

482
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,079
Qingqing.

483
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,959
Aren't you sharing a room with Xiaozhou?

484
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,239
Of course we do.

485
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,000
I'll check whether the door is locked.

486
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,479
This child is so meticulous.

487
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,280
It's locked.

488
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,599
Good night, aunt.

489
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,319
Good night.

490
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,160
Can't you tell my mother
did it on purpose?

491
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,839
You even responded to her.

492
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,160
We'll need to sleep together

493
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,560
as long as she stays here.

494
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,640
It's just about sleeping
in the same room.

495
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,040
One of us can sleep on the bed,

496
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,079
while the other sleeps on the floor.

497
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,000
Shall we play rock paper scissors
to decide?

498
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:53,880
You'll sleep on the bed.

499
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,239
(Why has he become
so nice all of a sudden?)

500
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,959
Is it very uncomfortable?

501
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,560
Who can sleep comfortably on the floor?

502
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,160
I have an idea.

503
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,040
Do you want to listen to it?

504
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,560
Just say it.

505
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:36,591
Isn't it uncomfortable
sleeping on the floor?

506
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,479
Let's make a deal.

507
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,680
You'll pay an additional RMB500.

508
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,560
I'll sleep on the floor while
you'll sleep on the bed tonight.

509
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,160
What do you think?

510
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,359
You're money-minded.

511
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,239
Forget it then.

512
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,446
Won't you feel nervous

513
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:58,250
sleeping with a man in the same room?

514
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,839
Why should I?

515
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,160
I used to sleep with Zhang Yin.

516
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,680
I've gotten used to it.

517
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,479
You used to sleep with him?

518
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,359
There is nothing odd about it.

519
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,959
There're many of us
rushing for publication.

520
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,079
A bed could fit six of us.

521
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,000
Men and women

522
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:22,959
all squeezed together?

523
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,040
Come on.

524
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,800
There was no difference in
gender when we're rushing.

525
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,239
We're exhausted.

526
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,479
No one cared about gender.

527
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,119
(Why should I care)

528
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,000
(who she used to sleep with?)

529
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,359
Did she sleep like this when she
was sleeping with others?
