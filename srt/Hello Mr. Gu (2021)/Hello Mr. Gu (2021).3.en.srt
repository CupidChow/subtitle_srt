00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,500
=Hello Mr. Gu Theatre=

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,800
There're reporters from DTV

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,760
at Entrance A and Entrance B
of the apartment.

4
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,439
There're also reporters from Youle

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,840
at the underground parking area.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,399
There is only one way

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,280
to avoid them,

8
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,360
and that's...

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,799
Go.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,319
(Gu Nanzhou.)

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,439
(This self-claimed flawless
and perfect man)

12
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,840
(has a fatal weakness
not known by the people.)

13
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,520
(He has a phobia of crowd.)

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,880
(It terrifies him more
than anything else.)

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,100
He becomes timid once
he's in front of people.

=Hello Mr. Gu=

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,960
=Episode 3=

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,480
(Troublemaker)

46
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,240
The meal is ready.

47
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,600
Wonderful.

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm so hungry.

49
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,559
Can you not waste food?

50
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,279
I never eat bread crust.

51
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,919
What is this?

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Fruit juice.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,919
Celery in fruit juice?

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,679
Are you a devil?

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Celery replenishes Vitamin C.

56
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,600
It can control blood pressure
and reduce cholesterol.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,679
It suits chubby people like you

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,720
the most.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,039
Who are you calling chubby?

60
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,839
You're the one who is chubby.

61
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,839
Are you blind?

62
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,119
You're crazy.

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,440
Can you have porridge quietly?

64
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,720
Can you not spin it while having it?

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,759
It will be less hot this way.

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,880
Why does one

67
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,279
need a spoon?

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,880
Have yours while I'll have mine.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
Why must you look at me
while you're eating?

70
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,880
Your eating behavior and noise

71
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,399
has disrupted my eating pace

72
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,960
and my taste buds to taste food.

73
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,399
Your current look and condition

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,119
have severely damaged my appetite too.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm glad that you aren't married yet.

76
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,880
Exactly.

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
We'd better not meet each other

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,640
unless it's necessary

79
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,040
or it will ruin each other's
physical and mental health.

80
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,839
I'm full.

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,480
I'll make a move first.

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,959
Wait.

83
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm done eating.

84
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,959
Let's head to office.

85
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:00,959
Xiaochuan.

86
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,640
Ignore her.

87
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,359
Drive.

88
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,000
Xiaochuan.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,519
Okay.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,119
Xiaochuan.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,959
Open the door.

92
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,079
Can you have common sense
and not get too far?

93
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,559
There're traffic rules to follow.

94
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,600
Can you send me to school?

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
It's nearby.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
Based on the 30th clause,

97
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Party B shouldn't add trouble

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
beyond the agreement to Party A.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,200
I know, boss.

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,519
I'm late.

101
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,720
I need to attend
career guidance course this morning.

102
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,880
I can't be late.

103
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,480
No.

104
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,200
If you didn't keep me up

105
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,160
the whole night,

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,760
I could've spent the night at school

107
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
instead of being late.

108
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,880
Do you know what you're saying?

109
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,079
Be a kind person for once, okay?

110
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,839
I won't look for you next time

111
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,160
nor cause trouble for you.

112
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,040
I promise.

113
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,880
No.

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,040
I won't let you go

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
unless you give me a lift.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,359
Get into the car.

117
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,399
Move in.

118
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,920
Nancheng University.

119
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,399
Thank you.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,119
All right.

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,239
Qingqing.

122
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,799
So you spent a whole night

123
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,239
with a handsome man.

124
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,519
Stop that.

125
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,200
Now I just want to sleep.

126
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,679
What did you do last night?

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,519
Let us, the single ladies,

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,519
feel a spark of romance.

129
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,160
Tell us.

130
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,079
Forget it. He can't be the one.

131
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
Isn't that...

132
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,040
He's handsome.

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,399
He is so handsome.

134
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
It's really him.

135
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,239
Both of them...

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,119
You left your bag in the car.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Backpack.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,640
She really went to his house last night.

139
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,720
It's true.

140
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,000
Hi.

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,399
I'm Zhou Jianqing's fiancé.

142
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,519
She is good in everything,

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,920
but she has a bad habit.

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
Sometimes she loves telling

145
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,839
inappropriate jokes.

146
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:21,839
Yes.

147
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,239
I always can't run my mouth.

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,399
Don't take it seriously.

149
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,559
Can I have her for two minutes?

150
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
She told us nothing.

151
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,440
Why did you tell them
that you're my fiancé?

152
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
Should I allow you to defame me

153
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,239
whenever you like out there?

154
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Fine.

155
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,839
We're even.

156
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,559
I'm heading to my class.

157
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
Don't come to my school
unless it is necessary.

158
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Wait.

159
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,119
Give me your phone.

160
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,380
(Hubby)

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,519
Do you need to be so serious?

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,839
Yes, since we've signed

163
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:09,920
an agreement.

164
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,519
We're engaged

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,359
in front of others from now on.

166
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,320
Also,

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,600
if I hear you spouting nonsense
to others again...

168
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,040
Got it.

169
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,519
Fulfill my duty.

170
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Act as your fiancée.

171
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,200
But you don't need to act as my fiancé.

172
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,880
I'll lose my chance of knowing
other men if I get married

173
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,760
before dating anyone.

174
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,760
Behave.

175
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,799
I'm short-tempered.

176
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,000
I have to go.

177
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,880
Okay, bye.

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,799
Why are you here?

179
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,440
Tell me now.

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
Is it true?

181
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,479
What?

182
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,679
Your engagement.

183
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,159
Even students in
the college next door know.

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,039
Your wedding photos

185
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,159
are displayed on a loop

186
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,119
at the bridal shop.

187
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,239
Many passersby saw it.

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,239
Who let them display the photos?

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,159
Students,

190
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,000
look at the whiteboard.

191
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,200
Leave.

192
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,679
He helped me.

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,159
So I act like we're in
a relationship temporarily.

194
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
I only act as his fiancée.

195
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,039
We're unrelated in private.

196
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,520
Are you going to register
marriage with him for real?

197
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,440
We'll talk about that later.

198
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,320
What should you do if you really

199
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,200
fall in love one day?

200
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,599
Don't worry.

201
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
We don't like each other.

202
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,679
Even if it's the end of the world

203
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,960
or we're invaded by aliens from Mars,

204
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,119
there would never be a spark of romance

205
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,760
between us.

206
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,280
You mustn't tell my brother about this.

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Even you're responding this way.

208
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,080
He might wield a knife at me

209
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,559
if he knows about it.

210
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,479
What if he threatens me?

211
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Be strong.

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Hang in there.

213
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,280
You know him.

214
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't do it.

215
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,000
You should make an oath.

216
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,080
No matter how my brother
threatens or forces you,

217
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,559
you can say nothing.

218
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,479
Do you want to see me
being killed by my brother?

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,760
A life is at stake here.

220
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,760
You'll end up losing me.

221
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,479
Fine.

222
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,119
I promise you.

223
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,760
Do you really want to marry that man?

224
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:18,880
Yes.

225
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,960
I didn't believe it when others told me.

226
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,719
I saw your wedding photos

227
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,119
only when I visited the shop.

228
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,760
Did you plan to inform me only

229
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,520
when your baby turned one month old?

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,880
You know it now.

231
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:30,960
Give us your blessings.

232
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
Why are you suddenly getting married

233
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,239
to him of all the people?

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,599
So the wish I made on Singles' Day

235
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,359
has come true.

236
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,440
A handsome, muscular,

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,679
excellent and blind man

238
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,760
is vigorously pursuing me.

239
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,479
I thought you're annoyed by him.

240
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,119
I was,

241
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
but I'm a girl.

242
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,479
No one can resist

243
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
such a romantic pursuit.

244
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,200
Don't you think so?

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,840
Don't pull a long face, both of you.

246
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm marrying into a rich family.

247
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm not sold to a human trafficker.

248
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
At my wedding,

249
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll give each of you a big red packet.

250
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,200
Zhang Yin.

251
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,960
Remember to submit your work tonight.

252
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,719
Are you leaving, too?

253
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,740
(Gu Group Headquarters)

254
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:50,960
What is going on?

255
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,880
We may begin, Mr. Lu.

256
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,640
Mr. Gu seems to be

257
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
as mysterious as always.

258
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,840
He is absent at
such an important meeting.

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,559
I'm worried about the outlook

260
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,239
of a company led by him.

261
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,559
Those who are supporting
the shutdown of Xingyun

262
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,280
include Mr. Li, Mr. Zhao,

263
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,200
Mr. Zhuo, Mr. Zheng

264
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,359
and me.

265
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,679
We own

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,799
Gu's Group

267
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,840
by 41% of shares.

268
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,039
Those who want to sustain Xingyun

269
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,719
are Mr. Gu and Mr. Wu.

270
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,719
They own

271
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
the group by 39% of shares.

272
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,119
It seems that Mr. Gu will
be disappointed this time.

273
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,479
Mr. Lu, you seem to have
overlooked the small shareholders.

274
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,559
Mr. Lu, you seem to have forgotten

275
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,919
to calculate the small
shareholders' shares.

276
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,400
Small shareholders?

277
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,593
(Shareholders Meeting
Authorization Letter)

278
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,039
This is an authorization letter
of small shareholders.

279
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,239
They authorized me

280
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,159
to vote for sustaining Xingyun Animation

281
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,119
on their behalf.

282
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,640
With 4% shares owned
by small shareholders,

283
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,919
shareholders who support to sustain

284
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,440
Xingyun Animation own 43% of shares

285
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,679
of the group.

286
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,280
Mr. Gu is certainly an impressive youth.

287
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,760
He's a force to be reckoned with.

288
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,479
He thinks he owns substantial shares.

289
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,159
Hence he's neglecting what
the people in Gu Group want.

290
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm flattered, Mr. Lu.

291
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,960
Even when he wins in
this shareholders meeting,

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
what about next time

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
and the following times?

294
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,599
So I have a suggestion today,

295
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,799
which I hope you all will consider.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,919
Xingyun will be detached
from the group in the future.

297
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,919
It will operate independently

298
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,039
and bear its own profit and losses.

299
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,440
It won't exist

300
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,599
as a subsidiary of Gu's Group.

301
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,799
The group used to invest in Xingyun.

302
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:50,039
Mr. Gu should be
responsible for shareholders.

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,119
Sure.

304
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,440
Xingyun will achieve

305
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
expected profit within a year

306
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
to repay the group for its investment.

307
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,200
Good.

308
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,520
Let's do as you say.

309
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,440

I want to look at that one.

315
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,200
I want to look at that.

317
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,599

Sorry.

325

They aren't for sales anymore.

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
Sorry.

327
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,200
Sorry.

328
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,559
Forget it.

No.

332
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you trying to do?

334
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
90% off for so many books.

335
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,239
What a loss.

Young lady.

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,280
I'm going to pack up and leave tonight.

338
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll lose more

339
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,280
if I throw all books away

340
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,080
instead of selling them.

341
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,239
I'll let you earn more.

(There're many book stores. Hence,
you can only sell books cheaply,)

344
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,159
(Cao's Duck Restaurant)
(but there's no book store in the west.)

345
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,400
(Shuyi Tealicious)
(Move the books there.)

346
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,039
(You can sell them at 50% off.)

347
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,359
(Original copies at 50% off)
(Just pay me a 20% commission.)

348
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,520
(I'll sell them all.)

349
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes, it's 50% off.

350
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,559
Come and see.

351
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,359
50% off for all books.

352
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,200
Come and see.

353
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Is there a novel?

354
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,919
We have everything.

355
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,679
Pick what you want.

356
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,799
50% off for all books.

357
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,799
It's super economic.

358
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,840
Rest assured.

359
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,520
They are all genuine copies.

360
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,159
Rest assured.

361
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:18,840
What are you doing?

362
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,599
You're not allowed
to sell anything here.

363
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,479
I am not selling these anymore.

364
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,080
Dismiss.

365
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,880
Aren't you selling them anymore?

366
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,239
How can you sell books over here?

367
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,840
Stop.

368
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:27,799
Sorry.

369
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
I was feeling unwell a few days ago.

370
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,520
I couldn't join the plan discussion.

371
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,799
You're feeling unwell?

372
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Why did I hear

373
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,039
that you're meeting
a beauty in the office?

374
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,960
Mr. Luo,

375
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,159
that's actually Mr. Gu's assistant.

376
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,119
Mr. Gu fell sick all of a sudden.

377
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,280
So she was caught off guard.

378
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,599
I envy Xingyun's office environment.

379
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,679
Not only Mr. Gu

380
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,119
has a young and innocent girl,

381
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,599
he also has a gentle

382
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,960
and intellectual beauty
like you, Ms. Jiang.

383
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,599
Mr. Luo,

384
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,719
you're making me mad

385
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,919
with your joke.

386
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
Ms. Jiang, do you want me
to compliment you more?

387
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,239
Mr. Gu has been telling us

388
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,119
that we should work harder

389
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,359
to improve our talent even when
we can live on our good looks.

390
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,719
Good.

391
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,040
I've drafted a new plan.

392
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,119
Why don't we go through it

393
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,319
and examine my talent?

394
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,719
In this case,

395
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,959
I'll go through it carefully.

396
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,180
(Wife)

397
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,199
Xingyun has been making good plans.

398
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,199
I have no problem after revising

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
these problems.

400
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,719
Our agreement...

401
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
It's merely a process.

402
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,599
It can be done with a signature.

403
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,359
We've been busy for so long.

404
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,920
We should celebrate.

405
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,920
Tonight will be my treat.

406
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:48,800
Mr. Gu,

407
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,160
you should come.

408
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,800
We should treat you to a meal instead.

409
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,079
I've booked a nice

410
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,079
Japanese restaurant tonight.

411
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,160
All of you must come.

412
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,800
Sure.

413
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,780
(Wife)

414
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,400
Hello.

415
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
I still have something urgent.

416
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,199
I know.

417
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,599
Sorry, guys.

418
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,680
My fiancée has an emergency.

419
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,479
I need to settle it for her.

420
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,400
So I can't dine with
you tonight, Mr. Luo.

421
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,719
Mr. Gu,

422
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,640
what is it? I'll go on your behalf.

423
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,800
Mr. Luo and others...

424
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,280
No.

425
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,760
I should go by myself.

426
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,520
Sorry.

427
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,680
(Genuine titles)
Comrade,

428
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,319
(50% off sales)
it's really my first time.

429
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:44,800
(Nancheng Market)
Well...

430
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,439
(Administrative and Law Enforcement)
I couldn't help it.

431
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,199
They insisted on seeing my kin

432
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,119
and I needed to keep it
from my brother.

433
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,680
I could only trouble you.

434
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,760
Stay away. What a disgrace.

435
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
I won't do it next time, seriously.

436
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
Don't worry.

437
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,000
Miss. Zhou,

438
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,520
you've violated the clauses
twice in a day,

439
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,239
you know?

440
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,400
Fine.

441
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
I'll pay

442
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,920
all the fines to Xiaochuan.

443
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,520
However,

444
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,520
it may have to be a few days later.

445
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,280
I have no money now.

446
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,079
Just bear

447
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
the third clause in mind.

448
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,520
Party B cannot tarnish Party A's image.

449
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,239
The poor wants to make a living.

450
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,959
I need to sell things to feed myself.

451
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,959
Moreover,

452
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,880
it has nothing to do with you.

453
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,520
If so, why did you ask me to come here?

454
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,479
Just don't create trouble for me.

455
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,239
Otherwise...

456
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,520
Compensate you for all your losses.

457
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,760
Got it.

458
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,239
I...

459
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,359
It's really difficult for me.

460
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
(Urban Administrative and
Law Enforcement Bureau)

461
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,839
I won't bother you.

462
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,239
I'll keep my promise. Go.

463
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,479
Get into the car.

464
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:56,839
I'll send you back to school.

465
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,520
You look heartless,

466
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,119
but you're actually kind.

467
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,719
Are you leaving or not?

468
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,199
Yes.

469
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,380
(Nancheng University)

470
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
Bye.

471
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,239
Wait.

472
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,839
Remember the agreement.

473
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,079
You mustn't run a stall.

474
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,520
You mustn't tarnish my image.

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,199
Don't worry.

476
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Customer first.

477
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,959
Are you Mr. Gu's fiancée?

478
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,520
I was worried

479
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,839
when he dashed out.

480
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,000
Is everything okay now?

481
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,760
Yes.

482
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,359
I was arrested for
selling books at a stall.

483
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,959
It's good for a young person

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
to learn to earn money and accumulate

485
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:05,880
some social experience,

486
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,959
but you should be careful next time.

487
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,439
Don't make Mr. Gu worried.

488
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,079
I won't

489
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,599
and I won't dare to.

490
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,479
I know someone in the bureau.

491
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,760
You may run an approved stall next time.

492
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
Shall I ask around for you?

493
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,239
Miss,

494
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,479
you're awesome.

495
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,760
I want to sell some vintage
clothing over the weekend.

496
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,520
Is it convenient

497
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,000
to introduce your friend to me?

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,719
Zhou Jianqing.

499
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,239
I'm just asking.

500
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,160
Why are you looking for me?

501
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,599
Aren't you having a meal with Mr. Luo?

502
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,680
He promised to do so at first,

503
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,119
but he had an emergency.

504
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,119
So he left early.

505
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,280
He raised a few questions
before he left.

506
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,239
We might need

507
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,199
to revise the plan.

508
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:54,599
Okay.

509
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:55,800
Get into the car.

510
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,079
I'll work overtime at Xingyun with you.

511
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,359
Miss,

512
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,000
can I add you on WeChat?

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,680
No.

514
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,680
Remember what I said.

515
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,280
Go back to your dormitory
as soon as possible.

516
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,520
Got it.

517
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I'll obey you.

518
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Isn't it hectic to look
after a young girlfriend?

519
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,920
She even wants to run
a stall to experience life.

520
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,439
She's like a child who never grows up.

521
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,199
Nanzhou,

522
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
let me drive instead.

523
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,160
You dashed out

524
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,839
and you didn't eat.

525
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
I think this porridge is nice.

526
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
So I ordered one for you.

527
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,880
Do you want to have some first?

528
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,439
No need.

529
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't like to eat in a car.

530
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,760
Also, I'm full due to anger.

531
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,160
(Teachers Office)
February 14, Valentine's Day.

532
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,439
You sold roses at men's dormitory,
which was against the rules.

533
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,439
March 12, Arbor Day.

534
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,680
You sold succulent plants, which
was again, against the rules.

535
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,479
April 1, April Fool's Day.

536
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,280
You posted advertisements everywhere

537
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,199
to help design pranks for others.

538
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,119
Zhou Jianqing,

539
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,920
you're really good at grabbing
business opportunities.

540
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,439
Sorry, teacher.

541
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,079
I'll take note in the future.

542
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,000
Small problems are fine.

543
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,359
You even offended those rogues.

544
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,439
They damaged
the dormitory's water pipes.

545
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,280
Why did they go to my dormitory?

546
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,599
They're too much.

547
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
How many times have I warned you?

548
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,839
Don't think you can graduate

549
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,680
if I punish you every time.

550
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,599
Teacher,

551
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,359
please don't do this.

552
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
I still need to find a job.

553
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,359
I can't afford to have
a blot on my record.

554
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:38,880
Teacher,

555
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,199
you know my family's situation.

556
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,160
We have debts of millions of RMB.

557
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,239
My brother and I

558
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,119
have been working hard to pay it,

559
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,239
but sometimes, it's overdue.

560
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,280
All right. Stop crying.

561
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,760
Enough.

562
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,439
It's two months to go before graduation.

563
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:09,880
You may apply

564
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,959
to leave school early.

565
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,839
Take care of yourself.

566
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,800
Sorry.

567
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,560
Tell me.

568
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,239
Our dormitory is at a low level.

569
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,719
Will those rogues climb over the wall?

570
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,040
Don't be crazy.

571
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,199
We have security guards.

572
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,599
The rogues won't go that far.

573
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Why did they come in to
damage the water pipes?

574
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm so mad.

575
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,239
My new leather shoes are soaked.

576
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,359
My figurine is broken.

577
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,439
It's a limited edition.

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
It's all Zhou Jianqing's fault.

579
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,959
She should have been careful
when she's debt-ridden.

580
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,560
She shouldn't have let the rogues

581
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,880
know where she's staying.

582
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,079
Do you think

583
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,160
the rogues will target at us

584
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,560
if they cannot collect the debt?

585
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Sorry.

586
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,680
I was the cause of the incident today.

587
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,680
I'll compensate you for
your shoes and figurine.

588
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,599
I'll move out today.

589
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,280
The rogues won't come anymore.

590
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,079
(It's all right.)

591
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,479
(I can stand it.)

592
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,479
(I'll clear the debt)

593
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,839
(and solve the problem eventually.)

594
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,880
(Zhou Jianqing,)

595
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,079
(work harder.)

596
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,640
Mother,

597
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm leaving first.

598
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,400
Hurry up.

599
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,640
Hello.

600
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,359
Susu.

601
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,160
Do you miss me?

602
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,800
Yes.

603
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,520
I miss you every minute and second.

604
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,239
Why

605
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,400
are you calling me at this hour?

606
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,640
I've moved out from the dormitory.

607
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,359
Can I spend a night at your house?

608
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,640
Why did you move out
from your dormitory?

609
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,959
I'll tell you when we meet.

610
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,800
I'll go to you now.

611
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,359
I'm not home.

612
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm enjoying hot spring with
my mother at Luhu Lake.

613
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,599
When will you come back?

614
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,439
Qingqing.

615
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,520
Qingqing?

616
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,400
Hello?

617
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,560
Seriously?

618
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,839
The battery runs out at this time?

619
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,479
It's late.

620
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,680
Susu isn't home.

621
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,079
Do I have no choice,

622
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,680
but to bother that annoying man?

623
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,040
(No way. Is he here to collect debt?)

624
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,959
Gu Nanzhou.

625
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,880
Open the door, Gu Nanzhou.

626
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,839
He is living next door.

627
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,920
It freaked me out.

628
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,640
Welcome home.

629
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,160
Sorry.

630
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,000
I thought someone was following me.

631
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,599
I hide here only because I was scared.

632
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,520
Turning on lights for you.

633
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,119
It's a robot.

634
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,520
It freaked me out.

635
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Turning on air conditioner for you.

636
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,599
Never mind.

637
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,680
Playing a song for you.

638
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,479
No.

639
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,800
May I know

640
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,239
what you need?

641
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,640
I need nothing.

642
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,439
Thank you.

643
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,359
(He isn't home.)

644
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,880
(I'll apologise)

645
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
(when he comes back.)

646
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,479
Sorry

647
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,680
to trouble you at this hour.

648
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,079
Don't mention it.

649
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
There is an overcoat on the rear seat.

650
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,880
Put it on after getting off the car.

651
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,839
What about you

652
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,599
if I wear the overcoat?

653
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,760
Xingyun will not be able

654
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,000
to operate if you fall sick.

655
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,479
I have spare clothes.

656
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,199
Don't worry.

657
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,900
(Nancheng University Meal Card)

658
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,640
Is this Zhou Jianqing's meal card?

659
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,560
She could've dropped it this morning

660
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,199
when I sent her to school.

661
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,560
Just leave it there.

662
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,359
Since when are you dating?

663
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,400
I didn't even know.

664
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,520
We started dating not long ago.

665
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:58,719
Hello.

666
00:30:59,199 --> 00:30:59,839
