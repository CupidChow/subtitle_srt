(Premonition never lies.)

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
(Are you still angry?)

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
(What happened today?)

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,240
(I am sorry.)

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,920
(It was my fault.)

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,640
(I won't let anyone sit in
the passenger seat anymore.)

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,840
(Have an early night.)

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
(Have an early night?)

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,240
Do you want to reply to him

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,240
and let him know you're safe?

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,880
No.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,600
He didn't even ask about my safety.

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,880
Okay, don't reply to him then.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
He always does this way.

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,520
He never takes the initiative
to apologize.

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
This time, he's gone overboard,

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
yet his attitude is still the same.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Does he think I will always forgive him?

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Correct.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,120
He's really being too much.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,160
Then,

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
I'll help you to break up with him.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,680
In fact,

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
you don't want to let him go,

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,600
right?

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Susu.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,640
However, now I can't feel

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,440
that he cares about me.

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,360
Is it because I courted him?

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,200
Is that why he doesn't cherish me?

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
I knew it.

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Girls just shouldn't
take the initiative.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
I think

63
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,080
Gu Nanzhou is not that kind of person.

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,200
Someone like him

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
wouldn't have accepted you

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
in the first place

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,680
if he didn't like you.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,880
However, when we first met,

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,480
he said

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I wasn't his cup of tea.

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
He likes

72
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
intellectual, independent

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
and elegant women.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
Isn't that Jiang Jingxuan?

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
His ideal woman

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
is in front of him every day.

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,600
Won't he be tempted?

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,880
However, Jiang Jingxuan got to know him

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
much earlier than you did.

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,560
According to you,

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,280
she has always been
interested in Gu Nanzhou.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,520
If Gu Nanzhou liked her, too,

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
why would they remain

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,600
only work partners?

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
What about the shower and ribbon?

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
If you mind,

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,320
just ask him in person.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
What if it's really a misunderstanding?

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,520
Won't you regret it

90
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
if you break up over this kind of thing?

91
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,440
So,

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,720
apply a mask

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,640
and sleep well tonight.

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,960
Tomorrow,

95
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,400
ask him about this yourself,

96
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,480
okay?

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,720
(Xingyun Animation)

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,400
Obviously, he provoked me.

99
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
Why should I go to him first?

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,440
Qingqing.

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Ms. Jiang.

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,400
Are you here for Nanzhou again?

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,440
I am just passing by.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,280
Nanzhou just finished a meeting.

105
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
He's now on his lunch break.

106
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you have anything important?

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Should I wake him up?

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
It's okay. I can go by myself.

109
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
I'll get back to work then.

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,720
Wake him up for me?

111
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,960
You talk as if you were his girlfriend.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,360
I am, okay?

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Since you look pitiful,

114
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll spare you this time.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,080
I'll reason with you next time.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,120
Hello.

117
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,440
Hello.

118
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Is it Ms. Zhou?

119
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,320
Speaking.

120
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,440
May I know who you are?

121
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
I am the editor of Senka Press.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,800
Here's the thing.

123
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,360
We're

124
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
very interested

125
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
in your Paradise Street 19.

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,160
I don't know if you're willing

127
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
to work with us.

128
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,840
Hold on.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,960
Which publishing house?

130
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
Senka Press.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,320
We are the earliest publishing house

132
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
in China to start publication of comics.

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,400
We have published

134
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,280
many classic works.

135
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
I know.

136
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
I read every work

137
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
published by you.

138
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,280
I am glad that you like

139
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,400
Paradise Street 19.

140
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
I am also honored

141
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
to have an opportunity
to work with you.

142
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
Ms. Zhou, we're flattered.

143
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
If you have time,

144
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
we can meet and talk in detail.

145
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
Are you free?

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,720
Yes!

147
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm always available.

148
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Nanzhou.

149
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,480
Nanzhou, you're up.

150
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,080
You should have covered
yourself during the nap.

151
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,160
What if you catch a cold?

152
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,280
Thank you.

153
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,120
You don't take care of your health.

154
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,720
I have to keep an eye on you.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
You are the core of the entire company.

156
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
If you fall ill,

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,560
I can't cope with the operation.

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Don't worry.

159
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
I won't fall ill before the completion

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,440
of Lake Xingling.

161
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Mr. Gu,

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,160
we're in trouble.

163
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Lejiabao sent us a legal letter.

164
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
There's sufficient evidence
of plagiarism

165
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
for the animation we brought in.

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,600
Their claim amount

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
is exorbitant.

168
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Did you contact
the attorney, Ms. Zhuang?

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,720
What did she say?

170
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,720
I did.

171
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
Ms. Zhuang is not confident.

172
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,200
Their legal team is very experienced

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,960
and has an amazing record.

174
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,080
Also,

175
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
we are in the wrong.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
We don't stand a high chance.

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
We can only negotiate with them

178
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,440
and try to reduce the amount
of compensation.

179
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
Open all these contracts.

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
Then, compare them

181
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,960
and find the differences.

182
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,120
Yes.

183
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
(Dear)

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,360
Yes, just these two.

185
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,160
Hello.

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,560
Nanzhou.

187
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,400
I have great news.

188
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,160
Paradise Street 19 is
about to be published

189
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
by Senka Press!

190
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm so happy!

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,480
I must

192
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,960
celebrate with you.

193
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,080
Great.

194
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,400
However,

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,400
I might have to go home late by tonight.

196
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,320
I see.

197
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,720
Well,

198
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,080
see you tonight.

199
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,040
Okay.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,480
Wait.

201
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,120
He hasn't apologized to me yet.

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
Why did I call him?

203
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Zhou Jianqing,

204
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
you're lame.

205
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,600
You forgot everything when you're happy.

206
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
You're really forgetful.

207
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,040
That's all for today.

208
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Go home early to rest.

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,280
Nanzhou,

210
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,120
you can rest in the office.

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,960
You have an appointment
with Ms. Zhuang later.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,200
No.

213
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,120
I have to go home tonight.

214
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
Mr. Gu, let me give you a ride.

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,320

Don't leave me.

Gu Nanzhou.

242
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,480
Why didn't you let me know
when you came back?

243
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,800
According to Ms. Zhuang,

244
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,360
although Lejiabao agreed to
lower the compensation amount,

245
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,720
it still puts Xingyun

246
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,880
under great pressure.

247
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,040
I am afraid

248
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
some projects have to be suspended.

249
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
All projects must not be suspended

250
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,040
unless it is absolutely necessary,

251
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
especially Lake Xingling.

252
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,520
Xiaochuan,

253
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,160
check the properties under my name,

254
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,320
and sell them for cash.

255
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Let's overcome this first.

256
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,640
Mr. Gu,

257
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
based on the current situation,

258
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,800
I am afraid

259
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,600
even the house you're living now

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,640
has to be sold, too.

261
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Even so,

262
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,960
you'll still be debt-ridden.

263
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,560
Let's settle it this way first.

264
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,360
Okay.

265
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,640
(Super Species)

266
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Why did you buy so many things?

267
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm cooking something delicious for you

268
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
as a reward.

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,240
So,

270
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,520
are you no longer angry with me?

271
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
Well,

272
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,960
you have been working overtime

273
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,640
and living a hard life.

274
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,560
I am merciful

275
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,080
and magnanimous enough

276
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,280
to forgive you.

277
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,480
Qingqing,

278
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,600
can we have a discussion?

279
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,040
What is it? Say it.

280
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,920
My house

281
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,680
is a bit far from the company.

282
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,920
I plan to sell it

283
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,800
and get a new one.

284
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,240
So...

285
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,120
So we have to move out, right?

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Can you stay with Susu

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,760
for a few days?

288
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
It's just temporary.

289
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
When the new house is settled,

290
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
you'll move back immediately.

291
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,080
Nanzhou,

292
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
are you facing

293
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
a problem recently?

294
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,400
No.

295
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm just busy with
the company's projects.

296
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,760
I know you are busy

297
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,040
and under great pressure.

298
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,880
However, you can

299
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,080
share everything with me.

300
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,760
I am your girlfriend.

301
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,480
I can also relieve your burden.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,720
Thank you.

303
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,120
Qingqing.

304
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,440
Enough.

305
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,080
Don't be so sentimental.

306
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,880
Hurry home.

307
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
(Jiang Jingxuan)

308
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,880
Hello.

309
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
What is it?

310
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,360
Nanzhou,

311
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,120
I bought a small apartment

312
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,560
near the company

313
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,400
for investment before.

314
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,480
It's not occupied.

315
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
If you don't mind,

316
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
I can bring you over to have a look.

317
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,400
All right.

318
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't have the time

319
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
to find a house lately anyway.

320
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,160
Thank you.

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
Be careful.

322
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,000
These things are valuable.

323
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
-Okay.
-Handle them with care.

324
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,320
Qingqing,

325
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,360
why are you here?

326
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,480
This is supposed to be my question.

327
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
Why are you here?

328
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,040
Where is Gu Nanzhou?

329
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,720
Nanzhou

330
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
has left with the mover.

331
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
He has too much stuff at home.

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,320
We can't move it all at once.

333
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,400
Where has he gone?

334
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,880
My house.

335
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
Is he staying in your house?

336
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Didn't Nanzhou tell you

337
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,400
why he's moving to my house?

338
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
It seems that you don't know anything.

339
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Since Nanzhou is
not willing to tell you,

340
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,880
I can't tell you in detail.

341
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,400
After all, I have to respect him.

342
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
On Valentine's Day,

343
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
were you and Gu Nanzhou in a meeting?

344
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,760
Yes.

345
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,640
Why did I

346
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
hear the sound of a shower?

347
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,640
Why don't you speak?

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,880
Don't you think it's necessary

349
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
to explain to me,

350
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,120
the girlfriend of Gu Nanzhou?

351
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,480
I am into him.

352
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,400
So what?

353
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,760
I am his girlfriend.

354
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,080
However, the one

355
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
who he really needs now is me.

356
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
Ms. Zhou.

357
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,520
Take my advice.

358
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,240
Don't trouble him anymore.

359
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Compared

360
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,760
to a little girl who
only makes him upset,

361
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,760
he's in need

362
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,000
of someone who can help him.

363
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,840
Be gentle!

364
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,240
Zhou Jianqing, what are you doing?

365
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,080
I...

366
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,640
I...

367
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Are you all right?

368
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm all right, Nanzhou.

369
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
There's just a misunderstanding
between me and Qingqing.

370
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I didn't manage to clarify it

371
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,280
and she's upset.

372
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Jingxuan is here to help me to move.

373
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,640
Why did you push her?

374
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,880
You're taking her side
and criticizing me?

375
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,280
Nanzhou,

376
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,160
it was my fault.

377
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,640
I'll explain to Qingqing

378
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,400
and everything will be okay.

379
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Gu Nanzhou, tell me.

380
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,880
Why didn't you tell me

381
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,960
that you were moving to her house?

382
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,640
I'm moving to her house

383
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
because it's nearer to the company
and it's convenient.

384
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,080
Convenient?

385
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,560
Jiang Jingxuan picked up my call

386
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,880
when I called you.

387
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,960
Is it convenient?

388
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
You also spent time with her

389
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,120
on the night of Valentine's Day.

390
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
Is this convenient?

391
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
You allowed her to sit
on your passenger seat.

392
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,320
Is this convenient?

393
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,240
You didn't tell me why you moved

394
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
but you told Jiang Jingxuan instead.

395
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
Is this also convenient?

396
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,760
Zhou Jianqing!

397
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,080
Stop being unreasonable!

398
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm being unreasonable?

399
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,240
I'm being unreasonable again, right?

400
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,880
Yes.

401
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,720
She is better than me.

402
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,840
She's gentle and considerate.

403
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,760
When you need help,

404
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,400
she can help you, too,

405
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,680
unlike me.

406
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm just a little girl.

407
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
I can only kill your boredom

408
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,720
when you are bored.

409
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
Live with her then!

410
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,240
I...

411
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,600
Nanzhou,

412
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,040
Qingqing is still young and insensible.

413
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,640
She's wayward and imaginative.

414
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,240
The trivial things

415
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,880
are big deals in her opinion.

416
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,160
Why don't you

417
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,720
let her calm down for a few days?

418
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,160
It's okay.

420
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Don't hold back

421
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,120
if you want to cry

422
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,440
or it'll affect your health.

423
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,000
Susu.

424
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,920
Can my relationship

425
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,320
with Gu Nanzhou still go on?

426
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,360
Why are you saying this suddenly?

427
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,920
I planned

428
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,080
to help him today

429
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,640
and comfort him.

430
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,600
However, I couldn't hold back

431
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
and quarreled with him again.

432
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
It's Jiang Jingxuan's fault.

433
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
I didn't pull her hard at all.

434
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,320
She fell on her own.

435
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,840
For her sake, Gu Nanzhou

436
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,320
yelled at me.

437
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,280
Susu,

438
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,640
have I lost?

439
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,560
I don't know if you have lost.

440
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
However, I think

441
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
you've really changed.

442
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,120
You're becoming different

443
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
from the Zhou Jianqing I knew.

444
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,840
In the past,

445
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,320
I was carefree.

446
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
However, Gu Nanzhou

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,360
works hard

448
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,520
and sticks to his dreams.

449
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,840
He's done everything I want to do

450
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
and am unable to do.

451
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
When I am in trouble,

452
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
he always shows up.

453
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
When I am sad,

454
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
he always makes me feel better.

455
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,440
He is perfect.

456
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,320
So I always feel that
I am not good enough

457
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
and that I don't deserve him.

458
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,720
I...

459
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,280
Says who?

460
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,080
I think you are perfect, too.

461
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,040
It's different.

462
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,040
I used to think

463
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,560
that I knew Gu Nanzhou well

464
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,880
and I was perfect.

465
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,920
However, now I realize

466
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,960
that I don't understand anything at all.

467
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Refine the details
of the special effects.

468
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,480
Okay.

469
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,600
Mr. Gu,

470
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
several investors knew

471
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,760
our copyright infringement
of Lejiabao's work.

472
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
Aren't we and Lejiabao

473
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,120
negotiating?

474
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
Although they agreed to settle it,

475
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,240
the investors

476
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
are worried that it will affect

477
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Xingyun's future development.

478
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
They have expressed their
intention to withdraw investment.

479
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
The compensation
has not been settled yet.

480
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
How can they withdraw investment now?

481
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,680
Mr. Gu,

482
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,360
should we continue with
the special effects of Lake Xingling?

483
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
The special effect company
has started dunning.

484
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,200
Of course we should.

485
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,760
If we stop now,

486
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,960
Xingyun's deficit

487
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,880
will only get bigger.

488
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Don't worry about the funds.

489
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,080
I'll see to it.

490
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,840
Ms. Zhou, rest assured.

491
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,360
(Senka Press)
We will start pre-production

492
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,400
according to the schedule.

493
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Paradise Street 19

494
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,080
will be published as scheduled.

495
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,360
Thank you so much.

496
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,320
It's our job.

497
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,120
See you, Ms. Zhou.

498
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,800
Goodbye.

499
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,560
Ms. Zhou.

500
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,840
Hi.

501
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,680
I am Lu Ziming from Gu Group.

502
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,160
Ms. Zhou, don't you remember me?

503
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,760
Hi.

504
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
What's the matter?

505
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Take a look

506
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
and you'll understand.

507
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,360
I think Gu Nanzhou

508
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,640
has never told you

509
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,920
about these shares.

510
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,160
I know your brother Zhou Zixuan

511
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
has a RMB2 million debt.

512
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
If you agree,

513
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,200
we can sign a copy

514
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,520
of Gu Group's Equity Transfer Agreement
in advance.

515
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,840
The money I give you

516
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,240
can help you to pay off your debts easily.

517
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,400
Gu Nanzhou

518
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,560
has paid the debts for me.

519
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
Instead of selling
the shares to you,

520
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,280
why don't I

521
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,520
sell them directly to Gu Nanzhou?

522
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,240
He also needs the shares.

523
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,040
Instead of just RMB2 million,

524
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640
I'll offer you the market
price you deserve.

525
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,840
Also, I want to remind you

526
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,920
that Gu Nanzhou wants
to take advantage of this

527
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
and buy the 5% shares of your father

528
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,800
with only RMB2 million.

529
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,000
Think about it.

530
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
In your marriage agreement,

531
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
why is there a term that states

532
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,480
you'll use your private
property and shares

533
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,760
as collateral if you have any debt?

534
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
So your marriage is a conspiracy

535
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
to take away the shares you have
from the beginning.

536
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,560
(Xingyun Animation)

537
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,400
I'm very sorry.

538
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
It's already a concession

539
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,080
that we agreed to internal settlement.

540
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,080
The compensation amount
cannot be lowered.

541
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,000
Gu Nanzhou,

542
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,400
I want to talk to you.

543
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm having a very important meeting

544
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,920
with the investors.

545
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,080
I'll call you later.

546
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,480
Mr. Gu,

547
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
if we bring it to court,

548
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,880
it will only be worse for you.

549
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
(I've learnt of what
you've been hiding.)

550
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,840
