00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,540
(Hello Mr. Gu Theatre)

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,159
(When I'm Mr. Gu's assistant,)

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:12,840
(most of the time,)

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,560
(I'm being tortured.)

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,359
(However,)

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,040
(whenever I have a chance,)

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,799
(I will strike back.)

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,440
I was on a diet at noon.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,399
I haven't eaten yet.

11
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,719
I'm a little hungry.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,680
Thank you.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,520
Come on.

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,000
You're choking, right?

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,200
Come on, have some water.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Are you all right?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Drink more.

18
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,400
Come on, hurry up.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,119
Are you all right?

20
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,159
Are you all right?

21
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:02,599
(Though he tortures me,)

22
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,080
(when I see him giving in,)

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,959
(mentally and physically,)

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,919
(I feel greatly pleased and relaxed.)

25
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,480
(Now this is karma.)

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,800
(It backfires on him.)

(Trapped in a hole.)

57
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,039
(What am I thinking?)

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,279
If you refuse to tell,

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,800
I'll secretly use your toothbrush

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
to scrub the toilet seat!

61
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,180
(Congratulations on being nominated
in Youxun Comic Competition.)

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,079
I am selected.

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
What do you mean?

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
It's a comic competition

65
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,480
organized by Youxun.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,239
My work

67
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,839
is nominated for Excellent Work.

68
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,920
The committee wants me to publish

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
the comic online.

70
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,040
If my popularity

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
is ranked among the top 50,

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,079
I will be qualified for
the play-off selection.

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,239
Isn't it amazing?

74
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,640
When you're talking,

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
don't simply touch me.

76
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,679
I

77
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,079
just pulled you.

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
You're a girl.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't simply pull nor hug anyone.

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
You should behave yourself.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,359
This is a modern age.

82
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,399
Do you have to say this?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Why do you

84
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
touch me all the time?

85
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,480
Are you into me?

86
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,600
Gu Nanzhou,

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
give me a break.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,359
I've already told you I'm not into you.

89
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,239
Then stay away from me.

90
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,000
Remember,

91
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,679
whenever you're with me,

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,160
maintain a social distance

93
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,359
to prevent unnecessary misunderstanding.

94
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,399
Don't move.

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,959
Further.

96
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,359
Further.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,519
Gu Nanzhou!

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,959
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,320
These are the top
special effects companies

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,679
in China.

101
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,720
They have experience

102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,839
of participating in overseas projects.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
You can read up on them.

104
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,359
(Bule Ray)
I have a better option.

105
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:07,880
Bule Ray?

106
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,119
They have never cooperated

107
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,559
with any company in China.

108
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,320
A friend of mine

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,279
contacted their vice president.

110
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,559
An hour later,

111
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,959
we will have a video conference.

112
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,200
I just got my salary

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,720
and I have to use it to pay my debt.

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,799
There's RMB2 million.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,679
Must I live on air from now on?

116
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,940
(Run Errands. Expenses)

117
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:47,799
Kid,

118
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,000
why did you simply take my stuff?

119
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,720
You've got engaged with Gu Nanzhou,

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,839
yet you're making a living

121
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,679
and paying the debt.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,119
Isn't he helping you?

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,279
We're financially independent.

124
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,239
He can't even

125
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,959
solve your problems for you.

126
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,720
What's the point of you marrying him?

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,440
You're old-fashioned.

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,359
It's a modern era with modern concepts.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
There's more freedom by going dutch.

130
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,119
Don't you understand?

131
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,320
Qingqing,

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,559
no offense.

133
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,119
I used to think

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,200
you married him

135
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
because he's financially capable

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
and that he could support you
in pursuing your dream.

137
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,320
However,

138
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
look at what's happening.

139
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,600
What do you see in him?

140
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,519
What to do?

141
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Sometimes, love

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,239
can be unreasonable.

143
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,959
Just treat it as

144
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,880
I lost my mind for falling for him.

145
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,519
Zhou Jianqing!

146
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,959
What are you doing?

147
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm

148
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,440
eating the snail rice noodle.

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,959
Didn't I tell you

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,720
not to order weird food
in the middle of the night?

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,679
I'm having it in my room.

152
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
How does it concern you?

153
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,919
I can smell it.

154
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,520
Do you have a dog's nose?

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
What are you doing?

156
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,440
Also,

157
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,799
when a girl

158
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,479
is staying with a single man,

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,479
it's improper for you

160
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,320
to wear shorts like this.

161
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,679
What's wrong with wearing shorts?

162
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,840
Also, this is my room.

163
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,320
It's none of your business.

164
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,479
You're not allowed to wear it anyway.

165
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,280
It's not a pretty sight anyway.

166
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,119
You ruined the style of the house.

167
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,200
Gu Nanzhou!

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,760
Are you from the Qing dynasty?

169
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,679
It's really tasty.

170
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,479
Susu,

171
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,400
your place is still the best.

172
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,760
I can eat whatever I want here,

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,679
unlike the time I'm at
Gu Nanzhou's place.

174
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm infuriated.

175
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,719
Forget about banning me from

176
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,359
eating snail rice noodle in the house,

177
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,400
he even criticized the way
I dressed at home.

178
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,719
He's insane.

179
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,799
Susu,

180
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,799
what's wrong with you?

181
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,719
Are you unhappy?

182
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,880
Did Zhou Zixuan offend you again?

183
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,679
No, he didn't.

184
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
What's wrong with you?

185
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,440
My mother keeps arranging
for me to go on blind dates.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Blind dates?

187
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,039
You're into someone, remember?

188
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,039
Why are you going on blind dates?

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm not into anyone.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,599
You revealed it on the phone.

191
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,239
Stop denying it.

192
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,280
Tell me.

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,159
I'll give you suggestions.

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
Is he a gentle and cute guy?

195
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,000
A mature man?

196
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,679
An energetic young man?

197
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,159
Stop guessing.

198
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,280
Just eat your food.

199
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,719
I'll get cola for you.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,919
Thank you, Susu.

201
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,460
(X Little Water Celery's Weibo votes)

202
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,159
It's so troublesome.

203
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
What's troublesome?

204
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,479
(Snacks)
Isn't it convenient

205
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,400
with this reader?

206
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,760
(Positive?)

207
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,760
(Humorous?)

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,520
(Straightforward?)

209
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,359
(A warm man?)

210
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,719
I am not like any of it.

211
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Mr. Gu,

212
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,760
why don't you order it?

213
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,760
Anything will do for me.

214
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,919
Let's order crab ball broth

215
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,119
and stewed lobster,

216
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,679
as well as braised squab

217
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,599
and boiled king clams for Xuan.

218
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,919
I think these are her favorite.

219
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,039
I think

220
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,919
she's into you.

221
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,400
If you showcase

222
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,080
more of your strengths,

223
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,239
she might not be able to resist you.

224
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
How do you know she loves these?

225
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,080
She orders these all the time.

226
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,039
Does that mean she likes these?

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Just because there're certain signs,

228
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,599
you think you're right?

229
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,159
No.

230
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,280
Before you confirm anything,

231
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,000
don't simply say it.

232
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:08,919
Why don't you

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,520
order it instead?

234
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,119
You'll order it.

235
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,159
Anything will do for me.

236
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,540
(Humorous)

237
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,359
I don't know whether

238
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:29,919
the teacher is willing

239
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,520
to use the draft.

240
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,599
As your senior, I did a good job.

241
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,400
Of course the teacher
is willing to use it.

242
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,960
You're right.

243
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,520
By the way,

244
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,000
I submitted the work
to the monthly magazine.

245
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,919
It's you.

246
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,359
Why are you honking
your car's horn suddenly?

247
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,119
Get into the car.

248
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,320
It's so near.

249
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,960
Why do we need to take the car?

250
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm going to a supermarket.

251
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,599
I need someone to carry my bag.

252
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,559
She's a girl, okay?

253
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,280
How can you get her to carry your bag?

254
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,640
My interaction with her

255
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,679
has nothing to do with you.

256
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,119
I...

257
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
Why don't you go home first?

258
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
I'll call you tomorrow.

259
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll go to the supermarket now.

260
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,119
Why is he

261
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,479
with you all the time?

262
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,880
We have a lot of work to do lately.

263
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,000
He's my assistant.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,159
We need to work together.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,479
He glares at me

266
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,239
whenever he sees me.

267
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,799
Is he

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,599
into you?

269
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,919
You misunderstood.

270
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,520
He glares at you

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,119
as he thinks you're abusing me.

272
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,440
Would I abuse you?

273
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,320
You look like a man

274
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,640
who's abusing your wife now.

275
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,119
You look like a gentle-looking psycho.

276
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,719
Do you think I'm fierce?

277
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,159
It's all right.

278
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,039
I've seen worse Party A

279
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,960
than you before.

280
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,799
You're not too bad.

281
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:27,719
Why are you

282
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,039
still all smiley to me everyday?

283
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
Of course,

284
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm a professional Party B.

285
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,640
All the time,

286
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,119
no matter how Party A abuses me,

287
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,520
I still treat Party A as my first love.

288
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,239
Any demand

289
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,559
of Party A is considered reasonable.

290
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,640
(Party A.)

291
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,200
(Am I only Party A to you?)

292
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,440
You're buying so much.
Can you finish all?

293
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,880
Is this for me?

294
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,159
Thank you, Party A.

295
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,119
Party A is awesome.

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm buying it for myself.

297
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,080
It has nothing to do with you.

298
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,880
He's eccentric.

299
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you,

300
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,400
Party B.

301
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,679
Are you hungry?

302
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,719
Join me for the meal.

303
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,359
All right.

304
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,679
Why did you cook so much?

305
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
You didn't cook what you bought.

306
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,199
I couldn't stand
seeing you wasting food.

307
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
So I cooked it for you.

308
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,920
You're suddenly so nice to me.

309
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,040
Are you doing it as Party B

310
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,280
or in other capacity?

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,680
What capacity can I possibly have?

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Do you seriously think

313
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,280
I'm into you?

314
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,400
I guarantee

315
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
that I won't harbor any intention

316
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,319
beyond our professional relationship.

317
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,199
Even so,

318
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
you don't feel anything?

319
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:08,959
No.

320
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,479
Absolutely not.

321
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,680
We're both single and staying
under the same roof.

322
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,160
Have you never wondered
what can possibly happen?

323
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,199
After all,

324
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,719
you called me a lecherous man.

325
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,760
No.

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,520
Never.

327
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,520
Absolutely impossible.

328
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,079
Fine.

329
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,719
You'd better keep your promise.

330
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,119
What's wrong with you today?

331
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,520
Why did you ask me that?

332
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,680
Are you...

333
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,119
No.

334
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,040
I'll never fall for you.

335
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
You're neither gentle nor elegant.

336
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,839
You're tasteless and petty.

337
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,959
You're not meticulous nor particular.

338
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,119
There's even a generation
gap between us.

339
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,719
I almost had a heart attack due to you.

340
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,719
Am I that bad?

341
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,400
You have bad daily habits.

342
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,439
You place the mugs
and clothes everywhere.

343
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,640
You order food delivery all the time.

344
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,800
You disrupt my sleep.

345
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,719
Then my cooking must be bad.

346
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,439
Stop eating.

347
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,359
I must eat anyway.

348
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,959
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

349
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,040
Gu Nanzhou.

350
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,319
Gu Nanzhou.

351
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
(Jiang Xiaochuan)

352
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,319
Hello, Xiaochuan.

353
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,400
Where's Mr. Gu?

354
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,319
Why isn't he picking up?

355
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,119
I have no idea where he is.

356
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,520
I think he's home.

357
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,719
Check how much medicine is left

358
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
in the blue pill box by his bed.

359
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Okay.

360
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,359
There isn't any.

361
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,160
It's empty.

362
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,560
Don't tell me he finished all of it.

363
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,640
This is bad.

364
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,599
What's wrong with the medicine?

365
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,599
Did he take it wrongly?

366
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Last time he overdosed on it

367
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,400
and almost died.

368
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,640
I rushed him to a hospital

369
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,800
in midnight for gastric lavage.

370
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,599
Now

371
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,959
you have to find him no matter what.

372
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,199
Would he have fainted in the bathroom?

373
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,599
Gu Nanzhou!

374
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,040
How did you get in?

375
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,199
I'd been calling you.

376
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,839
Why didn't you answer me?

377
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,959
I was holding my breath underwater.

378
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,719
How could I hear it?

379
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,319
Just take your bath properly.

380
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,359
Why did you hold your breath?

381
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
Are you a dolphin?

382
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,079
Don't you have gender consciousness?

383
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
How could you simply barge in?

384
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:13,079
I saw that the medicine in
your pill box was finished.

385
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,119
I was worried about you.

386
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,199
You don't have to worry about me.

387
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,280
Just leave.

388
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,439
Don't turn around.

389
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:43,920
Hello.

390
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,439
How is it?

391
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,439
Hello, Xiaochuan.

392
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,280
I found him.

393
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,319
He's bathing in there.

394
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:49,959
He didn't hear me.

395
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,319
Is he mentally stable?

396
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't think so.

397
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,719
Xiaochuan,

398
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,719
what's wrong with him?

399
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,719
I think he's stressed out.

400
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,719
Lately,

401
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,199
I'm quite worried about him.

402
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,199
Why don't you find a way

403
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,800
to bring him to a psychologist?

404
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:10,959
I've been trying to convince him,

405
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,199
but he refuses to do it.

406
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,800
Did he start having

407
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,199
the psychological problems

408
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,160
after the death of his brother?

409
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,839
This

410
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
is hard to tell.

411
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,719
However, I'm at my wit's end

412
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,319
when it comes to bringing
him to a psychologist.

413
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,880
I can only count on you.

414
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,959
I...

415
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,239
Can you give me a ride?

416
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,880
I happen to be going
somewhere near Xingyun.

417
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,560
Get into the car.

418
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,839
You look sleepy.

419
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,280
Allow me to drive instead.

420
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,239
All right, we're here.

421
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:33,880
Get off the car.

422
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,780
(Du Man Psychology)

423
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,239
Why did you bring me here?

424
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,119
We're just looking around.

425
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,400
I'm not getting off.

426
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,880
Since you're already here,

427
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,839
just take a look.

428
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,280
No.

429
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,439
What are you doing?

430
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,160
-Get off the car!
-No!

431
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,680
Get off!

432
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,119
Go.

433
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,040
No!

434
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,800
Are you going or not?

435
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:13,520
No.

436
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,680
If you don't go, I'll scream.

437
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:16,719
Feel free to do so.

438
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,760
I won't go even if you do.

439
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,319
You...

440
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,560
How can you treat me that way?

441
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,040
I've been with you since
I was 18 years old.

442
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,839
You hit me everyday
throughout the years.

443
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,040
I already told you.

444
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,079
I said you had psychological issues,

445
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,199
but you denied it.

446
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,239
Who hit you?

447
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,839
You hit me.

448
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,239
Look, you're hitting me again.

449
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,640
Enough, don't go too far.

450
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,839
Are you going in or not?

451
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,359
If not, there will be a bigger crowd.

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
No.

453
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,479
I'm even pregnant with your child.

454
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Can't you

455
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,520
be a responsible father?

456
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,119
Just go to a psychologist

457
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,760
and I'll stay with you.

458
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
If not,

459
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,920
don't expect to see your son.

460
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:21,920
Are you all right?

461
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,880
What's wrong with you?

462
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,239
Get yourself checked.

463
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,839
That's right.

464
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,800
I know, right?

465
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,680
Look at me.

466
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Don't look elsewhere.

467
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,359
Focus

468
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,760
and look at me.

469
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,119
It will be all right.

470
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,119
Sorry, everyone.

471
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
It's all right, please dismiss.

472
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Please dismiss.

473
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,839
Are you all right?

474
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,239
Well,

475
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,319
please just get yourself checked.

476
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,040
Come on.

477
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,880
You know what?

478
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
Your girlfriend told me

479
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,199
to knock you out

480
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,839
if you don't cooperate with me.

481
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,680
Don't worry,

482
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I don't hit anyone.

483
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,199
However,

484
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,280
your girlfriend

485
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,439
cares about you a lot.

486
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,400
She cried on the phone

487
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,319
and asked me

488
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,520
to check on you.

489
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,520
Otherwise,

490
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,959
I wouldn't have waited until now.

491
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,560
Actually, one with a psychological issue

492
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,280
needs his or her family's

493
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,439
company and encouragement.

494
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,239
Someone around you

495
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,640
cares so much about you.

496
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
You're very lucky.

497
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,359
Look,

498
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,280
why don't we do
psychological guidance first?

499
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,800
The process might be painful,

500
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,680
but gradual exposure

501
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,040
allows systematic desensitization.

502
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
Slowly you can adapt

503
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,959
to what you fear the most.

504
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,119
Take a deep breath.

505
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Don't be nervous.

506
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,239
It may be uncomfortable at first.

507
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,280
You need time to get used to it.

508
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,760
Close your eyes.

509
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,280
Relax.

510
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,359
Follow the ray of light before you

511
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,719
and take one after another step

512
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,640
to the most familiar
place in your memory.

513
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,839
What did you see?

514
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:11,920
Xiaozhou.

515
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,760
There're too many people.
Don't simply run away.

516
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,280
Mr. Gu.

517
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,359
