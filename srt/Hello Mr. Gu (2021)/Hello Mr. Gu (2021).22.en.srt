(Zhang Yin)

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,800
Hello.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,920
What happened to you?

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
How come you sound so depressed?

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,640
I don't want to talk about it.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
Now only I realize

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,560
how difficult it is to find a job.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,560
What a coincidence.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
Do you still remember

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,440
the work opportunity
I mentioned to you last time?

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,400
The commercial illustration job
for Ceyue Cartoon?

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,160
Yes.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
I just received the news.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,360
There are characters drawn by Miyamoto

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
in the product placement this time.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,720
So,

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,960
if we are able

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,120
to get this project,

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,880
you will have a chance

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
to meet Miyamoto.

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
How is it? Doesn't it sound good?

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,080
Seriously?

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,240
Are you serious?

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
My goodness.

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,000
He is my idol.

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
I'll send you the address later.

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
You have 30 minutes.

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,240
Come over now.

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,320
Sure, I'll go over right now.

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,240
You two are indeed very outstanding.

61
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
What we need the most now

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,960
are fresh talents like you.

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
(Ceyue Cartoon)
I will be relieved

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
if the project is entrusted to you.

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,080
I hope our cooperation will go smoothly.

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
Look forward to our cooperation.

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
Look forward to our cooperation.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,560
Goodbye.

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,760
Sure. Goodbye.

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,760
That went better than I imagined.

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
It's because
they recognized the talents.

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,880
They knew you're able

73
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,760
to handle this project.

74
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
(Dear)

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:19,960
Hello.

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Where are you now?

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm at Ceyue Cartoon

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
on Huainan Street.

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
I happen to be nearby.

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
I'll pick you up.

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,680
No, thanks.

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,400
Do your work.

83
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
I'll just take the bus.

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,520
I've almost arrived.

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Picking up my girlfriend is my job.

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,640
I...

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,200
Who's calling?

88
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Who is talking?

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Nothing. There's no one here.

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
When you're here,

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
just wait for me at the car park.

92
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,600
I'll look for you.

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,160
Bye.

94
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,040
Why were you reluctant to tell him

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,120
that you're with me?

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,320
Gu Nanzhou and you
have just started dating.

97
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
Is he stopping you from
meeting male friends now?

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
He's too demanding.

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,400
No.

100
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
That's not it.

101
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't you think he's a control freak?

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
If you don't listen to
him in the future,

103
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,880
is he going to lock you up at home?

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
Have you ever thought about that?

105
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
You got the wrong idea.

106
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,160
I...

107
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,440
It can't be explained in a few words.

108
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
I need to get going.

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,320
However...

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Why do you keep staring at me?

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,680
Why are you out of breath?

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
It's because you kept rushing me.

113
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
I ran all the way here.

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,040
Shortness of oxygen in the lungs

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
will cause shortness
of breath, of course.

116
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,720
Seems like you're in need of oxygen.

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
You should keep your oxygen

118
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
for yourself.

119
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,400
Let's go.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Why are you so quiet?

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
thinking about work.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,720
What is it about?

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,640
Today, I accepted a job

125
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
of Ceyue Cartoon.

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Isn't that a good thing?

127
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Zhang Yin and I accepted it together.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,000
I really couldn't turn it down.

129
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,280
You know what?

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
This advertisement

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
is going to include characters
drawn by Miyamoto.

132
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
If I accept it,

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,640
I'll be able to meet my idol.

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,200
Your idol

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
is Miyamoto?

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,480
Yes, that's right.

137
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
I started reading his manga

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
ever since I was in junior high.

139
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,840
Moreover, I've read

140
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,080
all his works so many times.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,520
I like him a lot.

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
I never imagine having a chance

143
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
to meet him in person.

144
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
If I accept this job,

145
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
my idol will be within reach.

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
Moreover, I will be able
to meet him in person

147
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,200
and interact with him.

148
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
So...

149
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Since you accepted the job,

150
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
just do it well.

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,840
Seriously?

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,200
You're really my dear boyfriend!

153
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,080
You should

154
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
keep your hug

155
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
for yourself.

156
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
For this corner,

157
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,120
I plan to make it into
a play area for children.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
In my opinion,

159
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
that doesn't suit our restaurant's

160
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
target audience, the youth.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Besides, children's area
will be quite hard to manage.

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,080
Why don't we turn this area

163
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
into an individual dining bar?

164
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
That way, not only it will save space,

165
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
it'll also allow

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,440
individual customers

167
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
to have a better dining experience.

168
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,200
That's great.

169
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,800
How about this?

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,920
Make a proposal for me.

171
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,400
No problem.

172
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Also, please take a look at this area.

173
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,000
This is also an issue.

174
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,840
Zhang Yin,

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,040
I've sent you the information.

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
Have a look at the remark.

177
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,880
Do you want to eat supper?

178
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Sure.

179
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,200
My boyfriend is the best.

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
What would you like to eat?

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,240
Qingqing,

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
there's a problem with the drawing
you sent over just now.

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Take a look at that
girl's hair accessory.

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,280
Ceyue Cartoon's person-in-charge
has told us to amend it.

185
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
Sure, I'll take a look at it right away.

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Mr. Gu.

187
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,200
What's the matter?

188
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,920
Didn't you ask me to
take documents from you?

189
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,360
Wait.

190
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,080
What's wrong, Mr. Gu?

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,800
Here's what happened.

192
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,360
I have a friend.

193
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
Please carry on.

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,560
This friend of mine

195
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
recently went steady

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,920
with a girl.

197
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,320
However...

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,160
There comes

199
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,480
a guy who's been into her.

200
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
He keeps showing up around her.

201
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
That's a good thing.

202
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
It shows that
his girlfriend is attractive.

203
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
My friend is troubled over this.

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
He agreed to give his
girlfriend personal space.

205
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
However,

206
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
seeing how the guy keeps contacting her,

207
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
I am simply worried.

208
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,240
It's simple.

209
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,040
Tell that rascal

210
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
to stop contacting
your friend's girlfriend.

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,880
Then it'll be solved.

212
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,240
That won't do.

213
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,640
They have to communicate about work.

214
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Mr. Gu,

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
you're worrying too much.

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
We also have female colleagues here.

217
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,680
What if he uses work as an excuse

218
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,760
to court her?

219
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,400
Since last night,

220
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,360
he has been calling her
to talk about work

221
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,000
and telling jokes whenever
there's an opportunity.

222
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
Is that what one should say at work?

223
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
It's impossible to guard against him.

224
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Does your friend think

225
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,000
that rascal

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
is a more suitable candidate
to be her boyfriend?

227
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Of course not.

228
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,640
However, this guy

229
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
is at a similar age to her.

230
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
They have similar interests.

231
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
She even said online

232
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,680
that she's into

233
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,000
this type of guys.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
Besides, she's all about
physical appearance.

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,120
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

236
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,160
You're more outstanding than him.

237
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,840
Xingyun is full of problems now.

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,280
All the properties under my name

240
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
have almost been sold.

241
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,680
At this rate, we'll be debt-ridden soon.

242
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,560
I mean my friend.

243
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,680
That's right, your friend.

244
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,000
Your friend.

245
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
This friend of yours

246
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
is just paranoid.

247
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
Actually, it's not a serious issue.

248
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,120
He

249
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
overcomplicated the issue.

250
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
If you are still worried,

251
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,560
just take an initiative

252
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,560
and let her fall for you completely.

253
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,320
That way,

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,520
you won't have to worry that
someone else will snatch her away.

255
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,400
Trust me.

256
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,840
(Ceyue Cartoon)

257
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
This is Ms. Zhou Jianqing.

258
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
This is Ms. Zhou Jianqing.

259
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
This is Mr. Zhang Yin.

260
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,640
This is Mr. Zhang Yin.

261
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
This is Mr. Miyamoto.

262
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,880
Greetings.

263
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm...

264
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,520
I'm...

265
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,240
Hi.

266
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Hi.

267
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Greetings.

268
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Hi.

269
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,040
Did I perform badly just now?

270
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,880
I couldn't even speak properly.

271
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,440
My idol must be thinking that I'm crazy.

272
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
Don't worry.

273
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,120
You performed quite well just now.

274
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,120
Seriously?

275
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,160
Ms. Zhou, please wait.

276
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Is there anything else?

277
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
Mr. Miyamoto wishes

278
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,840
to invite you two

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
for dinner.

280
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,640
Seriously?

281
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
Am I dreaming?

282
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,840
This way, please.

283
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
(I'll be back late tonight.)

284
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,960
(I am not dining at home.)

285
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,560
(Miyamoto)
Mr. Miyamoto said

286
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,160
he'd like to give this portrait

287
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
to Ms. Zhou Jianqing.

288
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Thank you, Mr. Miyamoto. Thank you.

289
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I'll surely do my best.

290
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,000
For my idol,

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
I'll go all out.

292
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,600
Mr. Miyamoto said

293
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
he's very glad to have met you two.

294
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,680
Zhang,

295
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
send Zhou home later.

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,800
It's late.

297
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
It isn't safe for a girl
to go home alone.

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,280
I understand. Don't worry.

299
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,840
Goodbye.

300
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,400
Bye.

301
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
-Goodbye.
-See you.

302
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Let's go, I'll send you home.

303
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,240
It's all right.

304
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,400
I'll go back on my own.

305
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,000
What's wrong?

306
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,000
You won't even listen to your idol now?

307
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay.

308
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,080
You're still feeling excited about
meeting your idol, aren't you?

309
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,520
Of course. This feeling
will last for at least a month.

310
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,200
It's like a dream.

311
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
Everything that happened just now

312
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
is like a dream.

313
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,160
I got his autograph

314
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,440
and even had dinner with him.

315
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
I have no regrets now!

316
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,040
Are you sure?

317
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,600
You're easily pleased.

318
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,080
You...

319
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,840
Don't move.

320
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,720
What is it?

321
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
Nothing. Let's go.

322
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
You haven't slept yet?

323
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,280
Where were you just now?

324
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,320
I told you

325
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,120
I was having dinner with my idol.

326
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,880
The one I told you,

327
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Miyamoto.

328
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,920
Not only I had dinner with him,

329
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,520
I also got

330
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,640
his autograph.

331
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,440
(Miyamoto)
Look.

332
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,520
I saw it.

333
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,720
Did you come back with Zhang Yin?

334
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,640
He said

335
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,600
it's late.

336
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
So he sent me home.

337
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,520
You two seemed happy on your way back.

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
You were laughing while talking.

339
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
What's wrong?

340
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
Are you jealous?

341
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
Have you forgotten what you promised me?

342
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,640
Well, we're working on
the same project now.

343
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,000
Besides,

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
I've already explained to you.

345
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,520
We're just good friends.

346
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,160
Good friends?

347
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,120
You're the only one who thinks that way.

348
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,800
Why do you keep finding fault with him?

349
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,360
He and I have known
each other for years.

350
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
I can't possibly sever ties with him

351
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,640
just because I'm dating you, right?

352
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,320
Fine.

353
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,520
Let me ask you.

354
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,640
What kind of male friends

355
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,160
would touch your hair near your house
in the middle of the night?

356
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,720
He was getting

357
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
something off my hair.

358
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,360
If that's how you two

359
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,280
interact with each other,

360
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,480
then, from now on,

361
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
I forbid you from meeting him!

362
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,880
Can you stop

363
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
being unreasonable?

364
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
In order to respect your feelings,

365
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,160
I've even become very cautious

366
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
when I'm working with him.

367
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
He even thinks

368
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,360
you're like a control freak.

369
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,600
He thinks?

370
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,200
So, you believe everything he says?

371
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,720
The way you're acting now

372
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
is like a control freak.

373
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I spent the entire night

374
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
cooking dinner for you.

375
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,680
You ended up having dinner with him

376
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,800
and he sent you home afterwards.

377
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,680
You have a boyfriend.

378
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,480
Can you be more conscious of that?

379
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm your girlfriend,

380
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,400
but I'm not your personal belonging!

381
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,880
Zhou Jianqing!

382
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,440
You shouldn't forget that

383
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,160
you're the one who said
you belonged to me alone.

384
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,320
Gu Nanzhou!

385
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,280
You dirtied my portrait!

386
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm talking about you and Zhang Yin now.

387
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
Don't use the portrait as an excuse.

388
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm telling you.

389
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,120
This portrait is very important to me.

390
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Zhang Yin is also
an important friend of mine.

391
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
I can't possibly discard
all that's important to me

392
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
just because I'm dating you!

393
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Are you admitting that

394
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,280
Zhang Yin matters a lot to you?

395
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
I don't wish to argue with you.

396
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,600
I'll leave now, okay?

397
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,720
Where are you going?

398
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
It has nothing to do with you.

399
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,120
Where I'm going

400
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,240
has nothing to do with you.

401
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
Can you calm down for a second?

402
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,160
I can easily obtain

403
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,840
this kind of portrait

404
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,720
for you.

405
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't run away over such a small issue.

406
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,160
You think this is a small issue?

407
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
That means you have never

408
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
considered my feelings before!

409
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,200
Xia.

410
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,080
Pass me the cocoa powder.

411
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,320
Cocoa powder?

412
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,560
Here you go.

413
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,960
Why do you

414
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,360
keep looking at me?

415
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,760
I didn't know

416
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,080
you could make tiramisu.

417
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,680
Do you know

418
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
what "tiramisu" means?

419
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,280
I think it's

420
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,840
"bring me with you".

421
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,560
You know quite a lot.

422
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
Xuan,

423
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,480
you...

424
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,680
Xia,

425
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,720
from now on,

426
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
I'll entrust myself to you.

427
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
You can bring me

428
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
anywhere you want.

429
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,240
Then,

430
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll put you in my heart,

431
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
cover it up tightly

432
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
and never let you out.

433
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
Who is it? It's late at night.

434
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,280
(Qingqing)

435
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,960
Hello, Qingqing.

436
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,040
Hello, Susu.

437
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,200
What are you doing?

438
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm at your door now.

439
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,480
Open the door for me.

440
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,960
Then I'll...

441
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
I'll go over and open
the door for you right away.

442
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,040
It's Qingqing.

443
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,960
Xuan,

444
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
hide first.

445
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm not hiding.

446
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
Xuan.

447
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Xuan,

448
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,720
please.

449
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
-Please hide.
-Okay.

450
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,680
Xuan.

451
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,520
Susu,

452
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,160
what took you so long?

453
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Be honest with me.

454
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
Is someone hiding here?

455
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,920
No.

456
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,080
No?

457
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,040
Let's see.

458
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,840
Are you making dessert?

459
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,560
I am just practicing.

460
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,160
You're practicing?

461
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
You're even making tiramisu.

462
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,200
There's more to it, Susu.

463
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,960
Didn't you tell me last time

464
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,360
that you're dating that guy?

465
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,360
Who exactly is it?

466
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
Tell me.

467
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Is that hipster photography major?

468
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,240
I saw him last time. You two
are really compatible.

469
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,360
Don't talk nonsense.

470
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,840
We aren't compatible at all.

471
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
Actually,

472
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,600
I...

473
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,920
My boyfriend

474
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,800
is very considerate

475
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
and gentlemanly.

476
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,160
Moreover, he's ambitious and determined.

477
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
He is also hardworking.

478
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Be honest.

479
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,440
Which stage are you in now?

480
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,040
We only started dating.

481
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
We just get started.

482
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,840
Then we'll have to study it thoroughly.

483
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,960
Anyway, here is a piece of advice.

484
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,600
Remember.

485
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,200
Just look for someone who is
the exact opposite of my brother.

486
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
It won't go wrong.

487
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,160
Well,

488
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,920
actually, I think your
brother is quite good.

489
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,440
He's not that bad.

490
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,760
What's wrong with you?

491
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,360
I thought you hate him.

492
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,600
Since when did I hate your brother?

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
You said so.

494
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,160
You said he's never serious.

495
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,040
You said he's bad as he
loves teasing others.

496
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Let's not talk about me.

497
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,320
Why are you here late at night?

498
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,560
I ran away from home.

499
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I have no place to stay.

500
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,480
So I'll stay overnight at your place.

501
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
What happened?

502
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,280
Gu Nanzhou is crazy.

503
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,520
He

504
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,200
is the pettiest person I know.

505
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,000
He thinks something is going on
between me and Zhang Yin.

506
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,840
What a joke.

507
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,560
If something was really going on
between me and Zhang Yin,

508
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,640
I wouldn't have been seeing him.

509
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,640
He...

510
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
He probably cares about you too much.

511
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,200
I think

512
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,120
you two need to communicate properly.

513
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,280
The sooner, the better.

514
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,080
Why don't you do it now?

515
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,360
He cares about me?

516
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,840
There's not the right way to do it.

517
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm not communicating with him.

518
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,920
Think of it this way.

519
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,680
A person like him

520
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,400
took the initiative to confess
his feelings to you.

521
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
It's not easy for him to do so.

522
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,800
Actually,

523
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,640
I am the one who took the initiative.

524
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,400
You did?

525
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,680
Didn't you say

526
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,080
he was the one who
confessed his feelings?

527
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,480
I...

528
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm a girl after all.

529
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,560
I have to save face.

530
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,480
I just couldn't hold back my feelings.

531
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,960
So...

532
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,000
So?

533
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,840
So,

534
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
I did it.

535
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,760
You...

536
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,840
What's the sound?

537
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
I accidentally kicked
the table just now.

538
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,960
Let's go to my room and tell
me exactly what happened

539
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,960
between you and Gu Nanzhou.

540
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,120
What is going on exactly?

541
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,920
You're already furious.

542
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,080
Didn't he try to stop you at all?

543
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
Seriously.

544
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760
(Where are you now?)

545
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,080
(Where are you?)

546
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,680
(When are you coming back?)

547
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
(Do you want me to pick you up?)

548
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,120
Mr. Gu,

549
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,920
here's your coffee.

550
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,400
Mr. Gu,

551
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,480
what's troubling you?

552
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Recently, you're only troubled

553
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,720
by Xingyun

554
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,920
and that friend of yours.

555
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,480
How is he recently?

556
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,920
Is he having a relationship issue?

557
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,200
My friend

558
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,000
recently quarreled with his girlfriend.

559
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,320
His girlfriend got angry

560
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,160
and ran away from home.

561
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
You even made Zhou Jianqing...

562
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,360
Why did your friend and his girlfriend

563
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,800
quarrel?

564
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,680
She finally left?

565
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
I told you

566
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,160
there's no need to hide last night,

567
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,400
but you insisted.

568
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,600
It's not necessary.

569
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,480
Qingqing has warned me many times

570
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
not to fall for you.

571
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,000
If she knew,

572
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,560
she'd surely be mad.

573
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
You're afraid that she'd get mad,

574
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
but what about me?

575
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm sorry.

576
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh, right.

577
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
We need to talk.

578
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
What's with

579
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,880
the boy from the photography class?

580
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,480
Also,

581
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,120
what do you dislike about me?

582
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
You have to be honest

583
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,960
and tell me.

584
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,560
Xuan,

585
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,720
you must be hungry.

586
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll make breakfast for you.

587
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,520
Xia!

588
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,360
Come here!

589
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,440
You're obviously suspecting her

590
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
without evidence.

591
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,960
Moreover, you dirtied

592
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,080
her idol's manuscript and autograph.

593
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,320
It's intolerable.

594
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,560
It's just an autograph.

595
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,120
I'll think of a way

596
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
to get another one for her.

597
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,960
Mr. Gu,

598
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
the production department's new intern

599
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,280
poured coffee

600
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,720
on the original drawing
of Lake Xingling.

601
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,800
Does he wish to get fired?

602
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,080
Mr. Gu,

603
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
calm down.

604
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,600
Do you understand

605
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
why

606
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,160
she's angry now?

607
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
What should I do?

608
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,320
She said she wanted to be alone.

609
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Let her be.

610
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
When she comes back,

611
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,960
perhaps everything will be fine.

612
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,440
What if she doesn't come back?

613
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Then you'll have to show your sincerity

614
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,760
and apologize properly.

615
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,000
Think about what she likes.

616
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Red packet.

617
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,040
You're a couple.

618
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,920
Red packet is too corny.

619
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,760
What should I give her as a gift?

620
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,680
Chocolate.

621
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,840
Chocolate?

622
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,280
According to scientific research,

623
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
ingesting chocolate produces endorphin.

624
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
A person feels better once
he or she eats chocolate.

625
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,440
Moreover, chocolate

626
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,040
is the designated gift
for Valentine's Day.

627
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,760
It's very romantic

628
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,240
as a gift of apology.

629
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,080
Trust me.

630
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,040
It won't go wrong.

(Chocolate)

632
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,560
What if she doesn't like

633
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
the flavor I choose?

634
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,600
If I choose for her,

635
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
she'll think I'm overbearing.

at this version that
I'm sending you now.

Comparing it to the previous
one, which is better?

645
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,240
Qingqing?

646
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,960
What did you say?

647
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,160
