=Episode 10=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,251
(There's no turning
back once it starts.)

31
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,000
Now I remember.

32
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,480
I think I accidentally

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
treated it as trash

34
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,440
and threw it into the trash can.

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,919
When I was cleaning up in the morning,

36
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,000
I placed the trash outside.

37
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,319
It's taken away.

38
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,839
Zhou Jianqing!

39
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,919
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,599
I'll just buy you another one.

41
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,519
Ten.

42
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,240
Do you think you can compensate me?

43
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,039
Is it branded?

44
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,080
It's just a Rubik's Cube.

45
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,919
Will it cost a fortune?

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,679
I think I could afford it.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,440
How many times have I told you

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,360
not to touch my stuff?

49
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,800
If you can't do this,

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
just move out!

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,559
Get off her!

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,320
How can you treat her that way?

53
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,240
She's your fiancée.

54
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,880
What does my relationship
with my fiancée

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,679
have to do with you?

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,520
Do you think

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,880
you can mistreat her

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,399
just because you're her fiancé?

59
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,360
What makes you think

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,479
you can speak to me

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
like that?

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm her friend

63
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,119
who doesn't want to
see her getting hurt.

64
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,320
I shall not talk to you.

65
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,160
This is my house.

66
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:58,919
Please leave!

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,639
Qingqing, let's go.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Zhang Yin,

69
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,720
I think this is a misunderstanding.

70
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,119
Mr. Gu.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,399
At 9.30am,

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,679
we have a meeting with Bule Ray.

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
What's wrong with you and Mr. Gu?

74
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,039
Why did he lose his temper

75
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,919
early in the morning?

76
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,679
How would I know?

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
I just lost his Rubik's Cube.

78
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,080
He suddenly

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,199
entered the aggressive mode.

80
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,080
Rubik's Cube?

81
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,119
The one in his house?

82
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,759
What's special about it?

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Is it a limited edition

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
or a branded one?

85
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,399
You messed up. Big time.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's the matter?

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
You're scaring me.

88
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,960
Is it really that expensive?

89
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,160
It's not about the price.

90
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,039
That's his late brother's belonging.

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,279
His brother passed away
more than a decade ago.

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Mr. Gu is reluctant to mention it.

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,399
I know that

94
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,880
all psychological issues of Mr. Gu

95
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
were caused by his brother's death.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,079
So the Rubik's Cube
matters a lot to him.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,679
Has he been treating you this way?

98
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,160
No,

99
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,440
he's rather gentle to me normally.

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,239
He treats me well.

101
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,600
Stop brushing me off.

102
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,959
He shouted at you

103
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,920
over a trivial matter.

104
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I really don't think

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,839
he treats you well.

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,079
You worry too much.

107
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:44,600
Look at me.

108
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,600
Do I look like a pushover?

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
When he shouted at you,

110
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,079
you were so scared

111
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,079
that you're speechless.

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,160
I wasn't in my top form.

113
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,239
Don't worry.

114
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,119
Our relationship is not as you imagine.

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
I've seen

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,760
how he treats you.

117
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,359
Of course I'm worried.

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,239
If he doesn't

119
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,079
cherish you,

120
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,440
you should leave him.

121
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,000
Got it.

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,440
Zhang Yin,

123
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,200
you might have

124
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,600
to make a trip to
the office for me today.

125
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,519
Do you remember the actual amendment?

126
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,119
Please pass the message to the boss.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Please.

128
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
I'll treat you to a meal.

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,519
Young lady,

130
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,760
why are you messing

131
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,959
with the rubbish?

132
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,399
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,559
I'm looking for something.

134
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,320
What's so important?

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,399
I'm so sorry.

136
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,239
I'll put these back

137
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:52,359
once I find it.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,320
All right.

139
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Do it for me later.

140
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Sure.

141
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,440
How was it?

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,119
Did it go well?

143
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,720
Is the boss happy

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,559
with our amendment?

145
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,679
Seriously?

146
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,519
Do we have to stick to the old style?

147
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,920
How to draw

148
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,279
that kind of illogical plot?

149
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,559
The boss said

150
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,320
your amendment

151
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
was well-received among the readers.

152
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,119
We can do as you say.

153
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:56,720
Seriously?

154
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,679
Brat,

155
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,600
you're bad.

156
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,839
You were scaring me.

157
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,279
It's great

158
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,399
that we can amend the plot now.

159
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,839
Do you think we're becoming

160
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,519
true cartoonists?

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,200
Wait.

162
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,040
No, thanks.

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll do it myself.

164
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Don't tell me your urgent matter

165
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,119
was to rummage around the trash

166
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,399
to look for Gu Nanzhou's Rubik's Cube.

167
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,920
I lost it.

168
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,880
So I simply looked for it.

169
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,279
It's just a Rubik's Cube

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,559
and you even put aside your comic

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,880
to rummage around the trash.

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,959
Are you really scared of him?

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,279
You got the wrong idea.

174
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,359
That thing

175
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,359
is rather important to him.

176
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,160
You should be the one that
matters the most to him.

177
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,959
You're his fiancée.

178
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,480
Fine,

179
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,079
he's rather emotional today,

180
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,000
but he's usually not like that.

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,320
Stop lying to me.

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,440
I think

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,600
he's been treating you this way.

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
That's why you're scared of him.

185
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,799
Hello, boss.

186
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,480
Zhou Jianqing,

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,119
work hard this week

188
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,839
for an update.

189
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,320
Another update?

190
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,920
This is requested by
the website's editor.

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,920
If you update it,

192
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,440
then only we can
recommend you this week.

193
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,279
This is the perfect opportunity.

194
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,040
All right.

195
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Another update, right?

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,119
I'll stay up with you.

197
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Can you do it?

198
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
You didn't sleep well last night.

199
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,280
You, too.

200
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm your right-hand man.

201
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
Without me,

202
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,760
can you possibly finish it tonight?

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,840
Junior,

204
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,880
you're a great friend.

205
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,799
Let's go.

206
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,599
I didn't expect

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,799
to secure the deal with Bule Ray.

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Mr. Gu,

209
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,760
I'm impressed.

210
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,520
I think it's considered

211
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,919
a milestone for local anime and manga.

212
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,960
It's all thanks to Yingqi's support.

213
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,799
That's why the cooperation went so well.

214
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,679
Should we

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,440
thank Zhou Jianqing, too?

216
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Cancel all internal meetings

217
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
in the afternoon.

218
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,400
I need to go home.

219
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,359
All right.

220
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Property management, right?

221
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,640
Sorry,

222
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,200
I'm the one who asked you

223
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,640
to keep the trash this morning.

224
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,440
Do you mean the Rubik's Cube?

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,719
A girl

226
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,799
found it for you.

227
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,640
She found it?

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,760
That's right.

229
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,320
She did it early in the morning.

230
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,679
She's been

231
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,000
rummaging in the trash

232
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,640
and getting herself all dirty.

233
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,080
She said

234
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,359
it mattered a lot to her.

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,039
She went all out

236
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,159
just to find it.

237
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,599
Thank you.

238
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,559
You're welcome.

239
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,840
(I found the Rubik's Cube.)

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,760
(I didn't know)

241
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,159
(it mattered a lot to you.)

242
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,559
(I'm really sorry.)

243
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,000
Why don't you eat something first?

244
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,159
I'm not in the mood.

245
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,840
How many line drafts do we need to draw?

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,679
There're

247
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
four to go.

248
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,280
It'll drain me of energy.

249
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
Drink some milk

250
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
to replenish your energy.

251
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,760
Forget it, I'm not drinking it.

252
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Let's just draw.

253
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,559
Drink some.

254
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Thank you.

255
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,660
(Dear)

256
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,640
Is Gu Nanzhou

257
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
rushing you to go home?

258
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,559
I'm not done yet.

259
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,520
Forget about going home.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Why don't you stay

261
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,559
in a motel near the campus?

262
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
It might be dangerous
for you to go home late.

263
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,719
Well,

264
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,080
let's talk about it after we're done.

265
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,599
Is she

266
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,760
mad at me?

267
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:44,760
(Where are you?)

268
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,119
(Why aren't you back yet?)

Mr. Gu, you're unbelievable.

00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,679
You aren't sleeping well,

294
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,479
yet you're being romantic
with Zhou Jianqing.

295
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,640
What do you mean?

296
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,799
Our colleagues saw it.

297
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,200
Zhou Jianqing

298
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,440
posted a photo of you two

299
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,599
watching sunrise together.

300
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,520
I didn't expect
a rational person like you

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,640
to fall in love.

302
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,679
Did I watch sunrise with her?

303
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,080
The contract is here.

304
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,960
Take your time.

305
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,760
(She didn't come home.)

306
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,479
(So she's turned to Zhang Yin.)

307
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,080
I suddenly realize a problem.

308
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,559
Qingqing is following us on Weibo.

309
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,440
Does that mean Mr. Gu

310
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
can trace us

311
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,479
from there?

312
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,080
That's right.

313
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,239
Mr. Gu is scheming.

314
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,039
He can almost be a spy.

315
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't you think

316
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,280
something is fishy
about their relationship?

317
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,679
At first, they pretended
not to know each other.

318
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,599
After they got together,

319
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,719
they looked distant.

320
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,400
I think so.

321
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,799
However,

322
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,719
Qingqing looked convincing

323
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,840
when she's mocking him behind his back.

324
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,440
-Mr. Gu.
-Mr. Gu.

325
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,160
You're not allowed to mention

326
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,680
Zhou Jianqing any more in Xingyun.

327
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,800
Yes.

328
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,359
It's embarrassing.

329
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,000
The money for our hard work
is banked in.

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,880
I'll transfer it to you later.

331
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,239
Buy a sandwich with extra ingredients.

332
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,160
I'll treat you to a fine meal today.

333
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Keep it.

334
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,920
You don't have to pay me

335
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
for being your assistant this month.

336
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,560
Do you

337
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,680
want to quit being my assistant again?

338
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
I never said that.

339
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,680
Why didn't you take it?

340
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
It's what you deserve.

341
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
Just keep it.

342
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,400
One day,

343
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,640
if you feel like leaving Gu Nanzhou,

344
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
with the savings,

345
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,959
you won't feel burdened.

346
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,479
Why are you bringing this up again?

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,479
I told you it's a misunderstanding.

348
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,959
Actually he treats me quite well.

349
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,079
I've seen

350
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,479
how he treats you.

351
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,800
You don't have to defend him.

352
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
You're exaggerating.

353
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,839
You've misunderstood.

354
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,079
Fine, just keep it.

355
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,359
Fine.

356
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll return it to you next month.

357
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,880
I'll treat you as another creditor then.

358
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,640
Creditor?

359
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,040
Nothing.

360
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,280
Let's talk about it later.

361
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,520
(I'm returning to you this
amount of money this month.)

362
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,160
(There's an additional RMB500.)

363
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,319
(Please accept it, boss.)

364
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,160
An additional RMB500?

365
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,880
What is it for?

366
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,479
She wants to leave me
as soon as possible, right?

367
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
(At your current rate of
paying off the debt,)

368
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,199
(you need 75.8 years)

369
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
(to settle the debt.)

370
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,599
(Please speed up your
process of making money)

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,680
(to clear it while you live.)

372
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:06,959
Qingqing,

373
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,719
be frank to me.

374
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,000
Are you really happy

375
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,079
when you're with Gu Nanzhou?

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,959
Are you sure

377
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,239
Gu Nanzhou is your Mr. Right?

378
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,520
Stop talking.

379
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:36,880
Follow me.

380
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,439
What's going on?

381
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,520
Hurry up.

382
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,119
Someone is looking for you.

383
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,719
Who is it?

384
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,119
Xuan.

385
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,839
Get back to work.

386
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,479
I'll make a move first.

387
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,079
Why are you here again?

388
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,959
I happened to pass by.

389
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,319
I saw you skipping your meal earlier on.

390
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,680
So I brought you food.

391
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,359
I've accepted it.

392
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,719
Go back.

393
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Don't ever come again.

394
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,599
I happen to have my color lesson

395
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,280
nearby.

396
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,079
I...

397
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,000
Xuan.

398
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm really sorry.

399
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,359
Why didn't you watch out

400
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,479
when you're pushing it?

401
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,359
Xuan, I'm sorry.

402
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:14,959
I'm so sorry.

403
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,280
The stuff was piled up high.

404
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,160
I really didn't see her.

405
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,040
Thank you for chasing

406
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,359
the rogues away today.

407
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,199
You're home.

408
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,439
I...

409
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,860
(Qingqing)

410
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,000
Hello, Qingqing.

411
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,079
Susu,

412
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,119
good job.

413
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,599
my brother has not
bothered me for a long time.

414
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,839
My salary is in.

415
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,800
I want to treat you and Zhang Yin
to a meal this weekend.

416
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,119
Pick a venue.

417
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,119
All right.

418
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,119
What's wrong with you?

419
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,640
Why do you sound

420
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
down?

421
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,000
Qingqing,

422
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,359
I...

423
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,839
I think I'm in love with someone.

424
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Who are you in love with?

425
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,959
A really nice man.

426
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:18,199
He's kind-hearted and gentle.

427
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,280
He's considerate, too.

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Who exactly is he?

429
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
Since he's a great guy,

430
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,319
what are you waiting for?

431
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,959
Just pursue him.

432
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,560
He's not into me at all.

433
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,719
We're not compatible at all.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,680
Forget about that,

435
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,359
as long as you're into him.

436
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,560
Susu,

437
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,119
have you heard of this?

438
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,079
In life, one will meet

439
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,119
29 million people.

440
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,599
The possibility of true love

441
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,319
is only three in one billion.

442
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,839
You're considered lucky

443
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,359
to have fallen for someone.

444
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,199
Good luck and work hard. Don't be timid.

445
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,839
Will you support me?

446
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,599
Of course I will.

447
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,280
You're my best friend.

448
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,439
It doesn't matter whether you're

449
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,520
pursuing a prince or a celebrity,

450
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,599
I'll support you.

451
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,319
Who is he?

452
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,199
Just tell me.

453
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:24,959
I

454
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,959
will tell you next time.

455
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,359
All right.

456
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,119
(Why aren't you home yet at this hour?)

457
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,719
(What if you bump into bad people?)

458
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,439
(You found the Rubik's Cube.)

459
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
(I shall let it slide.)

460
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,040
(I was rather)

461
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,760
(harsh that day.)

462
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,319
(Please don't take it to heart.)

463
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,599
(Is it because she's in love with me?)

464
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,239
(Is that why she
doesn't want to return?)

465
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,160
(If you're really in love with me,)

466
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,839
(we can terminate the agreement)

467
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,479
(and try to get together for real.)

468
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,239
You're back.

469
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
I've been back for long.

470
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,119
Do you want to have noodles?

471
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll cook for you.

472
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,400
I texted you.

473
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:23,839
Did you read it?

474
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,400
You did?

475
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,880
My phone is in the bedroom.

476
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,599
I didn't see it.

477
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,920
Also,

478
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,680
I was harsh that time.

479
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,959
You're mad and you left home.

480
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,400
It's understandable.

481
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,280
Did I ever leave home?

482
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
Let's not talk about that.

483
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,839
However, I must

484
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,839
make another thing clear.

485
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I know you're into me.

486
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,520
That's why you're having it tough

487
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,439
around me these days.

488
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,079
Actually I can...

489
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:02,560
Wait.

490
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Since when am I in love with you?

491
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,599
Aren't you?

492
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
Why do you steal glances
at me all the time?

493
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,560
I did that

494
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:18,680
to tip our colleagues off.

495
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,520
Why did you peel the prawns?

496
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,079
It's because

497
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,719
I worked as that.

498
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,040
It's an occupational habit.

499
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
What makes you think I'm into you?

500
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,199
It's impossible between us.

501
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,040
Good.

502
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,920
(If you're really in love with me,)

503
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,953
(we can terminate the contract)

504
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
(and try to get together for real.)

505
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:12,920
Password.

506
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,160
Birthday.

507
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,760
Don't tell me it's 888888?

508
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,640
Gu Nanzhou!

509
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,959
What are you doing?

510
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,800
Nothing.

511
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,599
Return my phone to me.

512
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:35,839
No.

513
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,280
Return my phone to me!

514
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,760
No.

515
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,479

Why did you secretly access my phone?

551
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,319
You even deleted my text.

552
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,040
Don't you know

553
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,599
this is invasion of privacy?

554
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,359
I can compensate you
according to the contract.

555
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,319
What did you delete?

556
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
I saw it.

557
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,880
It's a text from you.

558
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,160
Tell me.

559
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,560
What did you delete?

560
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:38,959
Just treat it as I didn't send it.

561
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,439
The text you sent me is considered mine.

562
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,599
Secretly accessing my phone

563
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,359
is akin to using my toothbrush
without my permission.

564
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,920
If you refuse to tell,

565
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,560
I'll secretly use your toothbrush

566
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,079
to scrub the toilet seat!

567
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,479
You...

568
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,400
I

569
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,000
accidentally sent
Xingyun's trade secret.

570
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,599
If you claimed

571
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,359
that it's Gu Group's trade secret,

572
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,239
I might buy it.

573
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,119
What secret could Xingyun possibly have?

574
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,839
I told you it's a secret.

575
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,079
Of course I can't tell you.

576
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,599
As an acting assistant, I even know

577
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,800
the details of the collaboration

578
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,640
between Xingyun and Yingqi.

579
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,920
Look at your so-called security.

580
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,000
What secret could you possibly have

581
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
that you had to go to the trouble

582
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,079
to delete it in the middle of the night?

583
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,719
I know.

584
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,719
Did you access prohibited stuff

585
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,839
in the middle of the night

586
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,359
and accidentally

587
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
send it to me?

588
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,680
No.

589
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,839
Stop talking nonsense.

590
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Look,

591
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,719
you're blushing.

592
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:51,880
Stop denying.

593
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,319
I didn't expect

594
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,040
the prim and proper Mr. Gu

595
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,959
to be so lecherous.

596
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,520
Stop it!

597
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,800
It's all right, Mr. Gu.

598
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Although your image

599
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,439
no longer works for me,

600
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,520
don't worry,

601
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,760
I'm a professional Party B.

602
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,119
As long as you
compensate me accordingly,

603
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,359
I'll keep it a secret.
