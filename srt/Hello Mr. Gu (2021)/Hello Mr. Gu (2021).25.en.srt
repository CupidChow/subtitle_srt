00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,600
(Little Devil)

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,160
By the way,

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm very curious about
something, Ms. Jiang.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,040
Do you know

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,560
why Nanzhou

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
wants to marry Zhou Jianqing?

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
It's Mr. Gu's private matter.

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
It's not convenient for me to ask him.

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
This is not a private matter.

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,920
It's a small gift from me to you.

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Over the months,

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
in order to defeat him at
the shareholder meeting,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,840
I have been acquiring
the shares of Gu Group.

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Only then I found out

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,920
Gu Licheng

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,440
gave 5% shares to a friend.

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Following this clue,

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
I finally found this.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
Now Gu Nanzhou is

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,000
already the majority shareholder
of Gu Group.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,200
If he marries the heiress
of this shareholder,

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
namely Zhou Jianqing,

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,680
they will become a family

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,400
and their combined shares
will exceed 51%.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Then, I won't get to

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,520
call the shots in Gu Group.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,400
Mr. Lu,

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,720
let's be frank.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I want

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
Gu Nanzhou and Zhou Jianqing
to break up.

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,680
They can't be together at least
before the reorganization of Gu Group.

81
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
I can tell

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
that you want

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,960
the same thing as I do.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Qingqing, you are here.

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
Is Mr. Gu here?

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
(Xingyun Animation)
I think he's still in a meeting.

87
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Why don't you go to his office

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,760
and wait for him there?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,480
Sure.

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,520
Qingqing.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Are you here for Nanzhou again?

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Nanzhou is in a meeting now.

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,440
I don't know when the meeting will end.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,840
Why don't you go back first?

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,280
It's okay.

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I'll wait for him here.

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,200
Qingqing,

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,000
you should learn to
be considerate to him.

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
It's a critical moment now.

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,320
Don't disturb him

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
and affect his work.

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm just here to see him.

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm not interrupting his work.

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
It seems that you don't know
Nanzhou well enough.

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,440
He likes to keep his
emotions to himself.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's so busy now

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
yet he has to
take care of your feelings.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
He is under great pressure.

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
I am his girlfriend.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
I know what to do.

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,120
You don't have to worry about that.

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
A relationship

113
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,880
is more than just love.

114
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Our relationship

115
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,760
won't change

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,080
because of an outsider's words.

117
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
No one can be too confident

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
in a relationship.

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,800
I know everyone is
working hard recently.

120
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
The company is recruiting new people.

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Everyone, hang in there.

122
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,840
Lake Xingling

123
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
is the fruits of our labour.

124
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,320
I really don't want it

125
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,240
to be terminated.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Also,

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,960
regarding the investment

128
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
of Different Worlds,

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,440
I understand that many
may not agree with me.

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,160
However, I can't help it.

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
I founded Xingyun

132
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
for the project,

133
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,800
Lake Xingling.

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,600
Your wish of producing original work

135
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
can't be granted for the time being.

136
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
You are not famous yet.

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,640
Your proposal

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
is not about a popular subject matter.

139
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Thank you.

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,280
(Zhou Jianqing's CV)

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,560
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

143
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,640
I think

144
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,360
your idea

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,720
is not in line

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
with our company's.

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,720
Sorry, Ms. Zhou.

148
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,040
Thank you.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Mr. Gu,

150
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,400
why did you agree for Lingyun

151
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
to shorten the period of production?

152
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,960
This will place

153
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080
great pressure on us.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
Other than Lingyun,

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,160
other three investors have also
proposed the same thing.

156
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,680
They're right about certain problems.

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,920
Also, Xingyun really
can't afford the delay.

158
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,160
What about the quality of the film?

159
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,440
The quality of the film
must be guaranteed.

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,960
Recruit more people.

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,160
If we can complete

162
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,120
Lake Xingling in one go,

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
that will be good for everyone.

164
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,760
Okay.

165
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,520
Mr. Gu.

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,640
Are you here to talk
about the schedule, too?

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm here to talk to you

168
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
about acquiring some projects.

169
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
You know the current
situation of the company.

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Most of the company's capital

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,720
is invested in Lake Xingling.

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,040
We don't have extra funds

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
to acquire any other projects.

174
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,400
I watched a lot of

175
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
animations in Southeast Asia recently.

176
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,640
There is a batch

177
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,200
of works for children, which is not bad.

178
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
If we can use our channel

179
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
to launch this batch of animations,

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
Xingyun's income

181
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
will increase steadily.

182
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Okay.

183
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,120
Just do as you said.

184
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,280
You are responsible for
the information verification.

185
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Don't make any mistake.

186
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay, you can count on me.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Are you here for Zhou Jianqing?

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
She didn't come to school today.

189
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm here for you.

190
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,400
Why are you looking for me?

191
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
Are you interested in joining Xingyun

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,800
to work as an assistant
for background design?

193
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm in a hurry.

194
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
I'll make the long story short.

195
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I have seen your work.

196
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,760
You have a solid foundation
and you are talented.

197
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,000
Your style is light and dreamy.

198
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
Actually, it suits Lake Xingling.

199
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
Do you mean

200
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,400
you want me to go to your company

201
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
and work for you?

202
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
Although

203
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,680
I don't like you,

204
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
I don't deny

205
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,800
that you will be a good work partner.

206
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,240
You've stolen the one I love.

207
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Now you want to lure me
to your company

208
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,000
so that I'll work for you?

209
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
A relationship

210
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
is out of our control.

211
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,280
However, regarding work,

212
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
I hope you can think rationally.

213
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
I will pay you 30% more

214
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
than the average salary.

215
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
When Lake Xingling is finally released,

216
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,280
you will also be one
of the main creators

217
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,840
and get corresponding dividend.

218
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
In the adult world,

219
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
never lump relationship

220
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,800
and work together.

221
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
(Xingyun Cartoon Service Contract)

222
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,240
I'll wait for your reply.

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,640
(Xingyun Cartoon Service Contract)

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
(You must come back tonight.)

225
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,200
(You have to celebrate the day with me.)

226
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,440
Mr. Gu, are you leaving?

227
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
What are these?

228
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
Documents

229
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
about the recently signed agreement
and animations we've purchased.

230
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
Read them tomorrow.

231
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,000
Go home and spend time
with Qingqing today.

232
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
(Where are you?)

233
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
(I'll finish everything)

234
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
(if you don't come back.)

235
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,800
There are so many dishes.

236
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,880
How can I finish them all by myself?

237
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,280
(1962 Forest Music)

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,880
(Dear)

239
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
Hello, Qingqing.

240
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,160
What's the matter?

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,280
Where is Gu Nanzhou?

242
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,920
Nanzhou?

243
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,920
Nanzhou can't talk to you now.

244
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,200
Where

245
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,720
are you?

246
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,120
We are

247
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,920
talking about the projects.

248
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,640
Nanzhou said

249
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,320
that he was coming back
for dinner tonight.

250
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,560
Nanzhou didn't mention it to me.

251
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
Qingqing,

252
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,640
Nanzhou can't talk to you now.

253
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,480
Why don't you call him later?

254
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,800
Are you having

255
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,120
a meeting tonight?

256
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,760
Yes, Qingqing.

257
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,720
Everyone in the company

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,360
is having a meeting tonight.

259
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
We're working overtime
to rush the projects.

260
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,960
If there is nothing else,

261
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,720
I'll hang up now.

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,400
I must have heard it wrongly.

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,080
Why would there be the sound
of running water in the office?

264
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Nanzhou.

265
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
Have some chocolate

266
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
to replenish your energy.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,520
Contact this company, SL, right now.

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
We must terminate the contract

269
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
with The Legend of the Little Pig
immediately.

270
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,520
However,

271
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
we have signed a contract
with the children's channel.

272
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,160
The first episode was aired yesterday.

273
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,320
If you terminate the contract now,

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
we have to make a huge compensation.

275
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,600
We must terminate the contract.

276
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,840
There are three characters
in this animation

277
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,560
that are exactly the same

278
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
as the characters in Forest Music,

279
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,320
made by Lejiabao in 1962.

280
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,360
The main storyline

281
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,600
is completely plagiarism.

282
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
I don't think he's such a person.

283
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,240
He wouldn't do this.

284
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
It's hard to tell.

285
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
It is Valentine's Day today.

286
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,600
How can he not be with his girlfriend?

287
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,160
Why is he with Jiang Jingxuan instead?

288
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,640
He said it's just for work.

289
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
They are in a meeting.

290
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,600
Would you hear

291
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
the sound of one taking
a shower if it's a meeting?

292
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,880
Everyone in the company
is in the meeting?

293
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,360
Obviously, they are
celebrating Valentine's Day.

294
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Jiang Jingxuan must
have said it wrongly.

295
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,080
Didn't you hear her

296
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
calling him Nanzhou?

297
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,480
Would anyone else address
a colleague so intimately?

298
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
He said

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
he loves me instead of her.

300
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,480
Men are deceitful.

301
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Only fools trust them.

302
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,040
Maybe

303
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,560
he and Jiang Jingxuan

304
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,720
are doing something intimate

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,360
that only adults would do.

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,280
(Where are you?)

307
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,840
(I'll finish everything)

308
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,680
(by myself if you don't come back.)

309
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,640
(Sorry, Qingqing.)

310
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
(There was an emergency
in the office yesterday.)

311
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,160
Why should I reply to your message?

312
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
I won't even text you a word.

313
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,840
Mr. Gu,

314
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,600
to be honest,

315
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,440
the current situation
is not good.

316
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,840
I understand.

317
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Just tell the truth.

318
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,600
Based on the content,

319
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,280
we did commit copyright infringement.

320
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,640
Also, Lejiabao is very experienced

321
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
in copyright lawsuits.

322
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,320
Based on their past cases,

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
a lawsuit like this

324
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,640
requires us to pay more than
tens of millions in RMB.

325
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,440
Come here.

326
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,640
This way.

327
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,040
Come on, take a seat.

328
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,920
Take a seat.

329
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,000
Take a seat.

330
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,760
Mr. Hu,

331
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,640
is Mr. Longchuan coming today?

332
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,520
He has something on today.

333
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
He's unable to come.

334
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,600
It's Tuesday.

335
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,200
Aren't your employees working?

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
This place is just renovated.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,120
No one has moved in yet.

338
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,080
I'll come again next time.

339
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,920
I am a fan of Mr. Longchuan.

340
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I came for the job interview

341
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
in order to meet him.

342
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
What's the hurry?

343
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,440
As long as you join the company,

344
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,520
you will have many opportunities
to see him in the future.

345
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
Why are you in a rush to meet him?

346
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,080
Don't you agree?

347
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
Come on, take a seat.

348
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,080
Take a seat.

349
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,360
I have other things to do.

350
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,000
I have to go.

351
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,760
What are you doing?

352
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,160
Don't you want to take a look
at the working environment?

353
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,200
Let me go!

354
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,520
-Young girl.
-What are you up to?

355
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,080
Young girl.

356
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,800
-Let go of me!
-Listen.

357
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,640
In life,

358
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,120
You're a rogue!

359
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
you have to learn to judge a situation.

360
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,320
Go away! Let me go!

361
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,280
By doing this,

362
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,840
you'll have

363
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,280
What are you doing?

364
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,040
a smoother-sailing future.

365
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,680
Rogue!

366
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,360
I...

367
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,760
Mr. Gu,

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
four episodes of the animation
have been aired.

369
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,600
If we terminate it now,

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
we not only have to consider

371
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,680
the loss caused by temporary
change of schedule,

372
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,400
we will also offend the TV station

373
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,600
and the advertisers.

374
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,520
Hello.

375
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,600
Gu Nanzhou,

376
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,760
pick me up now.

377
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,200
I...

378
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
Qingqing, I'm busy now.

379
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
Can you take a taxi?

380
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,440
Okay.

381
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,560
Hello?

382
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,800
Hello?

383
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,280
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

384
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,280
We'll draft a termination contract
as soon as possible.

385
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,600
I'll send our legal counsel
over tomorrow

386
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,520
to tell you the details.

387
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,680
I am sorry.

388
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
The number you're dialing

389
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
cannot be reached at the moment.

390
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Please try again...

391
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,080
Nanzhou,

392
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll go back now.

393
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,480
Okay.

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,640
What happened to you?

395
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
Nothing.

396
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm just a little tired.

397
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
I'll get Xiaochuan

398
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
to take you to a hospital.

399
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm fine.

400
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,120
Go back early and get some rest then.

401
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,040
Okay.

402
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll take you to a hospital.

403
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,960
It's okay.

404
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,200
I'll take you back.

405
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,400
Stay home

406
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,160
and get some rest tomorrow.

407
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
You have worked so hard lately.

408
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
Thank you, Nanzhou.

409
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,280
Sorry to have troubled you.

410
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,200
It's okay.

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,520
Jingxuan.

412
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,320
What's the matter?

413
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,880
I feel dizzy.

414
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,960
Can you please

415
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,840
drive slowly?

416
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,640
You're going home so late.

417
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,760
Why didn't you take a taxi?

418
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
It's none of your business.

419
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,000
Are you angry?

420
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,760
Don't be angry. I will
pick you up next time.

421
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,120
Why did you hang up on me?

422
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
I was in a meeting.

423
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,160
Don't be mad.

424
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,440
I'll spend more time with you

425
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,800
after I'm done with the project, okay?

426
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,760
It's okay.

427
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,080
Anyway, you don't remember that

428
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,880
you have a girlfriend.

429
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,000
Qingqing,

430
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,120
it's cold. Get into the car.

431
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,760
Don't catch a cold.

432
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,040
I'm tired, too.

433
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,560
I want to go home and go to bed early.

434
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,960
Did Jiang Jingxuan take this seat?

435
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
She wasn't feeling well today.

436
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,320
I gave her a ride.

437
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm asking you

438
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,320
if she took the passenger seat.

439
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,080
Yes.

440
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,720
Didn't I say

441
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,760
she's not allowed to sit here?

442
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,520
Qing...

443
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Qingqing!

444
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,560
Qingqing.

445
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,120
Qingqing!

446
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,280
Listen to me.

447
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,040
It's an exception.

448
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,600
I promise it won't happen again.

449
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,680
You asked me not to contact Zhang Yin,

450
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,720
but you stay with
Jiang Jingxuan all the time.

451
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,760
What do you mean it's an exception?

452
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,280
Why do you make this sound

453
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,520
as if it's reasonable?

454
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,480
What's the reason

455
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,560
for her to sit here?

456
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,360
Stop acting up.

457
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
I haven't rested for days.

458
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,680
Yes.

459
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
I should be sensible to you.

460
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
You're tired and busy.

461
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,080
You need to attend meetings.

462
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,920
You have to make an exception.

463
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,840
What about me?

464
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Do you know that today I was almost...

465
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,680
When I needed you most,

466
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,320
where were you?

467
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,600
What am I to you?

468
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,840
Am I your pet that you
can summon anytime

469
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,360
or a pastime in your free time?

470
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,080
Don't get the wrong idea.

471
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,320
She wasn't feeling well today.

472
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,840
That's why I let her sit
on the passenger seat.

473
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
I don't want to hear this.

474
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Yes.

475
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,240
I'm insensible and naive.

476
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,080
I can't be

477
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,400
your good helper and
partner in business.

478
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
However, Gu Nanzhou, don't forget

479
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,880
that I am your girlfriend.

480
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,360
She is just your work partner!

481
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,920
Qingqing!

482
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,800
I think

483
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
I have made it clear enough.

484
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,240
Don't be unreasonable, okay?

485
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,560
You think

486
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,720
I'm being unreasonable?

487
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,880
If you think I'm being unreasonable,

488
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,720
yes, I am.

489
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,440
I'll leave,

490
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,720
okay?

491
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,160
You...

492
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,240
Coming.

493
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,320
Qingqing?

494
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
Susu.

495
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,160
What's going on?

496
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
I want to break up

497
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,640
with Gu Nanzhou. He is a jerk.

498
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
Don't cry.

499
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,480
Let's talk inside.

500
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,760
Let's talk inside.

501
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,160
What's going on?

502
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,880
Why are you crying?

503
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Don't cry.

504
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Sit down.

505
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,160
What's going on?

506
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,920
Did you quarrel again?

507
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I wish it were as simple as a quarrel.

508
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,760
You know what?

509
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,240
Gu Nanzhou has been busy recently.

510
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
He promised to give me two calls a day,

511
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,120
but he didn't. It's fine.

512
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,840
When I called, Jiang Jingxuan
picked up instead.

513
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
On Valentine's Day,

514
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,560
he was with Jiang Jingxuan.

515
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,080
I even heard the sound

516
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,000
of shower on the phone.

517
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Did you

518
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,240
hear it wrongly?

519
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,040
Would I?

520
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,920
That's impossible,

521
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
Jiang Jingxuan said

522
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
everyone in the company
was in a meeting.

523
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,840
However, I saw the posts
of Xingyun's employees

524
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
on social media.

525
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,600
They were celebrating
the festival out there.

526
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,520
That was obviously a lie.

527
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,440
Well,

528
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,560
there may be a misunderstanding.

529
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't make blind guesses, okay?

530
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,120
When I went for a job interview today,

531
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,320
I met a lecherous man.

532
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,680
I was nearly molested.

533
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,920
I asked Gu Nanzhou to pick me up,

534
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,680
but he told me he was in a meeting

535
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,360
and asked me to take
a taxi home instead.

536
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
I even saw Jiang Jingxuan's ribbon

537
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,280
on his passenger seat.

538
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,480
That...

539
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,960
That was too much!

540
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,400
Susu,

541
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,440
what do you think I should do?

542
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,240
Stop crying.

543
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
If you continue to cry, I will cry, too.

544
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,120
Stop crying.

545
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,800
Stop crying.
