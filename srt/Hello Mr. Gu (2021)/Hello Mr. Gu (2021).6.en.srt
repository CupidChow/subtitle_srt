=Hello Mr. Gu=

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,775
=Episode 6=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,251
(Party A doesn't need to be reasonable.)

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
She's allergic to benzodiazepines.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,959
As her family member, you're careless.

33
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,800
Thankfully she's admitted in time.

34
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,120
She will be admitted

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,319
for observation for two days.

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,800
All right.

37
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,959
Thank you, doctor.

38
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:01,800
You're welcome.

39
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,680
You don't even know
what you're allergic to.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
No wonder your brother
had to write a manual

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
about ways to take care of you.

42
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,520
(Benzodiazepines?)

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,960
Zhou Jianqing.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,759
Zhou Jianqing!

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,679
(Why am I dreaming)

46
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,800
(of that annoying guy
early in the morning?)

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,479
(He even occupies my dream.)

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
You're awake.

49
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,360
Where am I?

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Why am I here?

51
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,800
You fainted

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
last night.

53
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,559
I sent you to the hospital.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,399
Thank you.

55
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,559
However,

56
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,360
I'm

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
rarely ill for the few years.

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,320
Why did I faint all of a sudden?

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,399
Have I been straining myself recently?

60
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,320
What time is it?

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,960
What are you doing?

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
The deadline is tonight.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,720
I won't be able to make
it if I do not leave now.

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
You're not allowed to move.

65
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,559
It's extremely urgent.

66
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,440
Don't stop me.

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,279
You...

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,799
What are you doing?

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,600
I...

70
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,959
You're a patient.

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,640
Stop messing around.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,600
However,

73
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,440
if I do not submit the draft on time,

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,760
I'll lose my job.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,839
How much do you want?

76
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,559
I'll compensate you.

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
It's not about money.

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,679
You may be able to
compensate me for now,

79
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,760
but can you do it for life?

80
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,959
It wasn't easy for me

81
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,959
to land this job.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,320
The doctor said

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
you're not allowed to leave yet.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,119
What should I do?

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,440
Please.

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,239
I really need this job.

87
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,399
What do you need?

88
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,200
I'll fetch it for you.

89
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,079
Bring me my laptop and drawing tablet.

90
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,040
Don't forget
the Hello Kitty make-up pouch

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,559
in the second drawer by the bed.

92
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,880
The pajamas in the balcony.

93
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
My electric toothbrush and mouthwash.

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,720
Your laptop and tablet.

95
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,519
I got it.

96
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,640
Hello.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,559
Xiaochuan.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,480
Okay, I understand.

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,799
Okay, Mr. Gu.

100
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,440
I'll get to it immediately.

101
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,399
What happened?

102
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,079
Zhou Jianqing is unwell.

103
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,760
She's at the hospital.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,760
Is it severe?

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
It doesn't seem like it.

106
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,920
I'm ordered to fetch her drawing tablet

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,839
so that she can draw.

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll go instead.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,720
You're unfamiliar with
women's belongings.

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,399
Sure.

111
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,720
Girls should eat more fruits.

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,520
(Gleneagles Hospital)

113
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,160
Look.

114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
The mangos

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,679
are delivered from overseas.

116
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,399
Thank you, Jingxuan.

117
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,480
Qingqing,

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,839
what other fruits would you like?

119
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,200
I'll wash and cut it for you.

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,279
Don't worry about it.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,799
Anything is fine.

122
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,519
Don't worry.

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,799
I cut fruits for Nanzhou all the time.

124
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,640
You have no idea how picky he is.

125
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,600
He only eats fruits that I cut.

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,760
The sizes must be consistent

127
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,839
or he claims the texture
will be affected.

128
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,880
(That guy is such a nitpicker.)

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,959
(He's unbelievable.)

130
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,839
Xiaochuan and I are
going to the supermarket.

131
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,279
Do you girls need anything?

132
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,600
The water ran out.

133
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,959
Okay.

134
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,519
I would like some
spicy strips, sour plum,

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,959
chips and juice.

136
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,880
You're not allowed to eat those.

137
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Fine.

138
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,519
A hand cream.

139
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,640
I need a scrunchie.

140
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,440
I would prefer it in Mori style.

141
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,279
Why do you need that during
your stay in the hospital?

142
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,880
What about...

143
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,519
What else do you need?

144
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,440
Will you buy me some
sanitary napkins as well?

145
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,799
What?

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,679
Buy them yourself.

147
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,519
Forget it then.

148
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,480
What's with the attitude?

149
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,839
Excuse me.

150
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,679
It's an old habit.

151
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,799
(You'd even drink
that clean freak's water.)

152
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,799
(That's the vice president
of Xingyun for you.)

153
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,079
(How bold.)

154
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,480
There are pure cotton,

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,880
cellucotton and liquid types.

156
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,679
What are the differences?

157
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,079
Mr. Gu,

158
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,040
let's pick one and go.

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,760
No.

160
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,480
According to the Internet,

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,239
this contains artificial fragrance.

162
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,600
We can't take this.

163
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:03,880
This is better.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,760
She isn't supposed to eat these.

165
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,119
I'll eat them.

166
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,519
If you want them,

167
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,239
buy them yourself.

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,760
Mr. Gu,

169
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,719
don't tell me

170
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,679
you've fallen for her.

171
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,799
You're so concerned about her.

172
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,840
I just want her

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,799
to cultivate good habits

174
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,880
like me.

175
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,719
Besides,

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,119
she's admitted

177
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,479
because of me.

178
00:08:59,239 --> 00:08:59,880
Do you know

179
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,719
what Mori style is?

180
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Mori style is...

181
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,359
I don't know.

182
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,559
Qingqing.

183
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,640
Thank you.

184
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,239
You're back.

185
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,239
These are the things you asked for.

186
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,440
Thank you.

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Aren't you allergic to mangos?

188
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,559
I only had some.

189
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,840
She can't eat mangos.

190
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
You're attentive

191
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,799
to girls, Mr. Gu.

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,039
I'm just

193
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,159
worried she's going to
cause me more troubles.

194
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,799
If you two are done here,

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
you may return to the office.

196
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,599
She had a long night.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
We should leave her to rest.

198
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,359
Nanzhou,

199
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,559
you should return instead.

200
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,719
I'll stay to take care of her.

201
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,080
Forget it.

202
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,559
Well,

203
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
Xiaochuan and I shall return first.

204
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,919
If you have things to attend to,

205
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,080
you should go ahead, too.

206
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm just fulfilling my obligation

207
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,239
according to the agreement.

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,919
I know.

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,039
You're being responsible for Party B.

210
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,559
However,

211
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,799
I just want to rest alone

212
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,359
to get well soon.

213
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,400
Then I'll have carried
out my job as Party B.

214
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,280
Am I right?

215
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,320
Fine.

216
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,840
Get some rest.

217
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
Do not cause me trouble.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,159
All right.

219
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Zhang Yin,

220
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,359
where are you?

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Zhang Yin, you're here.

222
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,559
You said it was not a big deal.

223
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,520
I just felt a little dizzy.

224
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm fine now.

225
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,640
You're on a drip. This isn't minor.

226
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,320
Stop drawing.

227
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,239
Get some rest.

228
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,719
I don't have a choice.

229
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,679
Look at the time.

230
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,919
I need to submit the draft soon.

231
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,359
No matter

232
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,440
how urgent it is,

233
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,400
nothing is more important
than your health.

234
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,520
This is a matter of life
and death as well.

235
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,640
I finally found a company

236
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,440
without arrears of payment.

237
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,919
To me,

238
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,599
it's already a blessing.

239
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,679
I can't lose it.

240
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,080
How much is left?

241
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,640
Send it to me. I'll draw it for you.

242
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,239
What about the part I sent you?

243
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,080
Don't worry.

244
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
I finished it long ago.

245
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,919
Send me the storyboard.

246
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,640
Junior,

247
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,960
at critical times,

248
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
you're the most reliable one.

249
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,599
As your partner,

250
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,599
I'm used to being on standby 24/7.

251
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,719
Of course I'm reliable.

252
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,719
Here.

253
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,239
Let me show you the storyboard.

254
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,280
Here.

255
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,359
The composition is all right.

256
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,200
You can readjust it here.

257
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,520
Do I have to?

258
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,559
Move it over here?

259
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,080
Hold on.

260
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
This one?

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,320
You can adjust this, too.

262
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,280
Over here?

263
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,479
Don't you think

264
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,599
it's too congested?

265
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,239
Zhou Jianqing, are you seeking death?

266
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,559
Don't move.

267
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,400
Let me take a picture

268
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,320
and post it to social media.

269
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,400
It's a great opportunity
to impress my boss.

270
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
Is that why you're
neglecting your health?

271
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
It's a minor condition.

272
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,719
What's the big deal?

273
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
It's not as severe as
you make it seem to be.

274
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,559
It does not affect

275
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,239
my appetite nor mood at all.

276
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,320
Coming.

277
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,440
If you're incapable of
taking care of her,

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,919
get out of here.

279
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,679
She doesn't need you.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,239
He's here to help me
with the background.

281
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Zhou Jianqing,

282
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,039
no drawing tool is allowed in your ward.

283
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,679
If you want to draw,

284
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,479
do it after you're discharged.

285
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,200
My deadline is approaching soon.

286
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,679
Why are you still here?

287
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,479
It was my fault to neglect the drip.

288
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,479
What about you?

289
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,559
You left her alone in the hospital

290
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,000
and returned with complaints.

291
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,159
Have you fulfilled

292
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,039
your responsibility as her fiancé?

293
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,840
Wait.

294
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,760
No.

295
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,000
You can't wait to kick me out.

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,599
Sure.

297
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,520
What do we do with her job then?

298
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,400
Don't fight.

299
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,960
Do you know

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,640
how important comic is to Zhou Jianqing?

301
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
Does that mean you can neglect

302
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,559
her health?

303
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,520
Do you really understand

304
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,280
how much Zhou Jianqing loves comics?

305
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,599
In order to get a little
closer to her dream,

306
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,200
she'll give her all and persist through.

307
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,479
If she loses her job

308
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
due to your negligence,

309
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,200
have you ever imagined
how upset she'll be?

310
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,200
Please.

311
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,559
The draft is very important to me.

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,280
Without Zhang Yin,

313
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll be in trouble today.

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,200
I cannot lose this job.

315
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
I'll die.

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,159
Do you insist on completing this?

317
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,960
Hurry up.

318
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Hurry up.

319
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:20,640
Hurry up.

320
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,039
What about this part?

321
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,559
I think...

322
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,320
Yes!

323
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
We survive.

324
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,320
It's perfect.

325
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,520
This is awesome.

326
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,400
You may leave now.

327
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,440
How can you kick him out?

328
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,440
I'll visit you tomorrow.

329
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Take care.

330
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,400
I said you're not allowed to eat chips.

331
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,919
I want some spicy strips.

332
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,080
It's bad for your stomach.

333
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,239
Where did you get these?

334
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,679
They're Zhang Yin's contribution.

335
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,520
You're not allowed to eat any of these.

336
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,000
What can I eat then?

337
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,200
Healthy food.

338
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,520
Fruits.

339
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,919
You're unreasonable.

340
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm your Party A.

341
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
There's no need to reason with you.

342
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,620
(Gleneagles Hospital)

343
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,500
(Devil)

344
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,239
Hello.

345
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,239
Are you home?

346
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,439
I've been knocking all day.

347
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,199
Why are you there again?

348
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,400
I am dropping by after work.

349
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,319
I brought you food.

350
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,199
Where are you?

351
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,160
I...

352
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,719
I'm working overtime at the office.

353
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,560
All right.

354
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
I'll head to your office then.

355
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,680
The grilled food won't
taste good when it's cold.

356
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,439
No.

357
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,959
I think

358
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,800
you shouldn't come all the way.

359
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,239
Leave it by the door.

360
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,199
What time are you coming home?

361
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,239
I'll wait for you here.

362
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,439
All right!

363
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,760
Mr. Liu, I'm coming!

364
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,040
Brother,

365
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,800
I need to go.

366
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,319
I have a meeting with my boss.

367
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,319
I'm hanging up.

368
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:43,959
Bye.

369
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:44,839
Hello?

370
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,640
Hello.

371
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,079
What's the matter?

372
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,359
An emergency.

373
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,079
My brother is at Gu Nanzhou's doorstep

374
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,959
on an inspection.

375
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,479
Whatever you do,

376
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,479
take him away from Gu's house.

377
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,479
All right.

378
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,760
Qingqing agreed to be my model
for a photography assignment.

379
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
It's getting late and
she hasn't shown up.

380
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,199
The sunset will be gone
by the time she returns.

381
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Xuan,

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,239
would you help me instead?

383
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,839
Sure.

384
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,640
I'll go with you.

385
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,239
Let's go then.

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,719
Smile.

387
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
For the next few days,

388
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,199
go to Gu Nanzhou's house as soon
as it's time to get off work.

389
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,680
You must distract
my brother at all cost.

390
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,599
Do not let him find out that
I was admitted to a hospital.

391
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,439
Otherwise,

392
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,199
he'll lecture me.

393
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,760
Xuan.

394
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,920
Not you again.

395
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,319
I need a partner for
my flower arrangement course.

396
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Go ahead then.

397
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Qingqing isn't available.

398
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,479
Will you go with me?

399
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,280
You want me

400
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,280
to attend a flower arrangement course?

401
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:52,959
What do you think?

402
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:54,479
Isn't it perfect?

403
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,280
Well, this...

404
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:58,920
It's...

405
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,479
Excuse me,

406
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,959
why did you arrange the flowers

407
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,280
into a porcupine?

408
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,000
This is not a porcupine.

409
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,280
It's obviously a Christmas tree.

410
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,520
Class is over.

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm heading to Zhou Jianqing.

412
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,359
Xuan,

413
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,920
I want to go shopping.

414
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,680
Go ahead then.

415
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm in a bad mood.

416
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,760
I might spend money recklessly
when I'm in a bad mood.

417
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,199
All girls are like that.

418
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,479
They spend recklessly whenever
they are in a bad mood.

419
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,479
You're rich anyway.

420
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,359
Go ahead.

421
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Xuan!

422
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,520
What's wrong?

423
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,400
I have stomachache.

424
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,359
Are you all right?

425
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,719
I can't take it.

426
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,680
I must take a break here.

427
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,760
Come on, be careful.

428
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,640
Slow down.

429
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,439
Did you hurt yourself?

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,359
My stomach hurts.

431
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,439
Let's head to a hospital.

432
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
It's not necessary.

433
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,880
I'll be fine after getting some rest.

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,439
Don't be stubborn.

435
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:04,959
Get on.

436
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,439
Wait, Xuan.

437
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,199
Xuan.

438
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:07,839
I...

439
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,520
I don't want to go to
a hospital, Xuan.

440
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,479
According to the manual,

441
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,439
patients should take a walk

442
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,760
for 30 minutes three times a day.

443
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,760
You slacked when you're left
unsupervised in the morning.

444
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Mr. Gu,

445
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
stop being so rigid.

446
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,079
It's just a suggestion.

447
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,760
This is the suggestion of
experts in the hospital.

448
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,000
We should follow it.

449
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
You're inhumane.

450
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,199
I should be able to wake up
whenever I want in the morning.

451
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,760
keep this manual in mind

452
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
when you return.

453
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll pick you up after lunch.

454
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,359
The doctor said

455
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,599
you could be discharged.

456
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,880
Seriously?

457
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,640
That's great.

458
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,280
What's the matter with you?

459
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,000
Hurry up.

460
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:56,839
Xuan.

461
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't move.

462
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,000
What's wrong with you?

463
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,719
I...

464
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,079
Let me lean on you for a moment.

465
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,040
Why do you need to lean on me?

466
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,119
You're in great pain.

467
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,239
Let's hurry to the doctor.

468
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,640
Xuan, I don't want
to get an injection.

469
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,439
You're an adult. Why are
you afraid of having an injection?

470
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,119
I can't do it.

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,439
Hurry up and leave.

472
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,000
It's impossible to make reservation.

473
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:35,800
I waited for a long time.

474
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,320
(Xiaxia, crisis solved.)

475
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,439
There you go.

476
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,680
Your test results are out.

477
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,439
The doctor says

478
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,439
you're completely fine.

479
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,760
Okay.

480
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,920
What's wrong with you?

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
It hurts momentarily.

482
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,359
Did they examine you thoroughly?

483
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,439
Should I

484
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,160
take you for a full body check?

485
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,839
It's fine, Xuan.

486
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,719
Since the doctor said I'm fine,

487
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,119
I must be fine.

488
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,839
Let's go then.

489
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,599
Are you sure you're all right?

490
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,359
Yes.

491
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,839
Okay.

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,319
I'm off to meet Zhou Jianqing.

493
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,319
Go home on your own.

494
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,479
All right.

495
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:16,959
I'm coming.

496
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,560
What's the matter with you?

497
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,119
I couldn't reach you
for the past two days.

498
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,079
Change your shoes first.

499
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,520
I've been really busy recently.

500
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,280
My brother-in-law is here.

501
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,560
Darling,

502
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,119
I would like to have a glass of juice.

503
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,079
Okay.

504
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,920
Since when do you drink juice?

505
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,479
Don't you normally drink cola?

506
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,800
You have no idea.

507
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,719
This is the necessary way
to train my husband.

508
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,439
Thank you, darling.

509
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:05,719
Have a seat.

510
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,719
Scoot over.

511
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,319
Over here.

512
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,359
You two

513
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,719
were pretty occupied with work.

514
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:16,839
Yes.

515
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,119
But whenever Nanzhou is free,

516
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,599
he would pick me up at the office.

517
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,560
Am I right, Nanzhou?

518
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,119
Nanzhou,

519
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,439
would you like juice?

520
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:27,719
No.

521
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,959
Have a sip.

522
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,439
I suddenly recall that I have
something to attend to.

523
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,079
I'm leaving.

524
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,959
Are you leaving already?

525
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,280
Stay a little longer.

526
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,319
Let me see you off, brother.

527
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:50,880
Brother,

528
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,119
can you stop visiting me every day?

529
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,599
You act like an evil mother-in-law

530
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,199
who's constantly monitoring us.

531
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
You two were
very comfortable just now.

532
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,479
A relationship requires space.

533
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Besides,

534
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,239
I finally have

535
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,239
a boyfriend who's
exceptional in all aspects.

536
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,680
What happens if you constantly

537
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,079
show up and ruin my relationship?

538
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,239
I'm just worried he
might mistreat you.

539
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,839
You mustn't act like this

540
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,680
just because I have a boyfriend.

541
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,319
You're going to scare the man away.

542
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,400
When nobody wants me,

543
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I'll be your burden forever.

544
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,160
Will you be happy then?

545
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,439
Brat.

546
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,640
What are you talking about?

547
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,479
Fine.

548
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,839
I'll stop showing up, all right?

549
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:28,880
You promise?

550
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,959
I promise.

551
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,119
Are you satisfied?

552
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,760
Hurry up and return to Gu Nanzhou.

553
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
You must keep your promise!

554
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,760
Thank you for cooperating with me.

555
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
You put on a pretty good act.

556
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,199
Did I have a choice?

557
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,439
You don't have to put
on an act from now on.

558
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,839
I convinced my brother just now.

559
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,640
He's not going to bother me again.

560
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:03,359
So,

561
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,880
I'll move out tomorrow.

562
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Thank you for the last couple of days.

563
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,040
To be honest, you're not

564
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,719
as heartless as it might seem.

565
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,719
When I had nowhere to go,

566
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,839
you took me in.

567
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:24,880
When I was arrested by city inspectors,
you came to my aid.

568
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
When I was admitted to the hospital,

569
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,800
you took care of me.

570
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,199
That's why

571
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,920
I will not leave any problem behind.

572
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,520
I will not cause you inconvenience.

573
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,439
Clear all traces of yours.

574
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,160
All right.

575
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,119
I'll clean the place up.

576
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,640
Don't go.

577
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:33,839
(Gu Nanzhou.)

578
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,880
(Thank you for taking care of me.)

579
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,239
(I cleaned the room.)

580
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,640
(I washed the sheets.)

581
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,239
(All traces of me)

582
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,800
(were completely cleared.)

583
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,400
(From now on,)

584
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,959
(I'll never bother your life again.)

585
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,520
(Goodbye.)

586

(Wesca Color Printing CO., LTD)

587
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,319
Aunt?

588
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,760
Why are you here?

589
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,479
Why are you here?

590
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,920
I stayed here for a few days.

591
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm leaving now.

592
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,359
You stayed here?

593
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,560
Aunt.

594
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Have a seat.

595
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,160
I'll pour you a glass of water.

596
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,119
All right.

597
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,199
(Nanzhou has never
taken photos like these.)

598
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,959
(How did Qingqing convince him?)

599
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,000
(Are them really dating?)

600
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,280
Qingqing,

601
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,160
this is a great picture.

602
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,920
Aunt,

603
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,719
this photo is...

604
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,920
Are you guys dating now?

605
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,000
Aunt,

606
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,319
I stayed here for a couple of days,

607
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,520
but...

608
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,920
We...

609
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,599
Did you guys get into a fight?

610
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,000
Is that why you're moving out?

611
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,119
Yes.

612
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,079
We had a fight.

613
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,040
Due to contrasting personalities,

614
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,000
we've decided to let it go.

615
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,959
How can you be incompatible?

616
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,760
Qingqing, listen to me.

617
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,520
I'm great

618
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,000
at judging one's character.

619
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
The first time I met you,

620
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,439
I knew you'd be a great
match to Nanzhou.

621
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,719
Look at you.

622
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,560
You're funny and kind.

623
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
You're friendly as well.

624
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,359
You complement Nanzhou perfectly.

625
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,520
Am I right?

626
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,280
Aunt.

627
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,239
In my opinion, a relationship

628
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,640
cannot be forced.

629
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,199
Don't you agree?

630
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,640
He shouldn't kick you out

631
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,800
over a small fight.

632
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,199
That's not what a gentleman should do.

633
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,640
With that attitude,

634
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,119
he'll never have a girlfriend.

635
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,359
Aunt,

636
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,319
you misunderstood him.

637
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,719
I decided to leave on my own.

638
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,319
It's a fight.

639
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,079
Boys should always take the initiative

640
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,479
to reconcile with the girls.

641
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,680
I know

642
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,280
that Nanzhou

643
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,599
is not good at things like this.

644
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,400
Don't get the wrong idea.

645
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,920
We just...

646
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,119
Don't worry.

647
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,719
I call the shots around here.

648
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:28,959
You should stay here.

649
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
If he objects to it,

650
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
I'll break his legs.

651
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:32,839
Aunt.

652
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,280
Stay here.

653
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,439
