1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,340
(Hello Mr. Gu Theatre)

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,560
Listen.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,359
If he wants iced water,

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,760
don't give him a coaster.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,680
Why?

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,479
Why?

7
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:18,399
Mr. Gu

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,879
hates the water drops from the glass.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,799
If there's water on the table,

10
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:22,600
he'll go insane.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,760
Also,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,040
if you don't draw
the curtain all the way

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,239
and you leave a small gap,

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,280
I guarantee this.

15
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,040
Gu Nanzhou

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,439
may not be able to find fault with you,

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,759
but he'll feel uncomfortable.

18
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,439
Moreover,

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,919
the jotting on this white board

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,119
is rather tidy, right?

21
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,759
As long as the last character

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,000
is slightly different
from the front part,

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,319
I guarantee

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,240
that he won't be able to stand it.

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,940
(Speak)

26
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,279
Mr. Gu.

27
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,040
-Mr. Gu.
-Mr. Gu.

28
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:04,319
Hello, Mr. Gu.

29
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,120
This...

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,760
You're right.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,080
Qingqing, you're brilliant.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
Let's have a group chat
to mock the boss.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,879
That's right.

34
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:40,839
-Let's have a group chat.
-That's right.

=Hello Mr. Gu=

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,575
=Episode 9=

64
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,746
(A boss is meant to be mocked.)

65
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,360
Dugu Nanzhou.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,520
Art indeed imitates life.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,759
It will work.

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,799
Dugu Nanzhou?

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,000
Ms. Jiang.

70
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,679
No wonder you disappear all the time.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
So you're drawing secretly.

72
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,480
Aren't you drawing...

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
No.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
Actually it's...

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
Do you hate him that much?

76
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,040
No,

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,559
I respect my boss, Mr. Gu.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
All right, just kidding.

79
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,799
Keep drawing.

80
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:52,959
By the way,

81
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,640
there's a hidden place
on the third floor.

82
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,519
You can draw there.

83
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,239
She's unpredictable.

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,119
She's switching between a hypocrite

85
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,519
and the kind-hearted girl

86
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,760
seamlessly.

87
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,440
Mother, I'm here.

88
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
I'll wait for you at
a table by the window.

89
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,920
Did you fry the chicken?

90
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,279
Who told you to add lemon in it?

92
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,880
How does it taste?

93
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,279
Try it.

94
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,279
Look, sir.

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,399
This dish

96
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,279
is new in our restaurant.
It's Japanese fried chicken.

97
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,480
Lemon juice makes it special.

98
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,519
Forget about

99
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,480
what makes it special.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Is the chicken fresh?

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
Look at this Spanish ham.

102
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,359
It's as thin as a window screen.

103
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,799
Isn't this cheating?

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
Sir,

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,959
ham is meant to be thinly sliced

106
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,239
to enhance the taste.

107
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,839
I recommend you
to match it with red wine.

108
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,880
It'll taste better.

109
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,760
Is it about thickness?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Come on, take a look.

111
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,480
It's all mashed up.

112
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,440
Can't you see?

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,279
Sorry, sir.

114
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,160
Why don't I

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
treat you to the meal?

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,760
Sorry, sir.

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
This meal is on me.

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,239
I'll get the kitchen

119
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,359
to prepare another portion for you.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,040
Sorry.

121
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:12,720
Let's go.

122
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,279
Go on.

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,399
Do you have too much money?

124
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,559
When the guy found fault with me,

125
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,359
you offered to pay for him.

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,399
I...

127
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,480
I didn't want them to
make life difficult for you.

128
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,679
Stay out of my business.

129
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,399
Why are you here?

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,559
I'm a chef here.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Aren't you a manager in a hotel?

132
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,920
You are

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,679
a hotel management graduate in Britain.

134
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,040
You've worked in
a five-star hotel before.

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,000
Why did you go back to be a chef?

136
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,239
I love cooking.

137
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,160
As a chef, the more I work,

138
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,040
the more I earn.

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,720
What's the matter?

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,839
Are you looking down on chefs?

141
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,119
I just didn't expect this.

142
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,440
You used to hate cooking for Qingqing,

143
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,359
yet you enjoy cooking now.

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,040
It's to pay the money I owe Gu Nanzhou.

145
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,880
Otherwise, it will be like
Qingqing is selling herself.

146
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Then,

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,920
are you going to be a chef forever?

148
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,640
Not forever.

149
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,760
I'll open a store when I earn enough.

150
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,519
When business is good,

151
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,440
I'll have a few branches.

152
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,519
I believe that one day,

153
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,440
the stores run by my father

154
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,480
will be reopened.

155
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,920
In the future, Zhou Jianqing

156
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,920
will be backed by her maternal family.

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,679
She won't have to suffer

158
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,239
at Gu Nanzhou's place.

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
Her brother can provide her
with a comfortable life, too.

160
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,440
Zhou Jianqing!

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,799
What's the matter, Mr. Gu?

162
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,799
What's the time?

163
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:06,880
1.15pm.

164
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,239
What time is the meeting with Yingqi?

165
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,239
2pm.

166
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,799
Oh no, we will be late.

167
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,880
All right, let's go.

168
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,799
Where's the car?

169
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,000
Your car

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
was sent for maintenance.

171
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
They said it'd be
sent over in the morning.

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,599
I don't know why

173
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,559
it isn't here yet.

174
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:39,960
You...

175
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,919
I'll hail a cab right away.

176
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,760
You should do so, too.

177
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,400
If we don't do it together,

178
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,359
we'll surely be late.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,599
Oh no, there're 17 to go.

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,159
We still have to wait.

181
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,599
There're 18 to go.

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Answer me.

183
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,039
This is the umpteenth time.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,640
Girls,

185
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,200
look at the scarves.

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,840
Where are you bringing me?

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,280
They're beautiful.

188
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,960
This is bus rapid transit.
It's faster than a cab.

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,919
It's the one you're holding.

190
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't take public transport.

191
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Look at the state we're in.

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,359
Just stop throwing your weight around.

193
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,400
Do you know how important

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
this meeting is?

195
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,359
Lake Xingling.

196
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,200
Yingqi!

197
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,880
I really can't do it.

198
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
Oh right,

199
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
you're scared of a crowd.

200
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
Where are you going?

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:55,880
Miss.

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,400
How much is this?

203
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,640
The total is RMB30.

204
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Yes, scan this.

205
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,159
All right, thank you.

206
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,880
All right.

207
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,880
There you go.

208
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:07,719
Wear it.

209
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,960
Wear it now.

210
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,239
Come on. Have a look.

211
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,320
Is there a sound?

212
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,000
Follow the order.

213
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,400
There're steps.

214
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,239
Slow down.

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,280
Come on.

216
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:41,840
Watch out.

217
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,359
Excuse me.

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,119
Watch out.

219
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,880
Excuse me.

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,440
Don't push me.

221
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Excuse me.

222
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,159
There's something to hold onto here.

223
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,400
Hold onto it.

224
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,200
Miss,

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,880
you can have the seat.

226
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,760
Thank you.

227
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,039
Come on.

228
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,760
Sit there.

229
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,280
-Watch out.
-Watch out.

230
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,159
There're steps.

231
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,080
Mind your step.

232
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
Look at the young man.

233
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,320
He's so handsome,

234
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,400
yet he can't see.

235
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
-He's pitiful.
-What a pity.

236
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,479
That's right.

237
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,359
My brother

238
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,960
is handsome,

239
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,200
but here, here

240
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,960
and here

241
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,000
are not good.

242
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,840
It is really unfair.

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,479
Yes.

244
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,400
I know, right?

245
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,520
If I

246
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,159
didn't raise him up by myself,

247
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,599
who knows

248
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,320
how he'd have fared.

249
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
For him,

250
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
I work three jobs.

251
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,359
I work day and night.

252
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,359
However, as long as he's fine,

253
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm content.

254
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,159
Miss,

255
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,840
it's been tough on you.

256
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,239
Hurry up, have the seat.

257
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,760
Yes.

258
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,080
Aunt,

259
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
it's all right.

260
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,039
Please take the seat.

261
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,479
Take mine. I'm getting off.

262
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:02,719
Thank you.

263
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,400
You're welcome.

264
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,599
If her parents heard it,

265
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,159
they'd feel really bad.

266
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,400
I know, right?

267
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
(Dugu Nanzhou)

268
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,159
Oh no.

269
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,359
What to do?

270
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,039
Hello, Walnut.

271
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,359
It's an emergency.

272
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,280
Hurry up.

273
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,159
Are we there yet?

274
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,599
Mr. Gu,

275
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,039
it's 1.55pm.

276
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,960
If you continue to do this,

277
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,640
we might as well just return.

278
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,799
That's all

279
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,520
for Lake Xingling's situation.

280
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,080
Right now our company

281
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,440
has completed architectural
model of the animation.

282
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,679
We have an idea about
certain chapters, too.

283
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,239
We have also prepared a teaser.

284
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:07,760
(Walnut,)

285
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,359
(where are you?)

286
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,119
Please watch it.

287
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
(Is the USB flash drive here?)

288
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,980
(Dugu Nanzhou)

289
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,160
(Control freak. Sharp-tongued.
Hypocrite. Heartless. Unkind)

290
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,580
(Stupid guy.
Pretty looks can be deceiving.)

291
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,400
Mr. Gu,

292
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,799
is Dugu Nanzhou

293
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,679
a new character

294
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,840
in Lake Xingling?

295
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,000
The style is rather...

296
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,159
The style and character

297
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,159
are exactly what we're against of.

298
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,640
Mr. He,

299
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,400
in pre-production,

300
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,880
we did a great deal of research.

301
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,880
We realized that works

302
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,679
that are riding on hype

303
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,559
have occupied most of the comic market.

304
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,239
However, such incomprehensible content

305
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,679
without a proper theme

306
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,960
is not what we, Xingyun,

307
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,200
are after.

308
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:18,719
Therefore,

309
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,080
we prepared this material

310
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,039
for our animators.

311
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,559
This is

312
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,479
to stick to our principle

313
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,799
of creating Lake Xingling.

314
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,159
Your words make sense.

315
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,840
We're

316
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,400
interested in this project

317
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,960
because it's different

318
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,520
from most works in the market.

319
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,840
At least the theme and feelings

320
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,000
are genuine.

321
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,559
That's right, Mr. He.

322
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,239
You can spot talent really well.

323
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,200
You might not know that

324
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,200
Lake Xingling

325
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,039
was inspired by Mr. Gu's

326
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,239
real experience.

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
Do you mind sharing with us?

328
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Lake Xingling's core story

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,840
is about working towards a dream.

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,479
The young boy and young girl

331
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,159
are projection

332
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,559
of the protagonists.

333
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
As long as you have a dream,

334
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,599
you can surely find your Lake Xingling.

335
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,080
You'll also find your long-lost courage.

336
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,880
It's indeed a moving story.

337
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I think

338
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,919
the boy

339
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,320
is based on Mr. Gu.

340
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What about the girl?

341
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,159
Of course it's based on me.

342
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,400
The little girl is based on me.

343
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
Seriously?

344
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,679
Do you grow up with Mr. Gu?

345
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,280
What a great story of
the anime and manga scene,

346
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,119
yet we only found out today.

347
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,559
We've indeed known
each other since young.

348
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,719
However,

349
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,599
we had not stayed in
touch for some time.

350
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,239
We're only reunited recently.

351
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,080
I'm surprised.

352
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,799
It's been so many years.

353
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,880
I didn't expect Mr. Gu to remember me.

354
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,800
He actually included our story

355
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,479
in Lake Xingling.

356
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,599
However, this is

357
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,160
what I want to convey.

358
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,000
As long as two people harbor a dream,

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,000
even if they're separated,

360
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,439
they'll bump into each
other again somewhere

361
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,719
and fall in love again.

362
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,920
Are you two having a quickie wedding?

363
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,199
We are,

364
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,800
but our love will last.

365
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,479
I will never forget

366
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,959
the night we're reunited.

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,359
He's watching fireworks with me.

368
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,800
He lifted his head to
watch the fireworks.

369
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,560
I stole a glance at him.

370
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,640
The light of the fireworks

371
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,239
was reflected on his face.

372
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,640
That's when I thought

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,439
he's actually better-looking
than the fireworks.

374
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,239
Perhaps

375
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,280
that's how love feels.

376
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,719
However,

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,599
this scene is like
the part in the animation,

378
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,400
where the boy and the girl

379
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,680
watch the stars falling by the lake.

380
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,439
Such a romantic
moment rich with emotions

381
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,199
inspired this highlight
of the animation.

382
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
Mr. Gu, you're a loving person.

383
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,119
No wonder

384
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,400
you insist on making Lake Xingling.

385
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,280
So you're driven by love.

386
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,640
Such a romantic love story

387
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,359
is re-enacted before us.

388
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,160
I envy you.

389
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,040
It's really romantic.

390
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,359
Why don't you tell us
more about your love?

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,199
That's right.

392
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,640
How did you get together?

393
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
Who took the initiative?

394
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:48,520
That's right.

395
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
This is considered Lake Xingling's

396
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,680
backstory, right?

397
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,839
I overlooked

398
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,719
certain things today,

399
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,479
but it's understandable.

400
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,000
When you're back,

401
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,920
get legal department to draft
an investment agreement

402
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,520
and send it to Yingqi.

403
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,880
An investment agreement?

404
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,319
Is Mr. He investing in Lake Xingling?

405
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
It's awesome!

406
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,160
Well,

407
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,439
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,719
I forgot

409
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,640
as soon as I got excited.

410
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,560
I'll pay the penalty to Xiaochuan.

411
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,359
It's all right.

412
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,040
You've

413
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
contributed to Xingyun after all.

414
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,319
Boss.

415
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,719
Since I've made a contribution,

416
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,160
is there a bonus?

417
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,079
Jiang Xiaochuan got
food poisoning because of you.

418
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,839
He can't work.

419
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,119
You kept disappearing at work.

420
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,199
You forgot the time of meeting

421
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,439
and didn't bring the material.

422
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,199
Ms. Zhou,

423
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,800
what makes you think
you deserve a bonus?

424
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,119
I...

425
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,520
What is it?

426
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,319
Nothing.

427
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,280
Is it because

428
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,040
you're leaving the company soon?

429
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,920
Is that why you're acting abnormally?

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,719
You may

431
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,439
put it that way.

432
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
It seems we've interacted

433
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,040
for far too long.

434
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,520
Once you leave the company,

435
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,199
you won't be bothered, right?

436
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,140
(Lake Xingling Working Group)

437
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,199
Mr. Gu,

438
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,199
I'm back.

439
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,800
Have you been fully recovered?

440
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,920
Yes.

441
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:45,719
Later,

442
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,199
I'll liaise with Zhou Jianqing
on the handover.

443
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,599
Then I can officially return.

444
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,040
All right.

445
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll make a move first.

446
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,280
Hold on.

447
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,439
Zhou Jianqing

448
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,439
has been with me these days.

449
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,680
I think she's engrossed.

450
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,280
She's leaving me all of a sudden.

451
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,959
As a girl,

452
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,719
she might not be able to take it.

453
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:15,640
Later,

454
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,719
when you're dealing with
her about the handover,

455
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,920
don't provoke her.

456
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,280
A girl

457
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
cares about her feelings.

458
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,319
What if she's hurt?

459
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,160
Mr. Gu,

460
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,839
what do you mean?

461
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,640
I think she's in love with me.

462
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,079
Although she's only
pretending as my fiancée,

463
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,520
I should

464
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,959
be considerate to her.

465
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,839
All right, you may go.

466
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,040
Qingqing,

467
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,640
do remember

468
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,719
to visit us.

469
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,839
Keep in touch, Qingqing.

470
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,359
Yes, keep in touch.

471
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,359
Don't worry,

472
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,920
I'll return regularly to visit you.

473
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Great.

474
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:55,959
All right,

475
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,959
that's it.

476
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,479
Qingqing,

477
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,640
we'll miss you.

478
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
I'll miss all of you, too.

479
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:01,839
Qingqing,

480
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,119
take good care of yourself.

481
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:03,760
That's right.

482
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,280
Yes, take care.

483
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,359
Why do I have a feeling

484
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,000
that she's not as sad as you imagine?

485
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,959
We'll miss you.

486
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:09,640
That's right.

487
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Keep in touch, Qingqing.

488
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,319
Enough.

490
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,800
Don't be naggy.

491
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,520
Is good at pretending to be happy.

492
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,319
Farewell. We shall meet again.

493
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,719
See you.

494
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,280
Bye

495
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
Bye, Qingqing.

Don't worry.

Aren't you?

504
00:23:59,239 --> 00:23:59,800
Oh right,

the new character of the evil boss

is well-received by the netizens.

Therefore,

508
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,800
you should design

509

his scenes well.

00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,040
it's me.

520
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,479
What is this?

521
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Zhou Jianqing

522
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
asked me to bring you the clothes.

523
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,119
Is it a counterfeit again?

524
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Throw it away.

525
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,520
Counterfeit?

526
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,239
Zhou Jianqing is a cheapskate.

527
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,079
I told her to buy clothes for me,

528
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
but she bought counterfeits

529
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,359
to fool me.

530
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,319
Mr. Gu,

531
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,520
you're mentioning

532
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,920
Zhou Jianqing

533
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,479
for the 34th time.

534
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,560
Am I?

535
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,439
It seems

536
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,439
she left you

537
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,439
with a memorable impression.

538
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,239
You,

539
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,400
bring this clothes with you

540
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,959
when you leave.

541
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,040
(This ruthless boss)

542
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,119
(is a psycho.)

543
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,119
(I love it.)

544
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,359
(The heartless boss)

545
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,160
(is exactly like my boss.)

546
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,920
(Please torture him, dear author.)

547
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,199
(Do you have other tactics)

548
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,199
(of torturing the boss?)

549
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,400
(Please enlighten us.)

550
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,520
(Here's my work.)

551
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,920
(Please like it.)

552
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,479
(The boss is inspired by Mr. Gu.)

553
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Return my phone to me.

554
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
What are you doing?

555
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,719
I want to join the group chat.

556
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,680
Mr. Gu,

557
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,800
why are you doing this to yourself?

558
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,319
Get off me.

559
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:45,640
No.

560
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,000
Feel free to do what you want to me,

561
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,560
but I'll never

562
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,439
betray my colleagues.

563
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,680
According to the 32nd
clause of our agreement,

564
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,199
Party B must fulfill

565
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,719
the responsibility and
obligation of a fiancée.

566
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,119
This is my job.

567
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,040
Doesn't a fiancée

568
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,319
have the freedom to work?

569
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,239
According to the third clause,

570
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,199
Party B must protect Party A's image.

571
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,079
Do you want to have freedom to work

572
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,280
or discuss

573
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,439
the compensation for
breaking the contract?

574
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,540
(Zhou Jianqing invited Gu Nanzhou
to join the group chat.)

575
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:31,000
Actually in the group chat,

576
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,599
we didn't really mock you.

577
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,719
We admire you.

578
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Have you forgotten? The group is called

579
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
Let's Mock the Boss.

580
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,040
Yes, we do,

581
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,280
but we genuinely

582
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,479
admire you.

583
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,359
However, sometimes,

584
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,760
you're rather domineering.

585
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,239
I don't mean it that way.

587
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,040
Actually I...

588
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,980
(Yuanyuan invited Zhou Jianqing to join
the group chat Let's Mock Qingqing.)

589
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,959
(Why did you invite the boss?)

590
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,880
(Now we can neither quit the group)

591
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,160
(nor kick him out.)

592
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,000
(What should we do?)

593
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,199
(It's awkward.)

594
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,119
(I didn't expect someone like you)

595
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,199
(to be a traitor.)

596
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,839
(You actually betrayed us
to please the boss.)

597
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,079
(I didn't mean it.)

598
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,479
(When I was texting,)

599
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,760
(he saw it.)

600
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,959
(He forced me to invite him.)

601
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,160
(How could you just obey him?)

602
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,160
(What about our friendship?)

603
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,959
(Wait,)

604
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,160
(it's 12am now.)

605
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,640
(How)

606
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,160
(could the boss see you
mocking him in the group?)

607
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:39,800
(Yuanyuan,)

608
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,800
(spot on.)

609
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,920
(Don't you even watch)

610
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,719
(the company's awarding ceremony?)

611
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,000
(Fiancée?)

612
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,319
Let's invite

613
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,599
Xingyun's CEO

614
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,560
Mr. Gu Nanzhou's fiancée

615
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,640
to collect the award on his behalf.

616
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:15,760
You're welcome.

617
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,599
Allow me.

618
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,079
Please.

619
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,640
I need to work overtime tonight.

620
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,359
I need to replenish my energy.

621
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,680
Just let me have a bite of it.

622
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,400
I'm starving.

623
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
Please.

624
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,199
Clean up after that.

625
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,560
Do you want some?

626
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,599
Forget it.

627
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:32,479
Coming.

628
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,680
You're here.

629
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:39,760
Thank you.

630
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,319
The background is done.

631
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,319
I've also proofread the content.

632
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,520
Why do you look haggard?

633
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,719
Didn't you sleep at night?

634
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,479
You have dark circles under your eyes.

635
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,400
Look who's talking.

636
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,839
By the way,

637
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
I bought breakfast for you.

638
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,719
Eat it.

639
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,839
I'll accompany you
to go to office later.

640
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,640
Thank you.

641
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,520
You already look like this.

642
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,800
Forget about going to the office.

643
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,079
You should go to bed.

644
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,119
Zhou Jianqing!

645
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,400
Coming!

646
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,640
Just go back.

647
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,400
What's the matter?

648
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,119
Did you touch my Rubik's Cube?

649
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,959
What do you mean?

650
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,079
The Rubik's Cube on the table.

651
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,599
I didn't see it.

652
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,800
Now I remember.

653
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,520
I think I accidentally

654
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,640
treated it as trash

655
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,359
and threw it into the trash can.

656
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,040
When I was cleaning up in the morning,

657
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,119
I placed the trash outside.

658
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,520
It's taken away.

659
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,920
How many times have I told you

660
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,000
not to touch my stuff?

661
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,479
If you can't do this,

662
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,640
just move out!

663
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,319
Get off her!
