I'll sleep on the floor.

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,520
The bed is actually quite big.

44
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,399
It can fit two people.

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,399
If you don't mind,

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
I allow you to come up.

47
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
Qingqing and Xiaozhou,

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,480
wake up.

49
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,440
Right away, mother.

50
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,720
Hurry up.

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,839
Breakfast will be ready.

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,279
The nutritionist said

53
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,519
we should eat two eggs a day

54
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,200
for sufficient protein.

55
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,559
Have it later.

56
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,959
Is this breakfast?

57
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,079
You caused the trouble.

58
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,799
Bear with it.

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Mother.

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,679
I have a meeting this morning.

61
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,040
I have to go.

62
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:15,839
You can make it.

63
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,200
You should take breakfast
no matter what.

64
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,920
Sit.

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,239
That's right.

66
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,559
Aunt has prepared breakfast.

67
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,320
Finish it before you leave.

68
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,279
The weather is dry lately.

69
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,799
Drink some egg water to
remove heat and swelling.

70
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,200
It enhances your beauty.

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Child,

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
it's natural.

73
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
Does it disgust you so much?

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Where do you want to go?

75
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:46,767
Let go of me.

76
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,239
You can't leave.

77
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,440
Let go of me.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,160
Mother.

79
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,079
I have a meeting at 8 a.m.
with the investment company.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,559
I'll be late unless I leave now.

81
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,799
Qingqing,

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
eat more for me.

83
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Are you serious?

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,359
This child is unbelievable.

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
Xiaozhou has no luck.

86
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,640
I'll save the best for you.

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Qingqing,

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,399
it contains red dates, snow ginseng

89
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,200
and Gastrodia Rhizoma.

90
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,720
It's really nourishing.

91
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:24,880
Done.

92
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,079
Drink it.

93
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,480
Isn't this too nourishing?

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,959
I can see that you're physically weak.

95
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,959
You need more nourishment.

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Drink it.

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,519
It'll taste awful once it gets cold.

98
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,519
Sure.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,279
Qingqing!

100
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,760
Aunt.

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,320
My goodness,

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,920
why is she here when I'm
rushing for the deadline?

103
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,880
Qingqing.

104
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,359
You've been drawing.

105
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,079
It's tiring.

106
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
Here. Have some fruits.

107
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,359
Thank you, aunt.

108
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,440
You're welcome.

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,600
Aunt.

110
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,720
You woke up so early.

111
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,119
Do you need to take a rest?

112
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,320
No.

113
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,720
Staying with you is
the best way to rest.

114
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,440
Don't bother about me.

115
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,279
Get back to work.

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,720
Okay.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,559
Aunt,

118
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,679
do you want to say something?

119
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,320
I want to ask

120
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,880
if we can shop after
you finish your work.

121
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,920
Sure.

122
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,760
I'll wait outside.

123
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,480
Sure, aunt.

124
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,480
What should I do?

125
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,000
Look, Qingqing.

126
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,520
Isn't this outfit cute?

127
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,359
It's a pity no one can
wear it even if I buy it.

128
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,359
It would be great if I could
have a grandchild soon.

129
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Aunt.

130
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,679
Why don't we buy some
ingredients for dinner?

131
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,080
Sure.

132
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,000
Qingqing.

133
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,520
You should eat more seafood.

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,239
Sea cucumber,

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,640
cuttlefish and so on.

136
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,440
I don't really like those.

137
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,159
Qingqing,

138
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,000
you shouldn't be a picky eater.

139
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,119
I read an article.

140
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,479
The seafood contains arginine,

141
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,080
iodide, iron, calcium and so on.

142
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,050
It's nutritious

143
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,649
for women who are trying to conceive.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,359
Aunt, I'll check out

145
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,280
laundry detergent over there.

146
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,620
(Cashier)

147
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,599
Qingqing,

148
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,719
I suddenly recall

149
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,679
seeing a beautiful cup.

150
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:04,967
I want to look at it again.

151
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,159
Pay the bill for me.

152
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,359
This is a supplementary
card given by Nanzhou.

153
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,080
You know the PIN, right?

154
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,320
Of course.

155
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,919
I'll be right back.

156
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,880
Answer the call.

157
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,260
(Dear)

158
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,320
Hello.

159
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,919
What is the PIN number
of your bank card?

160
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,000
Tell me now.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
Are you dreaming?

162
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,280
Your mother asked me to swipe your card.

163
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,799
Our cover will be blown
unless you tell me now.

164
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll text you.

165
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,719
One more thing.

166
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,359
You should pay extra for me

167
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,159
to shop with your mother.

168
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,880
Hello?

169
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,799
Miss, would you like to pay?

170
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,039
Yes.

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
It serves delicious
blanquette de veau here.

172
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,919
Do you know each other?

173
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
-He is...
-Here is the thing.

174
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,559
She is the restaurant's VIP.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,359
I serve her regularly.

176
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,880
We know each other for sure.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,280
Everything goes smoothly.

178
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,719
You don't need to worry at all.

179
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Do you think it's fun

180
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,159
to wander aimlessly like me?

181
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,039
I think

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,880
that is not a problem.

183
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,119
Take my advice.

184
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,880
Take the right path.

185
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,280
Don't waste time on me.

186
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,799
I...

187
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,559
Brother, what brings you here?

188
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,000
Dadong and the guys have
something else to do.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,919
I'll go home with you.

190
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,520
Who is she?

191
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,919
She is my new classmate.

192
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,119
She is Su Youxia.

193
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,440
Isn't it a lovely name?

194
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,039
She likes comic very much, too.

195
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,640
He is my brother.

196
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,919
He's bad.

197
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,440
Stay away from him.

198
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,559
Don't spout nonsense.

199
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:35,455
Qingqing,

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,119
are you still going to read
comic at the book store?

201
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,119
Of course.

202
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,039
I won't stand you up.

203
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Brother,

204
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,280
Susu and I will read comic
first before going home.

205
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,080
Go home.

206
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,039
Let's go.

207
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,359
You know what?

208
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,239
There is a nice comic book store.

209
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,559
It has a lot of decoration.

210
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
We can take pictures together.

211
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,760
Sure.

212
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,400
We can play together then...

213
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,200
Are you crazy, Zhou Zixuan?

214
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:04,719
She hasn't introduced me to you.

215
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,479
I'm her brother, Zhou Zixuan.

216
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,468
You need to call me
Xuan from now on.

217
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,239
Do you hear me?

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,239
Xuan.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Milk tea for you two.

220
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:15,840
Drink it.

221
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,559
All right.

222
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,520
Go home.

223
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,719
Remember to come home early!

224
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Got it!

225
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,640
The down payment has been transferred
to your company's account.

226
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,640
So, please continue to work
on the special effects

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,799
as soon as possible.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The first payment took
so long to arrive.

229
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,848
I hope there'd better not be any problem

230
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,300
with the subsequent payments.

231
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,119
Sure, don't worry.

232
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,760
Everything has been arranged.

233
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,320
Mr. Gu.

234
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
I've bought the suit
for the event tomorrow.

235
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,799
It's the latest of this season.

236
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,479
Try it.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,880
Return it.

238
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,440
Choose one with a better
price-performance ratio next time.

239
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
Better price-performance ratio?

240
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,599
Are you referring

241
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,799
to those ordered by Zhou Jianqing?

242
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,880
What do you think?

243
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:28,960
I think

244
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,159
you two are getting more alike.

245
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,520
What did you say?

246
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
I'll return it.

247
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,799
Wait.

248
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,799
Leave it here.

249
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm full.

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
You make delicious food, aunt.

251
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,280
Seriously?

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Shall I cook for you
every day from now on?

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
Sure.

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,719
Put it down.

255
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,520
Leave it.

256
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,159
Rest with Xiaozhou.

257
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,359
I'm fine, aunt.

258
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,080
Let me help you.

259
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,159
Just listen to me.

260
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,559
I can handle it alone.

261
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,440
Go.

262
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,200
The crisis has been resolved perfectly.

263
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,840
Remember to pay for my service.

264
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,599
How much?

265
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,280
Shall I give you a discount?

266
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,679
Watch TV with your mother tonight.

267
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,280
Buy me some time to
rush for the deadline.

268
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,719
It can offset the payment.

269
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,200
It's a deal.

270
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,080
(It's true.)

271
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,359
(You two...)

272
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,559
(Let me summarise our results.)

273
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,239
(Junjun and William will
send it to Kaiwen.)

274
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:04,719
(That's right.)

275
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,200
(-Kaiwen will send it to Junjun, right?
-Junjun?)

276
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,919
(Junjun to the four of us.)

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
(So it's Chaoyue and Xuan.)

278
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:10,960
(That's right.)

279
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,960
(Fine.)

280
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,559
(Go on.)

281
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,000
(Let me...)

282
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,520
(Let me take what I should take.)

283
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,280
Zhouzhou,

284
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,000
is the company

285
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
facing a problem lately?

286
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,719
No.

287
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,080
Do you lack fund?

288
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,760
Mother,

289
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,359
I'll solve the company
matters by myself.

290
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, is something going on

291
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,039
between you and Qingqing...

292
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,239
We're fine.

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,640
Mother,

294
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,880
don't worry.

295
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,719
If you don't want to talk to me,

296
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,039
I'll talk to Qingqing.

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,679
Mother!

298
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,640
I'll watch TV with you.

299
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,440
(Please get along with each other.)

300
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,119
What would you like to watch?

301
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,719
Watch Heart Signal with me.

302
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,559
It's about to begin.

303
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,799
The male guests in the show

304
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,119
are really romantic.

305
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:01,919
Learn from them.

306
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,400
(When I cooked on the second day, you...)

307
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,959
(When you turned back)

308
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,880
(and smiled to me when I cooked for you,)

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,400
(seriously...)

310
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,148
Here he comes.

311
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,199
This male guest

312
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,199
is Zhao Qijun.

313
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,439
He's really experienced.

314
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,760
Watch his love confession.

315
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,680
He gives both the details and story.

316
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,079
It comes with true feelings.

317
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,680
Watch him.

318
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,280
The face-to-face love confession.

319
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,319
The session

320
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,709
is so creative.

321
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,479
He'll surely succeed.

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,880
Learn from him.

323
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,040
Got it, mother.

324
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,880
He is superb.

325
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Stay calm.

326
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:02,760
Zhou Jianqing.

327
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Get up.

328
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
How can I sleep when
you're sleeping like this?

329
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,280
I spent the whole night
with my mother for you.

330
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,719
Is this what you do in return?

331
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,400
Wake up.

332
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,719
Zhou Jianqing!

333
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,599
Gu Nanzhou.

334
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,520
Gu Nanzhou!

335
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,520
Why are you sleeping here?

336
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,839
Sorry.

337
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,000
Did I toss and turn all night

338
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,319
and push you off the bed?

339
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,839
I'm glad that you know.

340
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,199
Qingqing.

341
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,040
Do you think we can
handle this angle like this?

342
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Yes.

343
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,359
Okay.

344
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,920
This is it for the story board.

345
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Let's complete it today.

346
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,640
Sure.

347
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Why do I have a feeling

348
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,400
that the two employees
are looking at us?

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,040
Those two

350
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,800
were the ones you mentioned, right?

351
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:52,880
Yes.

352
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,640
I'll handle it.

353
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,719
Thank you.

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't be defeated by their fiery glance.

355
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,520
We can hold on to it

356
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
so long as we're thick-skinned.

357
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,479
Is it inappropriate?

358
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
The air conditioner

359
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,680
would be running even without us.

360
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
It's okay.

361
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,800
They're coming.

362
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,239
Shall we grab some food?

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Sure.

364
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,239
I'll bring you to have
something delicious.

365
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,479
-Sure.
-Let's go.

366
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
-My goodness!
-What is the matter?

367
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,400
Gosh!

368
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,839
I've entered top 10!

369
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,719
Look.

370
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,460
(Congratulations on being nominated
for Youxun Comic Competition.)

371
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,479
It's awesome.

372
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,040
I knew you could make it.

373
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,640
I'm outstanding, right?

374
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,560
Let's leave now.

375
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,940
(Cartoon Competition)

376
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,860
(Youxun Comic Competition Vote Ranking)

379
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:21,920
Watch out.

380
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,560
Thank you.

381
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,800
Hello.

382
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,959
I've seen the winner list.

383
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,959
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

384
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,680
What is your plan tonight?

385
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,280
What a piece of good news.

386
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
I should celebrate with my friends.

387
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,119
-Why not...
-Hold on.

388
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,400
I have a call.

389
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,079
I'm hanging up.

390
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,560
I tried so hard to help you,

391
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,439
yet you didn't invite me
to celebrate with you.

392
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,119
Senior, did your girlfriend
cheat on you again?

393
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,520
Yes.

394
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Do you want me to pretend
as your girlfriend again?

395
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,119
Yes.

396
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,479
How about tonight?

397
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
Tonight?

398
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,719
I lent money to you last month.

399
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,160
Help me to save my pride.

400
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,520
I...

401
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,160
Don't leave me in embarrassment.

402
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:28,439
Shall I help you in your
graduation project?

403
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,760
No problem.

404
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,040
7 p.m. Tonight.

405
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,760
I'll show up beside
you looking gorgeous.

406
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,439
Okay, bye.

407
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,280
We can celebrate anytime,

408
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,760
but we mustn't miss a chance
to consult a top student.

409
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,119
Would Gu Nanzhou

410
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,119
mind?

411
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,239
It's my own matter.

412
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,479
It has nothing to do with him.

413
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:59,479
It's a piece of cake for me.

414
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,680
I'll go with you.

415
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,239
I'll pretend as my senior's girlfriend.

416
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,000
Why should you be there?

417
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
Do you want a love triangle?

418
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,239
Don't cause a scene.

419
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
I'll make a move first.

420
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,800
You should dine alone.

421
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,000
Here is the information of
a few investment companies.

422
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,359
You may go through it.

423
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,319
Thank you.

424
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:30,119
By the way,

425
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,040
happy birthday.

426
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,199
How do you know I like this bracelet?

427
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,160
Did you check my social media?

428
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,359
Nanzhou,

429
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,839
although you look distant,

430
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,359
you're a caring man.

431
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,319
You're a gentle person.

432
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
It's a thoughtful gift.

433
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:02,920
I like it very much.

434
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,319
Jiang Xiaochuan chose it for you.

435
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,760
You should thank him instead.

436
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,599
I'm glad that you like it.

437
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,160
All the best.

438
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,400
Nanzhou.

439
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,920
Can you put it on me?

440
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,199
By the way,

441
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,560
are you free tonight?

442
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,800
I want to talk about
the investment companies with you.

443
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,479
Moreover,

444
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,520
I have no close friend
who I can invite.

445
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,719
Take it as my birthday celebration.

446
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,599
All right.

447
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,239
See you tonight.

448
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,839
This way, please.

449
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:19,760
Please have your seat.

450
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,000
-Please place an order.
-Okay.

451
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,000
Nanzhou, what would you want to have?

452
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,239
Anything will do.

453
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,959
You may consider our couple set.

454
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,160
It's very suitable.

455
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,719
Not bad.

456
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,640
It's sumptuous and good value for money.

457
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,000
Nanzhou,

458
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,520
why don't we order this?

459
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,479
We'll have the set then.

460
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,640
-Okay.
-Thank you.

461
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,839
Shall I remove the extra set of utensil?

462
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:04,760
No.

463
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,719
There is another person.

464
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,239
Okay.

465
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Nanzhou,

466
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,079
did you invite someone else?

467
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,520
There should be a cake
for your birthday.

468
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I told Xiaochuan to buy it.

469
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
You can save the trouble, actually.

470
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,680
It's fine.

471
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,319
He'll arrive later.

472
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:51,839
Please enjoy.

473
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,800
Thank you.

474
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,040
Let's take that table, my dear.

475
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,439
Sure.

476
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,800
I have a friend who
has opened a new pub.

477
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,439
Let's pay him a visit later.

478
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,560
Let's go to another restaurant.

479
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,359
My ex-girlfriend is there already.

480
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,160
My plan will be in vain if we
change to another restaurant.

481
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,520
Sit down.

482
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,439
Please place an order.

483
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,520
-Okay.
-My dear.

484
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Allow me.

485
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,040
Hand-peeled bamboo shoots for one.

486
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,239
Pan-fried foie gras.

487
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,439
Minty crispy meat.

488
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,359
Is this okay, my dear?

489
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,079
Of course.

490
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,000
That's all.

491
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:10,959
Okay.

492
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,239
Menu, please.

493
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
I still need it.

494
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,439
Sure. Please hold on.

495
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,599
Okay.

496
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,239
(I thought of celebrating with you,)

497
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,640
(yet you already have a date.)

498
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,079
Nanzhou,

499
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,199
shall we have a bottle of red wine?

500
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't think so.

501
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,040
I still have to work tomorrow.

502
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,400
Don't keep blocking
your face with the menu.

503
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,079
She can't see our interaction.

504
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,959
Sorry.

505
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,479
My dear,

506
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,280
try this.

507
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,760
-Is it delicious?
-Yes.

508
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,839
You're quite close to your girlfriend.

509
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,880
You purposely came to show off.

510
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,000
Why? Couldn't I do that?

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Are you jealous?

512
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,479
Zhou Jianqing?
