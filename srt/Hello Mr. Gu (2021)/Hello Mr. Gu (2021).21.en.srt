(since when I've fallen for you.)

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,840

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,440
(the moment I see you.)

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,240

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,680

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
how's your work lately?

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,760
Not bad.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
Look at the candles.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,600
You bought them.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,920

Can you tell me now?

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Not yet, I think.

last night

It isn't necessary.

108
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,280
I think I can recall it.

109
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,520
Didn't you tell me this?

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
You have to take responsibility

111
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,640
for what you've done.

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,280
You're making me sound like a bad lover.

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Are you seriously

114
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
not going to take responsibility for it?

115
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,560
What do you want me to do?

116
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,760
First of all,

117
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
you must take full responsibility

118
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,160
after what happened.

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,040
From now on,

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,040
we're officially together.

121
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,440

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,360

I'm now your fiancé,
as well as your boyfriend.

126

Therefore,

127

a secret relationship?

131

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,560
That's your unique bad cuisine.

174
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
Bad cuisine?

175
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,920
I...

176
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,080
Master.

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,800
There's smoke!

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,680
Do I need to call the police?

179
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
What's going on?

180
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,920
What are you doing?

181
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm fine.

182
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Go away. Leave it to me.

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,040
It's okay.

184
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Just wait outside.

185
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,160
You...

186
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
What happened to your lips?

187
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,440
How do I look? Am I pretty?

188
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Are you poisoned?

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,280
Go away.

190
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,320
What's wrong?

191
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,120
It's painful.

192
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,360
I...

193
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
I hardly exerted strength.

194
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,800
You did last night.

195
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,680
Done.

196
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,440
Go to work now.

197
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,040
Remember to miss me.

198
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm leaving.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,160
Bye.

200
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,560
Drive safely!

201
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,000
She fell for you first.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Gu Nanzhou.

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
She confessed her feelings to you.

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
She could barely control
her love for you.

205
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,160
What?

206
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
You really got together with him?

207
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Just calm down.

208
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Sit down and talk.

209
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,600
I was actually confused.

210
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,320
Before I knew it, we have
already gotten together.

211
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,159
What we learnt before

212
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
was totally useless.

213
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,240
Who confessed first?

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,960
It was him.

215
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,560
He actually couldn't
wait to confess to me.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,800
What happened next?

217
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,680
Then

218
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,520
he told me to be responsible for him.

219
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Be responsible for him?

220
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,640
He confessed his feelings first.

221
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,120
Why did he ask you to be responsible?

222
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,800
What does that mean?

223
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,640
What's done can't be undone.
Do you have to play along

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
or does he genuinely love you?

225
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,360
Forget it.

226
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Anyway, our relationship is confirmed.

227
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,320
We can leave that for later.

228
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,440
By the way,

229
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,760
you wanted to see me urgently.

230
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,080
Do you have anything to tell me?

231
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,920
I just want to tell you

232
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,640
I've also gotten together
with the guy I like.

233
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,040
Seriously?

234
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,280
Who is he? Is he handsome?

235
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,000
How old is he?

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,720
What does he do?

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,520
You...

238
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,720
Don't ask me so many questions at once.

239
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
We just got together.

240
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,960
You can meet him much later.

241
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,600
Come on.

242
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,760
Why are you being so secretive to me?

243
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
Time for lunch.

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
I have to go.

245
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,160
I want to deliver lunch to Gu Nanzhou.

246
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,200
You...

247
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
You're putting your boyfriend
above your friend.

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,520
Hi.

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,120
Hi.

250
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,160
I'd like to order takeaway
of fish congee.

251
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,840
Sure.

252
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,320
Anything else?

253
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,160
I want rice noodle rolls, too.

254
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,520
Thank you.

255
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,040
Sure.

256
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Hello.

257
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,440
Just a moment, please.

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,560
Qingqing.

259
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,720
Ms. Jiang.

260
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,680
What a coincidence.

261
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,920
Are you also getting fish congee?

262
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes.

263
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,760
Hi, Miss.

264
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,720
Here's your fish congee.

265
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,280
Thank you.

266
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll go now.

267
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Bye.

268
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,320
(She's here to buy the same food.)

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
(Could she be buying for Gu Nanzhou?)

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Excuse me.

271
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
Please speed up my order.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,720
I'm in a hurry.

273
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,360
Sure.

274
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,840
Nanzhou.

275
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,520
I bought you fish congee

276
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,800
on my way back.

277
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,880
Thank you.

278
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,800
You're welcome.

279
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,520
Gu Nanzhou!

280
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
What brings you here?

281
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
I was just passing by.

282
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,440
I bought you fish congee,

283
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,960
as well as

284
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,480
rice noodle rolls.

285
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,800
What a coincidence.

286
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,760
There are two portions of fish congee.

287
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,720
Since there are two
portions of fish congee,

288
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,920
I shall share it with Jiang Xiaochuan.

289
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
I'm sure he hasn't had lunch yet.

290
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Sure, Mr. Gu.

291
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,440
Listen carefully.

292
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
From now on,

293
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,440
you shall only consume
the lunch I buy.

294
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,120
Otherwise,

295
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,840
you're dead meat.

296
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,080
Fine.

297
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Lower your voice.

298
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,920
Don't embarrass me.

299
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm your girlfriend.

300
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
Why should I lower my voice?

301
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,600
I promise

302
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,560
I won't touch others.

303
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,560
Are you even thinking of that?

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,520
I...

305
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
I mean the congee.

306
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
What a fierce girlfriend.

307
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,120
I shall only eat
the food you bring, okay?

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,240
Who are you calling a fierce girlfriend?

309
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,240
Tell me.

310
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
We're in the office.

311
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Watch your behavior.

312
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I'm telling you now.

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,720
Finish it.

314
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I want to see nothing left.

315
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,960
Got it.

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
How is it?

317
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,080
I heard

318
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,480
that you recently rejected
your junior's love confession.

319
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,360
Why?

320
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
I've seen her before.

321
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
She's cute and talented.

322
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,240
Tell me.

323
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
It's nothing.

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,880
I am not into her.

325
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,120
You are not into her?

326
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,000
What's your type then?

327
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,000
Let me know.

328
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,560
I'll find one for you.

329
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,200
No.

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
You don't have to do that.

331
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't have to do that?

332
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
What do you mean?

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,680
You are not into girls?

334
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,760
Just kidding.

335
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,560
You don't have to be shy.

336
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,960
You can just tell me.

337
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,480
You aren't required to marry her

338
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,200
even if I introduce a girl to you.

339
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,760
Qingqing,

340
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
are you free tomorrow night?

341
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,560
Why?

342
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,920
I want

343
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
to take you to a place.

344
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Where to?

345
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,920
I think this is a nice place.

346
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
Look,

347
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
the lighting is good.

348
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
The atmosphere is good, too.

349
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Most importantly,

350
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
it's free.

351
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,320
It isn't about work.

352
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,480
It's my personal matter.

353
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,880
Qingqing.

354
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,520
Why are you here?

355
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm here to pick you up.

356
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,400
You've been working all day.

357
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,400
You must be tired.

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,640
Not too bad.

359
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,000
You two...

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,560
Oh yes.

361
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,720
He's now my boyfriend.

362
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,080
Boyfriend?

363
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,439
Yes.

364
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
A real boyfriend.

365
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,720
By the way,

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
something suddenly came to my mind.

367
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,720
Tomorrow night,

368
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
we may be attending a gathering.

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,200
What kind of gathering is that?

370
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,160
Why didn't you inform me earlier?

371
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,280
Do I need to wear a formal dress?

372
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,360
Don't worry.

373
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,800
I've prepared the things you need.

374
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,400
Do you guys have anything
important to talk about?

375
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,800
That's all.

376
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
I'll go now if there's nothing else.

377
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,200
Zhang Yin.

378
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,160
Is it a piece of breaking news?

379
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,000
Anyway, he'd know sooner or later.

380
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,920
I can wait to tell the whole world.

381
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,960
Let's go home.

382
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,280
Why are you eating my strawberries?

383
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,920
I was trying them to
see if they're sweet.

384
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,640
Stop right there.

385
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,680
Yours are indeed sweeter.

386
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,760
(Zhang Yin)

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,760
What are you doing?

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,680
Let's watch the movie.

389
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,360
Zhang Yin wants to
talk to me about work.

390
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,280
You may talk to him tomorrow.

391
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
Can you stop being unreasonable?

392
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
You're now my girlfriend.

393
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,240
You aren't allowed to answer calls
from other men late at night.

394
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
This is a hard rule.

395
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,000
Zhang Yin isn't any other guy.

396
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
It's even worse if it's Zhang Yin.

397
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,560
You can't do it today.

398
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,240
From now on, you shouldn’t do that too.

399
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,680
From now on,

400
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
you aren't allowed to
call him after 10 p.m.

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Also, you can't spend
time alone with him.

402
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,720
Gu Nanzhou,

403
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
now I realize

404
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,000
you get jealous easily.

405
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
It's because he has
an ulterior motive about you.

406
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,040
I'm kind enough

407
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
to let you two remain friends.

408
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
Ulterior motive?

409
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,600
What ulterior motive
can he possibly have?

410
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,920
You mean he's thinking
of getting a pay raise?

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,680
The way you're jealous

412
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,000
is so cute.

413
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm serious.

414
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Fine.

415
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
Don't be mad.

416
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm your little cutie pie.

417
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,160
I belong only to you.

418
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,000
It won't work even if you kiss me.

419
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
I won't change

420
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,080
my rules.

421
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,640
Fine.

422
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,160
I'll follow your rules.

423
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,319
However,

424
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,120
you must fulfill a condition.

425
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,560
What's that?

426
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,560
You shall not go out with
Jiang Jingxuan alone.

427
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,880
I promise you.

428
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,160
You also can't smile at her.

429
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,000
You aren't allowed to have
the fish congee bought by her.

430
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,920
I'll strictly abide by it.

431
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
She can't sit on
the passenger seat beside you.

432
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
She can't even touch it.

433
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,960
From now on,

434
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,040
you must answer it

435
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,000
when I call you.

436
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,040
Also,

437
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
you shall not come home later then 10 p.m.

438
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,240
You always come home later than 10 p.m.

439
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
when you work late.

440
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,240
Does that count?

441
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm working overtime. It's business.

442
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,320
Me, too.

443
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,840
I'll inform you beforehand

444
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,800
when there's a unique situation.

445
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,760
I'll do the same

446
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,040
when there's a unique situation.

447
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Gu Nanzhou.

448
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,160
We should go on a date tomorrow.

449
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's go for an outing.

450
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,680
Sure.

451
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,400
I'll follow what my girlfriend says.

452
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,600
Gu Nanzhou,

453
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,520
come over.

454
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,440
Let's take a picture together.

455
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,120
Just a minute.

456
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Let me send this message first.

457
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,480
This is our first date.

458
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,960
Can you be more focused?

459
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,000
Stop texting.

460
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,240
Sure.

461
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
Look at the screen.

462
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,640
I need to take this.

463
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,600
I will be right back.

464
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,680
Hello.

465
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,280
How many times have I told you?

466
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,920
We have to be responsible for Xingyun.

467
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
You have to be careful with the details.

468
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,520
Our clients aren't paying us

469
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
for nothing.

470
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Our reputation is important.

471
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,040
You got it?

472
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,000
No.

473
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,960
I can't compromise on this.

474
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,000
You have to let Jiang Jingxuan
and Jiang Xiaochuan

475
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,800
be fully in charge of it.

476
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,280
Contact me again if there's

477
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,200
any unexpected situation.

478
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,160
Sure.

479
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,360
Keep in touch.

480
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,600
Qingqing.

481
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you want to go for a walk?

482
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,400
No.

483
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,640
How about

484
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,560
watching TV together?

485
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,680
No.

486
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,800
Do you want to
eat anything? I'll buy it.

487
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,240
No!

488
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,320
What's wrong?

489
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Are you angry?

490
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,320
Do you have stomachache?

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,960
I was left alone in
the cold wind all day.

492
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Of course it hurts.

493
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,280
What are you doing?

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Come on.

495
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,880
What are you doing?

496
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,000
Here.

497
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,000
It's cold on the hill.

498
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,120
Soak your feet.

499
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,600
Your body will feel warm.

500
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
It'll soothe your pain.

501
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,960
Why is your hair still wet?

502
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,640
Why didn't you blow-dry your hair?

503
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,680
I didn't want to move
because of stomachache.

504
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,000
Here.

505
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
You must remember

506
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
to blow-dry your hair after a shower

507
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,600
before you lie down on the bed.

508
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
You're a girl.

509
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,440
You have to pay more attention to this.

510
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,480
Got it.

511
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,520
It was my fault.

512
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,160
I'll finish my job

513
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,920
before going on a date
with you next time,

514
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,200
okay?

515
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,640
Don't do it again.

516
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,720
Got it?

517
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
Yes.
