=Hello Mr. Gu=

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,775
=Episode 8=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,251
(Party B's Obligation)

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr. Gu,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,639
your coffee.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,319
No sugar, remember?

34
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,120
Sorry, I forgot.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,279
I'll make another cup for you.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,400
The format is wrong.

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,399
Font face of Song 4.

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,160
1.5-spacing.

39
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,080
Didn't you see the remark?

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,039
All right, I'll redo it.

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,559
I asked you to categorise them

42
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,240
according to time and
production companies.

43
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,520
How could you mess up
something as simple as this?

44
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,360
Redo it.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,240
All right.

46
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,720
You can't even button my shirt right.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,279
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,279
I'll do it again for you.

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,240
Can't you match the colors well?

50
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,880
Got it.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
You don't know how to tie a tie either?

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,320
I'll be done right away.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,520
Enough.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,479
You don't have to tie it.

55
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,839
Show me the amended draft.

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,039
There isn't a problem.

57
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,199
Just edit the fighting scene

58
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,279
based on what's been discussed

59
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,279
in the meeting yesterday.

60
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,000
All right.

61
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,479
Mr. Gu,

62
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,520
at 11.30 a.m,

63
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,720
you have a meeting
with Mr. Wu from T2 Entertainment.

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,479
Bring along the files

65
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,000
in the brown folder.

66
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,000
Start the car first.

67
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,559
Okay.

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,679
Nanzhou,

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,679
why don't I go for the meeting today?

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,119
I'm rather close to Mr. Wu.

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,800
Okay.

72
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,720
Jingxuan will go with me today.

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,960
As for you,

74
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,320
just stay in the office.

75
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,759
Mr. Gu, thank you for
your hard work today.

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,279
Goodbye.

77
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,759
Mr. Gu,

78
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,559
your suit...

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,479
I'm so sorry.

80
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,039
Goodbye.

81
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:41,960
Goodbye.

82
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,039
I only asked you

83
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,119
to buy a suit for me.

84
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Why did you even

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
mess that up?

86
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,559
Did I not give you enough money

87
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,880
or did you not understand what I said?

88
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,800
I just wanted to save
some money for you.

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,839
What did you say?

90
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,639
I mean

91
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,160
you're right.

92
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,039
It's my fault.

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,520
You're fast in admitting your fault.

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
You admit you're wrong
but you never change.

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
I wake you up every day now

96
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,440
and you never prepare breakfast.

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,039
I told you to depart early

98
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,800
to avoid the morning peak.

99
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,440
Have you ever obeyed me?

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,679
You've never been late because of me.

101
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,640
So you think you're right?

102
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,160
I didn't expect

103
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,600
my brother-in-law to be bad-tempered.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
You're indeed a boss.

105
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,320
You're even bossing
your girlfriend around.

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,399
Brother,

107
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,480
we're talking about work.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,239
Are you his maid?

109
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,559
Why are you carrying so much stuff?

110
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,119
You used to do this to me, too.

111
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,040
What's the matter?

112
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,239
Why do you think it's inappropriate now?

113
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,519
I'm your brother.

114
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Who

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,799
does he think he is?

116
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:50,600
You...

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,079
Brother,

118
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,200
why are you here?

119
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,359
I'm here to send you food,

120
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,040
that's why.

121
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,679
All right.

122
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,720
I'll take the food.

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,559
Go back.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
I came all the way to send food to you.

125
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Are you keeping me out?

126
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,679
Brother,

127
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,679
later Nanzhou will try
to get me to sleep

128
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,119
and act intimately with me.

129
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,920
What's the matter?

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
Do you want to take a tour?

131
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,640
Zhou Jianqing, you...

132
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Enough.

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,279
Hurry up.

134
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
Go.

135
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,160
I...

136
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Just go.

137
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,200
Your brother is not
allowed to visit again.

138
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,040
If he does,

139
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,040
I'll double the rental.

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,239
No,

141
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll try my best.

142
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,239
The special effects companies you picked

143
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,679
are great,

144
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,720
but the cost will multiply.

145
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
A few years ago,

146
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,799
Tuxing wanted to make

147
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,880
an animation that transcended the era.

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,079
You saw the outcome.

149
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,200
I think Tuxing failed

150
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,320
because they cared
more about special effects

151
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,519
than the script

152
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,519
and the details.

153
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,399
I have the confidence

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,279
that Lake Xingling

155
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,000
will not repeat the same mistake.

156
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,399
It's not that I don't trust your work,

157
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,000
but a broken chain is
every investor's nightmare.

158
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,440
We can't possibly invest in a project

159
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,640
that might cause us to
lose money anytime.

160
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Investing more in special effects

161
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,200
will undoubtedly increase the cost,

162
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,480
but the enhanced quality of the work

163
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,839
will be another protection

164
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,640
for the investor.

165
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,279
We understand what you mean.

166
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,079
Our company might need

167
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,399
to reconsider Lake Xingling.

168
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,720
Please understand that.

169
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Nanzhou,

170
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,880
eat something.

171
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,440
Avocado, surf clams

172
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,480
and low-calorie sauce.

173
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,959
They're all your favorites.

174
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,799
Thank you.

175
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,799
Lately,

176
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,799
you've been having the takeaway
bought by Qingqing.

177
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,320
Are you not used to it?

178
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,200
Little girls are like that.

179
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,519
They do

180
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,880
whatever they want.

181
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,200
If you don't want to tell her off,

182
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,519
I can bring you food.

183
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,119
It's okay.

184
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,959
You mentioned something on WeChat.

185
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,720
What is it?

186
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,160
I almost forgot.

187
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,640
Ant Paradise is nominated

188
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,959
(Award Ceremony)
for the top prize of children category

189
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,160
in Golden Apple Animation Festival.

190
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,519
The committee contacted me

191
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,119
and said you're required

192
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,399
to give a three-minute speech.

193
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,119
I know

194
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,079
you might not like
this kind of occasion.

195
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,239
However, many companies

196
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,239
in the industry
will attend this ceremony.

197
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:46,880
I think

198
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
this is a great opportunity

199
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
to promote Lake Xingling.

200
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,839
Also, the committee

201
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,079
said

202
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,399
you could ask your date to
collect the award on your behalf.

203
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,279
All right,

204
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,399
I'll leave

205
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,480
the communication to you.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
We're here.

207
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Come on, uncles and aunts. This way.

208
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,399
Watch out.

209
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,839
It looks great.

210
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,679
Look, it's awesome.

211
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's line up here.

212
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,959
-This is not bad.
-What's wrong

213
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,720
with this car?

214
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,359
I know, right?

215
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,200
Why did he simply park it?

216
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Young man,

217
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,880
why did you park the car so close?

218
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,399
How can we get off?

219
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,440
That's right, move it.

220
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,799
Yes. Why did you park it here?

221
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,760
Just move the car.

222
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,159
Don't park it here.

223
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,520
We can't even get off.

224
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Move it.

225
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,479
Young man.

226
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,559
Young man.

227
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,599
Young man.

228
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,440
He's leaving.

229
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,479
Young man, where are you going?

230
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,559
Young man.

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
What's going on?

232
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Young man.

233
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,080
What should we do if you leave?

234
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,900
(Dear)

235
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,620
(Dear)

236
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,940
(Jiang Jingxuan)

237
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,799
Nanzhou,

238
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,960
do you want to eat anything?

239
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,799
I'll cook for you.

240
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:07,880
It's all right,

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,760
you may go back to office.

242
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,919
You're unwell.

243
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm worried.

244
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,440
Also,

245
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,479
I can handle

246
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,719
the company's affairs here.

247
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,119
Get Zhou Jianqing

248
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,280
to handle the stuff here.

249
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,580
(Dear)

250
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,820
(Dear)

251
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
Why isn't he picking up?

252
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,479
Nanzhou,

253
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,159
you need to rest now.

254
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,919
Why don't you transfer your calls

255
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,280
to my phone first?

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll handle the work for you.

257
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,280
All right.

258
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,119
By the way,

259
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,440
text Zhou Jianqing

260
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,559
and tell her to come back soon.

261
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,679
Sure.

262
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,960
What's wrong?

263
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,039
Are you done with the storyboard?

264
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,599
I'll give it to you tonight.

265
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
I've been tortured by Gu Nanzhou

266
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,479
in the past two days.

267
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,599
I have no time to draw.

268
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:12,799
How about this?

269
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,880
Let's draw in the library.

270
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,320
We'll go home after you're done.

271
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,479
I don't want you to stay up again.

272
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,640
However, Gu Nanzhou...

273
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,599
If he needs you,

274
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,919
he'll look for you.

275
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,039
Let's go.

276
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,919
The deadline is approaching.

277
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,599
Take your stuff.

278
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,280
Come on, hurry up.

279
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,679
Aren't you asleep yet?

280
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,640
So you did come back.

281
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,080
I was rushing to submit the comic.

282
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,880
You've been calling me.

283
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,119
What's so urgent?

284
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,239
Even if it was urgent,

285
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,559
could I count on you?

286
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,080
Jiang Jingxuan never forgets

287
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,479
what I tell her to do.

288
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,880
Did she tell you?

289
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,119
What is it?

290
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,359
There's an awarding ceremony tomorrow.

291
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,640
Ask her about the details.

292
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,280
What's the awarding ceremony about?

293
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Call her to ask her.

294
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Why did he turn moody all of a sudden?

295
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
It's not like he's having period.

296
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,280
You look elegant.

297
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,200
Very few can carry this gown.

298
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
It's customized

299
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,679
for someone like you

300
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,679
who has a great figure
and an air of elegance.

301
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,520
(Zhou Jianqing)

302
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,960
Hello, Qingqing.

303
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,640
What's the matter?

304
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,280
Xuan,

305
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,799
Mr. Gu wants me to ask you

306
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,239
about the awarding ceremony.

307
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
He wants me to get ready.

308
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,200
How should I get ready?

309
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,400
Look,

310
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,760
Xingyun's Ant Paradise

311
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,599
is nominated for the best
animation for children

312
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,200
at an animation festival.

313
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,119
Mr. Gu needs a date

314
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,520
to attend the event with him.

315
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,200
What should I wear

316
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,479
for that kind of occasion?

317
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't even have a proper dress.

318
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't care too much about it.

319
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,599
Those who are attending
it tomorrow are animators.

320
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,119
They're very casual.

321
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,359
Just wear

322
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,599
something that's comfortable.

323
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,359
You mean I don't have to dress formally?

324
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,520
I'll simply pick one then.

325
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,000
How about a T-shirt

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,159
of One Piece theme?

327
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,039
It matches the theme of
the anime and manga festival.

328
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,679
How about this?

329
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,960
Just pick

330
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,719
the most comfortable
outfit that fits you.

331
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,599
Nanzhou and I will meet up

332
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,280
with the committee at tomorrow noon.

333
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,400
Just come over at noon.

334
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,080
I'll send you the address later.

335
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,719
All right, thank you, Xuan.

336
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,640
Goodbye.

337
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,200
Hi.

338
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,280
Miss.

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,559
Pack this for me.

340
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,200
All right.

341
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
(I'm already at the venue.)

342
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,919
(Don't be late.)

343
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,799
(Okay, I'll depart right away.)

00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,200
Okay.

347
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,080
This way, please.

348
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,280
Where are you?

349
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,479
I'm at the entrance.

350
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,239
On your left.

351
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,400
You...

352
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm here.

353
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Why are you dressed like this?

354
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,119
I...

355
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,679
Isn't this an anime and manga festival?

356
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,400
My attire matches the theme.

357
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,280
Qingqing,

358
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,640
you're dressed too casually.

359
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,200
Jingxuan,

360
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,039
didn't you tell me

361
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,479
to wear something that fits me?

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,239
Yes,

363
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,039
I meant something that fits you

364
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,320
and your demeanor,

365
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,239
but

366
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,039
this is too plain.

367
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,719
Do you think you're going on an outing?

368
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
(You're wearing a dress)

369
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,520
(yet you asked me to wear a T-shirt.)

370
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,640
(Forget it.)

371
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
(I volunteered to work for him.)

372
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,400
(I shouldn't be mad.)

373
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,640
Nanzhou,

374
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,880
it's Qingqing's first time

375
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,039
participating in such an event.

376
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,280
It's inevitable.

377
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,359
Why don't...

378
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,559
Go in her place.

379
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,919
Gu Nanzhou.

380
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,280
I didn't even finish drawing my comic.

381
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,840
I came all the way

382
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,520
to attend this
awarding ceremony with him,

383
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,679
yet he pulled a long face.

384
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,640
Who cares about it?

385
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Jiang Jingxuan never forgets

386
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,520
what I tell her to do.

387
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't care too much about it.

388
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,199
Those who are attending
it tomorrow are animators.

389
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
They'll dress casually.

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,880
Just pick

391
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,239
the most comfortable
outfit that fits you.

392
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,920
(So you're into Gu Nanzhou.)

393
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,800
(Why did you have to plot against me?)

394
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,719
(Do you think I'm a pushover?)

395
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,280

396
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,520

397
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,439
The nominees for best
animation for children

398

400
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,640
The award of the best animation

401
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,359

00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,599
Depends on Xingyun's progress.

517
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,359
Can we talk?

518
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,560
What's your expectation

519
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,599
for the box office?

520
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,199
Please tell us.

521
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,000
(Yingqi Investment President)
Yes, tell us.

522
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,839
As long as Xingyun makes

523
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,199
what the audience loves,

524
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,439
we won't fare too badly

525
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,560
-at the box office.
-Of course.

526
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,560
What are you doing?

527
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,760
Qingqing,

528
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,439
you're careless.

529
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,079
You didn't even remove the label.

530
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,839
If others see this,

531
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,079
they might think

532
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,160
you're returning the dress
after wearing it.

533
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,959
Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

534
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,160
Don't mention it.

535
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,239
You've done Mr. Gu a huge favor.

536
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm really happy for you.

537
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,839
If you're the one

538
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,560
who went on the stage today,

539
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,599
perhaps you would be even happier.

540
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,839
I'm

541
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,119
actually fairly approachable.

542
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,280
If you want anything,

543
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,439
I can give it to you.

544
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,239
It's just that...

545
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:38,880
What happened today

546
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,239
was due to miscommunication.

547
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,199
If you don't know anything,

548
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,719
you can ask me in advance.

549
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,959
After all,

550
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,959
I'm more knowledgeable than you.

551
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,560
Why is she pretending?

552
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,079
My label.

553
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,719
Why should I even try?

554
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,520
If she wanted to go,

555
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,800
I should've just let her go.

556
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
Why are you staying in the room?

557
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,959
Are you happy

558
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,280
with my performance today, Mr. Gu?

559
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,599
Mr. He from Yingqi Investment
approached me.

560
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,599
He said you did well.

561
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,239
Because of what you said,

562
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
he's interested in Xingyun

563
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,040
and Lake Xingling now.

564
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,400
Seriously?

565
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,439
Do you mean

566
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,079
Yingqi which produced
The Legend of the Valley?

567
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
I told you I am awesome, right?

568
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,160
If they really invest in you,

569
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,000
shouldn't you

570
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,599
pay me commission?

571
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Your performance tonight

572
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,800
was indeed great.

573
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,359
Mr. He said

574
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,479
judging from your aura,

575
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:50,359
those who aren't familiar with you

576
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,680
might think you're a celebrity.

577
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Of course.

578
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,000
Don't you know?

579
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,040
I used to be

580
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
a little princess in Nancheng.

581
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,880
Whenever I celebrated my birthday,

582
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,599
my father

583
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,479
would invite all famous people

584
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,560
in the city.

585
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,119
It's

586
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,239
even grander than this.

587
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,319
Such an awarding ceremony

588
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,319
is nothing to me.

589
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,599
Is this your label?

590
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,479
I accidentally ruined it.

591
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,280
Are you planning to
return it after wearing it?

592
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,719
Of course not.

593
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,680
It's just a dress.

594
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,239
It's not like I can't afford it.

595
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,359
Good.

596
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,719
I thought

597
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,479
of getting the company to reimburse it.

598
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:36,839
Okay,

599
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,239
please reimburse it, boss.

600
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,719
Didn't you say...

601
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,680
I really can't afford it.

602
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,640
Also, I came

603
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,959
to participate in Xingyun's event,

604
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,040
and pretend as your fiancée.

605
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,359
According to the agreement,

606
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,400
Party A should bear the cost, right?

607
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,160
What about Party B's professionalism?

608
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,560
Well,

610
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,920
the dress...

611
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,959
Look for Jiang Xiaochuan.

612
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,839
Thank you, boss.

613
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,400
Thank you.

614
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:19,760
For these problems,

615
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
fix them according to what I said.

616
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,760
Okay.

617
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,439
Zhou Jianqing.

618
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,160
Follow up with him.

619
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,959
Mr. Gu,

620
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,560
I think Qingqing went to the bathroom.

621
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,239
All right,

622
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,079
you may leave first.

623
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay, Mr. Gu.

624
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,280
I can't even finish it.

625
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,319
How to submit it?

626
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,959
Hello.

627
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,040
Hello.

628
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,319
How are things at your side?

629
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,359
The part you assigned to me

630
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,400
is basically done.

631
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,520
I'll adjust the details
before sending it to you.

632
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,560
You're indeed fast.

633
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,760
Can I assign you one more part?

634
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,119
I can't make it.

635
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,400
Qingqing,

636
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,359
you're being too much.

637
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Please.

638
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,880
I'll pay you

639
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
an additional 20% in payment.

640
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,359
Today, my psychotic boss

641
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,839
has been monitoring me

642
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,199
for an unknown reason.

643
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,599
I tried to sneak away

644
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,839
and I almost had a heart attack.

645
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,079
I can't even slack at all.

646
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,560
Zhou Jianqing.

647
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,719
Are you in there?

648
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,439
Zhou Jianqing.

649
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm in.

650
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,319
Are you all right?

651
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,920
Mr. Gu is asking about you again.

652
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,319
Coming.

653
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm really unwell today.

654
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:46,920
Hurry up.

655
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,520
Did you hear that?

656
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,719
I'll leave it to you.

657
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,040
Mr. He,

658
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm flattered.

659
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,040
After listening to your
fiancée's speech yesterday,

660
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm impressed by you,

661
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,439
who stay true to yourself

662
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
in producing good work.

663
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,920
Is it convenient for you

664
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,680
to send me information

665
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
of Lake Xingling?

666
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,839
Sure.

667
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,599
I'll let my assistant
send it to you now.

668
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,119
Yingqi ranks the top in the industry.

669
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,680
If we can work with Yingqi,

670
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
it'll surely enhance

671
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,400
Lake Xingling.

672
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
Don't worry.

673
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
Yingqi

674
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,479
would never miss a good story.

675
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

676
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,000
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

677
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,560
Goodbye.

678
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,239
Goodbye.

679
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,520
Qingqing has been in the bathroom
the entire morning.

680
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,319
I wonder how she's doing.

681
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,839
Is she crying?

682
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,239
Her eyes were red just now.

683
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,400
I have no idea.

684
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,000
She looked tired

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,119
in the past two days.

686
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,359
She seemed troubled.

687
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,359
Is she...

688
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,599
(This girl)

689
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
(has been away and distracted all day.)

690
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,560
(Is it because)

691
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,479
(she can't bear to leave me?)

692
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:23,520
Nanzhou.

693
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:25,800
Mr. He read

694
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,000
the introduction of Lake Xingling.

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,920
He loves it.

696
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,800
He wants to talk to us face-to-face.

697
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,839
All right.

698
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,680
I didn't expect Qingqing's speech

699
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,719
had done us a huge favor.

700
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,719
She's quite capable.

701
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,359
Why don't you keep her in the company?

702
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,119
I'll consider it.

703
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,719
If you think it'll be troublesome,

704
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,599
you don't have to force it.

705
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm just saying.

706
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,800
Nanzhou,

707
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,400
I know everything.

708
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
You two have been pretending
as an engaged couple.

709
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,119
You must have your own reasons.

710
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,160
How did you find out?

711
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,359
You don't have to lie to me.

712
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,439
You should've

713
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,599
told me about it.

714
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,640
Who knows

715
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,239
I could've given you suggestions.

716
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,880
It's my own matter.

717
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:12,959
I can handle it myself.

718
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,800
Why

719
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,839
did you pick her?

720
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,560
It's working hour now.

721
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,599
Let's not discuss personal matters.

722
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,880
You two...

723
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,880
Our relationship isn't real.

724
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Xiaochuan,

725
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,599
you'll be discharged in two days?

726
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,560
Don't worry.

727
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,959
Now I'm really good

728
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,319
at making coffee now.

729
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,920
Okay.

730
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,199
That's all for now.

731
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:41,000
Bye.

732
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,300
(Nebula Carton)

733
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:47,680
Jiang Xiaochuan

734
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,839
is coming back in two days, right?

735
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,839
Yes.

736
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,959
We agreed on this.

737
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,479
As soon as he's discharged,

738
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,359
he'll replace me in work.

739
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,800
Do the handover with him then.

740
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
Yes, sir. Mr. Gu.

741
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Jianqing,

742
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,839
the boss of the female leading character

743
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
is so lame.

744
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,640
Add some characteristics.

745
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,800
Characteristics.

746
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,319
How about Dugu Nanzhou.

747
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,479
