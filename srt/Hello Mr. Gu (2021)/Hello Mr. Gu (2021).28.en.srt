(The person I can never let go.)

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,000
So they let you adapt

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,160
Sweet Pea's work?

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,800
Sweet Pea's works are
very popular recently.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,480
They're a huge publishing
company after all.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
The cover is designed quite well.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,160
Congratulations, Ms. Zhou,

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
for advancing in your career.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
Cheers.

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,520
Thank you.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Why don't we celebrate it

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,280
at another place later?

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,200
Sounds good.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
It's all right.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
I have to rush for my drawing.

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,480
Isn't it a good thing to have a new job?

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you pulling a long face?

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm thinking how to do the job well.

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm not pulling a long face.

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Anyway, your work hasn't started yet.

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
You, I

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,240
and Xia

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
will have a feast later.

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Being stuck at home

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
is no good for you.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,720
Let's go.

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,120
I...

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,920
You aren't allowed to turn it down.

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,360
After she goes home
and finishes the draft,

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll ask my friend to pick her up.

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,840
It's decided.

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,720
Let's go.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,840
Xia,

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,560
try this.

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,120
How does it taste?

66
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,080
It's tasty.

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
Eat it, Xuan.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,320
Qingqing.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
Guan Yue.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,320
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
It doesn't matter.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,680
My car is at the entrance.

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,360
Let's go.

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,920
Sure.

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
How have you been recently?

76
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,480
Not bad.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
I heard you've been
drawing comic recently.

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Isn't drawing comic by yourself

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
very dull?

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Not really.

81
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,160
Doing what I like to do

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,280
isn't that boring.

83
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
Actually, I used to like
comic a lot, too.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,720
Did you?

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,240
Have a seat.

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,280
Thank you.

87
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,120
How do you know

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
macchiato is my favorite?

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
It's simple.

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,120
Your brother mentioned you
a lot in the past few years.

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,520
Although we haven't met for many times,

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,360
it feels as if we've known
each other for a long time.

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,160
He never says anything good about me.

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
Don't listen to him.

95
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,320
However, he's right about one thing.

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,720
What is it?

97
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
You're beautiful.

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,720
Did you learn sweet-talking
from my brother?

99
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
I sincerely think you're beautiful.

100
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,360
I thought so

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
the first time I saw you in high school.

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,880
Guan Yue, I'm flattered.

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Why aren't my brother and Susu here yet?

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
I'll give them a call.

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,640
Hello,

106
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
where are you two now?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I forgot to tell you.

108
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,480
The renovation workers are coming
over for the finishing touch today.

109
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
I have to sort out the payment.

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
I might not be able to go.

111
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
What about Susu?

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,280
She's the lady boss.

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
So she has to accompany me.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,280
Zhou Zixuan, did you trick me?

115
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
Why would I trick you?

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
It's true that I can't go.

117
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Have fun.

118
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Oh right,

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,360
isn't Guan Yue

120
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
more handsome than he used to be?

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
Zhou Zixuan,

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,880
you've set me up for a blind date.

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,400
Don't say that.

124
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,600
Guan Yue is my buddy for over a decade.

125
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,360
He's definitely a good person.

126
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
He's from a rich family
and he is hardworking.

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
He even graduated from a top university.

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
Please seize this opportunity.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Thank your whole family!

130
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,920
You are welcome.

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
Don't thank yourself.

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm content as long as you cherish him.

133
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm hanging up.

134
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm going to the washroom.

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Sure.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,080
Guan Yue.

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,760
Who are you?

138
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
We met at a meal, remember?

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,720
Hi.

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Long time no see.

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,200
I heard you're working
with a startup recently.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
What kind of business is it?

143
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,480
New energy.

144
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Electric vehicles?

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,400
No.

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,080
Offshore wind power.

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Is the girl

148
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
your girlfriend?

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Not yet,

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
but she's a great girl.

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,920
I hope to date her.

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
How long have you known each other?

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
His brother and I are longtime friends.

154
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Come to think of it,

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,440
we've known each other
for almost a decade.

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
So,

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,720
you've liked her for a long time?

158
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
She's beautiful

159
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
and funny.

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,880
If it wasn't for her brother,

161
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
I would've courted her long ago.

162
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Are your feelings towards her

163
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
serious?

164
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Of course.

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,240
I've given it some thought.

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,600
If we date,

167
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll treat her well.

168
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,400
I have it all planned.

169
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,200
After we start dating,

170
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
she can do what she likes,

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,680
and

172
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,680
I'll be the breadwinner.

173
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
If she wants a child,

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
we'll have one.

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
During festivities,

176
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,160
our family

177
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
will go on a holiday in a small nation.

178
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640
I might've said too much,

179
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
because I'm a little excited
to have met her.

180
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Treat her well.

181
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,960
What took you so long?

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,600
Did Zhou Zixuan say something to you?

183
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,840
No.

184
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
I met a strange man

185
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,200
in the washroom just now.

186
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Who is he?

187
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
Could it be a con artist?

188
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,600
Did he try to sell anything to you?

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,240
No,

190
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,320
but he kept asking me about you.

191
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,720
He even told me to
take good care of you.

192
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,120
Where is he?

193
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,080
He just left.

Thank you.

219
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,160
You're welcome.

220
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,920
(Agreement Termination)

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,920
Hello.

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
Hello, Ms. Chen.

223
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm calling to check with you.

224
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Are you sure those shares

225
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
are valid?

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I've already confirmed it.

227
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
The 5% shares

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
indeed exist.

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,360
Mr. Gu Licheng transferred it to
your father before he passed away.

230
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,040
Perhaps he didn't get
to inform his family

231
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,560
since he passed away suddenly.

232
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Is it possible for me
to transfer my shares

233
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,920
to Gu Nanzhou?

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,960
He probably needs it now.

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,560
Mr. Zhou didn't have a will
when he passed away.

236
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,560
So, you and your brother have
the equal right of inheritance.

237
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,280
After you two discuss how
to distribute it,

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,480
you can handle your shares as you like.

239
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,840
Okay.

240
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Thank you.

241
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,560
You're welcome.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
Hi, here is your parcel.

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,840

247

Hello.

248
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,240
Mr. Yang,

249
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,520
hello.

250
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
What did you say?

251
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
My Paradise Street 19

252
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
is chosen

253
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
to be made into an animation?

254
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,680
All right.

255
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Of course I'm available.

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,080
Okay, see you later.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,640
Coming!

258
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,560
Coming.

259
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Why are you here?

260
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm here on your sister-in-law's order

261
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,440
to bring something to you.

262
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,440
Are these the shares you mentioned?

263
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
It's my personal belonging.

264
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Don't touch it.

265
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
You haven't thrown away
Gu Nanzhou's stuff yet?

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
I will.

267
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
I am about to throw it away.

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,760
Come on.

269
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,560
Let me ask you.

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,120
What got into you that day?

271
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,120
Why did you disappear

272
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,880
without saying a word?

273
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,680
When was that?

274
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Don't play fool with me.

275
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,200
It's the day you went on
a date with Guan Yue.

276
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,040
You kept him waiting for so long

277
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
in the restaurant.

278
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,480
So you don't even
remember anything about it?

279
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
I happened to have
an urgent matter that day.

280
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,520
After that,

281
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,560
I forgot about it.

282
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,600
Young lady,

283
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
you never learn.

284
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,680
How about this?

285
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,560
Treat Guan Yue to a meal this weekend

286
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,960
as an apology to him.

287
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,840
Treat him to a meal?

288
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,680
No way.

289
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
I got it.

290
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,200
You haven't moved on
from Gu Nanzhou, right?

291
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,680
Fine.

292
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
If you can't bear to
throw the stuff away,

293
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,240
I'll do it.

294
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,720
What are you doing?

295
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,680
Give it back to me.

296
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,680
Let go of it!

297
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,400
Then, promise me

298
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,600
that you will go on
a date with Guan Yue.

299
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
Okay.

300
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,280
Let go of it.

301
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Listen to me.

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Out with the old, in with the new.

303
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
I heard you.

304
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,560
Regarding the shares,

305
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,480
just do as the lawyer says.

306
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,760
I have urgent matters later.

307
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Just leave.

308
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,520

Bye.

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
Bye.

313
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,160
Zhou Jianqing!

(Future Animation)

316
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,680
This way.

317
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,160
Okay.

318
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,160
Ms. Zhou,

319
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,520
take a rest here first.

320
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,760
I think Xingyun is not bad.

321
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,200
I heard the visuals of Lake Xingling

322
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,120
were impressive.

323
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
The production level was quite good.

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,280
However, Xingyun

325
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,480
was sued not long ago.

326
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,480
I was told many investors

327
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,600
withdrew their investment.

328
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,240
True.

329
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,160
They are too busy dealing
with their issues now,

330
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,000
let alone producing good works.

331
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Excuse me.

332
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
May I know

333
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,480
what exactly happened to Xingyun?

334
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,560
They say it's a copyright issue.

335
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,880
It seems their boss
sold his own properties

336
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,280
to pay for compensation.

337
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,160
That's right.

338
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,640
Also, a lot of the investors

339
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,520
withdrew their investment
because of this.

340
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,280
When did this happen?

341
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
Not long ago.

342
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,840
The way I see it,

343
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Xingyun might not make it this time.

344
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,480
(A lawsuit?)

345
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,240
(So, all along,)

346
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
(he's been shouldering it alone.)

347
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,440
(I chose to leave him)

348
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
(at his most difficult moment.)

349
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,400
About the adaptation
of Paradise Street 19,

350
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Ms. Zhou Jianqing, do you, the author,

351
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
have any comment or request?

352
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,080
First of all,

353
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,320
I would like to thank all of you

354
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,720
for your recognition of my work.

355
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,400
Secondly, for the adaptation,

356
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,440
I hope to find

357
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,400
a production team which
matches my creative concept.

358
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
If it's possible,

359
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,080
I suggest cooperating with Xingyun.

360
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,120
Ms. Zhou,

361
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,040
you might not be aware.

362
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,400
Xingyun Animation is involved
in a lawsuit recently.

363
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm afraid this...

364
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,160
I believe in Xingyun.

365
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
I used to work there.

366
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
However, I didn't choose it

367
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
because of its past performance

368
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,680
or its current situation.

369
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
It's because of their boss'

370
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
perseverance in original works.

371
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,720
Sure.

372
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,360
We trust your judgment.

373
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,360
Next,

374
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,120
we'll try to liaise with Xingyun
as soon as possible.

375
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on,

376
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,880
everyone, gather round.

377
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Come on.

378
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,560
Let me introduce to you.

379
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,800
This is Zhang Yin.

380
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,000
He will be

381
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,280
our assistant for background design.

382
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,600
Let's welcome Zhang Yin.

383
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,200
Welcome.

384
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,680
Thank you, everyone.

385
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,760
Pleased to meet you.

386
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120
Let's work hard together.

387
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
How could you make such a mistake?

388
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,720
The character ratio isn't right.

389
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,600
Here you go.

390
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,360
All right, I understand.

391
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,360
Jiajia.

392
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you.

393
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,360
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

394
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,120
Mr. Gu, please sign this.

395
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,040
Thank you.

396
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,680
Mr. Gu,

397
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,240
please sign this.

398
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,120
Sure.

399
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,040
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

400
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Mr. Gu,

401
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,520
here's your coffee.

402
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,840
(Paradise Street 19 Proposal)

403
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,560
What is it?

404
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,200
Mr. Gu,

405
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
here is what I think.

406
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,840
This

407
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,600
is Qingqing's work after all.

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,680
If she can come to our company,

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,880
it might help to improve

410
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
our work efficiency.

411
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
(Paradise Street 19 Proposal)

412
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
We just happened to have accepted

413
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Future Animation's invitation
to produce an animation.

414
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
This has nothing to do

415
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,600
with Zhou Jianqing.

416
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
Nothing to do with her?

417
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,600
How can that be?

418
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,480
It's Qingqing's fruits of labour.

419
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,560
If we can invite her here,

420
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,000
we'll be able to understand

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,480
the author's thoughts
and requests better.

422
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Besides, your relationship...

423
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,200
We already broke up.

424
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,840
Now

425
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
she's just the creator

426
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,680
of one of the works we accepted.

427
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,880
We have no right

428
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
to trouble the creator.

429
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,600
(If we can invite her here,)

430
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,000
(does it mean)

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
(I'll get to meet her again?)

432
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,360
Qingqing,

433
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,360
you're really here!

434
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,320
I'm the creator,

435
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,960
as well as the consultant for
Xingyun's production team.

436
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,880
Am I brilliant?

437
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,560
Great.

438
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,440
With you around,

439
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,880
I am even more motivated to work.

440
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,360
Stop chit-chatting.

441
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
The meeting will start soon.

(Admit the mistakes. Persevere.)

461
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
(Correct your mistake. Solve
the problem. Make her feel secure.)

462
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,960
How to get back together with your ex?

463
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,320
How many times have I told you?

464
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,720
Knock on the door before you enter.

465
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm bringing you coffee.

466
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm not drinking it.

467
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,960
If you have time to search online,

468
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,200
you might as well talk to her,

469
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,480
ask her out for dinner

470
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,800
or go outside.

471
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,920
How good would it be to
create a chance encounter?

472
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
Don't say I never remind you.

473
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,920
She and her junior

474
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,360
are very close recently.

475
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
It seems your workload
isn't saturated enough.

476
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,840
You have the time to gossip.

477
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,400
Mr. Gu,

478
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
I'll get back to work now.

479
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,720
Qingqing,

480
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,400
let's attend Nancheng Anime Convention

481
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
two days later.

482
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
I heard there're many good works.

483
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Sure.

484
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,560
Oh, right.

485
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,680
Recently, I found

486
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880
a really good bullfrog restaurant.

487
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,480
Let's have some after work later.

488
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,280
I've also been craving
for bullfrog lately.

489
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,200
Mr. Gu.

490
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,960
Zhang Yin,

491
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,640
try this.

492
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,280
It's super soft and sweet.

493
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,920
What are you two talking about?

494
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,080
Just now, we're saying

495
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,720
tonight, we'd...

496
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,240
Zhang Yin,

497
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,880
try this butter-flavored potato chips.

498
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Potato chips of this brand
are very tasty.

499
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,800
The meeting will be held in
the meeting room in 20 minutes.

500
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,000
You two should get ready.

501
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,680
Why is there suddenly a meeting?

502
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,040
What do you think

503
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,040
we should do?

504
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,600
When it comes to why a couple breaks up,

505
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,520
other than a misunderstanding
and pressure from external parties,

506
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,720
there must be problems
between the two of you.

507
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,320
We had no problem.

508
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,960
Why did you break up?

509
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Rather than thinking about
how to get back with her,

510
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
you might as well think about

511
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,320
why exactly you broke up.

512
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,920
Of course,

513
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,200
most importantly,

514
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
you have to make her feel

515
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,400
your feelings towards her,

516
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,400
as well as

517
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,080
the changes you went
through during this period.

518
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,200
What do you mean by the changes?

519
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
It's not about how you've changed.

520
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,560
Instead, you have to make her feel

521
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,480
that you've changed.

522
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,960
If she thinks you're still the same,

523
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,400
then she'll definitely think that,

524
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,400
should you two get back together,

525
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,000
it'll still be the same outcome.

526
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,160
If she feels insecure,

527
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,720
she'll definitely choose not
to get back together with you.

528
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
Ask her out for me.

529
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,440
Just say it's about work.

530
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,520
Mr. Gu,

531
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,320
in order to show your sincerity,

532
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,840
it's better for you to
ask her out yourself.

533
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,640
Mr. Gu.

534
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Let's have burger after work later.

535
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,200
Sure.

536
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
Don't drink coffee in the next few days.

537
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,240
It's not good for your health.

538
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,240
Drink the red date tea I made for you.

539
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,840
Thank you.

540
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
Don't drink coffee during meeting.

541
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,400
This character

542
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,560
is an important supporting character.

543
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,480
However, the character has too
many scenes in the comic.

544
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
As a result, in the anime,

545
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,920
it might affect the pace
of the main storyline

546
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,760
and make it feel unnatural.

547
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
So, I suggest everyone

548
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,240
to go through all the storyline
of this character again,

549
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
remove one third of it

550
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
and keep the remaining
effective storyline.

551
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,240
Wait.

552
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm against this.

553
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
Although he's a supporting character,

554
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,000
he's the cause of the incident.

555
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,280
You can also say

556
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,400
he's one of the main roles
other than the protagonist.

557
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,000
That's right.

558
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,240
I think so, too.

559
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,280
He appears too often.

560
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Moreover, it doesn't tally

561
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,960
with the protagonist's timeline.

562
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Therefore, I think the viewers might

563
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
feel he's stealing
the protagonist's limelight.

564
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,560
All these side stories

565
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,760
are necessary.

566
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
The viewers will definitely understand

567
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,040
the relationship very quickly.

568
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,640
Ms. Zhou, you might not have

569
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
much experience in making an animation.

570
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,040
If too much ambiguous information
is given in the preliminary stage,

571
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,960
viewers might lose patience
to keep watching.

572
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,920
If we remove it as you say,

573
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,720
the preliminary plot of the animation

574
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,200
will be very flimsy.

575
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,200
The difference between
an animation and a comic is that

576
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,880
animation focuses more on the continuity

577
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,640
and the pace.

578
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,880
Sacrificing the overall sense of depth

579
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,080
and theatrical feel

580
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,000
will not bring any good.

581
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,400
Viewers are used

582
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,240
to fast-paced works.

583
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,440
This kind of adjustment

584
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,160
allows viewers to follow
the storyline better.

585
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,360
Once you remove part of the storyline,

586
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
the advancing will be implausible.

587
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,880
No.

588
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm the creator.

589
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,040
Each word the character says,

590
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,000
each action

591
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,160
or even the expression

592
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,720
is created for a reason.

593
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,080
Do you think

594
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,520
I don't know this?

595
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm sorry.

596
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,480
(Aunt Gu)

597
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,520
Hello, aunt.

598
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,680
Hello, Xiaochuan.

599
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
How are things going on between

600
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
Xiaozhou and Qingqing recently?

601
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,880
Those two?

602
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,720
Not so good.

603
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,760
Forget it.

604
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,720
It seems

605
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,160
I'll have to take action.

606
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,920
Mr. Gu,

607
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,280
I need to verify

608
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
something with you.

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,920
Go ahead.

610
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,920
Well,

611
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,160
since you and Zhou Jianqing broke up,

612
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,600
you won't object to it

613
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,760
if I court her, right?

614
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,360
I won't interfere

615
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,840
in my employees' relationships.

616
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,920
Zhou Jianqing is not my employee.

617
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,280
I don't have a say in her affairs.

618
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,240
Yes.

619
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,440
Zhang Yin,

620
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,000
no need to work overtime today.

621
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,200
Seriously?

622
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,280
Oh, right.

623
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
This is our company's new regulations.

624
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
Take a good look at it,

625
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,600
especially the sixth item.

626
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,440
(System)

627
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,040
What?

628
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,200
In order to make employees

629
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,360
focus on work during office hours,

630
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,360
all forms of office relationship
are prohibited.

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,040
Employees also cannot
develop any relationship

632
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,440
that's beyond professional
with work partners.

633
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,320
This is too harsh.
