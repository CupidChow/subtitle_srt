=Hello Mr. Gu=

29
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,937
(Episode 4)

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,360
(An eye for an eye)

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,559
How did you get in?

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,160
I was stalked today.

33
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,440
I had nowhere else to go.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,720
So I had no choice but
to come to your house.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,279
I'm asking how you got in here.

36
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,720
When I came here last time,

37
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,199
I accidentally saw you
keying in the passcode.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
According to the contract,

39
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,360
without my permission,

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,679
you have no right to enter my house.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,919
Moreover,

42
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,720
trespassing

43
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,720
is illegal.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,960
Do you want to be jailed?

45
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,720
Mr. Gu,

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,960
you're a kind person.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,759
You won't make life difficult

48
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,759
for a girl like me, right?

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,880
Still, you shouldn't have trespassed.

50
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,720
Yes.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
It's not justifiable.

52
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,199
However,

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,039
recently, there's been a lot of news

54
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,639
of girls being attacked.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,360
It's already late.

56
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,800
Do you want to see a girl

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,559
wandering on the street at midnight?

58
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,559
Who called the cops?

59
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,080
I did.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,039
What's going on?

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,320
Sir,

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
actually it's a misunderstanding.

63
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,119
I thought there's a break-in.

64
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,880
I didn't expect

65
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,199
she's the one.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,119
What's your relationship?

67
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm his fiancée.

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
We had a fight.

69
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
I left

70
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,119
and didn't tell him when I returned.

71
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,080
You called the cops over
a fight with your girlfriend.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,720
Do you think it's a joke?

73
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,039
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,000
It's indeed a misunderstanding.

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,279
If this happens again,

76
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,360
we'll handle it according to Public
Security Administration Punishments Law.

77
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,720
Watch out.

78
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes.

79
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,399
Have a safe journey.

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
(Why is she drinking water at night?)

81
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,000
(She's even eating an apple.)

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,359
(Why isn't she sleeping at this hour?)

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,679
(Yes, I'm doing this for
her own good. I am.)

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,959
Follow my rules when
you're staying here.

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
This is my resting hour.

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't exercise at midnight.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm doing yoga in the room.

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,559
Did I disturb you?

89
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,040
Yes.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I can't stand a single sound.

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Are you finding fault with me?

92
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,920
You're a man,

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,839
yet you intruded
a girl's room at midnight.

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,760
Who knows if you have ulterior motive.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,320
Anyway,

96
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,519
you're not allowed to do this anymore.

97
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,839
Mr. Gu,

98
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,959
sorry

99
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,320
for disturbing you last night.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm leaving now.

101
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,559
Come here.

102
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,559
What's the matter?

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,519
Do you know how to drink water?

104
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:02,880
If you do,

105
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
why is there so many stains?

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,239
Why don't you wipe it?

107
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:05,799
Why don't you wash

108
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,679
and place the glass
to its original spot?

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,239
I'm really sorry.

110
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll do it right away.

111
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Why didn't you clean the mud

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
on your luggage

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,320
before you entered?

114
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,559
I already

115
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,320
cleaned it last night.

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,399
Do you insist on leaving marks

117
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,160
at my home?

118
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,720
Don't get the wrong idea.

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll wipe it right away.

120
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,559
Is this all right?

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,799
I think there's a problem
with your eyesight.

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,799
Can't you tell the blanket

123
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,600
is not folded symmetrically?

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
Will this do?

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,160
Can't you hang the used towel?

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,799
Is this how a girl

127
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,920
should live?

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
I'll fold it right away.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
(She has no life skill at all.)

130
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,320
(How did she survive?)

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,079
Gu Nanzhou

132
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,160
is a devil.

133
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,720
Even if you kneel and beg me,

134
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
I will never come here.

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
What's wrong with you?

136
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Where did you go last night?

137
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
Your brother had been looking for you.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Did he call you?

139
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,119
He said he couldn't reach
you on the phone.

140
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,119
He asked your roommates.

141
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,359
They said you moved
out from the dormitory.

142
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,799
My phone ran out of battery.

143
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,160
I see.

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Where have you been?

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,000
You didn't answer my calls.

146
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,160
Nor were you staying in the dormitory.

147
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,200
Where did you go?

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
I got a new job.

149
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,079
So I moved out of the dormitory.

150
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Where's your dormitory?

151
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,559
I'll look for you later.

152
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,640
No.

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,600
The dormitory is packed.

154
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,200
So I crashed with my
new colleague for a night.

155
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,480
I'll stay in Susu's place.

156
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,239
Brother, don't worry.

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,399
Susu will take good care of me.

158
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,440
Listen.

159
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,399
You should keep me informed.

160
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,359
Keep your phone on 24/7,

161
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,000
understand?

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,239
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll look for you next time.

164
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:11,679
You...

165
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:12,880
Hello?

166
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,799
Aren't you landing me in trouble?

167
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,239
I don't want your brother to
come to my place all the time.

168
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,559
Susu,

169
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,559
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,359
I'm really sorry.

171
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,000
I was at my wit's end.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,079
You shouldn't...

173
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,239
I know you dislike my brother.

174
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,719
He's rather annoying.

175
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,960
I don't hate him.

176
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
Don't be shy.

177
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,400
He's been bullying
you since high school.

178
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,039
He asked you to buy milk tea

179
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,880
and do his homework.

180
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,640
He's despicable,

181
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,640
but don't worry,

182
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,239
I'll monitor you

183
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,880
and not let the monster bully you.

184
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,479
No.

185
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,719
I can guarantee.

186
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,200
Once I find the right place,

187
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,599
I'll move out immediately.

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,239
That's not what I mean.

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,200
You...

190
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,200
Just stay here.

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
It's okay even if your brother comes.

192
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,359
Seriously?

193
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,239
Thank you, Susu.

194
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,599
You're too kind.

195
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,080
Come on.

196
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,640
I'll reward you with a blueberry.

197
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,840
I don't have much money,

198
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,880
but I'll surely pay my debt.

199
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,159
Feel free

200
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,440
to hold me accountable.

201
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,000
Just one thing.

202
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,159
Don't harass my sister.

203
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:30,919
Someone

204
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,400
has already settled your debt.

205
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
Who did?

209
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,119
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang.

210
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,239
You're welcome, Mr. Gu.

211
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,200
If you didn't help us to
settle Zhou Zixuan's debt,

212
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,479
it wouldn't have been solved so soon.

213
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,960
Don't mention it.

214
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,200
Goodbye.

215
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,799
Goodbye.

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
Zhou,

217
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
after reading your work,

218
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,679
I'm satisfied.

219
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Your ideology

220
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,119
matches our company's

221
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,359
values.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,679
Although our company is small,

223
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,119
(Yinshan Animation)
we have a big target.

224
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,239
We want

225
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,359
to be one of the best
comic companies in China.

226
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,919
We want to create the best

227
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,640
comic in China.

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,320
I believe

229
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,000
you can surely be

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,359
a top cartoonist.

231
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,799
Thank you, boss.

232
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,479
However,

233
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,760
why don't we go through
the script first?

234
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,719
I like pragmatic people like you.

235
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
You're unlike some creators,

236
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,280
who talk big,

237
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,119
but churn out lousy work.

238
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,880
Try to understand

239
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,119
the connotation of the work.

240
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,940
(Domineering Boss
Falls for Lady Teacher)

241
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,840
Boss.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,719
A guy

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
who wants the girl to only see him,

244
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,479
think about him

245
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,880
and stay away from all other guys

246
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,200
is still a brainless domineering
character, isn't he?

247
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
What's wrong with a domineering boss?

248
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
There is no new thing under the sun.

249
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,440
The subjects are
more or less the same.

250
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,080
The point is can you make it special?

251
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,159
As long as you use your method

252
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,119
to make it interesting

253
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,799
and moving,

254
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,599
it doesn't matter

255
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,520
whether it's about a domineering boss.

256
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,280
Am I free to create as I like?

257
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,000
Of course,

258
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,200
but

259
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,679
not this one.

260
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,960
If you complete this well,

261
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,479
we'll cooperate in the next

262
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,200
and you can

263
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
draw whatever you want.

264
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,119
I'll try my best

265
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,239
to create

266
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,080
a different domineering boss.

267
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,559
However, the deadline

268
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,359
is kind of tight.

269
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,200
Sunday.

270
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,320
Can you make it on Sunday?

271
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,000
Boss,

272
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,320
it's Wednesday today.

273
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,479
I didn't ask you to
complete it on your own.

274
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,320
If you can't do it,

275
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
you can get someone to help you.

276
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,119
Why are you looking for me?

277
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,239
If

278
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
you want me to be your assistant,

279
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,719
forget it.

280
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,239
I'm sitting for an examination soon.

281
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,760
I don't have the time.

282
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,520
This time,

283
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,400
I'll fight for full payment.

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,159
It'll remain the same.

285
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,520
We'll split it.

286
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,719
I don't have the time.

287
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,919
It's all your favorite food.

288
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,400
Regarding what happened last time,

289
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,840
I didn't mean it.

290
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,320
I failed to get the payment,

291
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,400
as the boss ran away.

292
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,679
Qingqing,

293
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
do you think I became your assistant

294
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
for money?

295
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,679
I know it's not for money.

296
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
You think I have not been reliable.

297
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,679
However, I promise

298
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,840
the payment

299
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,039
will surely be more this time.

300
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,919
I've already talked to the boss.

301
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,760
What I earned as your assistant

302
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,520
was not even enough for me to buy paint.

303
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,080
Why should I be your assistant?

304
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,760
Please get someone else.

305
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,640
The boss told me

306
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
if I did a good job this time,

307
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,559
he'd let me do what I wanted next time.

308
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,080
This company is not bad.

309
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,960
Even if it's not for money,

310
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
do it for your dream.

311
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,280
Qingqing,

312
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,679
can you come to your senses?

313
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,239
You seem smart,

314
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,159
but you tend to fall for a trap

315
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,559
whenever one talks about dreams.

316
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,440
This is an opportunity.

317
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,280
Look at the great cartoonists.

318
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,119
They have overcome
all sorts of obstacles.

319
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,000
One needs to go through
challenges to achieve success.

320
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,960
It's worth trying as long as
there's space for creation.

321
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,479
Junior,

322
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,320
you have the talent to be a cartoonist.

323
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,520
You're efficient and your work is great.

324
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,479
You submit your work on time.

325
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,599
If we work together,

326
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,960
we can surely churn out good works.

327
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,960
Didn't we agree

328
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,280
to rule the cartoon industry?

329
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,000
We'll be great cartoonists

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,719
and experts in the industry.

331
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,799
Enough.

332
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,000
Fulfilling one's dream

333
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,400
needs to make attempt again and again.

334
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,239
It's not just dreaming.

335
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,799
Who told you

336
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,960
about this Chicken Soup for the Soul?

337
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,599
Did the boss

338
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,400
tell you this?

339
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
He did,

340
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
but he's right.

341
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,840
You have agreed to it, right?

342
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,479
I guarantee

343
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,239
that

344
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:29,960
it won't go wrong this time.

345
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
We'll work after the money is banked in.

346
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,880
We'll split the payment.

347
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,479
Forget it.

348
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,119
Send me the information.

349
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,440
I knew

350
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
you're the most reliable buddy.

351
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,559
I'll send it to you now.

352
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:51,840
Qingqing,

353
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,440
are you seriously marrying Gu Nanzhou?

354
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,479
Yes.

355
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,080
What do you see in him?

356
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,080
He's handsome.

357
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,880
Apart from being handsome,

358
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,239
he's running an animation company.

359
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
As for the rest,

360
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,400
it's mainly because he's handsome.

361
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:21,719
He's handsome.

362
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,280
He's not the only handsome one

363
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,200
around you.

364
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,919
Why does it have to be him?

365
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,719
You even said he had a condition.

366
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,479
As for this,

367
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,919
apart from being handsome,

368
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
he has a great figure

369
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,479
and charisma.

370
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,760
As for his condition,

371
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,640
thanks to his nice appearance,

372
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,880
I can forgive him.

373
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,840
Forget it, as long as you're happy.

374
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,220
(Hubby)

375
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,159
Hello, sir.

376
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,599
I'm Zhou Qingqing. I run
a business of running errands.

377
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm at your service.

378
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,359
There's a banquet tonight.

379
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,479
Attend it with me.

380
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Sure, sir.

381
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,400
May I know the time

382
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,439
and location?

383
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,160
Any dress code?

384
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,199
8 p.m.

385
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,599
I'll send you the address later.

386
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,520
Dress formally.

387
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,640
All right, honey.

388
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,079
I'll be there on time.

389
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,920
Wait for me.

390
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,520
Mr. Gu.

391
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm here.

392
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
I told you to dress formally,

393
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,479
not dressing for a job interview.

394
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,800
Isn't this formal attire?

395
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,760
Why don't you

396
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,079
buy her a dress?

397
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:51,839
Come on.

398
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,560
Mr. Gu!

399
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,479
Mr. Gu.

400
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,560
If I'm not mistaken,

401
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:04,800
this must be your fiancée, right?

402
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,680
You're so young.

403
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,640
Mr. Gu,

404
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,040
how can you

405
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,199
date a girl this young?

406
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,599
You even got yourself

407
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,359
a girlfriend in her twenties.

408
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,880
I must drink to you.

409
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,520
To your courage.

410
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,239
Come on.

411
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,880
Mr. Gu has low alcohol tolerance.

412
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,880
I'll drink in his place.

413
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,439
Ms. Jiang,

414
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,400
his fiancée is here.

415
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,000
You shouldn't worry about this.

416
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,560
This is between me and Mr. Gu.

417
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
Sit down.

418
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:38,199
Fine.

419
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,319
All right, Mr. Luo.

420
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,640
Stop teasing me after drinking this.

421
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,119
Come on.

422
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,760
As the saying goes,

423
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,239
happiness should be doubled.

424
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,040
Yes.

425
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,239
Mr. Gu.

426
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,359
(How's your alcohol tolerance?)

427
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,719
We met too late.

428
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,119
(What's the matter?)

429
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,760
I appreciate your talent.

430
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,560
(Mr. Gu has low alcohol tolerance.)

431
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,199
I'm happy.

432
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:03,880
(He shouldn't drink too much.)

433
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,119
We're partners now.

434
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,599
This is our first collaboration.

435
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,760
(I have great alcohol tolerance.)

436
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,400
This is our collaboration.

437
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,040
(At a key moment,)

438
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,640
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

439
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
(I can drink if you pay me.)

440
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:11,959
As for this third glass...

441
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,719
No, Mr. Luo.

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,880
I can't take it anymore.

443
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,680
You're a guy. You shouldn't say that.

444
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,439
Am I right?

445
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,119
As the saying goes...

446
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,680
(RMB100. Deal.)

447
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
We're comrades.

448
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,839
(RMB1,000 for each glass.)

449
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
We should drink.

450
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,079
(This is too much. RMB200.)

451
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
You must drink.

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,560
(RMB800.)

453
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,119
All right.

454
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:38,920
(RMB400.)

455
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,040
(That's the most I can offer.)

456
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
One more glass.

457
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,439
(RMB500.)

458
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
(That's the lowest amount.)

459
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,680
(Claim it from your boss.)

460
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,560
Don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,119
You must drink this today.

462
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,800
(Deal.)

463
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,880
Otherwise,

464
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
you're embarrassing me today.

465
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Mr. Luo.

466
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,439
I will drink instead.

467
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,920
You're a beauty saving the hero.

468
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,439
No,

469
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,160
I should be drinking in the first place.

470
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,599
Look,

471
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm the youngest here.

472
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,719
You're my senior.

473
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,040
I should drink to you.

474
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,040
I'll drink first.

475
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,719
You have great alcohol tolerance.

476
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,040
I should drink, too.

477
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,560
Mr. Gu,

478
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,119
take a seat first.

479
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,439
Mr. Luo,

480
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,000
let's drink

481
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,920
for your respect for art.

482
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,760
What do you mean?

483
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,319
I heard you're into cartoon

484
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,439
and you even plan to develop
an animation department.

485
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,599
Nowadays, those who are into cartoon

486
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
have great taste.

487
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,439
Moreover,

488
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
you're different

489
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,359
from investors who
only care about money.

490
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,680
You're a sentimental person.

491
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
Tell me.

492
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,680
How am I a sentimental person?

493
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,359
If you want to know

494
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,839
the answer,

495
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,439
drink first.

496
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,040
Sure,

497
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,400
I'll drink.

498
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:16,880
Can you tell me now?

499
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,000
Mr. Luo,

500
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:18,920
take a seat first.

501
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,439
All right.

502
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,079
Many tend to think

503
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
you can just get someone

504
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,239
to simply draw a story.

505
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,119
They're wrong.

506
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,680
Cartoon

507
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,119
conveys more about concepts

508
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,040
and thoughts other than the story.

509
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,920
A good cartoon

510
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
has a heart.

511
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,439
The exciting plot is just a medium.

512
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,920
The deep layer of core

513
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
is its soul.

514
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,520
Mr. Luo,

515
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,119
if you didn't have feelings,

516
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,839
you could've simply gotten

517
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,680
anyone to draw it.

518
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,520
You actually spent time

519
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,160
to drink with Mr. Gu.

520
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,599
You even interacted with him in depth.

521
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,040
Aren't you

522
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
being responsible for the work?

523
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,880
That makes you a person with a heart.

524
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,439
Do you think

525
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,839
I'm right?

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,560
Good.

527
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,160
Well-said.

528
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,760
She's right.

529
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,040
Interesting.

530
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
Based on your viewpoint alone,

531
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,880
I suggest everyone

532
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,280
to raise our glasses

533
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,640
for Mrs. Gu.

534
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,280
Come on.

535
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,040
Let's drink to Mrs. Gu.

536
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,239
Cheers.

537
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,640
Cheers.

538
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,599
Girl.

539
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,920
Buddy!

540
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,160
You're pleasant.

541
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,839
I hit it off with you today.

542
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,400
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

543
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,000
Sure.

544
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,920
Bottom up.

545
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,040
Sure, I will.

546
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,439
It's enough.

547
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
Leave me alone.

548
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,880
Stop her.

549
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,439
Stop drinking. You're drunk.

550
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,319
This is your 13th glass.

551
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,160
I want more.

552
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,839
I'll finish it.

553
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,439
This is fun.

554
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,439
Why are you stopping me?

555
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm really happy today.

556
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Drink tea first, all right?

557
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:08,439
Come on, cheers.

558
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:08,880
Come on.

559
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,000
All right, don't act tough.

560
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
Just drink the tea.

561
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:11,640
Come on.

562
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,439
Mr. Gu,

563
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,280
the medicine to make
her sober is down there.

564
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,479
Come on.

565
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
Mr. Gu, I'll drink to you.

566
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,880
Come on, let's drink.

567
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's drink. You...

568
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,760
Fine.

569
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,479
Are you not giving me face?

570
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,199
Listen, I can still drink.

571
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,439
What are you doing?

572
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,119
Drink this.

573
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,000
What did you feed me?

574
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,000
It's not alcohol. I want to drink.

575
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Stop it.

576
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,839
What did you tell her?

577
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,280
Nothing.

578
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,319
You'd better come clean.

579
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,040
I told her to drink for you.

580
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,199
We had a deal.

581
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,880
RMB500 for a glass.

582
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,439
You did that for RMB500 per glass?

583
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,599
Mr. Gu,

584
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,800
can I

585
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,800
reimburse this?

586
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,680
Get up.

587
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,040
Where are we sending her?

588
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,760
How would I know?

589
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,479
Well...

590
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,680
Go home.

591
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,000
Drink.

592
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,520
I'm telling you. Drink.

593
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Come on, one more glass.

594
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Come on, I'll drink to you.

595
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,199
I'm telling you.

596
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,079
I can drink another 1,000 glasses

597
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,560
to save for my down payment.

598
