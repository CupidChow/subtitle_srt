1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,620
(Hello Mr. Gu Theatre)

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,800
You actually ordered food delivery?

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,840
It's for you.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,200
Do I hear it correctly?

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,959
You ordered food for me?

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:23,799
Don't you want it?

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,000
You've ordered it anyway.

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,799
Do you want a bite?

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,520
No.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,439
It's delicious.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,560
Do you want to try it?

12
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,279
You might love it after a bite.

13
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,040
It's for you.

14
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,080
Enjoy.

15
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,919
Can you bring me some soy sauce?

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
It's quite bland.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Why do you want it saltier?

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,639
You might get high blood pressure.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,160
Can you bring me a drink?

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
Snail rice noodle is already unhealthy.

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,440
Don't have other beverage.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,760
Have some milk

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,919
or the spiciness might
hurt your stomach.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,559
(He is a thoughtful person.)

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,879
(Why must he pull a long face?)

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,839
(He's arrogant.)

27
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,760
He added sugar.

=Hello Mr. Gu=

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,855
=Episode 17=

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
(Overjealous)

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,119
Mr. Gu.

59
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,080
You have mild concussion.

60
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,240
Your arm is slightly dislocated
due to heavy pressure.

61
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,279
Others are merely minor wounds.

62
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,960
However, you should be careful
in the next two months.

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,600
Don't create secondary damage.

64
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:48,712
Why didn't you protect
your head when you fell?

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
It's very dangerous, you know?

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
I couldn't do that as I'd lost balance.

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,080
You freaked me out.

68
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,080
I've told you I'm fine.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,080
Actually his head
suffers only mild collision.

70
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,520
It isn't a big deal.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
It's just that in
the next couple of days,

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,600
he might feel nauseous.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,759
Don't worry.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,759
So long as he rests
more for half a month

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
and takes medicine regularly,

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,720
he'll be fine.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
He should also watch his recent diet.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,679
Avoid spicy and oily food.

79
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,079
He may take more vegetables and fruits.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

81
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Mr. Gu.

82
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
I'll leave now.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,079
Okay.

84
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,600
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.

85
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,399
-I'll see you off, doctor.
-Sure.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,799
Have a safe trip, doctor.

87
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,399
Why are you coming out?

88
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,559
It's stuffy inside the room.

89
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,519
I should come out.

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,880
Are you okay?

91
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,079
Hurry up. Sit down.

92
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,839
Wait.

93
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,399
Lie down. Here.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,519
Have they arrested that person?

95
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes,

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,200
but can you spare her?

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
She is the mother of Lady Black Cat.

98
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,799
She tried to hurt you.

99
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:22,880
Do you want to spare her?

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,959
She believed in
the rumors on the internet.

101
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,839
She thought I copied her daughter's work

102
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,760
which made her daughter
emotionally unstable and became worst.

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,399
You didn't copy it.

104
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,399
She didn't know.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Besides,

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,359
her daughter passed away recently.

107
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,160
Can you not file a lawsuit?

108
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,239
I am the one that's injured.

109
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,839
I know.

110
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,519
I shouldn't have involved you.

111
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,760
I'll pay you for what I owe you slowly.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
You owe me a lot.

113
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,399
Medical fees, loss of working time

114
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,519
and mental anguish.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,239
All will be included in your debt.

116
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,320
It'll be a huge debt.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,559
Nanzhou.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,440
Why are you here?

119
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,000
You're seriously injured.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,279
Of course I should come to check on you.

121
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,440
Which part is injured?

122
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,359
Which arm is it?

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,200
Is it the one?

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,880
Let me see.

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
-Is it serious?
-It's fine.

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,239
I bought fish congee
and fruits on the way.

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,559
Do you want some?

128
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,119
No. I'm not hungry.

129
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,679
Ms. Jiang, please change into slippers.

130
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,679
Sorry.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,519
I was so worried about Nanzhou.

132
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,440
I forgot to change.

133
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,399
Qingqing, thank you.

134
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,119
You're welcome.

135
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,959
Nanzhou, what happened?

136
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,119
Have they arrested that person?

137
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,079
You offended no one.

138
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,000
Why did that happen out of the blue?

139
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,040
You don't have to worry about this.

140
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,359
It's a critical time for Xingyun.

141
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,480
We can't afford any mistake.

142
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,399
Go back to office if you're done.

143
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,440
Rest assured.

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,480
I'll manage the company for you.

145
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,480
Just focus on recuperation.

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,320
I'll cut some fruits for you.

147
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,239
Allow me.

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,119
Let Qingqing do it.

149
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,640
She should practice.

150
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,359
Someone has to teach her.

151
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,480
Qingqing, I'll teach you.

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,839
I know how to peel apples.

153
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,079
Don't bother to teach me.

154
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,239
Nanzhou is picky about fruits.

155
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,279
It has to be cut into the same size.

156
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Let me do it.

157
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,799
Why do you care about size

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,079
so long as it is edible?

159
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,480
Let me do it instead.

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
How can I bother you?

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
I'll do it.

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,440
-I'll do it.
-Allow me.

163
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,239
-Leave it to me.
-No.

164
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,839
I don't feel like having fruits.

165
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,599
"Nanzhou".

166
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,080
It sounded so intimate.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,880
Why are you pleasing him
when you're only visiting him?

168
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,919
Cut an apple into the same size?

169
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,840
Must you cut it before eating it?

170
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,359
You're so dramatic.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,679
Wait a second.

172
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm his fiancée.

173
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,559
Why should I leave the room?

174
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,119
Nanzhou, have a slice of apple.

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,719
I...

176
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,960
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

177
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't be shy.

178
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:30,960
Are you not comfortable?

179
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,760
Let me help you.

180
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,039
Are you feeling better now?

181
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm feeling much better.

182
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,359
Don't bother about me.

183
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,200
Head back to office.

184
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,359
All right.

185
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,840
Take care of yourself.

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,640
Have a good rest.

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,679
-I'll make a move first.
-Okay.

188
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
You took the apple from her.

189
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,760
Are you an alpaca in the zoo?

190
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,080
Hello, Zhang Yin.

191
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
I forgot.

192
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,359
It's late.

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,359
Why don't you come and draw at my house?

194
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,400
Xuan.

195
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,960
-How is Mr. Gu?
-Find out yourself.

196
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,159
Why are you the one answering the door?

197
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,479
Where is Zhou Jianqing?

198
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,719
Slow down.

199
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,799
I bumped into Xuan downstairs.

200
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,799
She seemed unhappy.

201
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,599
Both ladies...

202
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,880
Are you here to gossip?

203
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,520
Based on my experience,

204
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,039
they must have had a fierce battle.

205
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,159
Xuan

206
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,039
must have beaten Zhou Jianqing
with her domineering stance.

207
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Why did I miss such an exciting battle?

208
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,719
Jiang Xiaochuan.

209
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,159
Are you here with a purpose?

210
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,880
I've got news about the scriptwriter
of 365 Days of a Terminally Ill Girl.

211
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,280
Go on.

212
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,880
This person didn't use a name

213
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,520
nor sign an official agreement
with DiffuseStar.

214
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,640
Even the money was
remitted to a private account.

215
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,599
There is nothing we can do

216
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,640
if the person denies it all the way.

217
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,799
I think we should use Screentone 13.

218
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,599
I feel that something is missing.

219
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,520
Why don't we change into motion lines?

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,280
It's a brilliant idea.

221
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,239
It can portray the character's mind.

222
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,119
Junior, you know me the best.

223
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
That's a sure thing.

224
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,520
We should've gained some
mutual agreement after so long.

225
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,359
That's right.

226
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,159
Check the turning point
on the last two pages.

227
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,640
Is it the one about the bicycle?

228
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,239
Yes.

229
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:32,880
It's so funny.

230
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,599
Lower your voice.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,919
You're disturbing the patient.

232
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,280
Go back to your room

233
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,080
and close the door.

234
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,760
This is my house.

235
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,960
Let's draw outside.

236
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,000
It's cold out there.

237
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,479
What to do if you catch a cold?

238
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,159
I'll be fine.

239
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:51,400
I can even wear a miniskirt in winter.

240
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,440
It's okay.

241
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,080
We'll go to the park downstairs.

242
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,359
The air is much fresher.

243
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,760
You mustn't go!

244
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,239
Didn't you chase us away?

245
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,840
Who will bring me medicine

246
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,479
and water after you leave?

247
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,559
I suppose

248
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
you can still fetch water by yourself.

249
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,840
The doctor said

250
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,840
I should avoid secondary
damage, remember?

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,719
You can just be more careful.

252
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,559
I think you forget how I got injured.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,799
All right, Mr. Gu.

254
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
Just call me whenever you need me.

255
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,320
What do you think about the turning
point on the last two pages?

256
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,200
The turning point is quite...

257
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,159
I think...

258
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,280
I feel dizzy. I want to sleep.

259
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,559
I think this part is not that nice.

260
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,280
We should work on it again.

261
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,000
What do you think?

262
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:13,880
Look.

263
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,119
Is this okay?

264
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,799
If you asked me,

265
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,799
look,

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,119
isn't it better when it's placed here?

267
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't you agree?

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
Am I right?

269
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,559
It's more coordinated.

270
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,000
(I contacted the scriptwriter.)

271
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:43,320
(However,)

272
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,159
(she refused to testify.)

273
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
(Ask her out for me.)

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,640
I'm hungry.

275
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,760
Buy some food for me.

276
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,320
Why are you so troublesome?

277
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,960
Sure, Mr. Gu.

278
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
Please wait.

279
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,479
Let's go.

280
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,039
What do you want to discuss with me?

281
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,719
I'm a friend of Little Water Celery.

282
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520
I hope you can tell the truth.

283
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,159
You provided the script

284
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,640
of 365 Days of the Terminally Ill Girl.

285
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,479
It plagiarized Lady Black Cat's

286
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,359
Go, Black Cat!

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
However, now my friend

288
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,640
is accused of plagiarism instead.

289
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,320
How can you prove that I copied it?

290
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,039
Even without an official agreement,

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,719
there was a transaction between
you and DiffuseStar's manager.

292
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,760
The employees can testify

293
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,280
that you took part in the scriptwriting.

294
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,280
So what?

295
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,280
You could be colluding with them.

296
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,559
I can sue you with the victim's family.

297
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,239
Even without sufficient
evidence at the court,

298
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,400
you'll draw public attention.

299
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,599
You saw what happened to my friend.

300
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,960
Netizens are not as rational as a judge.

301
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,640
Why are you forcing me?

302
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,359
DiffuseStar refused to sign
an agreement with me

303
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,919
when I worked for them.

304
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,960
I had to finish the whole script
before I was paid.

305
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,679
I couldn't afford my rental
and medical fees

306
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,919
yet they kept rushing me for the script.

307
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,119
I had no choice but
to plagiarize the work.

308
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,159
I understand your difficulty.

309
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,919
Everyone faces difficulties in life.

310
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,840
However, I think one shouldn't

311
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,039
and mustn't

312
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,799
implicate others for the injustice
he or she suffers.

313
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,080
Bear your own mistake.

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
Only then you can move forward.

315
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,560
Gu Nanzhou.

316
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,000
Gu Nanzhou.

317
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,439
I've bought food for you.

318
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Where is he?

319
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,160
Gu Nanzhou!

320
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Why did he suddenly disappear?

321
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,599
Hello.

322
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,800
Hello. Where are you?

323
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,800
I'll be right back.

324
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,199
Didn't the doctor tell you
to rest at home

325
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,119
and not go anywhere?

326
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,160
Wait for me.

327
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,400
I have good news for you.

328
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,479
Good news?

329
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,880
How much is left?

330
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,800
Send it to me.

331
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,359
It's fine.

332
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,400
Go home.

333
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,079
You've done me a huge favor today.

334
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,719
Have you been staying up lately?

335
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,880
Can you handle it without me?

336
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,479
Yes, I can.

337
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,680
Don't you know?

338
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,520
Staying up is the basic
cultivation of a cartoonist.

339
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,800
I think I should stay to help you.

340
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,239
Stop.

341
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,800
Go home now and work on the contest.

342
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,920
Do whatever you should.

343
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,199
I'll beat you up on
your teacher's behalf

344
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,439
if you don't perform well.

345
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,319
By the way,

346
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,280
I have good news.

347
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:03,119
My entry has been nominated.

348
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,800
Seriously?

349
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,199
You make me really proud.

350
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,439
When you become famous in the future,

351
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
can I tell others

352
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,439
that you're once my assistant?

353
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
You might be

354
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,959
more famous than me in the future.

355
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
Your words do make sense.

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,280
Qingqing.

357
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,640
Ever since I got to know you,

358
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,959
my life seems to have changed.

359
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,319
I've experienced

360
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,119
a lot of things that never
crossed my mind before.

361
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,719
Qingqing.

362
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,199
I'm thankful to you.

363
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,359
Save it for the speech on stage.

364
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,560
Don't flatter me now.

365
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,959
If you're thankful,

366
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:56,303
treat me to seafood.

367
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,359
No problem.

368
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Not only that,

369
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,439
I can even offer myself to you.

370
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,640
Who do you learn this from?

371
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,199
All in all,

372
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,040
Qingqing,

373
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,199
you're very important to me.

374
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,880
Qingqing,

375
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,719
I've always wanted to tell you this.

376
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,319
I actually...

377
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,199
Stop!

378
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,319
Gu Nanzhou!

379
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,319
Who allows you to touch my fiancée?

380
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,199
Fiancée?

381
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,280
What else do you have
apart from the agreement?

382
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:43,839
I...

383
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,719
She needs love and care,

384
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,599
instead of being bossed around

385
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,199
and treated as your property.

386
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
There is no need for you, an outsider,

387
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,839
to comment on my relationship with her.

388
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,959
An outsider?

389
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,280
At least I know what she wants.

390
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,959
I know your relationship with her.

391
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,719
Other than your fake engagement,

392
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,880
you're her landlord and creditor.

393
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,599
So you think she should
obey you in everything.

394
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,520
You even treat her as an accessory.

395
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,719
Listen, Gu Nanzhou.

396
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,524
You're the kind of person

397
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:15,970
who Qingqing hates the most.

398
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,920
Stop, Zhang Yin.

399
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,199
Please leave now.

400
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,280
Stop stirring up trouble for me.

401
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,764
There will be no way for me

402
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,169
to clean up the mess if you carry on.

403
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,680
Move.

404
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,959
Sorry.

405
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
He is still young and rebellious.

406
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,599
Don't take it to heart.

407
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,319
-He said...
-Sorry.

408
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,160
He overheard us,

409
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,400
but I assure you

410
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,880
that he won't tell anyone.

411
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,040
You may make any demand.

412
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,439
I'll agree to it, okay?

413
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,319
Do you hate me so much?

414
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,959
No.

415
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
You've helped me a lot.

416
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,199
I won't possibly hate you.

417
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,959
I'm grateful.

418
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,439
-Is it true?
-Yes.

419
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,959
I swear it is true.

420
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
(That's a relief.)

421
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,520
I'll forgive you today.

422
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:29,880
However,

423
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,439
from today onwards,

424
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,199
I want to add a new
rule in the agreement.

425
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,839
What's the rule?

426
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
You mustn't be alone with a man.

427
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,599
It's so harsh.

428
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,319
Didn't you say I could make any demand?

429
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,199
Tell me.

430
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,632
What do you mean by
being alone with a man?

431
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,199
Does it include my brother?

432
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,359
Also,

433
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,199
if I sign the agreement,

434
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,040
I can't take up many jobs.

435
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,640
How can I make money to
pay you without working?

436
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,800
Most importantly,

437
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,040
are you considered a man?

438
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,599
Can I be alone with you?

439
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't want you to be
alone with Zhang Yin.

440
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,719
-Why?
-The answer is no.

441
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,199
I feel sleepy.

442
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,040
I'll go to bed.

443
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,359
He is overbearing.

444
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,880
The story of
365 Days of a Terminally Ill Girl

445
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,959
was plagiarized by me.

446
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,119
I know.

447
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,280
The pressure of deadline

448
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,800
and DiffuseStar's refusal to pay

449
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,400
shouldn't be used as excuses.

450
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Zhou Jianqing had no knowledge of this.

451
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,479
She shouldn't be blamed for what I did.

452
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,079
Today,

453
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,079
I was approached by
a friend of Little Water Celery.

454
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
He said one thing to me.

455
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,680
He said

456
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,800
everyone faces difficulties in life,

457
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,439
but we shouldn't

458
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,160
and mustn't implicate innocent people

459
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,680
for the injustice we suffered.

460
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,079
We should bear our own mistake

461
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,160
to be able to move forward.

462
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:09,079
I know I was wrong,

463
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,280
but I want to move on
with no sense of guilt.

464
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,000
Black Cat Lady,

465
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Little Water Celery,

466
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,119
all readers and netizens,

467
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm sorry.

468
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,199
I was wrong.

469
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,920
My friend?

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,520
Wait for me.

471
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,640
I have good news for you.

472
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
Good news?

473
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,800
Have some fruits.

474
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,119
It's all of the same size.

475
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,400
Thank you.

476
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,880
Didn't you say
you have good news for me?

477
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,880
What is it?

478
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,959
I forgot.

479
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,040
Did you meet the scriptwriter today?

480
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,719
In fact, I was ready to be a scapegoat.

481
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,719
I didn't expect you

482
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,800
to convince her to clarify it.

483
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,719
It's nothing.

484
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:37,479
Gu Nanzhou.

485
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Thank you.

486
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,599
I've always wanted to thank you.

487
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,119
Ever since I got to know you,

488
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:52,160
you've been helping me
every time I face a problem.

489
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,000
You told the platform to
recount the votes fairly.

490
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,959
You blocked the things
thrown towards me.

491
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,079
Even this time,

492
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,359
you're injured because of me.

493
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,640
Meeting you

494
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,079
is the luckiest thing in my life.

495
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,359
How do you want to repay me?

496
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:23,839
I...

497
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,119
-I...
-Go on.

No.

508
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,079
What makes you think so?

509
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,760
I don't harbor any intention about you.

Were you displeased?

No.

516
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,359
Why should I be displeased?

517
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,319
Don't get the wrong idea.

518
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,479
Jingxuan is quite nice.

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,959
Are you massaging

527
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,680
or rowing a boat?

528
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,119

Stop!

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,239
Enough.

532
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,599
Fetch me a glass of water.

533
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,199

536
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,959
Peel a pomelo for me.

537
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,199
Do you have no hand?

538
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,599
I wouldn't have obeyed
you if you didn't save me.

539
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,599
What did you say?

540
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,719
Here's what I said.

541
00:29:55,439 --> 00:30:00,000
May you have a good appetite
and enjoy whatever you eat.

542
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,959
Hello, Zhang Yin.

543
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,160
Qingqing, I've arrived.

544
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,280
When will you come over?

545
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,439
1 p.m?

546
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,119
I'll be right there.

547
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:20,880
Zhang Yin,

548
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,359
order a honey cake for me.

549
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,479
Sure.

550
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,599
Stay home alone.

551
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,160
I'll discuss the plan with Zhang Yin.

552
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,719
No!

553
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,599
I feel unwell.

554
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,680
I feel dizzy.

555
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,199
What is happening?

556
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,439
You have no fever.

557
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,011
I mean my hand is still painful.

558
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,243
Doctor said your hand was recovering.

559
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,640
It's normal to feel a little pain.

560
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,119
Just bear with it.

561
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,384
My stomach is also in pain.

562
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,959
That's because you've
eaten a lot of fruits.

563
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
Use the toilet more frequently

564
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:05,920
and drink more water.

565
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,479
Gu Nanzhou, stop pretending.

566
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:17,742
Hello, Zhang Yin.

567
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:18,839
Qingqing,

568
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,599
the honey cake is sold out.

569
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,599
Shall I get you something else?

570
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:23,839
It's sold out?

571
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:26,959
Zhang Yin!

572
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,280
I think I can't make it today.

573
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,479
I'll call you again.

Are you okay?

577
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,199
Are you serious?

578
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,640
Don't scare me, Gu Nanzhou.

579
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,040
