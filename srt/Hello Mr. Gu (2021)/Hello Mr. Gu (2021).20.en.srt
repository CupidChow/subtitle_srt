=Episode 20=

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,974
(Strike while the iron is hot.)

31
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,239
Speak up.

32
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,480
What did Gu Nanzhou do?

33
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,080
Yesterday,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,879
he kissed me.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
You've gone steady?

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,679
-No.
-And he kissed you?

37
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,000
He seemed to have forgotten it.

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,199
He was terrible.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Don't get it wrong.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,199
He was drunk yesterday.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,199
Then he kissed me.

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,800
He didn't seem to know who I am.

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,600
Do you mean he kissed the wrong person?

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Susu,

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,869
how to tell

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,129
if a man is into you?

47
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,160
I don't really know either.

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,679
(Actually when a man is into a woman,)

49
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,199
(he will display it clearly.)

50
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,019
(Because men are born to be)

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,769
(more proactive than women.)

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,039
(They're different from women.)

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,199
(When a man is into a woman,)

54
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,839
(he will display)

55
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,320
(positivity and initiative.)

56
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,279
(Ms. Pan,)

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,559
(how does a man display that?)

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,199
(For example,)

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,119
(did he proactively
say anything nice to you?)

60
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,919
(Did he proactively
ask you out for a movie?)

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
(Did he proactively
ask you out for dinner?)

62
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,880
(Did he try all ways)

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,279
(to show up in front of you?)

64
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,960
(If he didn't do that,)

65
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,000
(maybe he has no interest in you.)

66
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,199
(Should the woman give up)

67
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,000
(if the man did none of the above?)

68
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,839
(Not really.)

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,839
(If the man doesn't take the initiative,)

70
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:37,759
(the woman can do that.)

71
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,240
(Ms. Pan,)

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,178
(do you mean women)

73
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,600
(should confess their feelings
to men instead?)

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,119
(No.)

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,399
(Confession of love is an unwise plan.)

76
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,020
(Led by a goddess. A lesson in love.)

77
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,119
Why does a talk show need a cliffhanger?

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Is it available online?

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,800
She has online love lessons.

80
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,639
RMB199 per session.

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,399
Why is it so expensive
for one video tutorial?

82
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,720
It is cunning.

83
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,040
Besides,

84
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,931
this kind of love lessons

85
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,250
won't teach it right.

86
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,920
It's clearly a fraud.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,839
I think you're right.

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,799
Have you made up your mind, sir?

89
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,959
Which ring

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
can give a girl the most impulsion
to marry me?

91
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,279
Impulsion?

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,279
Why don't you
describe your girlfriend to me?

93
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,000
She's

94
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,880
strong. She loves food,

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,079
especially stinky food.

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,399
She loves watching horror movies.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,720
What an active girl.

98
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,959
Why don't you try our dark series?

99
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,600
It's the latest limited
edition of dark series.

100
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,320
It's too ordinary.

101
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,119
She is a special girl.

102
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,720
Try this.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the one and only in the city.

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,359
Pack it.

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,239
(The so-called initiative of a woman)

106
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,959
(is not about confessing your love.)

107
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,440
(It's to make the man
fall in love gradually.)

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
(Make him have feelings for you.)

109
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,880
(There is a technique for the process.)

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
(It requires you...)

111
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,420
(Please top up.)

112
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,640
Why do I need to pay more?

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
If it doesn't work,

114
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,040
I'll apply for a refund.

115
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,959
(Men prioritize visuals.)

116
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,799
(What matters the most)

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,760
(is your physical appearance.)

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,920
Of course I know that.

119
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,399
(Physical appearance)

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,519
(is not solely about beauty.)

121
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,920
(You should reasonably display)

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
(strengths of your physical appearance.)

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,200
(For example, you have a fair complexion.)

124
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,000
(You should display it to the fullest.)

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,760
(Expose it.)

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,959
(Maybe you have a small face.)

127
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,203
(Having a small face)

128
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,839
(is also an advantage, right?)

129
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,079
(Maybe you have beautiful hands.)

130
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,959
(You should display them.)

131
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,600
(Place your hand on your face.)

132
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,519
(Display it.)

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,079
(Run your hand through your hair.)

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,679
(All in all,)

135
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,611
(try your best to explore)

136
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,850
(what makes you stand out.)

137
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,760
You're back.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,119
Leave the stuff to me.

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
Wash your hands for dinner.

140
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,799
It's okay.

141
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,279
I'll handle it.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Isn't it working?

143
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,200
He doesn't like the dishes?

144
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,039
Taste the food.

145
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,640
Okay.

146
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,320
You've applied makeup?

147
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,599
A bit.

148
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,039
Is it very obvious?

149
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,679
Heavy makeup at night.

150
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,599
It isn't Halloween.

151
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,919
Do you like the dishes tonight?

152
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:15,599
Not bad.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,308
(Isn't it lovelier if I tilt)

154
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,050
(45 degrees to a side while talking?)

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,880
(He gives no reaction at all.)

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
(Could it be another side?)

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,239
Have you tried the stir-fried beans?

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,359
I'll try it.

159
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,520
(He has finally noticed my difference.)

160
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,799
You...

161
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,159
Do you have a stiff neck?

162
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,679
No.

163
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,239
You seem to have stiff neck
from the start.

164
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,520
Shall I get the ointment
and apply it on you?

165
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,599
I'm fine.

166
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
(I'll go all out.)

167
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,159
(I just need to take the initiative.)

168
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,752
You should display how calm

169
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,610
and polite you are as a gentleman.

170
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,880
Work hard to restore
your tainted image.

171
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,000
Let me pour you some wine.

172
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,719
It's okay. I'll pour it myself.

173
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,159
Stay still.

174
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,640
(Is it working now?)

175
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you doing?

176
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,719
Your double eyelid tape has fallen.

177
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,559
Let's drink.

178
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,159
No!

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,159
I...

180
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,239
Gu Nanzhou,

181
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,640
are you stupid?

182
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,760
It's so obvious yet
you couldn't even tell.

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,460
(Please top up.)

184
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,479
Why do I need to pay again?

185
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,880
This is too over.

186
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,220
(Congratulations for being
upgraded to platinum member.)

187
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,559
(If all normal actions are ineffective,)

188
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,440
(you may try to play with his mind.)

189
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,107
(Create a chance)

190
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:10,009
(to close the gap with him.)

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,159
(For example,)

192
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,440
(have an accidental power outage.)

193
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
(It's a good choice.)

194
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,320
Power outage?

195
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,520
Would you marry me?

196
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I think it lacks creativity.

197
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,703
(Zhou Jianqing's exclusive cola.
Don't touch it.)

198
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,688
(Zhou Jianqing's exclusive cake.
Don't touch it.)

199
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,159
Why did you come from outside?

200
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,239
I had something to do.

201
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,880
Did Zhang Yin come to see you?

202
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
You went out to meet him at night?

203
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,200
Isn't this my strawberry mousse?

204
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,480
I spent more than half an hour

205
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,610
lining up to buy it.

206
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,968
I wrote my name on it.

207
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,159
Why do you still want to eat it?

208
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,119
I can eat it when I want.

209
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,559
I'll just pay you for it!

210
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,159
Gu Nanzhou!

211
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm warning you.

212
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,039
You mustn't touch
my belongings, especially food.

213
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,993
Don't touch it when my name

214
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,290
is written on it!

215
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,200
Also,

216
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,719
I must get this clear.

217
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080
When we're camping the other night,

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
do you remember kissing me?

219
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,880
Why did you want to kiss me?

220
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,559
Is kissing me so disgusting?

221
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,119
Restaurant director.

222
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,760
Two division managers.

223
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,420
(Uncle Li)

224
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,640
Uncle Li.

225
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,159
Good news, Zixuan.

226
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,359
-Is Mr. Peng hiring me?
-Yes.

227
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,200
He even told me

228
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,190
if you could make the same profit

229
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,249
achieved by his previous restaurant,

230
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,960
he'll pay you 1% as bonus.

231
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,039
Work hard.

232
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,080
Get ready to take over on Monday.

233
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
Don't worry, Uncle Li.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,119
I won't let him down.

235
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:47,799
Good.

236
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,200
See you, Uncle Li.

237
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,960
See you.

238
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,719
Coming!

239
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
Hi, here's your delivery.

240
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,839
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

241
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,880
Qingqing,

242
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
get over it.

243
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,439
You'll feel better after
eating something sweet.

244
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,439
Not strawberry mousse again.

245
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,800
I don't want to see it
in the next 30 days.

246
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,079
What happened to you?

247
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,599
I can't get over it.

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,079
I hardly fall for anyone.

249
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,959
However, he gave no reaction at all.

250
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,719
I have a similar experience.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,319
Techniques like playing hard to get

252
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,160
don't work at all.

253
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,199
Dark effect? Misattribution of arousal?

254
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,760
All these are lies.

255
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,839
-You paid for those sessions?
-You paid for those sessions?

256
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,719
We're two pathetic best friends.

257
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,160
I don't believe in love anymore.

258
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,599
Having each other will do.

259
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,079
Susu,

260
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,880
I've realized that

261
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,760
Gu Nanzhou feels nothing for me.

262
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,280
I should forget about him.

263
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,499
I should just do whatever

264
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,970
that's stated on the agreement.

265
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,422
Once I get to clear

266
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:24,689
my debt of RMB 2 million,

267
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,800
I'll cut ties with him.

268
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,920
Zhou Jianqing.

269
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,040
So you're really marrying
Gu Nanzhou to pay my debt?

270
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,000
Don't get it wrong, brother.

271
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,640
I really love him.

272
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,400
What about him?

273
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Does he love you?

274
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,400
Who do you think I am?

275
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,719
Why should you pay the debt for me?

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,800
Xuan,

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,280
she just wants to do something for you.

278
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,839
-She...
-Su Youxia.

279
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,479
You knew this,

280
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,599
yet you kept it from me, right?

281
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,280
I...

282
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,439
Zhou Zixuan!

283
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,800
Why are you yelling at Susu?

284
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,839
I just wanted to reduce your pressure.

285
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,359
I don't need you to bear it for me.

286
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,680
It's my own matter!

287
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,479
Can you bear it alone?

288
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,182
When can you pay the debt

289
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:08,650
with your petty salary?

290
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,280
Don't bother.

291
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,000
I told you it's my own matter.

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,575
It's better than you selling yourself

293
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,560
to someone else as a wife.

294
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,959
Don't bother about me as well!

295
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm doing it at my own will.

296
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,239
Stay out of it.

297
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,239
Zhou Jianqing,

298
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,520
why would I have
an ignorant sister like you?

299
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,839
I also want to know

300
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,839
why I would have
a pathetic brother like you.

301
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,599
I'm pathetic?

302
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,359
Fine.

303
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm pathetic.

304
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,000
Xuan.

305
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,079
Qingqing.

306
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,280
Qingqing,

307
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:56,077
the truth is

308
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,920
he is thinking for your sake.

309
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,280
He doesn't want to make you worried.

310
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,239
So he kept many things from you.

311
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,719
I don't need him to do that.

312
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,439
I'm an adult.

313
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,040
Can I not bear the same
responsibility as he does?

314
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,959
All he wants is a better life for you.

315
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,454
I'll be so much better

316
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,809
without his intervention.

317
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,599
Qingqing,

318
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:24,319
he is really doing this for you.

319
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:29,079
He lies to me all the time.

320
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,680
I can't tell he is doing it for my sake.

321
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,439
You have no idea.

322
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,079
The money you won from
the lucky draw over the years

323
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,599
is from Xuan.

324
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,359
Paint, cash and tablet.

325
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,719
Didn't you realize

326
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,287
that you received it

327
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,770
whenever you needed it?

328
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Didn't we receive a lucky draw voucher

329
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
at the supermarket last time?

330
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,489
They're announcing the winners

331
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,890
when I passed by today.

332
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,599
That's a lot of money.

333
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,079
RMB5,000.

334
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,839
Special prize.

335
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,599
I'm surely a lucky child.

336
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,760
The truth is you weren't that lucky.

337
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,599
It's arranged by your brother.

338
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,839
You've been lying to me with him.

339
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,079
He forced me to do it,

340
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,359
but I know why he did it.

341
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,560
Giving you money directly

342
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,040
would cause burden on you.

343
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,560
Only in this way,

344
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,280
you would receive it gladly.

345
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,439
Yes, he has come back to work,

346
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,839
but he has a goal.

347
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,199
He's told me before.

348
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,359
He wants to earn enough money
to have his own hotel.

349
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,239
One day,

350
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,760
he wants to rebuild the reputation
of your family's hotel.

351
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,160
Why do you know everything?

352
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,199
We...

353
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,239
We talked about it by chance.

354
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,845
You even talked about

355
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:08,010
things that I didn't know by chance.

356
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,839
There is something wrong.

357
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,439
Do you have a crush on my brother?

358
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,760
No. That's impossible.

359
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,079
I'm just kidding.

360
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,280
Why do you take it so seriously?

361
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,280
I know you wouldn't fall for my brother

362
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,599
even if you fell for all
other men in the world.

363
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,079
Be frank with me.

364
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,359
Who are you into actually?

365
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,680
Well,

366
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,079
I'll tell you next time.

367
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,319
Stop right there!

368
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,839
You must tell me today.

369
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,280
Tell me your real thought.

370
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,479
Don't worry.

371
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,920
I'll be responsible.

372
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
What are you responsible for?

373
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,839
Are you responsible
for urging her to pay debt

374
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,359
or being a fake husband?

375
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,800
I don't care about your agreement.

376
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,520
Terminate it at once.

377
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,839
From now on,

378
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,599
I'll bear Zhou Jianqing's debt.

379
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,800
You two are unrelated from now on.

380
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,760
I disagree.

381
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
You disagree?

382
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,079
First of all,

383
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,920
it is an agreement between me and her

384
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,599
and I don't want to let her go.

385
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,319
What do you mean?

386
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,599
I've fallen for her.

387
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,920
As her brother, I wish

388
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,839
you can give me a chance to pursue her.

389
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,199
You love her?

390
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,760
Are you serious?

391
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm serious.

392
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,199
I've even bought a ring.

393
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,560
What about the debt between you two?

394
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,427
Do you plan to be a creditor

395
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,529
and a husband simultaneously?

396
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,719
From what I know about her,

397
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,239
this might be her choice.

398
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
If interests are involved,

399
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,880
won't it complicate your
relationship with her?

400
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,119
If we can get together

401
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,359
and we love each other,

402
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,719
that won't be a problem.

403
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,880
You haven't gotten together.

404
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,319
I have a plan to confess my feelings.

405
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,159
Do you have a plan to propose a marriage

406
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,209
before even confessing your love?

407
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,439
Are you stupid?

408
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,520
I'll take care of your love confession.

409
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:30,920
Sure.

410
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,800
Look after Qingqing for me.

411
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,959
I was harsh today.

412
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:52,800
Brother,

413
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,640
sorry, I was wrong, too.

414
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,319
Thank you for arranging
those lucky draw prizes.

415
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
We're even then.

416
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,280
Sure.

417
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:07,959
I'm your sister.

418
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,439
Siblings bully each other.

419
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,520
I can bear anything.

420
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,359
What can you bear?

421
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,400
When I worked part-time,

422
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
I used to carry the rice bag alone.

423
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,040
Little girl.

424
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,680
You're all grown up.

425
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,040
To be honest,

426
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,560
you never told me those things.

427
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,239
Why did you tell Susu instead?

428
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,719
I didn't know you're so close.

429
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
What's wrong with telling her more?

430
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,199
I'm known as being friendly to women.

431
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:50,560
I never saw you confiding
in any other girls.

432
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,599
Have you fallen for Susu?

433
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,319
What are you talking about?

434
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,319
I'm warning you.

435
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,662
You may pursue any girl

436
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:05,090
but not Su Youxia.

437
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,520
Put out that flame
in your heart at once.

438
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,560
Don't harm my best friend.

439
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,880
Do you see your brother as a monster?

440
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,000
Don't get too far.

441
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,400
I don't care.

442
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,119
I'll be the first to kill you
if you approach her.

443
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:20,839
Do you hear me?

444
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,199
How rude.

445
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,839
Zhou Zixuan!

446
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,079
Do you hear me?

447
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,479
Hello.

448
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,280
Susu, are you on the way?

449
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,839
I'm about to call a taxi downstairs.

450
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,400
Save the trouble.

451
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,239
Zhou Zixuan said he would pick you up.

452
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,040
Have steak at our house tonight

453
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,680
to celebrate my scholarship award.

454
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,319
Save the trouble.

455
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,839
I'll just call a taxi.

456
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,400
Just wait.

457
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:02,450
He should be arriving.

458
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm hanging up.

459
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:04,891
I'm going to shop.

460
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,160
Get into the car.

461
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,119
Come on.

462
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,280
Get on the motorbike.

463
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,599
Xuan,

464
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,959
I think you're heading
to the wrong direction.

465
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,479
What did you say? I can't hear you!

466
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,239
I said

467
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,680
you're heading to the wrong direction!

468
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,359
It's correct!

469
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,760
Follow me!

470
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,800
Xuan,

471
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,033
aren't we going to celebrate

472
00:28:23,124 --> 00:28:24,289
at Qingqing's house?

473
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,599
Why have we come to the riverside?

474
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,800
Leaving them alone

475
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,119
is the best present to them.

476
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,470
I wouldn't have come out if I knew.

477
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,719
I brought you here

478
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,560
because I wanted to say something.

479
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,719
I know what you want to say,

480
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,119
but can you let me...

can't be reached at the moment.

510
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
Please try again later.

511
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,439
Why can't I reach Zhou Zixuan and Susu?

512
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,079
Could something have happened to them?

513
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,359
I forgot to tell you.

514
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,640
Your brother gave me a call.

515
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,359
He said they're not coming tonight.

516
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,839
They aren't?

517
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,760
I think they have a reason.

518
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,119
Try it.

519
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
They serve delicious steak.

520
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,439
I specially asked for medium well.

521
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,959
How is it?

522
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,280
It's yummy.

523
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,800
By the way, Nanzhou,

524
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
is your work going well lately?

525
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,520
Yes.

526
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,760
About that night,

527
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,040
I...

528
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,319
I'll be responsible for it.
