00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,360
(could drive him crazy.)

00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:33,639
What are you doing?

00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,080

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,759

(She might be into me.)

41
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,399
The content we need to submit this month

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
are the images of 43 characters,

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,872
including male and
female leading characters,

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,039
as well as the characters' details.

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,039
Of course,

46
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,839
the design of several scene's concept

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,800
needs to be adjusted one by one

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
according to Mr. Gu's requirement.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,080
Of course

50
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,080
there're certain details.

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,640
(Have you packed up?)
It's about the leading roles' attire.

52
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,320
We have Plan A and Plan B.

53
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,800
Plan A

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,759
can portray the leading male
character's personality

55
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,039
and the female leading character's
gentle demeanor better.

56
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,000
This plan...

57
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,839
Mr. Gu,

58
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,399
Ms. Zhou Jianqing

59
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,320
claimed to have an appointment with you.

60
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,800
The plot revolving
the male leading character...

61
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,639
Just tell her I'm not in.

62
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:01,039
Okay.

63
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,880
Has to be readjusted.

64
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:02,759
Hold on.

65
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,759
We'll discuss this

66
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,639
in detail later.

67
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:06,839
Excuse me,

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
please continue.

69
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:16,960
What's the matter?

70
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,119
I...

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,199
Actually I...

72
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,559
You don't have to bid me farewell.

73
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,240
Just leave if you have nothing else.

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,759
I have a lot of things to do.

75
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:27,839
No.

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
I just want to tell you

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,839
that I might not be able to move out.

78
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,039
Do you insist on staying?

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,039
No,

80
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
I was packing this morning

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,119
and about to leave,

82
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,679
but your mother suddenly showed up.

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,720
What do you plan to do?

84
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Here's what I think.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,080
Since it's already happened,

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
we should figure out a solution.

87
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,399
Maybe I should stay longer.

88
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,039
Is this your solution?

89
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,960
Think twice.

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,800
If you chase me away

91
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
and your mother

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,639
breaks your legs over this,

93
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
I can't possibly save you.

94
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,200
Look,

95
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,799
I need a place to stay,

96
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,239
while you

97
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,920
need someone to solve
the problem for you.

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,679
Mr. Gu, why don't you

99
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,799
do me another favor?

100
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,440
I'll surely repay you.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
How are you going to repay me?

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
How about this?

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
I'll rent the room

104
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
and pay you the rental on time

105
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,640
without delaying it.

106
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Do you think I need the rental?

107
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,600
I know you don't need the money.

108
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,600
How about a fair exchange?

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
As long as you need my service,

110
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
Mr. Gu,

111
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,119
I'll surely go all out

112
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,160
and do whatever I can

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,920
free of charge.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,760
Do you think

115
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,359
in what ways will I ever need you?

116
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,320
I don't want to trouble you.

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,760
I'll figure out a way.

118
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,959
If

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
I wander on the street

120
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,160
and someone sees it,

121
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,200
I'll dissociate myself from you.

122
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,559
It won't have anything to do with you.

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640

Why are you dating her now?

You're disregarding yourself

Son,

147
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,799
are you really into her?

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
Have you made up
your mind to be with her?

149
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
Will you regret it

150
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,359
even if I strongly oppose it?

151
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,000
I've made up my mind.

153
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,880
That's how you should persist

you're indeed my biological child.

You picked the type
of girl I really like.

I'm not.

Look at you.

You refuse to admit that you're wrong.

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
you can never

174
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,559
keep a girlfriend.

175
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,559
Qingqing is willing to come back,

176
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,239
because she's tolerant.

177
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,519
If I were her,

178
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,279
I'd break your leg.

179
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,200
Apologise to Qingqing when you're back,

180
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,320
got it?

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Do you hear me?

182
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
Yes.

183
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,640
(Why don't you invite
Xiaochuan and Jingxuan)

184
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,799
(to dine at home?)

185
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,519
(When I was hospitalized,)

186
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,200
(they had helped me a lot.)

187
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,640
Well,

188
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,359
Zhou Jianqing is inviting
you and Jiang Jingxuan

189
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,160
to dine at our place.

190
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,279
Sure,

191
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,160
but Xuan can't make it.

192
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,079
She has an appointment tonight.

193
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
Isn't Zhou Jianqing moving out?

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,640
No, she won't.

195
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,919
Earlier on, her brother
stirred up trouble.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Now she's using your
mother as an excuse.

197
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,359
Is it because she doesn't want to leave?

198
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:42,799
Go on.

199
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,119
Based on my experience,

200
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,359
I think

201
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,359
she's into you.

202
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,000
She wants to stay with you

203
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,919
to have more chances

204
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,080
to get along with you.

205
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,200
Look at yourself.

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
You're handsome and muscular.

207
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,039
You're young and capable.

208
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
You also look like a gentleman.

209
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,760
It's deceiving.

210
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
A brilliant young man like you

211
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,159
is always a crowd favorite.

212
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,719
If you showcase

213
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,520
more of your strengths,

214
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,520
I bet she won't be able to resist you.

215
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,119
What a sumptuous meal.

216
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,159
I cooked these dishes

217
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,280
to thank you guys

218
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,000
for taking care of me,

219
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,440
especially Mr. Gu.

220
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,239
Thank you for taking me in.

221
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,239
Is this your only way of thanking me?

222
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,080
What else do you want?

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,799
Marry him.

224
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,520
Xiaochuan, stop spewing nonsense.

225
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,520
Come on.

226
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,760
Let's drink.

227
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,159
Why does the wine taste weird?

228
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,799
Which bottle of wine did you open?

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,159
I wouldn't dare to open your wine.

230
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,400
This

231
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,960
was sold at a discounted
price in supermarket.

232
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,760
RMB38.

233
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,440
It's a really good bargain, isn't it?

234
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:58,239
She's thrifty and she cooks well.

235
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,599
She could be a good wife.

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
Are you sure

237
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,320
you're needed here?

238
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,559
If that's the case,

239
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,080
are you guys already a married couple?

240
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,200
I will drink to you two.

241
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,840
May you have children soon

242
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,760
and a blissful marriage.

243
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,679
Xiaochuan,

244
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,679
if you continue to talk nonsense,

245
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,799
I'll be mad.

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,640
Just kidding.

247
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,400
I'll drink to you.

248
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,239
Congratulations for becoming
Mr. Gu's roommate once again.

249
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,520
Thank you.

250
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
Come on. Taste this.

251
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,280
Mr. Gu,

252
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,119
have the crab.

253
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,119
I don't eat crab.

254
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,919
It's troublesome.

255
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,119
Xiaochuan,

256
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
it's all yours then.

257
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:44,880
Aren't you eating it?

258
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Good stuff are meant for the guest.

259
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,280
That's right.

260
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,679
I'm the guest.

261
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,159
I shall

262
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,400
help myself then.

263
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,500
(Taboo in daily life.)

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,799
(She seems crazy,)

265
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,679
(but after interacting with her,)

266
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,640
(she seems like a great girl.)

267
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,039
(Qingqing,)

(Commercial Bank)

269
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,479
(the tuition fees and pocket
money for this semester)

270
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,840
(is already transferred to Mr. Chen.)

271
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,280
(If you have a need,)

272
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
(ask Mr. Chen to pass the message.)

273
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,679
(You don't have to look for me.)

274
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,159
(As long as you study well,)

275
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,799
(it's your best way of repaying me.)

(Wesca Color Printing Co. Ltd)

277
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,400
(Is the one who's been sponsoring me)

278
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
(Gu Nanzhou?)

279
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,239
Well,

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,080
I would like to ask you.

281
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,280
Do you write letters?

282
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,640
No.

283
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,880
What's the matter?

284
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,520
Are you sure

285
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,239
you don't write letters?

286
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,760
What are you trying to ask?

287
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:36,760
Nothing,

288
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm just asking.

289
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,039
You're lame.

290
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
You're the lame one, okay?

291
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,919
Starting tomorrow,

292
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,359
you'll take over Jiang Xiaochuan's work.

293
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm paying you rental.

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,239
Why do I have to work for you?

295
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,359
Mr. Gu,

296
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
I think the crab I ate at your house

297
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,919
was dead for a while.

298
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,679
I'm suffering from food poisoning.

299
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll be hospitalized.

300
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,200
In the next few days,

301
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,599
get Zhou Jianqing to be your assistant.

302
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,119
Isn't she going to be an intern?

303
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,119
Crab?

304
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,200
I was wondering

305
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,640
why the seller was so kind.

306
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,719
He claimed to give me
one free for buying three.

307
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,520
So they'd been dead for a while.

308
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm having a meeting with
the production company tomorrow.

309
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
Sort out the information.

310
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,239
Isn't an assistant's job
managing your daily life?

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,119
Apart from this,

312
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
liaising with clients and
contacting the investors

313
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,640
will be your job in the next few days.

314
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,359
Are you denying responsibility?

315
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm not.

316
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,840
I'll be responsible for it.

317
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,440
Wake me up at 6.30am tomorrow.

318
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,440
6.30am?

319
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,919
Gu Nanzhou.

320
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,919
Wake up.

321
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,640
Hurry up.

322
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,679
Wake up.

323
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,400
What time is it now?

324
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
7.50am.

325
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,039
Why are you only waking me up now?

326
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,320
Your meeting is at 9am.

327
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,000
You can make it.

328
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,520
Wake up.

329
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,080
You're a man.

330
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,119
Why are you taking so long?

331
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,000
What did you say?

332
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,280
I mean

333
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,960
can you be more efficient?

334
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,799
If you take your own sweet time,

335
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,960
you'll be late.

336
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,840
If we can't make it,

337
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,119
it's because you didn't
wake me up on time.

338
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I told you yesterday

339
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,039
to wake me up two hours in advance.

340
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,440
It's your negligence.

341
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll do it.

342
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,080
Turn around.

343
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:58,919
Lift your head.

344
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,080
Done.

345
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,919
Let's go.

346
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,559
Come on.

347
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,080
Are you risking my life now?

348
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm merely making it up to you

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,799
for the time you've wasted.

350
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,880
Since you agreed

351
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
to do Jiang Xiaochuan's work,

352
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,039
you should do it well.

353
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,559
Wake me up at 6.30am.

354
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,799
Get breakfast ready at 7am.

355
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,599
That's part of an assistant's job.

356
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
You can't delay my meeting

357
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,039
nor create burden for my body.

358
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,840
Fine.

359
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,119
The boss is always right.

360
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,080
I'll surely do better.

361
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,359
What are you doing?

362
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
Don't you want to have breakfast?

363
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,200
What about punctuality?

364
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,440
We're almost late.

365
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,320
Don't worry.

366
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,719
I managed to buy you 10 minutes.

367
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,840
We still got 40 minutes.

368
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,719
Come on.

369
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,320
The place serves great breakfast.

370
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,479
Don't miss it.

371
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,599
Hurry up.

372
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
Come on, take it.

373
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm telling you.

374
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
They serve great buns.

375
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,000
Occupy seats first.

376
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,680
Hello.

377
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,199
Hello.

378
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,599
Four buns, two deep-fried dough sticks,

379
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,079
two glasses of soy milk

380
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,839
and two eggs.

381
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,640
All right.

382
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,319
Come on, dig in.

383
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,800
Help yourself.

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Boss,

385
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,359
two meat buns, please.

386
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,199
Aren't you hungry?

387
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
If you fall sick

388
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
for skipping breakfast,

389
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
who's responsible for it?

390
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,239
Is it even hygienic?

391
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,520
If I have stomachache,

392
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,199
who will be responsible for it?

393
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,359
Fine, I'll show it to you.

394
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,520
Whose car is it?

395
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm almost late.

396
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,479
I'll hail a cab for you.

397
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,319
I'll pay for the fees.

398
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,439
Don't just stand there.

399
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,959
You should hail a cab, too.

400
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Hailing a cab will take 30 minutes.

401
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,839
What should we do?

402
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,640
Come on.

403
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,000
Hurry up.

404
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,119
Sir.

405
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,520
How much do you charge
for going to Eastern Tower?

406
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,359
RMB20.

407
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,439
Make it RMB15.

408
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,640
I know a shortcut.

409
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,359
It'll shorten the trip.

410
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,079
Fine.

411
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,959
RMB15 then.

412
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,719
-Get on.
-Get on.

413
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,359
Are you asking me to take this?

414
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,119
Just get on

415
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,439
or you'll be late.

416
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,079
Get on.

417
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,959
Go.

418
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,560
All right,

419
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,599
sit tight.

420
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,880
Let's depart.

421
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,040
Guys, here's the place.

422
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:32,839
All right.

423
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,400
Thank you, sir.

424
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,959
You're welcome.

425
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:34,400
Bye.

426
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,280
Goodbye.

427
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:41,719
Mr. Gu,

428
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,599
why is Ms. Zhou with you today?

429
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,680
Where's Xiaochuan?

430
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,920
Xiaochuan is sick.

431
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,959
So

432
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:51,959
she's replacing him temporarily

433
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,800
as my assistant.

434
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,119
It's

435
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,359
due to some special reasons.

436
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,719
Qingqing,

437
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,880
do you know
the responsibility of an assistant?

438
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,280
Have you prepared the materials?

439
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,719
Don't worry,

440
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,160
Mr. Gu has already told me.

441
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,880
An assistant's job is complicated.

442
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,959
You're a first-timer.

443
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,160
If you can't cope with it,

444
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,199
why don't you let me do it?

445
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,119
I think it's perfect.

446
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,640
No.

447
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,599
She should be responsible

448
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,839
for her own matters.

449
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,319
Before the meeting,

450
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,239
turn on the slide

451
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:29,959
of File 28.

452
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,959
Adjust the projector.

453
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,439
I'll tell her this.

454
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:40,959
The layers of colors are too messy.

455
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,319
The movements are not seamless enough.

456
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,560
Most importantly,

457
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,599
the ethereal feeling

458
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,079
is not captured at all.

459
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,439
Mr. Gu,

460
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,400
the part after this involves
a great amount of special effects.

461
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,160
It needs the cooperation of a top team.

462
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,439
The budget might
increase by a few times.

463
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,439
I suggest

464
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,400
delete this chapter.

465
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,599
Mr. Gu,

466
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
it's just a 10-minute scene,

467
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,599
but in terms of risk management,

468
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,199
I agree with Sophia.

469
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,719
The fourth chapter

470
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,599
is the climax of the relationship
between the leading characters.

471
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,920
The image of stars falling
on Lake Xingling

472
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,079
signifies that everyone's dream
has somewhere it belongs.

473
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,719
I really can't compromise on this.

474
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,920
The feeling of the leading
characters being on an island

475
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,880
needs to be enhanced
by the ethereal atmosphere.

476
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,400
Otherwise, the animation, Lake Xingling,

477
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,959
will be considered a failure.

478
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,599
You also understand

479
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,839
what it means by
increasing the investment.

480
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,880
I didn't expect you

481
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,319
to be taking your work seriously.

482
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,640
Although I have an issue with you,

483
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I think you're right.

484
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,719
If we can't create the ethereal feeling,

485
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,199
the feeling of being
in a parallel universe,

486
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,959
with nothing but each other,

487
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,280
can't be captured.

488
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,400
This can't be compromised indeed.

489
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,599
However, I didn't expect you

490
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,199
to persist

491
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,319
in creating good work

492
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,800
despite everyone's objection.

493
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,199
After all,

494
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
it's what I've wanted to do since young.

495
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,920
Have you always wanted
to create an animation?

496
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,719
I think it started when
I was 10 years old.

497
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,079
I watched a foreign animation.

498
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,439
I felt

499
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,439
the need to create a different work.

500
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,839
Unknowingly, I persisted throughout.

501
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,959
I didn't expect you

502
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,079
to be an idealist.

503
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,319
Are you mocking me?

504
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
Of course not.

505
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:40,439
I'm serious.

506
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,880
I rarely see anyone

507
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,800
who stays true to himself or herself.

508
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,359
Actually,

509
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm impressed.

510
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,199
You're brilliant.

511
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,500
(Teachers Office)

512
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,439
The format of this work

513
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,839
is tidier than the previous one.

514
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,959
I could feel that

515
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,920
you've finally found a direction.

516
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,439
Moreover,

517
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,439
from this,

518
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,319
I can see the passion you had
when you first enrolled.

519
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Seriously?

520
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,199
Thank you, Madam.

521
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,359
I'll work hard.

522
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
I summoned you

523
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
for another matter, too.

524
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,280
This is an anime and manga competition

525
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,719
jointly held by Youxun and
eight colleges in Nancheng.

526
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,200
(Youxun Comic Competition)

527
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,599
I think your work, Paradise Street 19

528
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,599
is a suitable entry.

529
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,000
A huge amount of cash prize, an
opportunity of signing up with an agency

530
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,920
and the possibility of having
an independent volume.

531
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,839
You're one

532
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,079
of my most gifted students.

533
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
Thus,

534
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,199
I hope you can seize this opportunity.

535
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,020
(Hubby)

536
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,560
Hello.

537
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Are you back?

538
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,800
Remember to bring lunch to me.

539
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,599
Right away.

540
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,719
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,199
Mr. Gu,

542
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,199
your lunch is here.

543
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,079
There're braised eggplant,

544
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,040
your favorite fish porridge,

545
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,760
as well as prawns.

546
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,280
I don't eat prawns.

547
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,079
It's troublesome.

548
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,599
I already peeled them for you.

549
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,119
Sort out the files of yesterday.

550
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,479
You may leave.

551
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,800
All right, Mr. Gu.

552
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,119
Please enjoy.

553
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:08,839
Mr. Gu,

554
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,719
your coffee.

555
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,119
Please enjoy.

556
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
Does she really like me that much?

557
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,319
Am I seriously very handsome?

558
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,479
I'm indeed very handsome.

559
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,460
(Paradise Street 19)

560
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,540
(Zhou Jianqing's Graduation Design)

561
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,680
My Paradise Street isn't actually...

562
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,479
You don't have to explain it.

563
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:58,920
I don't want

564
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,000
to waste my time on
a worthless thing like this.

565
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,800
For Paradise Street 19,

566
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,959
I didn't plagiarise nor
refer to any other work.

567
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,000
Nor am I riding on anyone's fame.

568
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,760
You're not allowed to read it.

569
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,479
Why are you peeking at it?

570
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Is Paradise Street 19

571
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
your old family house?

572
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,479
What's the matter?

573
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,119
I'm sorry.

574
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,280
When we first met,

575
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,079
I had a bad impression of you.

576
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,160
DiffuseStar is a copycat.

577
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,400
That's why I misunderstood you.

578
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,239
Actually you draw rather well.

579
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Are you

580
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,800
apologizing to me now?

581
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,719
Since you are,

582
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,680
I'll be the bigger man

583
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,400
and forgive you.

584
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,800
However,

585
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,560
to be frank,

586
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,400
the first impression I had of you

587
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,439
was quite bad, too.

588
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,520
I thought

589
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,040
you're an arrogant and ignorant psycho.

590
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,280
Why was I ignorant?

591
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,680
You picked apart my work.

592
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,680
Do you think Vampire Warrior

593
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,439
was well-drawn?

594
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,839
You even stepped on my work.

595
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,680
I compensated you.

596
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,839
That's why I spared you.

597
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,599
Actually,

598
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,560
now I realize

599
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,199
you're quite a nice guy.

600
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,839
Although you're bad-tempered,

601
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm impressed

602
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,719
by someone like you

603
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,079
who devotes yourself to work.

604
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,079
That goes without saying.

605
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:02,880
I am aware of that.

606
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,319
(What does she want?)

607
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
(Why is she sitting here?)

608
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,439
(Is she going to confess
her feelings to me?)

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
Do you have anything to tell me?

610
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,439
Go on.

611
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,160
Actually,

612
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,359
I...

613
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,560
Go on.

614
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,319
I really feel like having
a bowl of instant noodle.

615
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,839
I'm starving.

616
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,920
Look,

617
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,359
I need to rush for
the animation company,

618
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,280
on top of being your assistant

619
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,599
and amending my graduation work.

620
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,439
It's the only glimmer of hope

621
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,400
in my miserable life.

622
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,599
You will allow me to have it, right?

623
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Come on, try and see

624
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,239
whether it's delicious.

625
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,719
I don't take junk food.

626
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,719
Junk food?

627
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,719
I'm good at cooking noodles.

628
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,640
In order to make
a perfect bowl of noodles,

629
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,560
each detail has to be
strictly supervised.

630
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,680
It's like producing an animation.

631
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,760
The spirit of paying
attention to the details.

632
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,239
Strictly control

633
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,520
the amount of each ingredient.

634
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,199
Most importantly,

635
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,560
pour your heart into it.

636
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,439
Come on, I'll demonstrate it to you.

637
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,439
There're steps in taking the noodles.

638
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,959
Take some noodles.

639
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,719
Scoop the soup.

640
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,959
Take some pickled vegetables.

641
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,719
Eat it in one bite.

642
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,400
It's delicious.

643
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,400
Try it.

644
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Just try it.

645
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,839
