4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,559
(would be tall, handsome,)

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,200

00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,559
(and polite, with a sense of humor.)

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,680
(If he can't be all these,)

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,520
(he should at least be handsome.)

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,119
(Who'd have thought)

10
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:35,919

=Hello Mr. Gu=

40
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,297
=Episode 5=

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,320
(The never-ending cycle of
lying and covering up the lie)

42
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,119
Mr. Gu.

43
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,839
Mr. Gu.

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Is anyone in?

45
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,160
Mr. Gu.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,479
Zhou Jianqing.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,520
Brother.

48
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,279
Brother.

49
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,839
Brother,

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,919
drink a glass of water first.

51
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,600
What did you do to my sister?

52
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,440
Why don't you ask her

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
what she did to me?

54
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,279
Brother,

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,039
don't get the wrong idea.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
We only drank together.

57
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,440
You drank?

58
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,240
Why did you

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,119
get a girl drunk?

60
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,399
Brother,

61
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,399
it has nothing to do with him.

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,119
I offered to drink.

63
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,119
You did?

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,839
What if he took advantage
of you when you're drunk?

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,039
Brother,

66
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,199
you misunderstood.

67
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
What happened?

68
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,520
I...

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
We're engaged.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,360
Engaged?

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
Are you Gu Nanzhou?

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,600
Don't tell me you're dating him

73
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,360
to settle my debt?

74
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,519
Brother,

75
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,959
don't get the wrong idea.

76
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,920
We're each other's true love.

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
I really love him

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
and he loves me, too.

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,399
I guarantee that

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,720
our relationship is the purest

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
and no interest is involved.

82
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,279
It's love.

83
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,519
Fine.

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,559
Let me ask you.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,239
When did you get to know each other?

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
-At childhood.
-Last year.

87
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,359
-Last year.
-At childhood.

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
How well do you know her?

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,920
What does she love?

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,920
She loves to eat.

91
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,760
She's a drama queen.

92
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,519
When eating Stir-fried egg with tomato,

93
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,600
does she prefer the tomato

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
or the egg?

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Tomato.

96
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:55,760
Egg.

97
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,679
When is his birthday?

98
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,559
Which university did he graduate from?

99
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,559
Where has he ever worked?

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,799
Brother,

101
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,760
a relationship is about the present.

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,839
What's the point of knowing this?

103
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,359
This information can be found

104
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,079
on Xingyun's homepage
within three minutes,

105
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,160
yet you don't even know.

106
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,920
How dare you claim that it's true love.

107
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,359
Come on, let me ask you.

108
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,640
What do you see in him?

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,959
I

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,399
love him

111
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,399
for his nice appearance and figure.

112
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,239
I care about one's appearance.

113
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,279
Appearance.

114
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,799
What about you?

115
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,679
What do you see in my sister?

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,799
I don't...

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,480
He means there's no
answer to this question.

118
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,880
He's been telling me

119
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,079
loving someone is not about reasons.

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,079
Nanzhou is less superficial than me.

121
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,559
He has substance.

122
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,559
He loves

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,200
my carefree soul.

124
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,399
He's unlike me.

125
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm so shallow

126
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,600
and I'm into his appearance.

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,279
I'll never approve of your relationship.

128
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,000
Why?

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,760
You don't have a chemistry together.

130
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,440
You don't know each other at all.

131
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,359
You got together hastily.

132
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,399
You won't be happy together.

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
I agree with you in this,

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
but don't worry.

135
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,959
In the first place,

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,279
I only want to get married.

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
He means

138
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,279
he wanted to marry me

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,200
the first time he saw me.

140
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:23,880
Dear,

141
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,399
please leave us alone.

142
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,880
I want to talk to my brother.

143
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,799
Go.

144
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,399
Are you sure Gu Nanzhou

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,640
sincerely wants to marry you?

146
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,359
Of course.

147
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
He already proposed.

148
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,239
There's a big diamond ring.

149
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,000
Where is it?

150
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,239
It's too expensive.

151
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,320
So I'm not wearing it.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
Brother,

153
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,399
Gu Nanzhou and I
genuinely love each other.

154
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,880
It's 100% true love.

155
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,959
The moment he appeared,

156
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,119
I thought,

157
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm doomed.

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,839
Maybe

159
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,880
this is love.

160
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,239
I've never been courted

161
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,079
in such a passionate manner.

162
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,880
No one else

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,120
has ever cared for me like this.

164
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,600
He stood among the roses

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
and popped the question

166
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
in front of so many people.

167
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,920
You have no idea

168
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,559
how romantic

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
it was.

170
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,559
You even said yes to such
an old-fashioned proposal?

171
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
What kind of proposal do you want?

172
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,320
Did you expect him to be on a hot air
balloon of the altitude of 20,000m,

173
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,239
facing rapeseed plants

174
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,559
and telling me,

175
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,359
it's all yours?

176
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
So you disappeared earlier on

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,359
to be with him.

178
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,799
Yes.

179
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,719
Since we're engaged,

180
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,799
it's necessary to spend some time

181
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
to get to know each other.

182
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,919
If not,

183
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
how do I know whether he has a problem?

184
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,520
Come to think of it,

185
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,840
on the surface,

186
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,479
there's a huge gap

187
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,799
between you two.

188
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,799
How did you charm him?

189
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,880
You even fooled him into
paying my RMB2 million debt.

190
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm after all

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
a pretty girl in University of Nancheng.

192
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,000
In a year,

193
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,559
I have around 50 or 60 suitors.

194
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,039
30 freaks and 20 weirdos, you mean?

195
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm telling you.

196
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,520
Anyway, we have our family rules.

197
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,719
We must pay the money we owe others.

198
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,119
Don't make your relationship

199
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,039
complicated

200
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,320
over this matter.

201
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
Got it.

202
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,039
I have a feeling that Gu Nanzhou

203
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,000
is kind of weird.

204
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,919
He must be a psycho

205
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,679
or maybe he's traumatized
in childhood...

206
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,479
You're

207
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,400
just jealous that he's better-looking

208
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,640
and more brilliant than you.

209
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Stop teasing me.

210
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,960
Let's get down to business.

211
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,359
If you find any problem
during this period,

212
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,559
just end the relationship.

213
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,799
All right.

214
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,159
I'll report to you if there's a problem.

215
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,239
Fine.

216
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:44,799
I'm leaving.

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,760
All right.

218
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,320
Have a safe trip.

219
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,679
Remember what I told you.

220
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Yes.

221
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,479
Not again.

223
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,760
What's the matter?

224
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,400
Can't I visit you?

225
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,280
Of course you can.

226
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,520
Have a safe trip.

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,359
Bye.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,840
Is he still coming tomorrow?

229
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,359
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,919
My brother worries a lot.

231
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,039
He's smart and paranoid.

232
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,039
I might have to stay here
for a few more days.

233
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,400
Can you do me a favor?

234
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
According to the agreement,

235
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,719
Party B won't create
trouble for Party A.

236
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,159
Party A can request Party B

237
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,880
to do something beyond
the scope of the agreement

238
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,960
in exchange.

239
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,599
What can you exchange?

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,280
Just tell me what you want.

241
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
I'll do it if it's within my means.

242
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,520
You'll surely need me somehow.

243
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,799
Please.

244
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,919
Just treat it as charity

245
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:53,880
and helping the needy.

246
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,119
You will get good karma.

247
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,799
At home, you aren't allowed

248
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,280
to make any sound that is
more than 30 decibel.

249
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,960
If Party B destroys any item at home,

250
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,799
you must compensate me
based on the original price.

251
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,400
Party B must protect

252
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,520
Party A's image at all times.

253
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,280
You can't simply bring
anyone to the house.

254
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,719
No pet is allowed.

255
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,960
All cleaning

256
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,119
will be done by Party B.

257
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,599
Waste sorting has to be done
individually by Party B.

258
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
This is too harsh.

259
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,520
Penalty for a violation.

260
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,679
You're required to leave if there're
more than three violations.

261
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,840
Party A...

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,479
No,

263
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,280
Mr. Gu.

264
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,159
Can we discuss this?

265
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,400
The door is over there.

266
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,080
Gu Nanzhou.

267
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,359
You're being too much.

268
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,400
Forget about the first 19 terms.

269
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,520
For the 20th term,

270
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't stay here alone.

271
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,359
You can choose not to stay here.

272
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,000
Continue.

273
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,719
Let me ask you.

274
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,799
How long have they been together?

275
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,000
I seriously have no idea.

276
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,400
You're her best friend.

277
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,520
How can you not know?

278
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,000
She didn't tell me, seriously.

279
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,520
Zhou Jianqing is not a secretive person.

280
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
She neither told you nor
posted it on her social media.

281
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,000
Gu Nanzhou is kind of weird, too.

282
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,799
There're flaws in the way
he speaks and acts.

283
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,119
I think he's keeping something from me.

284
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,520
There must be a problem with him.

285
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll make a move first.

286
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,719
Qingqing,

287
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Xuan looked for me yesterday.

288
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,960
He didn't seem to
believe you're engaged.

289
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,239
You should figure out a way.

290
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,239
He'll surely get to the bottom of this.

291
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,440
How's your life at Gu Nanzhou's home?

292
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,640
Did he

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
make life difficult for you?

294
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,080
He

295
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,599
is a psycho.

296
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
The books at home

297
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,159
must be sorted alphabetically.

298
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,000
Why didn't you

299
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,239
return the books to the spots?

300
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,719
Didn't I put them back?

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,799
Transformation

302
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,239
should be put behind Light-Year Stories.

303
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is it in front?

304
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
Peruvian Traditions

305
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,320
should be put in E category.

306
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,159
Why is it in C category?

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,760
What are you waiting for?

308
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,520
I'm not allowed to
keep unfinished beverage.

309
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
I have to discard it.

310
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,960
What is this?

311
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,479
Beverage.

312
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,479
Why don't you discard it if it's opened?

313
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,400
There's still half left.

314
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,039
It's a pity to discard it.

315
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll continue to drink it later.

316
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,080
Discard it.

317
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,080
It's an eyesore.

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,440
When I'm sitting on the sofa,

319
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,200
I can't flatten the pillows.

320
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,479
From now on,

321
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,799
I'll never sit on the sofa anymore.

322
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,039
You'd better

323
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,840
remember the terms in the agreement.

324
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,960
Last night...

325
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,559
You came out of nowhere.

326
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,640
I told you

327
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
after 12 o'clock,

328
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,599
you're not allowed to make any sound.

329
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,599
It's not 12 o'clock yet.

330
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Look at that.

331
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,039
It's only past a minute.

332
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,599
Also,

333
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,880
strawberry mousse has high calorie.

334
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,280
Drinking cola in midnight

335
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,679
is bad for your teeth.

336
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,400
The grapes

337
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,320
are rich in sugar.

338
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,440
Bananas

339
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,599
are all right.

340
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,000
Gu Nanzhou,

341
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,640
you're so nosy.

342
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,400
Follow my rules when
you're staying here.

343
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,719
He lectured me for half an hour.

344
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,440
Tell me.

345
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,679
Isn't he crazy?

346
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,280
Oh, Qingqing,

347
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,440
why is Gu Nanzhou like this?

348
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,159
It must be harsh for you.

349
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,559
However, Qingqing,

350
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,760
you should think twice.

351
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,400
Your brother

352
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
is not easy to fool.

353
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,400
If you don't show him concrete proof,

354
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,640
he won't believe it.

355
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,119
What should I do?

356
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,000
This is too difficult.

357
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,640
Mr. Gu,

358
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,239
our team spent a long time

359
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,239
working on this.

360
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,719
It's the best version

361
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,919
with our existing resources.

362
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,000
For this part,

363
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,159
actually I want to present

364
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,919
Lake Xingling as an ethereal fantasy,

365
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,280
like the reference effect I showed you.

366
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,599
However, your work

367
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
does not live up to my expectations.

368
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,400
Mr. Gu, to be frank,

369
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,559
your desired effect

370
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,200
can't be achieved

371
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,640
with the existing technology in China.

372
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,919
If you turn to an overseas company,

373
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,640
Xingyun's budget

374
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,119
can't cover it at all.

375
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,039
You're right.

376
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,479
The technology overseas

377
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,760
is indeed more mature.

378
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,440
Mr. Gu, what I mean is

379
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
we will

380
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,320
try our best to fulfill
your requirement.

381
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
What are you doing here?

382
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,719
I know you've been working overtime.

383
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,320
So I specially cooked
chicken soup for you.

384
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
It's for your nourishment.

385
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,760
I spent two hours on it.

386
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,919
It smells really great.

387
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm not hungry.

388
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,119
Smell it.

389
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,960
It tastes as good as it looks.

390
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,159
Put it down.

391
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

392
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,559
I did this

393
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,640
just to thank you for taking me in.

394
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,719
If you like the soup,

395
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,599
I'll deliver it to you tomorrow,

396
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,320
the day after tomorrow

397
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,719
and the following days

398
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,200
There's no need for that.

399
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,760
Do you have anything else?

400
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,799
If not, just go back.

401
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,520
I'll leave after you
take the chicken soup.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,760
I have to

403
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,880
bring the lunch box back for washing.

404
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,520
What are you doing?

405
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,319
I just want to take
a photo with you, Mr. Gu.

406
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,839
No photo is allowed.

407
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,239
All right.

408
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,400
I told you no photo was allowed.

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,439
Don't delete it.

410
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,119
I need the photo to convince my brother.

411
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,079
It's none of my concern.

412
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,719
If he doesn't believe

413
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,800
that we're dating,

414
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,439
he'll think

415
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm dating you for the money.

416
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,280
If he disturbs you everyday,

417
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,439
you will be bothered.

418
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't have to cooperate

419
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,560
with you to take the photos.

420
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,000
You can use it to convince your mother.

421
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
She called me last night.

422
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,520
I told her

423
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,880
about our engagement.

424
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,520
You...

425
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,920
You also don't want her to know

426
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,640
we're putting on an act, right?

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,359
Just treat it as fulfilling
your filial piety,

428
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
so that your mother will be relieved.

429
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,400
We're helping each other.

430
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,599
Don't be calculative.

431
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
Just take a few photos with me.

432
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,760
It won't take long.

433
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,280
Otherwise,

434
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,959
your mother will call me again.

435
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm only free at noon.

436
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,880
Thank you.

437
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,160
You're really kind.

438
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,000

00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,280
Hurry up.

00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,800

for Fengchi, this project

514
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
will be too risky.

515
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,439
Xingyun can't afford the consequences
of increasing investment.

516
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,359
If Mr. Gu insists on
increasing the investment,

517
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,439
Mr. Jin

518
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,800
will never follow suit.

519
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,520
Mr. Gu,

520
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,079
Lake Xingling's current investment

521
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,520
is reaching the budget limit.

522
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,800
If we turn to foreign companies
for special effects,

523
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,839
the investment will increase
by at least two times.

524
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,400
The risk will be unpredictable.

525
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,319
Moreover...

526
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,000
Stop talking.

527
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Mr. Gu,

528
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,400
did you even finish this
box of medicine, too?

529
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,239
Bring me the report of Lake Xingling's

530
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:38,760
investment increase.

531
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,920
Why did you simply
look at others' stuff?

532
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
It's just some couple photos.

533
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,119
Why can't I look at them?

534
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,760
You're done.

535
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,359
Just go.

536
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,839
I only came here for two minutes,

537
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,640
yet you're chasing me away.

538
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,439
Are you even my sister?

539
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,959
You've been here for
more than half an hour.

540
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,640
-No.
-Just leave.

541
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,319
Dear, you're back.

542
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,560
Please do me a favor.

543
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,520
You're back, brother-in-law.

544
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,439
Just nice,

545
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,839
I want to talk to you.

546
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Here's RMB10,000.

547
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,119
I'll

548
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,479
return the rest to you gradually.

549
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,400
I've already planned it.

550
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,199
In the first year, I'll return
you RMB10,000 monthly.

551
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
In the following year, I'll
increase the payment

552
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:47,640
by 50% every year.

553
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
As for the interests,
I'll pay based on

554
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,640
bank loan interests.

555
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,040
Don't worry.

556
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
I won't take advantage of you.

557
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,839
I don't need you

558
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,439
to return the money.

559
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
By rights,

560
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
my sister is marrying you.

561
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,839
You should call me brother-in-law.

562
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,199
However, come to think of it,

563
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,439
even siblings should
make transactions clear.

564
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,319
I've already told you.

565
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,920
You don't have to return the money.

566
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,119
I've already told you, too.

567
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
You must take it.

568
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,319
We're done talking about money.

569
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
Let's talk about my sister.

570
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,680
This recorded my years of experience

571
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,839
in taking care of Qingqing.

572
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,319
Please read it carefully.

573
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,079
(Handbook on caring for Zhou Jianqing)
Since our parents passed away,

574
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,280
I've been caring for Qingqing.

575
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,280
Although my sister

576
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,239
is flawed,

577
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,760
she's my sister after all.

578
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,760
I can't bear to see her being wronged.

579
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,000
Am I right?

580
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,000
This is too troublesome.

581
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,239
I've been caring for Qingqing for years.

582
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,199
Did I complain?

583
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,599
I finally raised her up

584
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,839
and now she's with you.

585
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,800
Did I ever think it's unfair?

586
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,760
You've cared for her for years,

587
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,479
but you've also
created troubles for her.

588
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,599
How does that count?

589
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
Those are different matters.

590
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,233
(Yinshan Animation)

591
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,359
Not bad.

592
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,280
The response for the comic is great.

593
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,439
It's even ranked among the top 15
most searched comic in the website.

594
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,959
The platform thinks highly of you.

595
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,599
Thank you, boss.

596
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,280
I'll continue to work hard.

597
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,199
Therefore,

598
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:26,959
I think you should strike
while the iron is hot.

599
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,880
Update it this week.

600
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,800
Update it again?

601
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,239
Mr. Gu is rich.

602
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,520
Why do you have

603
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
to make your own living?

604
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,839
What do you know?

605
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Anytime,

606
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,439
a woman should have her own career.

607
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,719
If I have a girlfriend,

608
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
as long as she's happy,

609
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,359
I don't mind providing for her.

610
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,640
You're lame.

611
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,479
Things are different now.

612
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,920
Your mindset is outdated.

613
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,520
Ladies

614
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
should be independent.

615
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,160
You're

616
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,959
still young.

617
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:09,920
You don't understand.

618
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,880
I'll leave if you don't get in now.

619
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,880
Coming.

620
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,800
I'll make a move first.

621
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,439
See you tomorrow.

622
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,319
Junk food.

623
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,040
Hello, your food delivery.

624
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,239
What is it?

625
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,920
Snail rice noodle.

626
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:37,920
It's yours.

627
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,359
Where's my food delivery?

628
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,239
I discarded it.

629
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,920
I ordered the food.

630
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,000
Why did you discard it?

631
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
Don't you know what time it is?

632
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,839
Why do you want to
eat such a smelly food?

633
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,760
I'm eating it in my own room.

634
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,839
How does it concern you?

635
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,760
Your room?

636
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,040
That's part of my house.

637
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,599
Fine.

638
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,760
Your house.

639
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,160
Everything is yours.

640
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,640
Can't you be understanding?

641
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,479
I'm rushing for work at night.

642
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you want me to starve?

643
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,199
The rules are long set.

644
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,319
Moreover, according to the agreement,

645
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,680
even you are mine.

646
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,239
Do you have to go so far?

647
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,280
Every day, when I'm here,

648
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,760
I have to be cautious

649
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
even when I'm drinking water
or in the bathroom.

650
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,319
I ordered food delivery.

651
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,079
You wouldn't smell anything
if I closed the door,

652
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:22,959
yet you discarded it.

653
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,239
Do you want everyone

654
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,800
to follow your lifestyle?

655
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,599
If you are reluctant,

656
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,439
you can leave immediately.

657
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,199
You...

658
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,000
Luckily I have smelly tofu.

659
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,160
Stupid guy.

660
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,040
Forget it if he stopped me

661
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
from having snail rice noodle
in the room,

662
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
he even discarded my smelly tofu.

663
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:03,319
I don't mind skipping supper.

664
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,119
Just treat it as going on a diet.

665
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,479
Was I

666
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
being too harsh just now?

667
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:35,520
Zhou Jianqing.

668
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,800

669
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:38,959
