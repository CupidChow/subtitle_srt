(Semi Final Entry)

32
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:50,839
Gu Nanzhou!

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
I am nominated!

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,639
It's awesome!

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,440
I did not expect

36
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,160
to make it to the semi-finals.

37
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,559
Then, I can surely

38
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,679
get RMB10,000.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's RMB10,000!

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,119
I might have a chance to publish
my single volume comic, too.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,800
Am I going to be famous?

42
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,440
You will.

43
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,199
I need to prepare a nomination speech

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,279
for the semi-final.

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,559
I can also bring my friends along.

46
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,880
Are you busy on Friday?

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,880
Do you want to go along?

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Forget it if you don't want to go.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
Though I am usually very busy,

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,880
I can make time to go with you.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,240
Okay.

53
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,320
Let's have our meal.

54
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,119
Can you

55
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,160
investigate Zhou Jianqing?

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,839
If it's possible,

57
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,279
can you do me a favor

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,639
with the comic competition?

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
You made a great progress.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,000
Keep up the good work.

61
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,800
Based on your current level,

62
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,679
you can surely get an A
for your graduation project.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,399
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

64
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,399
I will work hard.

65
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,800
By the way,

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,919
are you close

67
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,119
to Zhang Yin?

68
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,919
Please talk to him when you are free.

69
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,320
His current level

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
(Comic Illustration Competition)
is considered top-notch

71
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,679
among the oil painting majors.

72
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,119
This contest is a rare chance.

73
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,119
He'll also have a chance to know

74
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,600
top artists in the industry.

75
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,839
If he gives up the contest

76
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,559
for the sake of the part-time work,

77
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,480
that's too bad.

78
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,239
Part-time work?

79
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,480
I heard he's working as
an assistant for someone.

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,119
Yes.

81
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,239
Being an assistant

82
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,359
can indeed help

83
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,320
to improve his level.

84
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,920
However, he can work anytime,

85
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,399
while this contest

86
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,160
is only held every two years.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Once he misses it,

88
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,519
there will be no chance for him

89
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,160
to participate in it after graduation.

90
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,279
Are we going to Shaw Building

91
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,920
or Building One?

92
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,160
We have to finalize

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,959
the first eight pages by tonight.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,239
Why don't you join
the oil painting contest?

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,559
I have no interest in that.

96
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,720
Don't lie to me.

97
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,000
Your favorite people, Mr. Li Ya

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,959
and Raman Anderson,

99
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,160
will be in the contest.

100
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
How could you not be interested?

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I admire them.

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,359
It doesn't mean I have
to join the contest.

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,160
This contest is only
held every two years.

104
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,600
If you don't go this year,

105
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,040
you won't be able to
participate in it next year.

106
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,799
With your level,

107
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,480
it's a pity to not participate in it.

108
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,440
Didn't you say that I have a high level?

109
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,920
It's okay not to
participate in this contest.

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
As your junior, I

111
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
will definitely shine in the future.

112
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,440
Did you

113
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
give up the contest

114
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,359
to be my assistant?

115
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:39,880
Correct.

116
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,600
I want to be your assistant.

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
If you get the first place

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,279
in that contest,

119
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,000
we'll get hundreds of thousands
of RMB in cash prize.

120
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,079
You've promised

121
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,119
to give me half of it.

122
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,200
As your senior, am I

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
a disloyal friend?

124
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,600
You've helped me so much.

125
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,559
Of course you deserve
half of the cash prize.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,760
Hurry up.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Just do what you should.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Being your assistant

129
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,679
is my own decision.

130
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,720
I'll fire you then.

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Starting from tomorrow,

132
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,880
you are no longer my assistant.

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
However,

134
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,359
you're still my closest junior.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,399
Focus on the contest.

136
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,160
Beat all those people

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,359
and bring glory to me.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,279
Without me,

139
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,679
can you cope

140
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,760
with the workload?

141
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,920
You've worked with me for so long.

142
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,839
Don't you have confidence in me?

143
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,559
I'm nicknamed

144
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:39,440
Little Superman, okay?

145
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,559
Got it.

146
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,679
By the way,

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,959
you must come on Friday

148
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,440
and share the cash prize.

149
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,300
(VIP)

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,460
(Annual Award. An honorable moment.)

151
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,519
Xuan.

152
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,399
Why didn't you

153
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,200
come to school for Qingqing lately?

154
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm busy.

155
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,320
Senior.

156
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,279
How's progress of your thesis?

157
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:32,920
Did you pass the middle stage?

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes.

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,359
That's not bad.

160
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,160
Why don't we have a group chat

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,799
to canvass for Qingqing?

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,839
Come on.

163
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,440
It's okay.

164
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay.

165
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,160
When will it be your turn today?

166
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,519
I'm the third.

167
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,399
Are you ready with your speech?

168
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,119
I've been ready for a long time.

169
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:06,839
Don't worry.

170
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
What do you think of this?

171
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I have seen before.

172
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,359
It's just like that.

173

Thank you, my sponsor.

175
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,839
If I knew you could only stay backstage,

176
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,359
I wouldn't have asked you to come.

177
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm leaving then.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,119
You are already here.

179
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,119
Just stay here.

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,640
Anyway, your presence
will multiply the happiness.

Hello, Zhang Yin.

183
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
When will you get on the stage?

184
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,280
It's really awkward here.

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
They have never been
at peace with each other.

186

Don't mind it.

187

By the way,

188
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,640
let me treat all of you to hot pot

189
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,080
after getting the prize, okay?

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,119
Okay.

We're going for hot pot later.

I am going.

Okay, everyone is going.

198
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,039

272
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,799
I was wearing headphones
and didn't hear you.

273

Are you

274
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,119
really okay?

275

276

having hot pot tonight?

285

286
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,640

291
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:33,520
Wait.

292
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,200
Go.

293
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,799
Hurry back.

294
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,400
Qingqing.

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,200
All right.

296
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Go back now.

297
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:37,880
Bye.

298
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,679
Please keep an eye on her
in the next few days.

299
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,719
Don't worry.

300
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,599
By the way,

301
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,960
she likes taking sweet stuff

302
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
and heavily flavored food

303
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,640
when she is in a bad mood.

304
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,280
The hotter and spicier, the better.

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,599
I will remember to buy it.

306
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,440
Also,

307
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,559
you have to watch her.

308
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,559
Don't let her simply buy things.

309
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,080
Otherwise, she'll be sad again

310
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,479
after she gets better and sees herself

311
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,440
having spent so much money.

312
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,280
Got it.

313
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Also,

314
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,359
don't let her drink alcohol.

315
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,000
She goes crazy after drinking.

316
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,679
Sometimes, she even bites people.

317
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,359
I have seen it.

318
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,359
I'll pay attention to it.

319
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,799
In fact, it's okay to drink a little.

320
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,359
At least she can vent it.

321
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,119
Why don't you let her drink
a little in the next two days?

322
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,799
When she goes mad,

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,960
be her sandbag

324
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,919
and let her vent her anger.

325
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:21,719
I...

326
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,559
You're a man.

327
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,159
Sometimes, you need to be more tolerant.

328
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,760
The pain is nothing.

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
Making a girl happy is more
important than anything else.

330
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,159
Do you hear me?

331
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,200
Okay.

332
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,679
Then,

333
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,039
we're leaving.

334
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
Please take care of Qingqing.

335
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,320
Don't worry.

336
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,880
Is Qingqing all right?

337
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,599
I think so.

338
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,959
Didn't you see her

339
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,439
alive and kicking just now?

340
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
However, that's the way she is.

341
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,199
The sadder she is,
the stronger she acts.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
Then you should know

343
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
that the more you ask her,

344
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,959
the more pressured she feels.

345
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,400
You're right.

346
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,640
Let her have some personal time then.

347
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,680
Are you

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
still attending classes lately?

349
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes.

350
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,920
You're graduating, but
your schedule is still full.

351
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,359
I have to find something to do.

352
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,280
You are quite busy then.

353
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,719
Yes.

354
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,719
No wonder

355
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,959
I feel like

356
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,000
I have not seen you for a long time.

357
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,560
The ride I hailed seems to have arrived.

358
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,560
I'm leaving.

359
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,040
Why are you watching
a horror movie at this hour?

360
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,940
(Your e-mail is sent.)

361
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,479
May we have a happy cooperation.

362
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,439
Happy cooperation.

363
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,079
Mr. Sun, your investment

364
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,319
in our Lake Xingling

365
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,959
really helps Xingyun a lot.

366
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,199
Why don't we have
a meal together tonight

367
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,000
to celebrate our cooperation?

368
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,719
Mr. Sun, I remember that

369
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,160
you love Huaiyang cuisine, right?

370
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,000
Ms. Jiang, you have a good memory.

371
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,520
All right.

372
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,199
Let's have

373
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,479
an early celebration tonight

374
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,640
as Lake Xingling will become

375
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,439
the dark horse this year.

376
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,040
(Gu Nanzhou,)

377
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,560
(can I trouble you with one thing?)

378
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,640
(Qingqing neither answered
my calls nor opened the door.)

379
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,079
(I am really worried about her.)

380
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,119
(I'm afraid that she can't get over)

381
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,760
(the online backlash.)

382
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,520
Mr. Gu,

383
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,760
are you free tonight?

384
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,400
I have something urgent.

385
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
I have to go home.

386
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,400
Mr. Sun finally agreed

387
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,880
to invest in our project.

388
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,680
Can't you leave after dinner?

389
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes, Mr. Gu.

390
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,880
What's the hurry?

391
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Must it be done tonight?

392
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,839
It seems that I am

393
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,880
not that important to you.

394
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,920
Mr. Sun, don't say that.

395
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,640
I do have something urgent at home.

396
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,239
I have to trouble you tonight

397
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,599
to entertain Mr. Sun.

398
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,239
Sorry.

399
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,239
Su Youxia.

400
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,839
I'll open the door for you.

401
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,640
Something came up. So I won't go up.

402
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,760
Is Qingqing okay?

403
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,920
Please comfort her.

404
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,199
Don't worry.

405
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,000
She has been living comfortably

406
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,239
and doing business.

407
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,520
Doing business?

408
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,520
The netizens photoshopped her photos.

409
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,400
She went to the comments to take orders

410
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,359
by posting her online store address.

411
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,239
Then, she showed off to me that
she had a good business sense.

412
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
Qingqing

413
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,520
likes to act strong.

414
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
The sadder she is,

415
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
the more talkative she is.

416
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,800
She talks

417
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,160
non-stop.

418
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,839
She must be very sad yesterday.

419
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,400
However, she

420
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,800
was in the mood to watch
a horror movie at night.

421
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
She watched a horror movie?

422
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh no.

423
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:00,839
No wonder she didn't

424
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,079
even answer my calls.

425
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,400
What should I do?

426
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,920
What does watching a horror movie

427
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
have to do with this?

428
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,199
I found out that she likes to act strong

429
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,439
after knowing her for many years.

430
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,400
At first, I thought

431
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,599
she is just carefree.

432
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Later I noticed

433
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,439
that she'd go to my house
to watch horror movies

434
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,520
whenever she's unhappy.

435
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,239
In fact,

436
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,880
she's giving herself

437
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,359
a good reason to cry.

438
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,000
No wonder.

439
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
(Even the hourglasses
are exactly the same.)

440
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,959
(The hourglass works the same
way as entering the house.)

441
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,040
(Even if one imitates the crime,)

442
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,319
(it'd be impossible to do it so well.)

443
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:45,959
(I think)

444
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,920
(it's most likely the same criminal.)

445
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,359
(However, I think)

446
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,280
(the crime scene)

447
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,319
(is a little different from the previous.)

448
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,640
(Correct.)

449
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,040
(I have this feeling, too.)

450
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,199
What are you doing?

451
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,800
(Let's take a look.)

452
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,119
I'll watch it with you.

453
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,119
(Look a little more carefully.)

454
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,239
(Yes.)

455
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,239
(Look over there.)

456
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,280
Don't you hate horror movies?

457
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
I can watch it

458
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,680
if I lower my standard.

459
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,199
(Did you find anything?)

460
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,880
(It's the same.)

461
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,280
Focus on the movie.

462
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,040
Can you not scare me?

463
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,800
(Boss.)

464
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,680
(The entry method was the same.)

465
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,359
(Yes.)

466
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,479
Can you go back to your room to sleep?

467
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,199
No.

468
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,239
The plot is illogical.

469
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,719
They knew

470
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,719
that someone died in the room.

471
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,040
Why would they split up?

472
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,680
Why would the one that's left behind

473
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,760
walk alone?

474
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,520
This...

475
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,719
The plot is not logical.

476
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
Couldn't I complain?

477
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,800
Could you not hold me while you said it?

478
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,119
Is this okay?

479
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,599
I can watch anything.

480
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,079
Come on.

481
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,880
Go ahead

482
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,800
if you want to cry.

483
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,800
Turn your face away.

484
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Cover your ears.

485
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,280
In fact,

486
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,520
I'm sad.

487
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,560
When I saw the script,

488
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:36,959
I noticed that

489
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,640
the style was so different.

490
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,400
I even found

491
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,800
that some plots were familiar.

492
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,560
I wanted to check it,

493
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,640
but the boss was urging me.

494
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,800
So I just left it.

495
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,680
If I thought about it

496
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,280
and checked it,

497
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,280
maybe

498
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,479
things would have been different.

499
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Actually, it's not your fault.

500
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,599
Even if you didn't do it,

501
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,680
they would have got
another person to copy it.

502
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,439
I asked you not to listen to me.

503
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
My hands

504
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,400
don't have good soundproofing.

505
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,920
I'll take

506
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,439
their scolding

507
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,719
as my punishment.

508
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,560
We must have the courage to admit it

509
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,040
after doing something wrong.

510
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,119
Only then we can
go further and be better.

511
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,319
We need to know how we lose

512
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,640
in order to win honorably.

513
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,239
Says who?

514
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,119
Me.

515
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Am I amazing?

516
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,640
Next time,

517
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,239
I'll

518
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,479
make a great comeback.

519
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,640
I want those who scolded me

520
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,680
to sing a different tune.

521
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,959
They will be obsessed with my comic

522
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,319
and urge me to update it.

523
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,160
Actually, you are braver than me.

524
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
What did you say?

525
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,040
Nothing.

526
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,719
(Today,)

527
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,680
(only today,)

528
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,079
(allow me to be willful)

529
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,959
(and lean on his shoulder.)

530
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,719
(From tomorrow onwards,)

531
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,400
(I will be a good Party B.)

532
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:17,959
(I promise.)

533
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,479
I'm going to the subway station.

534
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:27,959
Let me give you a ride.

535
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,040
It's okay.

536
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,160
It's very crowded in
the morning peak hours.

537
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,880
I'm leaving.
