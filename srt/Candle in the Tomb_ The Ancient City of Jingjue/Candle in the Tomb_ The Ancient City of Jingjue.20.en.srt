00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,500
(Episode 20)

4
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
One of us

5
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,000
really is not a human.

6
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,380
What other than human?

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,700
Immortals,

8
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,020
a monster.

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,700
I just said it casually.

10
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,120
It's in a painting.

11
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,240
Miss Yang,

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,080
you see, there is another possibility.

13
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,200
Is it possible that

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,560
there are five people in it.

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
But it was so long ago that

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,500
because of this.

17
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,440
This stone box is very well preserved.

18
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,160
And has no signs of peeling off.

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,960
Besides, it's clear on it

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,860
that a round head

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,060
and the strings are the limbs

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,180
and body.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
It says that

24
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,060
one of these four people.

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,720
One of them opened the stone box.

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,800
Not just a child.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,140
How can he predict what will happen?

28
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,340
Isn't this just a broken stone box?

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
It's not locked.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,660
He said only one of us

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,880
only one can open it.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Let's hold it against him.

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,880
Give me your hand.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,720
Let's open it.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,940
Come on, Hu.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,920
Monster!

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,980
He was dead.

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,740
They were dead.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,140
They're dead.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,180
Are they ghosts?

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,260
Professor.

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,700
Stop Fatty!

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
Professor. Professor.

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,780
Professor?

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,640
Monster?

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Professor.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,020
Monster, I'm not afraid of you.

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,680
Professor.

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,500
-I'm not afraid of you. I'm a scientist.
-The professor.

50
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,400
Fatty, push harder!

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm pushing so hard, can't you see?

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,720
Professor.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,440
Little Ye.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,360
Professor.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,100
I'm a scientist.

56
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,280
-She Ye.
-Right. -Right.

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
It's okay, Professor.

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,420
Little Ye, wake up.

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,440
Little Ye, wake up!

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,300
Little Ye.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
-Left.
-The second leaf.

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,340
You Ye!

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Ye Ye, what's wrong?

64
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,000
Little Ye.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,540
The leaflet, the leaflet.

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,220
The leaflet.

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,380
Ye Ye was already weak to begin with.

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,220
After this,

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,340
I finally can't take it anymore.

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
Darn it!

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,540
It's all your fault.

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,400
You should be responsible for all of this.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,240
You know what?

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,100
We won't stop if we can get out.

75
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,360
You monsters!

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,820
I'll fight with you!

77
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
Professor Chen

78
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,340
what are you doing? Professor Chen!

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,840
Professor Chen!

80
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,660
-Don't come near me!
-What do you want?

81
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,840
You're all monsters!

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,760
Professor Chen!

83
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,920
- Fatty!
- Hey!

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,640
Hurry!

85
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,860
-You are all monsters.
- Professor.

86
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,740
- Professor?
- Monster!

87
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,400
-Calm down. -Come on.
- Professor.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,200
Monster!

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,340
Uncle Chen.

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,200
Uncle Chen, what's wrong?

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
Nothing can happen to you.

92
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,780
Don't you fear?

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,140
Aren't you afraid of monsters?

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,280
Hu, the prophet's words came true.

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,120
We have four people now.

96
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,160
And Professor Chen is the only one

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,920
opened the Stone Box alone

98
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,320
since the prophet predicted that

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,380
that we will come here

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
and maybe tell us the way out.

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,420
What is this drawing?

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Is it still a prophecy?

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,260
Definitely.

104
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,140
Does he tell us

105
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,340
how to get out of this?

106
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,800
Old Hu, say something.

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,620
What does it say?

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,860
If I'm right,

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,940
the second stone box can also be opened.

110
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,140
But the prediction says that

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,180
that the one who opens the second Stone Box

112
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,480
among the four of them,

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
one of us is a demon.

114
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,260
Evil ghost?

115
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,680
Don't joke with me.

116
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,080
Come here.

117
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,980
The first picture states that

118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,800
one of the four persons who opened the stone box

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,620
one of them

120
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,960
with eyes on his head

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,020
and have two snake teeth in their mouths.

122
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,980
Fatty, what does this

123
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,360
of the temple

124
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,540
the heads and bodies of the snakes are the same.

125
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,180
Look at this one.

126
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,100
The second and third pictures are juxtaposed.

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,820
There are two results.

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,140
One is

129
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,740
four of you open the Stone Box.

130
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,480
The evil ghost suddenly appeared and attacked,

131
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,980
and killed three people.

132
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,500
The other one was a demon lying on the ground.

133
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,580
With her head separated.

134
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
The other three

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
and open the second stone box.

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Inside the tomb chamber, a passage appears.

137
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,300
This is it.

138
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,280
Maybe it's the way

139
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,280
this is the way to escape from heaven.

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,240
Hu, I see.

141
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,420
That means we kill it

142
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,160
and escape.

143
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,900
I think the prophet wants to tell us

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,060
let us choose our fate.

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,400
I know who this evil ghost is.

146
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,340
He can be sure.

147
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,820
I know what you're thinking.

148
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,720
But Fatty, I'm telling you.

149
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,300
We must all stay calm.

150
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,520
How can we stay calm?

151
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,140
We don't have much time.

152
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,440
You know what?

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,880
Any further delay will ruin her life.

154
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,640
She is dead.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,300
Professor Chen

156
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,260
he might die soon

157
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,140
of course I know

158
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,320
but now every one of us

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,220
could be anyone,

160
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,260
Including you and me

161
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,060
hu Bayi and you're suspecting me too?

162
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,140
What are you doing?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
What's inside the Stone Box?

164
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,360
Nothing.

165
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,500
It's empty. Nothing.

166
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,760
We just discussed the matter

167
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,640
and see if there's another way out.

168
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,440
To find the exit.

169
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,060
-Filu goes down 3,000 feet.
-No! No!

170
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,980
The water is poisonous.

171
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,640
Professor.

172
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,560
You know what?

173
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,820
You're the boss from now on.

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,520
Test me first.

175
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,660
You can deal with this however you want.

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
If I am not a demon,

177
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,580
don't blame me for being harsh.

178
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,680
We can't talk about democracy anymore.

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,940
Political power under the gun.

180
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,760
Are you saying that producing political power under a gun

181
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,780
are you out of your mind?

182
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,820
You are what? I told you.

183
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,760
That's what Chairman Mao said.

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,860
I've found a way.

185
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Fatty!

186
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,680
That evil ghost

187
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,780
must come from

188
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,620
of Jing Jie Kingdom, right?

189
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,840
Right.

190
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,600
So no matter how it disguises itself,

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,360
It has never experienced the Cultural Revolution.

192
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,880
It has never accepted

193
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,640
political studies,

194
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,100
and I've never read the news or newspaper.

195
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,060
Get to the point.

196
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,220
We'll test it

197
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,560
with something we don't know.

198
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,020
Fatty.

199
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,460
Do you still remember the poem

200
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,500
to pay tribute to the warrior

201
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,360
of the Third World War.

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,220
The poem?

203
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,260
I remember that poem.

204
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,480
On your 16th birthday,

205
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,700
you copied this long poem

206
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,460
that I gave you.

207
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,060
Before World War II

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,880
and the last system of exploitation,

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,440
we were placed in the same class.

210
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
Our friendship started there.

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,220
Can't be calculated.

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,820
We only know it is higher than the mountain and further than the road.

213
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,100
In the trenches,

214
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,980
we shared a loaf of bread,

215
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,920
♪ And lick the salt ♪

216
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,060
♫ Humming the same melody ♫

217
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,700
We cover the same army blanket.

218
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,740
Each and every word

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,920
leader's thoughts. The great truth.

220
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,940
We've learned it over and over again.

221
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,540
Under the red flag

222
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,300
with my sincere wish to the Party,

223
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,620
and dedicated to the Party,

224
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,940
we clench the guns and raise our fists

225
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,640
and swear to steel.

226
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,860
We are willing

227
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,840
to give everything

228
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
to the realization of communism.

229
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,240
We were struck by the towering gunfire,

230
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,280
we stand shoulder to shoulder.

231
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,140
Break through the enemy's 300-meter defense line.

232
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,920
♪ The sub-machine guns ♪

233
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,300
Telling the bullets of

234
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,420
of the proletariat.

235
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
What are you doing?

236
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,240
Don't bother about something.

237
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Have a bite

238
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
and give it to Professor Chen

239
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,100
to Professor Chen

240
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,060
just do as I say.

241
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,700
It will do you no harm but good.

242
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
Are you out of your mind?

243
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,820
The black donkey's feet

244
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,160
are used to ward off evil spirits.

245
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,100
I won't dig into it.

246
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
She knows everything.

247
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,420
To tell you the truth,

248
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,580
there is a prophecy in that stone box.

249
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,680
The four of us,

250
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,180
one of us is an evil ghost.

251
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,900
We can't get out unless we kill it.

252
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
We've finished the test.

253
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,240
Sorry,

254
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,940
you two are the only two left.

255
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,880
If you don't dare to bite it,

256
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,680
that means there's something wrong with you.

257
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Do you want to bite it?

258
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,700
No, so what?

259
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,600
Stop wasting time to argue with her.

260
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,300
Look at that.

261
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Don't come here.

262
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,520
That's enough!

263
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,360
Hu is pointing a gun at us.

264
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,260
Hu Bayi suspected that you two were fighting

265
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,240
you are trying to rebel.

266
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,840
You want to kill me to keep my mouth shut?

267
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,460
You two jerks

268
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,020
I should have exposed you long ago.

269
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,860
And you're at it?

270
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,560
Do you think you are the only good shooter?

271
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
We're two against one, I'm not afraid of you.

272
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
You know what?

273
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,660
I caught a ghost before I died

274
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,020
this trip is worth it.

275
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,240
Really?

276
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,480
If they're ghosts, you two are ghosts.

277
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,740
To be honest,

278
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,320
what exactly is your relationship

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,220
between you and Demon Queen?

280
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
What can I be related to her?

281
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,800
Then why do you

282
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,140
look exactly the same as her?

283
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,260
How did you know that?

284
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,220
Just now...

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,880
When I opened the lid on that stone beam,

286
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,820
you're the one lying inside.

287
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,900
Hu, don't you think this is ridiculous?

288
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,520
Hallucinations can be counted?

289
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,220
Your hallucination?

290
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,280
Why don't you ask yourself?

291
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,160
We are talking about you now.

292
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Don't change the subject.

293
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,380
Why do you always dream of ghost holes?

294
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,080
And you are an American.

295
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,480
Why... Why do you know

296
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,940
the jargon of Mojin Captain?

297
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,580
Who are you exactly?

298
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,180
And what do you do? Tell me.

299
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Go on.

300
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,500
Don't be so polite.

301
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,440
Hold on.

302
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,560
Hold on.

303
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,940
Don't move.

304
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,420
It's hard to get this shot.

305
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
Fatty.

306
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,580
It's real.

307
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,580
Golden Tooth is such a brat.

308
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,380
He lied to us with the fake one.

309
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,220
I was wondering why it never worked.

310
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
I don't know why.

311
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,820
I could dream of that ghost cave.

312
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,060
And know those jargon.

313
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,640
It's because my grandfather

314
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
was in this industry too.

315
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,260
I heard his words.

316
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,680
So your grandpa

317
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,500
he is also a Mojin captain

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
you are not good people.

319
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,740
- No one can run away.
- Fatty! - Fatso!

320
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,060
Put a damper on him. Knock him down.

321
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm the guardian angel of the Jinjie Nation!

322
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,540
This old man is completely crazy.

323
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,080
Have a bite

324
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,480
hu Bayi, give it back to me

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
now you believe it?

326
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,220
If it's a demon,

327
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,520
can you have the Mojin Talisman?

328
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Hu, come quickly.

329
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,320
I can't stuff it in.

330
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,340
Don't do anything stupid.

331
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't move.

332
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,280
The lives of four people are related.

333
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,840
I had no choice.

334
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,860
Hu, come quickly.

335
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Don't move.

336
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,820
Hu, don't just stand there.

337
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,740
Shoot!

338
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,620
Calm down.

339
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,020
Shoot!

340
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,420
Why are you hitting me?

341
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,280
Stop fighting.

342
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,440
Miss Yang.

343
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Please take care of Professor.

344
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,940
What happened?

345
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Fatty.

346
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,800
Please tell me.

347
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,560
Tell me what you see.

348
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,020
Why is nothing here?

349
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,460
That's the spirit.

350
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,440
I'm really scared now, Hu.

351
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Don't be afraid, Fatty. I got it.

352
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,940
Just now is just my imagination.

353
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,800
Shirley just shot

354
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,980
which woke me up.

355
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,240
Including on the beams,

356
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,060
and it was your gunshot

357
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,100
woke me up.

358
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
I was also in my hallucination.

359
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,300
That's right.

360
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,640
Are you trying to ease my mind?

361
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
Let me clear my head.

362
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,220
The control of the corpse fragrant taro

363
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,220
Is far beyond our imagination.

364
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,860
When it's open,

365
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,120
It's control has expanded.

366
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,420
That higanbana

367
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,640
I suspect that higanbana

368
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,140
higanbana is an illusion.

369
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,820
Squeezed into that crevice

370
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,980
In order to make us

371
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,540
and buried himself.

372
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,500
Then when we came here,

373
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
and we saw

374
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
this false prediction.

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,620
In order to make us kill each other.

376
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,380
In that case,

377
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,680
no one will be able to tell

378
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,680
the Queen's secrets.

379
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,620
How vicious.

380
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,760
I should have used explosives

381
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,040
to blow up that stone beam.

382
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,480
The owner of the notebook

383
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,860
he saw his teammates

384
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,700
killing each other.

385
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,580
He would be insane

386
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,580
just like Professor Chen

387
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,220
the students were all dead

388
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,460
miss Yang, I'm so sorry.

389
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,160
Just now we have

390
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,040
-Right. -Right.
-So foolish.

391
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,840
I won't bother with you now.

392
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,260
Let's talk outside.

393
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,540
Please be magnanimous.

394
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,820
Just now we

395
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,340
are bewitched.

396
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,320
Just forget about my mistake

397
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,680
please be lenient whenever you can.

398
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,440
Enough.

399
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,420
Let's find a way to get out of this first.

400
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,060
By the way, let's see what's inside

401
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,520
Inside that stone box.

402
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,460
Let's make a deal first.

403
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
No matter what you see,

404
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,280
or what happens again,

405
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,420
when you find something wrong with him,

406
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,580
when you see something wrong with them.

407
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,600
That's right.

408
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,080
You're the one to beat us.

409
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,160
Right.

410
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,820
Well

411
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,120
check it out.

412
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,360
The Prophet

413
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,020
does he point out

414
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,300
for us to survive?

415
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
The Late Saint drew this.

416
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,780
It's mainly about

417
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,080
the Ghost Cave Clan's secret.

418
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,320
There is a ghost cave

419
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,580
because there is a ghost cave,

420
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,080
It's called the Divine Mountain.

421
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,880
Everyone wants to know

422
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,180
what's inside the cave.

423
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,940
So they invited a High Priest

424
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,640
to make a jade eyeball

425
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,280
hoping to see the bottom

426
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,780
to see the bottomless pit.

427
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
In the end, we didn't use it

428
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,620
It attracted a lot of monsters

429
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,920
which caused the death of countless people.

430
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,620
It's got nothing to do.

431
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,520
Why must I look at it?

432
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,200
Hold on.

433
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,340
That jade eye I threw

434
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,660
made by them?

435
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,640
That's possible.

436
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,760
Go on.

437
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Finally,

438
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,160
the two saints blessed by the God

439
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,840
and warriors in the tribe

440
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,320
to wipe out the Snake Beasts.

441
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,700
From then on, the sages considered the cave

442
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,380
as the cave of misfortune.

443
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,480
But the Jade Eye has been opened.

444
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,580
The door to misfortune.

445
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,680
Miss Yang, are you going to

446
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,740
from the beginning?

447
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,460
I have to finish it even if I don't start from the beginning.

448
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,340
You can see the last.

449
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,740
Maybe it's undecipherable.

450
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,860
Fatty, mind your own business.

451
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,240
Go on.

452
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,660
After that,

453
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,380
the prophet was born in the tribe,

454
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,680
who was

455
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,260
with precognition.

456
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,380
It says that through the ritual,

457
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,060
he could predict

458
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,260
major events that will happen

459
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,160
happened thousands of years later.

460
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,740
However, its Fan State

461
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,540
Is confined to the vicinity of Mount Zagorama.

462
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,300
That's pretty fast.

463
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,940
That's prophetic.

464
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,000
Didn't he predict anything?

465
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,460
My heart is beating fast.

466
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,920
Don't read the second part.

467
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,260
Don't read it.

468
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,820
Professor. Professor. Quiet.

469
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't go out.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,660
Don't go out.

471
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,620
Fatty, stop him.

472
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,260
Professor.

473
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,220
Professor?

474
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,200
- Professor?
- Professor.

475
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
-Don't waste his time.
-The professor.

476
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,740
I won't be polite to you.

477
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,700
Fatty.

478
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,080
Here. Hurry up.

479
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
Finished.

480
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,420
Professor licked the last page.

481
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,060
It's your fault.

482
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,360
It's OK.

483
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,860
The last page had no content.

484
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,920
Will that be

485
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,760
the last page

486
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
the last page of the lecture.

487
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,500
It might be.

488
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,300
Hurry up!

489
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,560
Look quickly!

490
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,440
The prophet predicted that

491
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,000
800 years after his death,

492
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,320
a new tribe was born

493
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,020
has welcomed a new tribe.

494
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,720
The tribe

495
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,080
was the predecessor of Jingjie State.

496
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,540
Who later became Queen Jingjie.

497
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,400
Her eyes

498
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,840
with eyes that can see through ghosts.

499
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,780
She mastered the ritual of summoning the Black Snake Spirit

500
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,400
the ritual of summoning the Black Snake Evil Spirit.

501
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,940
With this, we conquered

502
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,920
around it.

503
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,040
And the infidels' atrocities

504
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,140
which infuriated the True God.

505
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
So the True God

506
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
the mountain and the surrounding area

507
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,240
has been handed over to the devil.

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
The desert has engulfed all the cities.

509
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,600
And the people and animals in this country

510
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,440
as well as the black snakes and evil spirits in the ghost cave

511
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,500
will be deeply buried underground

512
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,120
this is completely different

513
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,860
the legends about

514
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,580
agree with me.

515
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,940
That's right.

516
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,100
This is our final revelation.

517
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,840
In the prophecy of Revelation,

518
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
four survivors will be found.

519
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,600
Who came here because the mountain collapsed.

520
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,340
One of them

521
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,880
he's a descendant of the Prophet Tribe.

522
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,400
Then one of the four of us

523
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,920
you are the most likely candidate.

524
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,740
That's right.

525
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,220
It's definitely Miss Yang.

526
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,860
She can sense places she's never been.

527
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,240
It means a prophet.

528
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,720
Could your ancestors

529
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,620
used to live here?

530
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,640
No matter who it is,

531
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,380
one of us

532
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,280
one of us.

533
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,680
The priority now is to leave this place first.

534
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,080
The prophet would point out a way

535
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,700
for the descendants to escape.

536
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't drop the sheepskin booklet

537
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,380
to the ground.

538
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
It fell to the ground,

539
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,560
Is when the sandstorm starts,

540
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,040
the yellow sand

541
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,380
jingjie Ancient City will be flooded again

542
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,960
and Zagorama next time.

543
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,020
The sacred mountain is again submerged.

544
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,880
Till the end of time.

545
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,180
This sheepskin booklet is a time bomb.

546
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
There's no other content.

547
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
Nothing.

548
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,260
This is the Prophet

549
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,640
the last revelation to us.

550
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,140
He said that it would show a path

551
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,260
for future generations.

552
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,200
Check the remains

553
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,720
on the remains.

554
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,220
How is Hu?

555
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,080
Nothing special.

556
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,160
There's no clue.

557
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,020
Miss Yang,

558
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,340
stop reading it.

559
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,660
Put your books away.

560
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,260
We can't drop it.

561
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,540
Never leave.

562
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,540
Professor.

563
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,560
- Don't...
- Don't!

564
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,840
That's enough.

565
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,880
What's going on?

566
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,320
Will it collapse again?

567
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,280
That's fun.

568
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,580
Fun, fun.

569
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,520
Hu, we're really screwed this time.

570
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,220
And the parchment came true!

571
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,140
Does Prophet play with us three?

572
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,220
It's one out of three.

573
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,080
There should only be one right decision.

574
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,120
We only have one chance.

575
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,620
If we make the wrong choice this time,

576
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,720
we will be dead for real.

577
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,180
Just take a route.

578
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,880
To stay alive.

579
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,100
Than being buried here.

580
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,000
You shut up.

581
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,060
We came in together.

582
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,180
We have to go out together.

583
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Miss Yang, pick one.

584
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,680
Don't look at her.

585
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Do you expect her to guide you the way?

586
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,060
That one?

587
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,460
Wait, is this reliable?

588
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,060
We have no time. Hurry up.

589
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Professor.

590
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,300
Professor.

591
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,660
I belong here.

592
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,700
I belong here.

593
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,760
Hurry up!

594
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,780
Hurry up!

595
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,000
This way!

596
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,820
Move along.

597
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,040
Walk forward.

598
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,420
Peering through a gap,

599
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,710
to see more clearly.

600
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,750
My bravery

601
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,550
with my courage

602
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:24,550
be together.

603
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:32,580
In my heart,

604
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,500
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

605
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,340
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

606
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,690
Fate only beckons.

607
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,340
But doesn't care

608
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,230
the result.

609
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,340
Trapped in the present

610
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,830
stuck in the present

611
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,190
down the unknown river

612
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,810
down the river,

613
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,270
the greater the desire,

614
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,780
the more you demand.

615
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,370
With full stomach,

616
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,370
they kept their mouths shut.

617
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,180
♪ Fate promised ♪

618
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,760
You'll change your mind.

619
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,210
Giving me sweet words

620
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,790
but lying to me.

621
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,290
You'd climb to Heaven...

622
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,840
And hides again.

623
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,180
Looking young.

624
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,140
And grey overnight.

625
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,030
Down the river

626
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,770
overnight, my hair turns grey.
