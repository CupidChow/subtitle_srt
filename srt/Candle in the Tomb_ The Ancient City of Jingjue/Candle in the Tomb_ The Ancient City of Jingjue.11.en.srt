4
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,990
Such a big ant.

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
How warm they are!

6
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,550
Haven't you slept?

7
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,300
Good boy.

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,380
And eavesdrop on our chat, right?

9
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,630
I'm afraid you will be tricked by a honey-trap.

10
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,710
Go to hell.

11
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,030
I haven't slept.

12
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,480
Go replace Shirley Yang.

13
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,560
Hurry up!

14
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,220
Go home.

15
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,220
What are they doing?

16
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,480
If you do this,

17
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,240
that God will punish you.

18
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
I'll disturb the gods by doing so.

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
God is finally merciful

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,880
gave us a chance to live.

21
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,810
And you returned kindness with ingratitude.

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,460
You will pay for what you did.

23
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,570
Old Brother, calm down.

24
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,560
God blessed us.

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,520
Don't be anxious.

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,100
God blessed us.

27
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,840
Old Brother.

28
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,720
God bless us.

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,890
Old Brother, don't worry.

30
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,490
God blessed us.

31
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,330
Honey.

32
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,100
Nothing.

33
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,980
Is that how you treat spirits?

34
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,870
What happened?

35
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,960
God will really blame it on us,

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,850
they dug the stone when Anli Man went out to see camels

37
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,310
they dug up the stone.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,110
The old man was anxious when he returned.

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,010
And scientific archaeological research.

40
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,910
And won't offend the gods.

41
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,190
I don't know your scientific research.

42
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,960
It's just been a long time,

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,590
you already dug this deep?

44
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,560
If I had stayed

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,380
for a little longer,

46
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,060
aren't you going to

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,330
this place?

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,950
They've already dug them.

49
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,520
Will you shut up?

50
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,010
Can I be quiet?

51
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,540
Old Man.

52
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,640
To stop you from digging it.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,440
Mr. An,

54
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,970
this sandstorm is over,

55
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,320
I heard the wind is getting quieter now.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,390
Hu, hold your tongue.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,330
I'm talking about

58
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,030
something very, very big.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
Mr. An, please listen to me.

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,470
Listen to me!

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,440
What I mean is

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,100
look at this stone statue.

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,580
This stone statue is the guardian of the gods.

64
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,690
It's working hard here,

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,860
professor Chen and his team

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,730
and ability

67
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,610
to clean it up.

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,100
So that it can

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,730
to better protect the gods?

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,010
What do you think?

71
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,470
That's right.

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,790
Uncle An Liman

73
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,360
professor Chen did it his way

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,680
thank you, God

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,060
for giving us a shelter.

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,140
Good point.

77
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,920
Professor Hao,

78
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,000
please inform your father

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
In advance.

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,670
An act of kindness.

81
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,760
What can't be said about it?

82
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,370
That's right.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,590
Hu is right.

84
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,010
That's right!

85
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,590
You two...

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,250
Say whatever you want.

87
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,270
Say what you want.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,690
I warn you that

89
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,440
It will clear up soon.

90
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,250
If you still stay here,

91
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,270
wolves and leopards stopped me here,

92
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,950
I don't want to warn you.

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,580
Don't worry.

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,840
We will pack up and leave now

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
professor Chen

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
have you found anything?

97
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,990
Yes, there is.

98
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,320
Look.

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,290
Many words are engraved on it.

100
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,090
It should be some kind of secret scripture.

101
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,130
Let's write down the book first

102
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,760
we'll study it carefully when we're back.

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,010
Professor.

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,210
Could this statue

105
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,940
related to the worship of aliens

106
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,610
the worship of aliens in ancient Western Regions?

107
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,660
They had seen one before then.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,650
But the science level was so low back then.

109
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,020
They mistook the aliens

110
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,310
as a kind of God

111
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
he made the stone statues

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
to worship them,

113
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,050
professor, please look at these scriptures.

114
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,680
Perhaps this

115
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,660
an alien language.

116
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,560
Sam.

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,050
Why are we talking about aliens again?

118
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,750
Professor.

119
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,480
I need to unpack.

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,480
You should

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
pack your things.

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,070
Alright.

123
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,510
That you are serious

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,290
archaeology is a serious matter.

125
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,260
Young people are active.

126
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,600
To be active.

127
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,010
United, tense, serious and lively.

128
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,270
There are no contradictions at all.

129
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,480
The first principle

130
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,990
the first principle

131
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,710
Is to make bold assumptions.

132
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,960
Then confirm it cautiously.

133
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,670
Take the stone statue with huge pupils.

134
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,480
Ancient people used to use astronomical phenomena

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,560
to judge their fate.

136
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,320
Would they

137
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,010
to look beyond

138
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,760
to see further.

139
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,270
When they're constructing the statue,

140
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,260
will they

141
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,400
put that wish into it?

142
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,240
That's a very likely possibility.

143
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,280
Some statues were unearthed

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,400
from Sanxingdui in Sichuan.

145
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,720
Their eyes

146
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,360
extend as long as they can,

147
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,530
this is probably because

148
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,320
an expression of the ancient people

149
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,580
to explore.

150
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,190
OK. Let's hurry after the class.

151
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,240
Old Hu,

152
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,320
last night

153
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,330
did you sleep for a while?

154
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,560
Well

155
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,770
wang Kaixuan came with me to change the shift yesterday.

156
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,080
I slept well. No problem.

157
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,010
That's good.

158
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,130
Old Hu,

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,160
come here.

160
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,860
What are you doing?

161
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,490
Did you fall for an American girl?

162
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,680
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,130
You know what?

164
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,150
Even if he chatted with you

165
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,380
to relax

166
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,960
to let your guard down?

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,750
I know.

168
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,540
And you.

169
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,510
Can't you stop?

170
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,590
Pack my things.

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,030
It's sunny outside.

172
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,780
This is really a blessing from God.

173
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,760
The sand outside

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,840
you could barely reach the wall.

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,040
If we have another two hours,

176
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,930
we would've...

177
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,420
Are buried here.

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
That's good news.

179
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,180
Let's pack up and leave as soon as possible.

180
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,190
Alright.

181
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,000
Why are there so many ants?

182
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,030
So large!

183
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,460
Professor, I have some here and there.

184
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,660
Here and there.

185
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,970
There are also so many.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,690
How can there be so many?

187
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
That's too many.

188
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,640
Are desert army ants.

189
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,130
And can gnaw people into bones.

190
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,700
Is it that powerful?

191
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't scare us.

192
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,980
I told you not to dig it.

193
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,520
I told you not to dig it.

194
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,430
This is too many.

195
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,090
Let's go now! Go!

196
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,040
Come on, let's go!

197
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Get the map!

198
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,390
Take your things and leave

199
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,830
professor Chen, hurry up

200
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,680
fatty is strong now

201
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,990
he's running away!

202
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,520
Get the old fox back! Hurry!

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,240
Alright.

204
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
-The professor.
-Hurry. Go!

205
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,890
Solid fuel!

206
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,580
Come on.

207
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,640
- Let's go. - Go.

208
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,570
Give me the solid fuel!

209
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,880
Ye Ye, come on.

210
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, here you are.

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,130
Mr. Hu, Miss Yang, come on.

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,650
Come on.

213
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,070
Hurry.

214
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,320
- Be careful. - Come on.

215
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,030
That way.

216
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,100
Come.

217
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,160
Old man, stop!

218
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,010
-Stop right there! -Stop running!

219
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,510
Stop!

220
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Or I'll shoot.

221
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,650
Don't shoot or hurt others.

222
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,490
I was dying

223
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,870
mind your own business.

224
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,990
Stop!

225
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,740
Stop!

226
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,720
Don't shoot.

227
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,490
Stop! Don't run!

228
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,840
Stop.

229
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll kill you if you run again.

230
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,490
Don't shoot.

231
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't shoot.

232
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,950
No, it's real

233
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,760
look at them!

234
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,060
They are all eaten up!

235
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,870
Over here. Hurry up.

236
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,850
Old Hu,

237
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,540
don't mind me. Go.

238
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,500
Run!

239
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,710
Don't mind me. Run!

240
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,710
You really don't want to leave me.

241
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,790
Hurry.

242
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,280
- Come on, Professor. Get on the camel!
-The professor.

243
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,370
-Hurry. Let the camel lie down. Hurry!
- Professor.

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
Old Hu.

245
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,580
Come on! Hurry!

246
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,180
Send Professor on the camel.

247
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,840
Professor, be careful. Hold it well.

248
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,710
Be careful

249
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,790
where is Hu?

250
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm asking you where is Hu?

251
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,890
You abandoned him?

252
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,610
Where is Hu?

253
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,590
He's trapped.

254
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm going back to save him now.

255
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,700
-You must run now or you'll die!
-Come back! -Come here!

256
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,110
I should go if I want to.

257
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,310
Stay with Anliman.

258
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,440
We would all die without him.

259
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,230
Stop! I'll come with you!

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Go ahead and find a safe place.

261
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,520
Wait for us.

262
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,630
Don't run, old man.

263
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,980
And have some wolf and mutton.

264
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,910
He has a crush on me.

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,590
What's with that?

266
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,730
Stop showing up!

267
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,210
Wait for me.

268
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,630
Against me separately.

269
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,110
I'm going to kill you today.

270
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,870
Scram!

271
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,280
Piss off!

272
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
What's this?

273
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,200
Fatty, I'm here!

274
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,510
Fatty isn't here! It's me!

275
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,250
Why are you here?

276
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,800
Stop talking. Cover your nose. Follow me.

277
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,120
Look at this.

278
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,830
Why is it so smoky over there?

279
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,970
Will the city collapse?

280
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,270
Shut your smelly mouth.

281
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,140
Comrade Wang.

282
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,600
We'd better keep a distance.

283
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,340
I don't think

284
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,520
Is still not safe enough.

285
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,630
God bless them.

286
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,850
Come back safely.

287
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,800
Otherwise,

288
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,360
I can't get the money back.

289
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,260
Old man, if you can't speak,

290
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,240
shut your mouth!

291
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,240
Look at this!
- Right?

292
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,960
- Brother Hu...
-It's them.

293
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,410
Yes, yes, they!

294
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,470
Take good care of the old man.

295
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,140
And don't let him run away.

296
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,910
Alright.

297
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,960
Old Hu,

298
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,630
old Hu, are you all right?

299
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,020
What happened?

300
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,960
It's been a while since you saw me.

301
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,790
I almost cried when I missed me.

302
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,010
He was scared to cry.

303
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,020
What nonsense! He was scared of crying!

304
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,500
You know what, Fatty?

305
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,530
She threw

306
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,560
throw something like that?

307
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,930
Don't talk about me.

308
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,900
The ants are like this.

309
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,360
Miss Yang,

310
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,400
you are welcome.

311
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,910
Did I say thank you?

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,010
They are using the means

313
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,020
the American imperialists' means

314
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,430
against the people.

315
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,190
Tear gas is not righteous.

316
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,990
Brother Hu.

317
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,220
Professor, slow down.

318
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,990
What happened to Hu?

319
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,750
Miss Yang.

320
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
- Brother Hu.
-What's the matter, Hu?

321
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,900
-Are you all right, Hu?
-Brother Hu, what happened to your eyes?

322
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,660
Nothing.

323
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,980
You were smoked by tear gas.

324
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,180
-Come, be careful. Sit down.
-What just happened?

325
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,750
It's nothing.

326
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,270
Be careful.

327
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,200
Here, Mr. Hu.

328
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,610
Rinse it with clear water.

329
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,560
It's okay, it's not serious.

330
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,150
- It won't be a big problem.
-Do it! Do it!

331
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,210
It's so uncomfortable.

332
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,820
I haven't seen the sky for a long time.

333
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,440
Great.

334
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,090
Great.

335
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,650
Let's hurry

336
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,910
quickly.

337
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,190
- Hurry up. Go.
- Come on.

338
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,950
- Come on.
- Come on.

339
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,430
Miss Mo.

340
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,040
Did you do that on purpose?

341
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,680
Father.

342
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,300
We've walked for such a long time.

343
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,730
Let's stop to have a rest.

344
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,630
Alright.

345
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,490
Professor.

346
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,020
What's the matter, Hu?

347
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,770
See how much water is left.

348
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,460
Here you are.

349
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,570
Come on, Sam. Have some water.

350
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,450
Thanks.

351
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,150
This is the only water we have.

352
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,550
It dropped a lot when we ran out.

353
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,570
So much water was dropped.

354
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,480
Right.

355
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,190
Hu, we are out of water.

356
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,420
Yes

357
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,900
dropped too much when we ran away.

358
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,930
You should drink too.

359
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,000
- I don't want any.
- Just drink a little.

360
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Later, I will have everyone

361
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
check the supplies again.

362
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,760
Why do you look at him?

363
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,770
Go and have a look.

364
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,730
I gave him the reason

365
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,430
on his own.

366
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,500
Give it to me.

367
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,430
You are not right, old man.

368
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,290
How could I...

369
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,460
How was I not right?

370
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,630
You are not righteous.

371
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,430
I... I want to...

372
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,420
I want to...

373
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,120
I want to stay away from the ant.

374
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,170
Or the ant

375
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,050
has eaten all my camels,

376
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,960
no one can run away.

377
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,830
You are afraid that your camels will be eaten?

378
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,140
Old Hu,

379
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,030
we are not as good as your camels.

380
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,450
Do you want us

381
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,360
to be eaten away?

382
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,330
You can leave now.

383
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,140
You're no different from a bandit

384
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,120
between you and a bandit.

385
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,050
What are you doing?

386
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,230
What do you want?

387
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,120
You old man,

388
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,560
you have a very bad conscience.

389
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,560
I don't understand what you're saying.

390
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't put labels on me.

391
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,230
I won't do that.

392
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,430
Listen to me.

393
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,270
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,950
I didn't shoot just now.

395
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,920
You wouldn't be here now.

396
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,150
You should've run away.

397
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,400
If you run away again,

398
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,620
I'll break down all your camels

399
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,400
all your camels!

400
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,120
You know what?

401
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,490
Nothing is more important

402
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,010
more important than my camel.

403
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,210
- You're so excited. - What?
-My camel is important.

404
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,910
You're on to something?

405
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,780
Fatty!

406
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,320
-Let go of me.
-Don't touch me!

407
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,800
I've been tolerating him for a long time.

408
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,700
- Fatty. - Fatso.
- Just now, we...

409
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,250
-We almost died in his hands.
-Let go of it.

410
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,800
Let go of me!

411
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,460
Fatty.

412
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,360
What are you doing, Hu?

413
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,160
I'm over 60 years old.

414
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,890
What are you doing?

415
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,020
He's over 60 years old.

416
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,580
We almost died just now

417
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,710
because of him.

418
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,830
Respecting the old and caring for the young

419
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,450
Is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation.

420
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,270
Stay out of it.

421
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,360
Are you from the Chinese?

422
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,380
Can you stop it?

423
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,060
Come on, Brother Wang.

424
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,080
Finished?

425
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,910
Honey,

426
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,670
we have a real problem.

427
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,190
The water supply is going to run out.

428
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
We need to find a source of water.

429
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,420
And replenish water.

430
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,480
I think... We went in the opposite direction

431
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,810
we are going in the opposite direction.

432
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,420
This old man...

433
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,590
-Brother Wang, Brother Wang!
-What? You went the wrong way?

434
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,530
We were in the wrong direction

435
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,400
we're already off track.

436
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,760
Today, you ran around again.

437
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,960
I think we've turned the other way.

438
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,780
And the opposite direction.

439
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,970
Do you have the map?

440
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,080
The map.

441
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,930
Yes, here.

442
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,470
Honey,

443
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,120
what kind of

444
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,550
position now?

445
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,860
The black sand storm

446
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,330
It was drifting from the northwest.

447
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,450
We've been around all day.

448
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
At night, we should be

449
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,310
hiding in this place

450
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,910
It should be in this area.

451
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,310
It's here.

452
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,590
That many places.

453
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,400
Can't you be more specific?

454
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,760
You ran away so suddenly this morning.

455
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,960
Who can remember if I lost my direction?

456
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,490
Can anyone remember

457
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,150
Is this one going east or west?

458
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,990
Who knows?

459
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,270
I seem to remember that

460
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,040
the moment we ran

461
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,190
from the inside

462
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,490
we were walking to the left side

463
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,530
when we got down the slope,

464
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,400
It seems to be going east again.

465
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
That's not right.

466
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,720
I remember that

467
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160
we turned south

468
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,830
after the descent

469
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,130
no, I can't distinguish

470
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,490
tell the difference between East and West.

471
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,730
Let's not talk about it.

472
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,100
We don't care about her.

473
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,400
Now it is certain that

474
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,960
we are in this area.

475
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,900
Uncle An Liman,

476
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,520
do you have a way to take us back

477
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,120
where we escaped the black storm yesterday?

478
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,320
We head northwest

479
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,880
go straight on,

480
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,550
we'll return to our original route.

481
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,740
If one is lucky,

482
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,500
even we need a day to find it.

483
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,630
What if it's not lucky?

484
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,540
It's hard to tell.

485
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,560
Fatty, mind your own business.

486
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,110
Look here, everyone.

487
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,830
If we are here

488
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,730
If we're here,

489
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,100
It'll take a day to return.

490
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,810
If it's here, it can be even farther.

491
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,440
It might take two days.

492
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,340
Plus we'll go from the original route

493
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,150
to the original place,

494
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,980
It'll take another day.

495
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,870
In other words,

496
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,060
It might take three days

497
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,480
to fill it with water.

498
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,050
The water we have right now

499
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,540
won't hold for a day.

500
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
Uncle An Liman.

501
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,090
Don't scare us.

502
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,080
You can't joke about such things.

503
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,800
Uncle An Liman,

504
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,900
you're the most experienced among them.

505
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,160
Do you know where to find water?

506
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,150
Well, there is a lot of water in the desert.

507
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,000
But I'm not very confident

508
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
to find it.

509
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,450
Depends on luck.

510
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,220
Hubby.

511
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,850
Come here.

512
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,550
Look at this.

513
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,320
It's marked on the map

514
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
on the map.

515
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,560
And it's not too far

516
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,140
to our area.

517
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,710
Are you sure there's water here?

518
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,400
I can't be sure.

519
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,720
You can only know if you go and have a look.

520
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,870
It's the windy season.

521
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,000
The sandstorm in the desert

522
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,230
the sand dune moves fast.

523
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,530
Unless it's a perennial and stable water source,

524
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,930
or last year there was one.

525
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,800
But this year...

526
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,020
Was buried by sand.

527
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,180
Which means it was possible that

528
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,500
we walked for a whole day

529
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,040
but we still can't find water.

530
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,310
That's right.

531
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,610
Due to water scarcity,

532
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,210
to find

533
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,730
an uncertain source of water.

534
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,740
It's too risky.

535
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,590
We can return by the way we came.

536
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Please Save Water

537
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,650
to last for three days.

538
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,480
That's right. It's hard,

539
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,420
but we'll make it through.

540
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,810
The youngsters can

541
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,360
but Professor Chen's health

542
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,600
won't hold on

543
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,860
don't worry about me.

544
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,880
I haven't been without water for three days.

545
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
-Of water for 3 days?
-The professor Chen

546
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,600
you may not know

547
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
to be in the desert without drinking water for a day

548
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,660
for one day without water.

549
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,160
Brother Hu,

550
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,400
why don't we just

551
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,490
go back?

552
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,700
If Professor Chen and the other ladies

553
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,740
can't hold on,

554
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,700
but we still have camels.

555
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,170
We can kill camels.

556
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,010
This...

557
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,190
Kill the camel,

558
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,650
we'll have to walk.

559
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,910
Without means of transport,

560
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,280
then neither of us can get out.

561
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,900
Ye Ye,

562
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,170
only kill one of them, but not the others.

563
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,140
That's enough.

564
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,710
Let's be optimistic.

565
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,120
Maybe we'll find another water source

566
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,140
on our way back.

567
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,870
Right.

568
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,280
I think

569
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,540
don't panic yet.

570
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,920
Killing camels?

571
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,490
Is under an extreme situation.

572
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,340
An extreme choice.

573
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,540
Unless it is between human life

574
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,890
or a camel.

575
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,690
To make a choice.

576
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,370
I know about

577
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,430
I know.

578
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,210
She consumes less energy

579
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,200
they consume less energy.

580
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,740
Objectively speaking,

581
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,940
It's safer to return

582
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,960
that's safer.

583
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,450
It might be hard to get enough water.

584
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,760
But it might not be that

585
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,420
enough to kill the camel.

586
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,750
Let's all have a hard time.

587
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,780
Please bear with it.

588
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,140
Victory is the persevering.

589
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,330
Well, in that case,

590
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,720
let's hurry to hit the road.

591
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:48,990
Alright.

592
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,990
Save water.

593
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,880
Old Man.

594
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,270
Don't worry, we won't kill camels.

595
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,400
Let's go back now.

596
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,490
And return to our original route.

597
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,230
Lead the way.

598
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,120
Little Red.

599
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
Do you remember this place?

600
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,400
Old man.

601
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,940
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

602
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,160
I think this place looks familiar.

603
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,890
I remember that

604
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,400
where the white camel saved my life.

605
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,720
There should be a water source nearby.

606
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,640
There is

607
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,000
how far is it?

608
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,850
Come here.

609
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,430
See it?

610
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,310
Go straight along this direction

611
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,260
we passed the dune ahead.

612
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,830
There is the ruins of a city there.

613
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,390
There is a well.

614
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,160
Then...

615
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
Why didn't you tell me that?

616
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,320
I only remembered about you

617
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
the things around me.

618
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,980
How far must we go?

619
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,720
We can get there before dark, right?

620
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,590
Are you sure about that?

621
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,250
I am sure about this.

622
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,880
Just now, my Xiao Hong

623
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,550
also told me

624
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,640
It knew this place.

625
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,870
Why am I so insincere?

626
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,930
Old man, let me tell you something.

627
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,100
If you can't find water on the journey,

628
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,030
I will slaughter a camel.

629
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,660
Enough. Why kill me?

630
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,910
I'll kill you too.

631
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,690
Killing me won't quench your thirst.

632
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,530
Enough.

633
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,790
Brother An Liman,

634
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,940
you can recall water source, which is a good thing.

635
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,390
Let's talk about the problem.

636
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,850
To use civilized words.

637
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,010
Mr. Hu, please continue.

638
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,670
That was many years ago.

639
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,670
My brothers and I

640
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,260
also encountered a black sand storm.

641
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
We got scattered.

642
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,470
My camel and I

643
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,360
we wandered in the desert for several days.

644
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,300
I am thirsty, hungry and tired.

645
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,310
He thought... He was doomed.

646
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,400
But when I was in a trance,

647
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,890
I suddenly saw

648
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,170
a white camel

649
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,590
was on the dune in front of us,

650
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,210
that's really a blessing of the gods.

651
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,170
The God is here.

652
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,880
Here he comes again.

653
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,640
That white camel

654
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,460
It's much bigger than ordinary camels.

655
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,640
All white with light.

656
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,160
I will go with

657
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,980
with that white camel.

658
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,740
Let's go. There we go.

659
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,780
I found water.

660
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,950
I came back to life.

661
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,250
I came back to life!

662
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,410
Later, my Xiao Hong

663
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,930
who carried me out of the desert

664
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,840
at that time, it was only five years old.

665
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,720
So to me,

666
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,720
camels are my brothers.

667
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,670
They are my guardians.

668
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,160
Nothing is more important

669
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,510
more important than camels?

670
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,390
That's right. This is the place.

671
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,960
Then... Now

672
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,100
we'll change our route again.

673
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,530
Alright.

674
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,960
We'll set out right away.

675
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,860
Alright.

676
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,600
Now that we can avoid it,

677
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,530
this black sand storm

678
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,050
that means

679
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,660
Is very kind to us.

680
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,030
I believe we'll find it too.

681
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,150
Let's go then, Pops.

682
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,110
We'll leave right away.

683
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,000
Fatty had the gun.

684
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,520
Or you break the back?

685
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,960
And went forward,

686
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,960
peering through a gap,

687
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,620
to see more clearly.

688
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,530
My bravery

689
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,790
with my courage

690
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:26,760
be together.

691
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,610
In my heart,

692
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,820
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

693
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,770
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

694
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,890
Fate only beckons.

695
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,830
But doesn't care

696
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,190
the result.

697
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,390
Trapped in the present

698
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,920
stuck in the present

699
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,510
down the unknown river

700
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,550
down the river,

701
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,370
the greater the desire,

702
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,590
the more you demand.

703
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,180
With full stomach,

704
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,650
they kept their mouths shut.

705
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
♪ Fate has promised ♪

706
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,910
Will change.

707
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,360
She poured out her love words

708
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,920
but lying to me.

709
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,700
You'd climb to Heaven...

710
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,750
And hides again.

711
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,290
Looking young.

712
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,900
And grey overnight.

713
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:33,400
Down the river

714
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,290
overnight, my hair turns grey.
