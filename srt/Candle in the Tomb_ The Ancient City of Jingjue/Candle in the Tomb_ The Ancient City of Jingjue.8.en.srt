Give me the bag.

6
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,890
Why should I?

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,910
Stop!

8
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,020
Give me the bag.

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,690
Why should I give you the purse?

10
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,060
Yes. The handbag will be your dad's?

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,400
Give me the handbag.

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,660
Fatty.

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,110
Put the gun down too.

16

Right?

17

Yes

yes

19
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,340
I turned off the flash.

20
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,030
Leave now!

21
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,160
Don't shoot.

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,500
Go! Hurry!

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,810
Retreat!

24
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,840
Run! Forget about the things! Go!

Come on.

28
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,450
Do you hear me?

29
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,320
Evacuate right away!

30
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,530
Roger, Inspection Team.

31
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,100
Ye Ye, what are you doing?

32
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,200
I will go find them.

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Calm down!

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,460
Let go of me!

35
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,500
The second leaf.

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,880
The Little Leaf.

37
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,870
You can't go there.

38
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,500
Ye Ye, the youngest,

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,060

Hurry up, Professor.

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,490
Come on. Hurry up.

42
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,330
Don't get out if you go into the underground river.

43
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,990
The underground river.

44
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,380
My notebook can't get wet.

45
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,040
Give it to me.

46
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,710
Leave now!

47
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,570
Get ashore now!

48
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,910
Are you all right?

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,110
Is everyone alright?

50
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,240
-It's fine.
-It's alright.

51
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,350
Big old is hurt.

52
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,080
Big man?

53
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,320
I can't pull him.

54
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,160
Hurry up!

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,930
Hurry up!

56
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,840
What happened?

57
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,640
In order to save me,

58
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
he was hit by a fireball.

59
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
Big fellow, how are you?

60
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm fine. I can make it.

61
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,660
Let me take a look at your wound.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,630
Where do I hurt?

63
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,520
Let me have a look.

64
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,850
On your back?

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,800
With my back!

66
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,200
-Can you hold on?
-Oh, no, I'm fine.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,270
Where is the wind?

68
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,660
This is too big.

69
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
This is the prehistoric King Newt.

70
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,770
This kind of creature

71
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,130
should be extinct long ago.

72
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,450
Run! Hurry!

73
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,460
Get out of the way!

74
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,180
Run.

75
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,670
Come on, run!

76
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,910
Brother Hu,

77
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,600
little Hu.

78
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,650
Come on!

79
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,700
-Hurry up. Fatty, take them away.
-Hurry up!

80
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,400
They're coming.

81
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,080
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Hurry up!

82
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,120
Come on! Go!

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
-Hurry up!
-Brother! Get up!

84
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,860
Ga'wa, fire!

85
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,320
Alright. Ga'wa, withdraw now!

86
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,480
Ga Wa!

87
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,140
Company commander, save me!

88
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,760
Ga Wa!

89
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,740
Hurry up!

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,930
This is bad.

91
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,760
Which woke them up.

92
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,890
What to do, Hu?

93
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,640
Ga Wa,

94
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,460
leave all your ammunition behind.

95
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,640
You take care of the big man.

96
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,940
Company commander, I'm not leaving!

97
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,850
Lower your voice.

98
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,880
The big fellow is hurt. Help him off.

99
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,740
This is an order

100
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,840
yes

101
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,080
give it to me.

102
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,400
Go! Go now!

103
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,700
Hu, can we do it?

104
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,680
Whatever will come will come.

105
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
What will happen will come your way.

106
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,290
Beat him.

107
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,630
Hurry.

108
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,240
Come on.

109
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,120
Stand up.

110
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,970
The tent! Hurry!

111
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,390
The ropes moved.

112
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,640
They're Alive

113
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,140
they're Alive

114
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,700
right.

115
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,600
- Hey.
-Hello.

116
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,510
Professor.

117
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,920
Who goes first?

118
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Professor Chen

119
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,390
the big guy?

120
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,240
- Go first.
-You go first.

121
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,430
-Let's go first!
-No, Mr. Chen and you go first

122
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,680
don't be humble, you're still young

123
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,200
hurry up. We have no time.

124
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
No, professor. You go first.

125
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
Hurry up.

126
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,120
-You can even help us.
That's right.

127
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,810
Come on! Hurry up!

128
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,850
Get up there!

129
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,070
Sa, get up there too!

130
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,740
Coach, let's go!

131
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,120
Come on.

132
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,960
Hold on!

133
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,480
Come on, do it harder.

134
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,720
It's impossible.

135
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,460
I've run out of bullets.

136
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,400
Me too.

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,380
Run!

138
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,930
Catch it!

139
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,940
I thought you wouldn't come back.

140
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,570
I'm fine.

141
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,030
Chu Jian and the big guy got hurt.

142
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,800
Go and check on the tall guy.

143
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,480
Come on, give me your hand.

144
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,780
Professor.

145
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,650
So tall.

146
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,010
Little Liu.

147
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,530
-The big guy
prof. Chen is still down there

148
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,550
our task has not been completed yet

149
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,660
professor. Hurry.

150
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
Where are they?

151
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,500
They're up.

152
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,250
At this rate,

153
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,140
we'll probably be burnt to death if we crawl halfway.

154
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,870
Cut the crap. Put it on.

155
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,360
Hu is here.

156
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,590
He's going all out.

157
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,180
Throw it now!

158
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,880
It needs to explode in the air!

159
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,960
Go on.

160
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,160
Run.

161
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,130
Push harder!

162
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,480
Come on.

163
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,400
Push harder!

164
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,380
Watch out!

165
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,020
Professor.

166
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,160
Professor! Hang in there!

167
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,820
What happened to Ga Wa?

168
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,640
Catch it!

169
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,530
Professor, hold on.

170
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:02,940
Come on.

171
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,500
Pull!

172
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,390
Pull it!

173
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,110
Pull it!

174
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,930
Hang in there!

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,940
Ga Wa! This is impossible!

176
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,240
Because of this!

177
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,440
-No, Ga Wa!
- Pull!

178
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
Come on!

179
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,480
Gap!

180
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,200
Ga Wa!

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,440
Hurry up!

182
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,980
Old Hu,

183
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,430
garwa!

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,990
How are you?

185
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm fine. Go now.

186
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,740
Fatty, get up there now!

187
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,130
Hurry up!

188
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
Ga Wa, hurry up!

189
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,150
It's OK. Leave now.

190
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,260
Ga wa!

191
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,990
The commander must take them out!

192
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,220
Ga'wa, don't do anything stupid!

193
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,940
Ga wa!

194
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,160
Sunshine!

195
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,530
Garwa!

196
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,590
Don't!

197
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,760
Professor, give me your hand.

198
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,500
Professor.

199
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,860
Professor. Professor.

200
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,280
- Pull me. - Come on.
- Brother Wang!

201
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,800
Brother Wang!

202
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,880
Old Hu,

203
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,390
old Hu, how are you?

204
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,540
My bag! It's my bag.

205
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,940
Where are you going?

206
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,460
My bag is gone.

207
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,870
I need to find my bag.

208
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,620
Hurry up!

209
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,370
Come on!

210
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,090
Hu, are you alright?

211
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,550
I'm fine.

212
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,660
It's going to collapse.

213
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,120
Help me pull the rope!

214
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,120
Push harder!

215
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,120
Old Hu, hand!

216
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,040
What happened

217
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,990
ga Wa sacrificed!

218
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,990
Get out of here!

219
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,350
Hurry.

220
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,100
Run!

221
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,720
Run, run!

222
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,980
Come on, let's go!

223
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,890
Tall.

224
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,040
Stop taking things, run!

225
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,960
Hurry up!

226
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,910
Come on.

227
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,300
Run!

228
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,480
Ga wa!

229
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,340
Mr. Hu,

230
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,200
according to Professor Chen and I

231
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,390
of Professor Chen and I

232
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,330
we plan to set out from Lake Bosten

233
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,990
and head south to find the ancient Kongque River.

234
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,500
And enter the deep desert via the river.

235
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,420
And followed the dark Henan

236
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,370
to find the remains of the ancient city.

237
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,800
Mr. Hu is entering the desert.

238
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,690
We need to discuss

239
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,830
about what to do next.

240
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
With the rest,

241
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,600
I hope we can set out right away

242
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,080
we should set out right away.

243
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,820
We'll depart right away!

244
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,770
Do you want me to stay alive?

245
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,970
Everyone here

246
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,090
because of you.

247
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,130
You know what?

248
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,280
The working people are the masters now.

249
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,080
Mr. Hu,

250
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,890
according to the notes,

251
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,660
we can only find the Ancient City during the monsoon season.

252
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,770
The monsoon season has come this year.

253
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,970
It'll be too late

254
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

255
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,880
Comrade Hu,

256
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,300
about this,

257
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,120
what are your thoughts?

258
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
No matter how we plan,

259
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,390
Is only empty.

260
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,000
If this time

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,130
Into the desert this time,

262
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,620
we need to find someone

263
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,760
who is familiar with the local conditions,

264
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,110
especially those familiar with the desert.

265
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,650
Sometimes, experience

266
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,850
Is more reliable than professionalism.

267
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,630
That's right.

268
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,470
I have another suggestion

269
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,440
professor Chen, we must have guns this time

270
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,360
and have enough ammunition

271
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,610
you must find a way

272
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,940
mr. Hu,

273
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,410
I agree with you.

274
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,170
I'm worried about the timing.

275
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,930
We found the notebook.

276
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,740
The contents are very important.

277
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,280
It has decisive significance

278
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,990
when we find Ancient City.

279
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,440
The point is the gun.

280
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,950
Did you hear that?

281
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,220
The point I care about is

282
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,970
to make sure nothing happens again.

283
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,870
It's dangerous.

284
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,520
I believe all of you

285
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,390
have personally experienced

286
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,400
If we go into the desert this time,

287
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,590
we won't be protected by the PLA.

288
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,400
So, let me emphasize this once again.

289
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,060
Who wants to go home?

290
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,630
It's not too late now.

291
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,710
Brother Hu,

292
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,290
young as we are,

293
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:05,820
we've already

294
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,920
about it.

295
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,170
Before we set off

296
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,610
professor Chen had emphasized it many times

297
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,210
about her many times before we set out

298
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
we love archaeology.

299
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,200
We don't want to make it

300
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,150
with words.

301
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,680
But into actions.

302
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,540
We believe we can learn a lot

303
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,610
we can definitely learn

304
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,940
that you can't learn from books.

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,680
Yes, to explore the essence culture

306
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,620
to explore the essence culture

307
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,540
and it's also the subject of our research

308
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,200
It's a rare opportunity.

309
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,850
We won't give up easily

310
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,080
simply because it's dangerous

311
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,400
professor Chen and I

312
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,790
after we got out of the glacier,

313
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,170
I talked to all of the members.

314
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,480
Their ideological level

315
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,950
In ideological consciousness.

316
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,350
To have such a team,

317
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,250
the future of our national archaeology

318
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,520
of our national archaeology.

319
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,870
It's really high.

320
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,190
Alright.

321
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,090
Let's find the guide

322
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,960
as soon as we arrive.

323
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,000
To make a decision

324
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,330
the next route.

325
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,190
When we get there,

326
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,230
divide into two teams

327
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,360
I'll lead the students

328
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,000
to prepare supplies for the desert.

329
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,700
Hu, lead the group to find the guide.

330
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,200
Mr. Hu,

331
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,760
professor,

332
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,120
leaders, leaders.

333
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,060
Welcome.

334
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,020
Welcome

335
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,680
-Everyone, after a long journey,
nice to meet you.

336
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,520
Thank you for your hard work.

337
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Welcome.

338
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,000
This is Chen Jiuren, Professor Chen.

339
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,600
Our expert on the archaeology of the Western Regions.

340
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,300
This is my work pass.

341
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,020
An expert from Beijing.

342
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm not qualified to be an expert.

343
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,930
We are all students

344
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,370
we're all students.

345
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,110
Come on.

346
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,260
What an expert says.

347
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,170
The result is really different.

348
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:12,780
Right.

349
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,490
My family name is Zhao Zhiguo.

350
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,460
You can call me Zhao.

351
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,090
This is Chief Zhao

352
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,370
- Section Chief Zhao
-Hello, Chief Zhao.

353
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,520
This is a letter of introduction,

354
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
thank you for your hard work.

355
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,030
-Hello.
- Professor Chen.

356
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,970
-Thank you.
-Where are you? -Why?

357
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,240
Such a small place like ours

358
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
a professor like him

359
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,630
a professor like you.

360
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,590
How about this?

361
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,540
You stay in the guest house

362
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,080
If you need any help,

363
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,540
we will do our best to

364
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,860
-Right. -Right.
-You need any cooperation?

365
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,090
We'll have the green light all the way.

366
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,050
Right?
Right.

367
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,510
Chief Zhao, here is the thing.

368
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,240
We are in urgent need of a guide

369
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,120
who in our town

370
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,470
has enough experience in going to desert?

371
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,440
-You know what?
-Yeah.

372
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,510
We don't want the most experienced.

373
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,790
And we need to set out right away.

374
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,030
These two

375
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,360
this is our leader

376
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,210
hu Bayi

377
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,730
oh, hello there

378
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,240
hello

379
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,730
she is Miss Yang.

380
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,940
The investor of our archaeology

381
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,500
the most experienced guide.

382
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,780
That's a bit difficult.

383
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,550
No, it's not.

384
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,040
Here's the thing

385
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,260
yes, Chief Zhao

386
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,880
an Li Man?

387
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,730
The living map in the desert.

388
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,920
Everyone knows

389
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,180
that this old man is incredible.

390
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,490
He has raised a good camel.

391
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Even the kids in our town know

392
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,980
to bring three things into the desert

393
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,120
water camel?

394
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,380
And An Liman.

395
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,220
Isn't this the one we're looking for?

396
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,600
But this man is hard to find.

397
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,980
He lives far away.

398
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,850
My town is not that big to begin with.

399
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,040
It's not that big.

400
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,140
Is there an electromagnetic wave

401
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,960
he has electromagnetic waves?

402
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
He can be invisible.

403
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,210
Shut up.

404
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,480
Don't listen to him.

405
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,290
He likes to study aliens.

406
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,320
Alien?

407
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,170
We have never seen an alien.

408
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,630
Last week, someone said that

409
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,750
saw a UFO.

410
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,900
- UFO?
- Comrade Zhao.

411
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,150
-This is...
-I knew

412
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,670
why is it hard to find?

413
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,530
We've been seeing

414
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,520
we haven't seen him

415
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,460
for more than half a month.

416
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
What's the name?

417
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,030
I really don't know his name.

418
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,090
We all call him An Liman.

419
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,900
In Uyghur it means

420
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,500
the living map in the desert.

421
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,450
You just said that

422
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,360
you need to bring three things to the desert

423
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,730
he's one of them, right?

424
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,740
Yes, that's him.

425
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,150
Is there any way

426
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,300
to find him?

427
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,340
How about this?

428
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,070
Go to the police station.

429
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,750
This place is small.

430
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,380
You know everything in the police station.

431
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,690
Let's go to the police station.

432
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,760
Please have some tea.

433
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,430
You're welcome.

434
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,320
(Letter of Introduction)

435
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,630
Mr. Shan, we're leaving now.

436
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
You can turn to anyone

437
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,250
you can turn to no one.

438
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,500
What do you mean?

439
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,950
It's the windy season now.

440
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,460
It's very dangerous to enter the desert now.

441
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,150
You are all experts from Beijing.

442
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,540
Regarding your safety,

443
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,790
we have to be responsible for that.

444
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,600
Take the thing.

445
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,270
Director Wang.

446
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,760
You've read the letter.

447
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,990
We are a key scientific research project

448
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,490
supported by the state.

449
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,270
This is a special project.

450
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,730
It should be treated as a special case.

451
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,470
Right?

452
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,650
I know that.

453
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,620
But I have to make it clear

454
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,820
about the relationship.

455
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,310
As for how to do it,

456
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,080
how to handle it.

457
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,800
But we really need

458
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,720
director An Liman

459
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,400
do you know that?

460
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,340
Got it.

461
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,500
An Liman is famous here.

462
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,320
When he was young,

463
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,570
he came to us to support us.

464
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,640
Once we were in the desert

465
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,540
he ran into a sandstorm

466
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,270
his life was saved by the camel.

467
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,260
And from now on,

468
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,680
the camel is his life.

469
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,650
He has always kept camels.

470
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,630
But in the current season,

471
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,120
In the season.

472
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,220
Which department is he in now?

473
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,580
Where can we find him?

474
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,830
Don't look for him.

475
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,120
He's right here.

476
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,140
We caught him two days ago.

477
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,110
The office.

478
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,440
We're carrying out the reform and opening up.

479
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,000
So many foreigners

480
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,040
travel to our place.

481
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,600
An Li is quite active.

482
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
Often leads a group of foreigners

483
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,080
as guides.

484
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,210
Not long ago,

485
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,700
he took a group of foreigners

486
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,610
to the desert.

487
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,070
And earned a lot of money.

488
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,370
But after a few days,

489
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,920
she's back.

490
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,640
Then...

491
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,430
We'll have to take care of

492
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,220
as well as the government.

493
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,160
Turns out the old man

494
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,420
was completely innocent.

495
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,290
We can't help it.

496
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,540
We can't even

497
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,520
here together.

498
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,850
- Wang. - Come on.
-Hey.

499
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,590
Have you fed the camels?

500
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,520
Yes, yes.

501
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,080
You only need to feed me all the time.

502
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,260
Why does that sound so mysterious?

503
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,310
Director Wang,

504
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,900
Is the old man reliable?

505
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,170
I guess he failed to negotiate a price

506
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,900
and left them in the desert.

507
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,530
But they dare not enter

508
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,860
If he dare not go in,

509
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,320
then no one would dare to come in.

510
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,030
And their camels are

511
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,260
are really good.

512
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,240
But I can't praise

513
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,940
good character.

514
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,730
It's all about serving the country.

515
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,570
If you think this is okay,

516
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,870
we will let him redeem himself.

517
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,340
If you think it's impossible,

518
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,360
we can think of a way.

519
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,890
What do you think, Hu?

520
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,920
Let's see him first.

521
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,150
An ability full.

522
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,600
Someone's here.

523
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,440
And went forward,

524
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,820
peering through a gap,

525
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,110
to see more clearly.

526
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,150
My bravery

527
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,950
with my courage

528
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:56,950
be together.

529
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:04,980
In my heart,

530
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,900
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

531
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,740
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

532
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,090
Fate only beckons.

533
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,740
But doesn't care

534
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,630
the result.

535
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,740
Trapped in the present

536
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,230
stuck in the present

537
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,590
down the unknown river

538
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,210
down the river,

539
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,670
the greater the desire,

540
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,180
the more you demand.

541
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,770
With full stomach,

542
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,770
they kept their mouths shut.

543
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,580
♪ Fate promised ♪

544
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,160
You'll change your mind.

545
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,610
Giving me sweet words

546
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,190
but lying to me.

547
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,690
You'd climb to Heaven...

548
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,240
And hides again.

549
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,580
Looking young.

550
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,540
And grey overnight.

551
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,430
Down the river

552
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,260
overnight, my hair turns grey.
