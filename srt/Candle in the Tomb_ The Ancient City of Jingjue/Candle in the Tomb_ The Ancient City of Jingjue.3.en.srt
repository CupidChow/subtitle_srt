Fat Brother Hu

5
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,830
yingzi!

6
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,120
Yingzi, are you down there?

7
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,210
Hu, I'm down here.

8
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,270
Are you alright?

9
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,330
I'm fine. I sprained my ankle.

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,790
And I can't climb it.

11
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,800
Fatty.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,640
Are there

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,060
Is it the side hole they dug?

14
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,210
Bring it here.

15
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,050
Hey!

16
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,350
Don't forget the rope.

17
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,960
Alright.

18
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,950
Yingzi, don't be scared.

19
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,680
We will come down to save you in a while.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,070
Alright.

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,780
What's down there?

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,640
I can't see it because it's so dark.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Slow down, Hu.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,760
Are you alright?

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,530
I'm fine. I sprained my ankle.

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,540
Let me take a look. Come on.

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,150
Can you move yourself?

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,970
Try to move.

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,140
It doesn't matter if you can move your bones.

30
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,320
Get out of the way, I'm coming down.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,760
Watch out!

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Please!

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,870
Who asked you to come down?

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,560
I told you to keep watching up there.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,590
There's nothing up there.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,640
Why should I look?

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,910
Yingzi, are you alright?

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,700
All right.

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,480
Are you alright?

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,690
I'm alright.

41
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,410
Oh my God! This is amazing!

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,650
It's so exciting.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,350
Old Hu!

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,250
Old Hu!

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,720
Is this a tomb?

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,540
This is indeed a tomb.

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,080
Old Hu,

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
yingzi, take this.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,550
What's this?

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Black donkey's hoof can ward off evil spirits.

51
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,840
I stole it from the village head.

52
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,410
There are sticky rice too.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're really something.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,020
Did you wear it?

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,520
Hold your tongue.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,630
That's right.

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,600
We're already here, just consider it an adventure.

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,020
Stand back.

59
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,630
Fat, what are you doing?

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,590
Let me check if there's any booby traps.

61
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,160
Don't kill him with all the arrows

62
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,710
If we wear candied haws,

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,030
fat, you know so much.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,380
That's the reason why Fat Bro

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,420
learning and selling right away is...

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,930
Fatty!

67
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,100
Enough.

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,310
Someone explored the way here.

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,540
There should be no traps.

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,410
We'll make a big mistake.

71
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,050
Mr. Hu, we really go in there.

72
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,790
Don't worry.

73
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,360
Let's go in and have a look.

74
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,450
You can protect

75
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,390
you will protect us.

76
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,700
We will protect you here.

77
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,280
Can you leave now?

78
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,590
It seems that someone was here.

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,240
Is this a coffin?

80
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,840
Don't be scared. It's murals.

81
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,240
It's surrounded by murals.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
You scared me.

83
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,800
Put these away.

84
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,600
This should be the tomb owner's

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,030
the scenes of

86
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,940
the scene of fighting on the battlefield.

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,320
Look at their feet.

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,470
It should be a scene of triumph.

89
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go that way.

90
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,200
It's a trap and distress

91
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
and here.

92
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,640
This is supposed to be a duke or a duke.

93
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,640
Judging from this,

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,020
the owner of this tomb is a general.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,470
Old Hu!

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,660
Come on!

97
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,880
Come on.

98
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,120
Old Hu, look at this.

99
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,540
Fatty, don't move.

100
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,850
I didn't move!

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,290
This fell off by itself.

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,440
You know,

103
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
the general is really poor.

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,130
People buried with you

105
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,720
not scrap metal,

106
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,140
and these broken pots.

107
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,230
What's this?

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,380
Dinosaur?

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,520
What dinosaur? Don't let pears.

110
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,970
This is the war horse

111
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,670
for your general. Got it?

112
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,980
Why isn't there

113
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,660
there's no coffin?

114
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,550
Do you think the coffin

115
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,200
was stolen by some tomb robber?

116
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,910
Don't be silly.

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,380
The cave is so small.

118
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,780
Can the coffin be carried out?

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,870
Mace.

120
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,120
Where do you think

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,480
hide the coffin?

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,200
There must be a booby trap.

123
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,320
Mr. Hu, I'm scared.

124
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go now.

125
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,130
Yingzi, don't be afraid.

126
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,480
When the sky collapses,

127
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,710
you, Mr. Hu, will take care of it.

128
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,820
Don't be scared.

129
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,760
Fatty.

130
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,220
Come here.

131
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,920
Look at this.

132
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,450
I think this must be a problem.

133
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,200
Is this a trap?

134
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,350
Can you really press it?

135
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,450
I see it.

136
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,120
Hu, there is one more here

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,900
don't move.

138
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,960
Mr. Hu, what's wrong?

139
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,340
What's that sound?

140
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,130
Stay down!

141
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,960
Fatty, are you all right?

142
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,750
I'm fine. Are you all right?

143
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,160
Hurry up!

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,450
Hurry!

145
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Old Hu, I bumped my leg!

146
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,540
You are so stupid.

147
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,890
Come on.

148
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,990
Here's the trap.

149
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
All the good stuff

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
must be inside there.

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,250
What are you doing?

152
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,960
Don't move.

153
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,360
Hey.

154
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,390
They are here.

155
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,420
Don't you want to see them?

156
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,100
Take this.

157
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,170
The candle.

158
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,900
Hey!

159
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,490
Fire.

160
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,210
What are you doing, Hu?

161
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,560
People are lighting candles and ghosts are blowing lanterns.

162
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,390
What?

163
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,480
It's a rule passed down from the elders.

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,700
It means it's at the southeast corner.

165
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,520
We must light a candle before opening the coffin.

166
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,640
If the candles burn out,

167
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,990
we'll have to leave as soon as possible.

168
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,260
Shall not be desirable.

169
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,800
This is a contract

170
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,630
between the living and the dead.

171
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,950
No exception can be made for the Millennium Inheritance.

172
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,840
Look at these.

173
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,000
The imposing manner, the workmanship and the carved patterns.

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,470
I guess the general was the only one

175
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,010
this is the only coffin left.

176
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,750
It's worth some money.

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,920
Just go.

178
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,250
Don't run your mouth.

179
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,960
Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,880
at least,

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,970
should have a sword or something.

182
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,920
You need to open it.

183
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,080
Give it to me.

184
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,950
Yingzi, shine it for me.

185
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Didn't I tell you to leave?

186
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,340
Shine the light on it.

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,420
Fatty!

188
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,920
Go to the back.

189
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,420
It's done.

190
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,830
Hold on.

191
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,550
Go and look at the candles.

192
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,320
Oh!

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,700
One, two, three.

194
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,860
Come on.

195
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,610
See? I told you he's very poor.

196
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,570
Let's see first.

197
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
You scared me.

198
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,920
We were too curious about this.

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,630
By accident.

200
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,630
And borrow your clothes back.

201
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,420
Don't be mad if you offend them.

202
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,810
He'll surely pay for the bridges and roads in the future,

203
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,140
and improve people's lives.

204
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,290
I, Fatty Wang, will surely

205
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,730
learn from Lei Feng and do good deeds.

206
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,360
Be clear about what to love and what to hate.

207
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,750
Firm stand and strong will.

208
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,810
Enough!

209
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,990
Fatty, I'm telling you.

210
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,900
Even if you've found something,

211
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,140
don't dwell on that.

212
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,910
I won't be able to protect you if something happens.

213
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,360
Stop it.

214
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,970
Let me ask you this.

215
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,140
Where did all the good stuff in Panjiayuan come from?

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,410
Where did Big Gold Tooth get those?

217
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I just want to have a look.

218
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,500
I just wanted to have a look.

219
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,310
Please rest first.

220
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,030
Hurry up! Go!

221
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,880
Fatty, slow down.

222
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,590
Old Hu,

223
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,550
all my efforts paid off.

224
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,520
Look at this.

225
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,360
Is it a good thing? Jade?

226
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,970
It should be good.

227
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,810
That's right.

228
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,600
They're holding it.

229
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
Can it be a good thing?

230
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,490
Mr. Hu, look at this.

231
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,500
Why don't you buy them?

232
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,130
These five-cent candles?

233
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,740
It's such an important thing to buy cheap ones.

234
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,920
Okay, I'll buy Japanese ones,

235
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,640
german, American.

236
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,010
I'll buy the ones from whichever country is more expensive.

237
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,750
However,

238
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,790
put the two jades back?

239
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,300
Put them back? That's impossible.

240
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,350
What are you thinking?

241
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,360
I wasted my energy

242
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,790
I took it out and then I put it back.

243
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,240
They're not glutinous rice balls.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,430
It's all for nothing.

245
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,080
Fat Bro, put it back quickly.

246
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,250
The candles went out.

247
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,200
Why not?

248
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,560
What if it was blown out by the wind?

249
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,630
Are you releasing it?

250
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,400
What's your problem?

251
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,280
How come you turn to the police

252
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,690
In the conflicts among the people?

253
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,830
You know what?

254
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,410
Fat Bro, I can't beat you,

255
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
I don't like to fight with girls.

256
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,050
Don't force me.

257
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,180
- Are you letting it go or not?
-Younzi.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,170
Fatty!

259
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,230
It's a rule passed down from our ancestors.

260
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,820
No one can make an exception and put it back.

261
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,270
Then can I put them together?

262
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,880
Okay. Give me the lighter.

263
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,600
I'll light the candles again.

264
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,940
If it's on,

265
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,140
we can take the jade away

266
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,020
If it is destroyed again,

267
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,090
we must put both back.

268
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,030
Okay, for our ancestors' sake,

269
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,270
release one.

270
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,400
I'll do that!

271
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,340
See if she's alright.

272
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,390
There's nothing wrong.

273
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,150
See that?

274
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,270
Fat Bro, I can keep my composure.

275
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,360
Retreat from Sha Jia Bang Act 6.

276
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Come on.

277
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,270
Hold on.

278
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,720
How did the candle flame

279
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,850
Is green?

280
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,960
Come on! Go!

281
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,720
How did these things fly here?

282
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,270
We can't go out.

283
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,680
Yingzi, all the ghosts and spirits

284
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,790
are all paper tigers!

285
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,020
Let's kill it then.

286
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,990
Kill it!

287
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,980
Big Brother Hu!

288
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,560
Old Hu,

289
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,350
discuss with it.

290
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,440
Let's give it back.

291
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,800
When we fight, tell it

292
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
It's no good to anyone. Peace is more precious.

293
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

294
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,660
Do you think they're human?

295
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,220
Can it understand when I tell it?

296
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,040
What to do then?

297
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,790
What can we do? The door is blocked.

298
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,410
Obviously,

299
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,720
he wants us to be buried with him.

300
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,960
We have to fight to its death.

301
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,940
Yingzi, hide well.

302
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,470
We're the boss of this monster.

303
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,980
I'm going to kill you!

304
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,170
Old Hu!

305
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,040
Old Hu, you don't deserve glory, do you?

306
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,660
Shut your big mouth.

307
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,640
I want your life.

308
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,490
I'll cut you with another knife.

309
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,560
Fatty, get up and run.

310
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,740
Hurry, get up and run.

311
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,770
Fatty.

312
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,180
Hurry and get up.

313
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,360
I can't get up. I have...

314
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,980
Good job! Continue beating Yingzi then!

315
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,990
Give me the jade.

316
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,630
Yingzi,

317
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,520
fat Bro, help me!

318
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Get out of the way!

319
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,890
Yingzi, are you alright?

320
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,070
Screw you!

321
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,640
Your thing.

322
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,920
Here is your stuff.

323
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,270
I've returned it to you.

324
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,230
I've returned it to you.

325
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,210
Why are you chasing me?

326
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,920
Fatty! Donkey's feet!

327
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,270
Black donkey's feet.

328
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,450
Climb over the wall!

329
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,920
Yingzi, shine your light on my hand.

330
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,510
Old Hu, you're right.

331
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,450
Old Hu is really good.

332
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,140
Brother Hu,

333
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,860
what's your name?

334
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Hu, are you all right?

335
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,860
I'm fine. Are you alright?

336
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,410
I'm alright.

337
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,720
Go ahead and shout!

338
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,590
Fatty.

339
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,650
Stop that!

340
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,960
Then the hoof.

341
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,190
Come here!

342
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,100
Open the door now.

343
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,920
Let's leave quickly.

344
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,090
Yingzi,

345
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,880
you made a great shot just now.

346
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,730
Otherwise, my life

347
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,530
I'll leave it here.

348
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,620
Mr. Hu, before you leave,

349
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,280
I must take the two jade stones with me.

350
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,220
Otherwise, I will not accept the result.

351
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,410
Cut the crap and help me.

352
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,480
Give me the shovel.

353
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,200
Come on.

354
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,020
Two, three.

355
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,120
One, two, three.

356
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,610
Come on, one more time.

357
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,520
One, two, three.

358
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,900
Two, three.

359
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,210
Brother Hu,

360
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,860
It seems to move.

361
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,040
What should we do, Hu?

362
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,890
Run!

363
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,660
Where are we going?

364
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,780
To the back.

365
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,470
Okay. Run.

366
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,930
Come on, Yingzi. Hurry up!

367
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,790
Come on. Hurry up.

368
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,150
Let me do that.

369
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,940
Let me help you with that.

370
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,990
One, two, go.

371
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,560
Hu is dying!

372
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,620
Why is it so heavy?

373
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,490
It's coming!

374
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,420
Stop yelling. You heard me.

375
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,470
Fatty, come here.

376
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,950
One, two, three.

377
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,630
Come on.

378
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,610
Fatty, one more time.

379
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,840
Come on.

380
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,000
Brother Hu,

381
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,030
this is a darkroom.

382
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,990
Fatty!

383
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,050
Get in now.

384
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,970
Am I passable?

385
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,530
Cut the crap. Let's go in.

386
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,320
Yingzi, hurry up!

387
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,740
Hurry up, Hu.

388
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,930
OK. OK.

389
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,160
Run!

390
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,650
Come on! Hurry up!

391
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,070
Come on! Go!

392
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,880
Hold on.

393
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,670
Close the door.

394
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,880
Really like glue.

395
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,250
It got stuck on it.

396
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,720
How am I supposed to lock this?

397
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,530
This is according to Yingzi.

398
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,810
Hurry up, you two.

399
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,050
Where is this?

400
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,510
What kind of place is this?

401
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,540
Why is there an iron gate in the tomb?

402
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,240
Come.

403
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,290
There's a map.

404
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,000
(Explanation)
This should be

405
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,190
of the Japanese.

406
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,750
This is the secret fortress of Guandong Army.

407
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,780
Old Hu,

408
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,840
we ran for this place.

409
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,280
(Drain pipe)
But got into this tomb.

410
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,290
Now you're running for your life.

411
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,520
And here again.

412
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,910
It's a worthy trip.

413
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,820
The exit is marked here.

414
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,580
I hope the Japanese

415
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,250
hadn't destroyed the Japanese

416
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,100
when we surrendered.

417
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,300
Old Hu.

418
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,650
(Ammunition storage)
There's the ammunition storage.

419
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,280
Let's go check it out.

420
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,010
It'd be better to have planes and cannons.

421
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,970
I'll blow them up!

422
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,670
Hu, if we can find the exit,

423
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,360
just stay away from the red monster.

424
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,440
Don't listen to the nonsense.

425
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,980
Can this plane go down to the ground?

426
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,420
Can't I

427
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,000
can't I just tell you something?

428
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,500
This is the generator room.

429
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,200
Let's go check

430
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,220
the generator can still be used.

431
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,770
This way.

432
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,100
Come.

433
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,490
Yingzi, shine the light for me.

434
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,980
Enough, Fatty.

435
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,250
Light has come to the world of men.

436
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,870
It's finally not so dark.

437
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,880
Brother Hu,

438
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,240
let's find an exit.

439
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,880
Alright.

440
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,090
Let's find some self-defense guys.

441
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,650
What if something bad happens to us? Let's go.

442
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,070
Brother Hu,

443
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,390
are there any children here?

444
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,220
There's no one here.

445
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,460
Where's this kid from?

446
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,420
Yingzi, I mean.

447
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,020
Are you scared?

448
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,740
Are you seeing something?

449
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,920
Nothing.

450
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,060
Maybe I'm really freaked out.

451
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,440
Let's go. This way.

452
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,840
This fortress is really big.

453
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,380
My goodness.

454
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,600
The Japanese are so evil.

455
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,820
Why are there so many things here?

456
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,850
The Type 92 infantry gun.

457
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
The 7.7-caliber heavy machine gun of the Type 92.

458
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,410
If it was there,

459
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,010
that red-haired monster

460
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,250
I'm going to smash it.

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,500
Fatty!

462
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,670
Find something to break the lock.

463
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,040
They're coming.

464
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,830
Get out of the way.

465
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,850
What is this?

466
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,400
Japanese lunch boxes.

467
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,040
What is this?

468
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,010
My goodness.

469
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,920
This is good stuff.

470
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,910
Come. Take the bag down.

471
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,060
Here you are.

472
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,560
Yingzi, take this.

473
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,790
Old Hu Yingzi, come here.

474
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,120
And went forward,

475
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,120
peering through a gap,

476
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,780
to see more clearly.

477
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,690
My bravery

478
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,950
with my courage

479
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:01,920
be together.

480
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,770
In my heart,

481
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,980
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

482
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,930
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

483
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,050
Fate only beckons.

484
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,990
But doesn't care

485
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,350
the result.

486
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,550
Trapped in the present

487
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,080
stuck in the present

488
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,670
down the unknown river

489
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,710
down the river,

490
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,530
the greater the desire,

491
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,750
the more you demand.

492
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,340
With full stomach,

493
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,810
they kept their mouths shut.

494
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
♪ Fate has promised ♪

495
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,070
Will change.

496
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,520
She poured out her love words

497
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,080
but lying to me.

498
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,860
You'd climb to Heaven...

499
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,910
And hides again.

500
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,450
Looking young.

501
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,610
And grey overnight.

502
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,560
Down the river

503
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,450
overnight, my hair turns grey.
