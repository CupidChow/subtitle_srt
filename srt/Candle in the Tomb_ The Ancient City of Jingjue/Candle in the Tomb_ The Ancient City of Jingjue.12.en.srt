Come on.

Come on.

6
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,720
Come on.

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,130
Come on.

8
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,290
My lord.

9
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,920
The vast desert is boundless.

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,380
If it wasn't for the long footprints,

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,740
I wouldn't even feel that

12
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,660
they're moving forward.

13
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,160
I really admire the explorers

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,240
who entered the desert alone

15
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,440
maybe there is one person

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,700
who walks in the world lonely.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Can we realize

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,780
more meaning of life.

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,960
You can also be an explorer.

20
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,040
You can travel around the world.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,980
I won't do that for the rest of my life.

22
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,840
I prefer the collective life.

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,620
Sis Yang,

24
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,460
I want to ask you a question.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,800
What are desert army ants?

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,300
I have never seen them with my own eyes.

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,400
I've read it in

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,720
In natural science.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
But I have seen it before.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
Before I saw the village

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,180
human and livestock

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,840
have been gnawed down to bones.

33
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,140
Too horrible to look at

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,660
this kind of ant colony

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,160
are called army ants

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,680
because it

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,440
Is highly organized and disciplined.

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,360
Even a well-trained human army

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,740
are no match for their organizational ability

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,260
Is no match for them.

41
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,600
Oh!

42
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,900
No wonder they have such amazing fighting power.

43
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,380
There is a kind of formic acid in their mouths

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,360
hundreds of thousands of them.

45
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,920
Even an elephant couldn't handle it.

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
okay, Ms. Yang, thank you.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,900
I don't have any other questions.

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,480
Oops,

50
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,260
I think I got bit.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,020
Won't it corrode?

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,800
Just a bite is okay.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
Then tell me,

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,080
how did you know that

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,100
Is useful to ants?

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,100
I don't know.

57
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,900
I don't know.

58
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,760
And you saved my life like that?

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,500
All I know is the ant is afraid of chili powder.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,080
And the pepper and capsaicin

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,240
contained pepper and capsaicin in the tear gas.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,020
So I have to give it a try.

63
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,300
But what if it doesn't work?

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,360
Have you thought about it?

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,520
I have fireworks.

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,380
OK.

67
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,540
Thank you for saving me.

68
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,480
Don't mention it.

69
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,220
Look at what?

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
Don't you think

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
you've changed a lot recently?

72
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,660
You didn't smile that much in the past.

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
You didn't know me.

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,780
That's true.

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,980
I see it now.

76
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Well, it is the ruins of the city.

77
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,060
There are ancient cities

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,700
beneath the yellow sand.

79
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,660
Did you see that?

80
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,020
- I found them.
- I see it.

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,640
- Over there.
- Right there.

82
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,220
See that?

83
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,660
Yes, I have!

84
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,880
Hu is there.

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
Let's go quickly then.

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,300
Though they look close,

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,860
to walk to the distance, right?

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,060
Everyone is leaving.

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,980
- We are leaving.
- The dawn is ahead.

90
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,160
Hurry up!

91
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,680
Teacher, are you OK?

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,600
It's okay. We're almost there.

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,420
Father.

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
What's the matter? Is there another problem?

95
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,400
Are you hiding something from us?

96
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
She's different now.

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,240
You've changed so much.

98
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
What does that mean?

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,940
I'm not sure if there's water in it.

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,180
That was many years ago.

101
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,740
After all these years,

102
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,440
no one ever mentioned it.

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
As far as I'm concerned,

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
we might not be able to find the water.

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,800
To the place

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
where the white camel took me

107
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
over twenty years ago, there was water.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Please bless me.

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,820
Chu Jian, there's water here.

110
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,740
It's okay. I can hold on.

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,840
When will you arrive?

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
This is where I came back

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
many years ago.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,640
-The old man... -Where is water?
-Mother. -Mother.

115
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,940
There's a well in there.

116
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,820
Hu, where is the water?

117
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,300
He said there's a well down there.

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,600
Professor, how are you?

119
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,040
Nothing.

120
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
Look, the old man is here again.

121
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,640
Ask him to pray.

122
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
If the well inside

123
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,740
had become a dry well,

124
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,220
this could be

125
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,580
the last scene of our lives.

126
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,620
What do you mean?

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,340
Everyone,

128
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,580
let's take a rest first. Don't scatter.

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,760
Fatty and I, we'll go inside.

130
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,540
I'll go with you.

131
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,660
Take care.

132
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
Come on.

133
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,860
Chu Jian, Sadipeng, go check it out.

134
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,900
Alright.

135
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,740
What?

136
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,620
What's up

137
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,560
what is it?

138
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,540
What's up

139
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,100
what happened

140
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,880
what happened?

141
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
What's up

142
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,560
say something!

143
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,860
Say something, Wang!

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,020
Hu, what happened?

145
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,780
Fatty, cut it out.

146
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,120
Tell me. What happened?

147
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,060
Water in it.

148
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
Water in there.

149
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
You scared me.

150
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,220
Why did he shoot?

151
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,160
That's great!

152
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,980
There's a rabbit in it.

153
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,500
That scared the guy.

154
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,520
Talk rubbish

155
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,840
I did it to improve the food for you.

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,400
Did you hit it?

157
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,420
What?

158
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,020
You should squat down when you see a rabbit.

159
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,640
You're lucky they didn't hit us.

160
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,020
Old Hu,

161
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,360
how could you make a scene like this?

162
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,220
Don't waste your bullets in the future.

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, let's fill the water.

164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,440
- Hey.
- Alright.

165
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,520
Just go.

166
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,260
God bless.

167
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
God bless.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,060
Miss Mo,

169
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,080
bless her.

170
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,460
It's all right. We have water now.

171
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,380
Uncle Wen, thank you.

172
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,700
Thank you, old brother.

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,300
Thank you.

174
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,320
We are friends.

175
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,420
It's all a blessing from God.

176
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,500
Just go.

177
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,160
Thanks to this old man

178
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,750
this old man.

179
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,930
-Yes! -Yes.
-Hey.

180
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,960
You're worried about your camels, right?

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,720
If there's really no water in there,

182
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,060
your camels will be doomed.

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
Comrade Hu,

184
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,900
the gods will love you.

185
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,560
He will love you.

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,960
But of course,

187
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,260
If even one of us

188
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,860
the God doesn't like it.

189
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,100
Today is the end.

190
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,040
We are all

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,200
we are protected by God.

192
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,540
Grandpa.

193
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,420
Thank you for your help today.

194
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
We'll be brothers from now on.

195
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,140
We're related to each other.

196
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,860
Well

197
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm your friend.

198
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,100
Come on.

199
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,120
It is ready.

200
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,940
How is it? Have you filled up?

201
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,760
Almost.

202
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,320
Mr. Hu said that we'd leave it there.

203
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,660
Fill it before we leave tomorrow.

204
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,840
-OK.
-OK, the last bucket.

205
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,660
Alright.

206
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,880
Forget it. I've never seen this before.

207
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,140
Come and have a look!

208
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Americans are all foreigners.

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,260
This is just a vegetable.

210
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,500
-Yes, that's right.
-Hurry.

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
You're in poor stamina.

212
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,260
That's really convenient.

213
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,900
This can be kept for a long time

214
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,500
and portable.

215
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,800
Alright.

216
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,580
Honey,

217
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,880
are these the dishes we usually eat?

218
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,920
That's right.

219
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,560
This dehydrated vegetable

220
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,660
removes the water from the vegetables,

221
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,960
while retaining its color and nutrition.

222
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,430
It's very suitable for field work.

223
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,920
This one is also suitable for you, right?

224
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,460
When we have this in the future,

225
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,560
If you go to the desert,

226
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,700
you don't have to only eat dry food.

227
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,120
Are these expensive?

228
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,360
The vegetable processing technology

229
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,820
Is an application

230
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,340
In order to let astronauts...

231
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,460
In the space,

232
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,440
to supplement vitamins.

233
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
So it's relatively expensive.

234
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,340
The thing you said just now...

235
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,300
What you just said.

236
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,850
Well, that's all.

237
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,960
-The United States.
-Father.

238
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,640
She means that this thing

239
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,740
Is really expensive.

240
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,080
Got it.

241
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
You've kept such a secret.

242
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,620
That's why I haven't taken it out in days.

243
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,480
To take it out

244
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,180
at a difficult time like this.

245
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,040
To reflect its value.

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,840
That's right, Miss Yang.

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,220
In such a desolate place,

248
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,480
having vegetable soup

249
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,040
to have vegetable soup.

250
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,660
You haven't seasoned it.

251
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,600
When the season is done,

252
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It looks good in color, fragrance and taste.

253
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,100
I think the northeast is better.

254
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,100
In the woods, there are so many delicacies

255
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,500
In this forest.

256
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,740
Look at this.

257
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,240
Nothing but sand.

258
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,140
-Come on.
-You hit a yellow sheep and have a bite.

259
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,500
Your mouth is full of grains of sand.

260
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,760
That both of us were in Inner Mongolia

261
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,860
there is a saying that goes around

262
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,280
come.

263
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,260
Let the roe deer be struck and the fishes be ladled.

264
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,300
Pheasants fly into the rice cooker.

265
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,020
Now we have enough to eat.

266
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,260
No one would have expected that half day ago,

267
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,500
we were still in limbo.

268
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,380
We can have

269
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,740
you'll be having your soup soon.

270
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,940
Hey, Brother Wang!

271
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,340
What did that girl mean

272
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,500
the roe deer?

273
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,220
Do you think you should hit me with a stick?

274
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,370
Spectacles, you are quite easy to learn.

275
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,840
Okay, I'll tell you about it.

276
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,260
Have you come to the woods

277
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,680
just masturbate with this stick.

278
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,280
You can kill a roe deer!

279
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,240
You can't even

280
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,080
just pull that ladle out to get him,

281
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,110
even this big fat fish comes out.

282
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,560
It means producing rich crops.

283
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,850
Understood.

284
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,200
Comrade Wang,

285
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,660
they also have their advantages.

286
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,960
The western regions are like

287
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,710
a mystery that can never be explored.

288
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,680
This place is the treasure of the world.

289
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,510
(Topographic map)
The source of culture.

290
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,240
I don't like your words.

291
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,110
Northeast has lost its culture.

292
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,510
Do you think there's only woods

293
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,090
and there are treasures underground.

294
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,820
The two of us

295
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,090
miss Yang,

296
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,520
when will this soup be ready?

297
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,830
It's so dry, you'll choke.

298
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,540
It'll take a while.

299
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,610
What happened to brother Wang a while ago?

300
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,750
Go on.

301
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,310
We went back

302
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,800
visit people here.

303
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,390
How could you tell

304
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,990
there is treasure underground?

305
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Yes, it seems that

306
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,590
honey,

307
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,780
old Hu,

308
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,020
when we went to the countryside,

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,160
the secretary told us

310
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,710
there was a national archaeological team

311
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,180
had arrived at Mount Niuxin.

312
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,030
We should do archaeology, right?

313
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,260
That's right.

314
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,860
Yes, that's right.

315
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,000
Was the tomb of Empress Xiao

316
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,740
In Niuxin Mountain, right?

317
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,220
Whatever it is,

318
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,070
got a tomb, right?

319
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,430
Yes, it seems big.

320
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,600
Before this,

321
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,140
the paper reported that

322
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
another one was found

323
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,240
another tomb

324
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,500
tomb of a general from the Liao and Jin Dynasties.

325
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,160
We also found

326
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,110
a Japanese military fortress.

327
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,590
Right. Right.

328
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,840
You know that, right?

329
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,450
Really?

330
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,300
I don't know.

331
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't think I've heard of this before.

332
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,160
I don't know.

333
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,630
When the tomb in Liao and Jin was being excavated,

334
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,960
Is the tomb of Empress Xiao being excavated too?

335
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,080
If you know the tomb of Empress Dowager Xiao,

336
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
then you must also know

337
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
It's not right.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,310
You might have been

339
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,230
the Niuxin Mountain

340
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,860
before the excavation of the ancient tombs.

341
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,250
But why are you...

342
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,800
What are you doing, Glasses?

343
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,560
Are you majoring in archaeology

344
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,860
or criminal investigation?

345
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,120
Do you know

346
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,980
oh, the delicious soup is ready.

347
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,950
It smells so good.

348
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,750
The water is out.

349
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,530
That's great.
-Sam.

350
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,440
Don't solve the case, have the soup quickly

351
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,270
-The fat guy...
- Hey!

352
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,030
Come with me. Go, please.

353
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,640
Come and have some soup.

354
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, aren't you being civilized?

355
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,930
- Glasses.
- Hey.

356
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,790
From now on, if you have any questions,

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,100
you can ask her

358
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,650
he knows everything.

359
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,620
Hey!

360
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,220
Ms. Yang, let me get the soup.

361
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,650
Look at your mouth.

362
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
You almost spilled the beans

363
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,300
you almost spilled the beans.

364
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,930
I look down on the fake foreigner.

365
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,040
He's just showing off every day.

366
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,680
What's there to show off?

367
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,670
You should thank him first.

368
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,630
If he hadn't interrupted us and said the soup was ready,

369
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,540
how can you take the next line?

370
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,550
How will you step down?

371
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,200
I thank her

372
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,840
just because you're on good terms with her,

373
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,740
If I call you Old Hu,

374
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,580
I must thank her.

375
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,150
You have a problem with your stance right now.

376
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,400
Very serious.

377
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,880
I think

378
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,360
shirley Yang is beginning to suspect

379
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,660
who we really are.

380
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
Drink more and replenish your vitamins.

381
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,410
Are you suspecting us?

382
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Suspect what?

383
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm still suspecting her.

384
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,700
We will be

385
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,760
we can be considered as tomb raiders.

386
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,740
What does she do?

387
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,160
I have a question mark here.

388
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,400
The American has a motive!

389
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,170
She told you she is a photographer.

390
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,350
What photographer?

391
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,830
That's a photographer.

392
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,800
OK. Photographer.

393
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,810
She knows about fire ladybug,

394
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,870
she also knows about the desert army ants.

395
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,190
Did she know too much?

396
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
She is not only a photographer

397
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,570
she is also a reporter,

398
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
photographer.

399
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,500
We've got plenty of places to go.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,760
You're a man of the world.

401
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,560
Then why is she so good at shooting?

402
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,910
A female?

403
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,040
How to use a gun better than I do.

404
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,120
How to explain that?

405
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,980
How to shoot accurately?

406
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,280
He can't control shooting in America.

407
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,140
They're always out

408
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,550
to practice marksmanship for self-defense.

409
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,600
That's reasonable.

410
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,530
You surely have something wrong.

411
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,110
Are you mesmerized by this beautiful girl?

412
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,580
Do you think she's beautiful?

413
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes, he is.

414
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,300
That's good.

415
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,120
What a mess.

416
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,980
Can you just do as I said?

417
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,910
Lower your voice.

418
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,250
Can you think about it according to my thought?

419
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,500
There's one thing

420
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,160
I can't believe you didn't notice it.

421
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,010
What happened?

422
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,420
The Kunlun glacier.

423
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
She said she went to find her father.

424
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,570
But did she look for him when she went down to the glacier?

425
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,280
Not at all.

426
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,070
She's occupied with the notebook.

427
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,030
She will never

428
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,210
she didn't study it.

429
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,240
When you two talked that night,

430
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,510
did she tell you that

431
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,250
she wronged her father.

432
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,350
Oh, how understandable she was to her father.

433
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
She was just saying that.

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Did she do that?

435
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
They're the feelings

436
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,230
her father?

437
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,190
Haven't you ever thought about these things?

438
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,530
And you eavesdropped on us?

439
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,230
I certainly thought about it.

440
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,120
According to a long observation,

441
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,420
I believe that

442
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,560
she didn't have bad intentions.

443
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,870
I can't tell if her intention was that,

444
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,140
but I just didn't think she was being honest with us.

445
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,790
You know what?

446
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,600
I even doubt her father's dead.

447
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,400
I even suspect that she's...

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,170
Is probably a secret agent

449
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,420
sent by the US.

450
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,360
Ostensibly,

451
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,700
we support the archaeological team.

452
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,380
As they come to our country

453
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,040
to steal our cultural heritage.

454
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,420
What secret agent?

455
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,880
That's too profound.

456
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,700
I admit that

457
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,350
I admit that she did not...

458
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,080
She didn't tell us everything.

459
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,010
She's not obligated to do so.

460
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,450
I'm sure she has her reasons.

461
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,120
She didn't want to harm us.

462
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,730
Old Hu,

463
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,680
how come you were bewitched

464
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,930
of her spell?

465
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,510
Fatty!

466
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,040
She had saved me.

467
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,360
I won't believe that

468
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,840
she is that type of person.

469
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,380
How can you do that?

470
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,870
I've saved you, too.

471
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,080
Why don't you believe me?

472
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay, just like what you said,

473
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,580
I believe you. She is a special agent.

474
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,390
Then... Then what else?

475
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,360
Okay, then I'll let the past...

476
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
The past.

477
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,940
Anyway, I'm telling you.

478
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,240
Don't let her

479
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,290
In the future.

480
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,030
And relax.

481
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,260
Don't give me that

482
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,840
you're the only one

483
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,430
I admit it

484
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,930
try another person.

485
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,860
I would've ripped her head off.

486
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,840
When the ball kicks me

487
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,490
don't.

488
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,400
You want to rip her head off?

489
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,050
The money we paid this time

490
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,180
who to ask for it?

491
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:57,930
Right.

492
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,400
Then spare her life first.

493
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,960
And let her off the hook?

494
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,360
Go back.

495
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,200
The soup is getting cold.

496
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,200
Hold on!

497
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,320
- Fatty!
- Hey! - What?

498
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,700
Something is wrong.

499
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,510
What's up

500
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,660
look at the divination with the arrangement of the stars.

501
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,800
I read Feng Shui to

502
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,970
In the Sixteen-character Feng Shui Technique

503
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,170
In the Yin and Yang Feng Shui.

504
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,930
This is no ordinary land.

505
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,280
It's a rare treasure.

506
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,940
Come back to life.

507
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,670
Come on.

508
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,310
Where have you two been?

509
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,410
The soup is getting cold.

510
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:04,960
Please get out of the way.

511
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,870
That's not important

512
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,120
professor Chen

513
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,650
It's my place

514
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,040
there is also some horse milk wine.

515
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,820
I will bring it out to everyone to taste.

516
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,670
Hu,

517
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,180
what did you find?

518
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,920
I'm not sure yet.

519
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,030
Can you tell anything?

520
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,100
Professor

521
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
professor Chen

522
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,530
there should be a tomb here

523
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,400
where is it?

524
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,390
Giant star, left auxiliary star, and right bi star.

525
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,730
Three shining stars.

526
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,020
Arranged into a triangle,

527
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,120
the central sun star, the taiyin star, and appear

528
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,970
what a good team!

529
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,080
Tell us something

530
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,100
that we can understand.

531
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,050
And they're in the middle

532
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,220
It corresponds to

533
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,600
this well

534
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,240
that well

535
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,590
little Hu,

536
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,590
are you sure there's a tomb in this well?

537
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,190
According to my Star Feng Shui,

538
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,240
I can't be wrong.

539
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,680
OK.

540
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,210
There is the sound of running water.

541
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,340
It should be an underground river down there.

542
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,250
With that much water

543
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,580
shouldn't there be a tomb?

544
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,200
It should still be dry.

545
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,490
I don't understand. I'm talking nonsense.

546
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,090
You can't say that.

547
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,350
Our study of the culture of the Western Regions

548
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,370
Is still lacking.

549
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,200
Besides, the Western Regions are different from the Central Plains.

550
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,280
There are all possibilities.

551
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,870
Did you hear that, Fatty?

552
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,640
That's possible.

553
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,930
That Chu Jian

554
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
go prepare the stuff.

555
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,590
I'll go check it out.

556
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,530
Alright, no problem.

557
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,290
- Come on.
-Let's go. -Come on.

558
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,180
Outside our experience.

559
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,020
Hu, I'll go down with you.

560
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,210
-No, I'll go and have a look.
-What's the situation now?

561
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,350
We can tell you when we need it.

562
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,050
There are so many men.

563
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,920
How could Hu ask a woman to leave?

564
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,330
He must be distressed.

565
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,050
- Leader Hu.
- Take it.

566
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,590
Store them in a safe place later.

567
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,060
You should search for the tomb down the mine.

568
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,620
That's right

569
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,000
- Professor Chen!
-Oh.

570
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,000
Although I'm not sure

571
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,910
I can find something,

572
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,910
but you might find something unexpected.

573
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,080
Right.

574
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,360
Hu,

575
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,470
we are right to come to you.

576
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,320
Please wait!

577
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,760
You guys got off?

578
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,610
And found the tomb.

579
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,670
What do you want?

580
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,290
Go in and have a look if you have found them.

581
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,250
After that,

582
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,960
there's value in it.

583
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,180
Then I should do research.

584
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,990
I don't understand what you're saying.

585
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,570
Let's put it this way.

586
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,880
When we find any treasure,

587
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,930
you can start digging.

588
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,630
You mean that, right?

589
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,200
You can understand it that way.

590
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,180
Wait, I'm not finished.

591
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,240
You're tomb robbing?

592
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,180
Hey,

593
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,160
we're archaeology and research.

594
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,790
We specialize in

595
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,150
western culture.

596
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,500
We have another mission today

597
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,150
we need to find the tomb.

598
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,700
I don't know about your scientific research.

599
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,180
I don't know

600
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,020
I told you that

601
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,850
If it's of value,

602
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,810
It must be dug up.

603
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,960
We can't let it lie on the ground forever.

604
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,580
That's right.

605
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,860
They are tomb robbing.

606
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,680
Father

607
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,120
professor Chen is from

608
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,420
of the Institute of Archaeology

609
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,780
didn't I give you

610
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,980
the letter of introduction.

611
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,520
So you're tomb robbing by the state?

612
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,960
What's with the smile?

613
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,170
So this is

614
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,280
that's your job?

615
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,760
If I knew this,

616
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,520
how much will I pay?

617
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,600
I wouldn't have come.

618
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,800
You can't go down there.

619
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,490
I don't agree! I disagree!

620
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,290
Father.

621
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,560
I told you that

622
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,550
they are.

623
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,600
Explain it clearly?

624
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,860
Don't be anxious, sir.

625
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,640
Listen to me. Take your time.

626
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,750
We excavated those tombs

627
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,860
to protect them.

628
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,140
Right?

629
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,990
So that the culture of the Western Region

630
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,050
for the people,

631
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,740
right?

632
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,100
Tomb robbing cases in Xinjiang

633
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,280
It is often seen

634
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,240
even foreigners secretly dig in.

635
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,930
After liberation,

636
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,370
after the liberation.

637
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,390
If the government doesn't do anything about it,

638
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,970
these precious things will be lost

639
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,720
will be taken by bad people.

640
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,500
Don't you think so?

641
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,440
Honey,

642
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,830
we used these treasures

643
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,200
for protective excavation

644
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
Instead of destructive robbing.

645
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,570
There's a difference.

646
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,000
We would never do

647
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
betray our ancestors.

648
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,430
Don't worry.

649
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,050
I don't understand what you're saying.

650
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,280
It's been so many years.

651
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,440
You know what?

652
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,320
I've met a lot of bad guys.

653
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,210
Old Man.

654
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,480
I don't like to hear that.

655
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,210
Didn't you just say that

656
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,400
we are all good people?

657
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,670
Right.
-Right. Right.

658
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,640
Isn't that right?

659
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,560
- Old Hu!
-Oh!

660
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,370
Come here.

661
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,310
Honey, come here.

662
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,980
Well, just now...

663
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,280
Are you telling the truth?

664
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,220
What's up

665
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,680
the black donkey's hoof and the Mojin Talisman

666
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,060
the Mojin Amulet.

667
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,710
I think...

668
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,700
Why are you

669
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,610
why are you in such a hurry

670
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,480
In such a hurry.

671
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,520
Certainly.

672
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,480
How can you

673
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,720
how could you come here in person?

674
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,610
You know what?

675
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,300
I've packed everything

676
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,880
you need.

677
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,880
Great!

678
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,650
Let's go after packing up.

679
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,050
Hey.

680
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,780
- Hey.
-OK.

681
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,090
Little Chu.

682
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,450
It's not that deep.

683
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,440
I'm going down to the bottom.

684
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,290
You should be able to feel it.

685
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,880
Yes

686
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,640
he's so long-winded.

687
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,300
We're all here. Don't worry.

688
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,120
Enough.

689
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,130
Alright.

690
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,620
- Come on.
- Here you go.

691
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,310
Just in case.

692
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,070
Just in case.

693
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,330
Let Miss Yang rest assured.

694
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,340
Shut up!

695
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,410
Thank you.

696
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,260
Comrades,

697
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,580
wait for the news of my victory.

698
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,520
Come on, Brother Hu.

699
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,610
Give me your hand.

700
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,080
Be careful

701
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,330
a little bit.

702
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,310
- Put it in.
- Put it!

703
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,540
- Put it in.
- Put it in.

704
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,560
- Put it in.
- Put it in.

705
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,310
Play it again!

706
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,120
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

707
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,260
Put it down.

708
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,590
Slowly.

709
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,760
Chu, slow down.

710
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,760
Hu, are you alright?

711
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,640
Hu, give us a signal.

712
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,270
What's up?

713
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,820
Don't make a fuss if you don't mind.

714
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,610
Hu said he's fine.

715
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,360
Hu, are you alright?

716
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm fine.

717
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,590
Slowly.

718
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,800
Don't play it too fast.

719
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,560
- Slowly.
-Slowly.

720
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,630
- Keep playing it. Go on.
- Slowly.

721
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,090
-Don't argue. -Who do you listen to?
- Come on! Hurry up!

722
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,610
Slowly.

723
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,690
Listen to Miss Yang. Slow down.

724
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,410
Put...

725
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,060
Going forward,

726
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,440
peering through a gap,

727
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,730
to see more clearly.

728
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,770
My bravery

729
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,570
with my courage

730
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:54,570
be together.

731
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:02,600
In my heart,

732
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,520
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

733
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,360

But doesn't care

736
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,250
the result.

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,360
Trapped in the present

739
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,210
down the unknown river

With full stomach,

744
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,390

Giving me sweet words

but lying to me.

749
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,310
You'd climb to Heaven...

750
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,860
And hides again.

751
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,200
Looking young.

752
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,160
And grey overnight.

753
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,050
Down the river

754
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,790
overnight, my hair turns grey.
