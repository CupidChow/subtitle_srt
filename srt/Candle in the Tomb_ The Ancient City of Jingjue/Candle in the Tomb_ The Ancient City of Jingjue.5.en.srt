Old Hu!

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,500
Old Hu!

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,180
Beat him to death!

8
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,880
Beat him to death!

9
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,250
Come on.

10
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,150
Come on. Hurry up.

11
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,630
Climb up, Yingzi.

12
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,380
Hurry up, Brother Hu.

13
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,270
Hu, give me your hand.

14
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,960
Hurry!

15
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,640
Did she die?

16
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,780
She died on fire.

17
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,540
Old Hu,

18
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,330
I thought I wouldn't see you marry

19
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,210
see your wife forever.

20
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,340
Uncle, don't you expect me to be good?

21
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,010
Just wait.

22
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,890
I must marry a foreign wife for you.

23
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,470
You keep your promise.

24
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,230
You have my word.

25
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,760
Brother Fat,

26
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,900
I really want to tell the old branch secretary

27
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,120
about you crying.

28
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,430
Don't tell him.

29
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,990
Tell him, and the whole village will know.

30
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,700
Come on, Yingzi.

31
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,040
That's right.

32
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Go back and tell your old branch secretary

33
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,930
yes, we must let the whole village know

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
look at yourself.

35
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,420
Both of you blessed us

36
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,970
and your blessing.

37
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,130
You protected us.

38
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,070
I hope you two

39
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,280
can go to the Western Paradise soon.

40
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,370
That's predestined.

41
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,130
That's all I can do for you.

42
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,780
He is insatiable when he wants something.

43
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,380
Is not a good child.

44
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,400
You two kids from ancient times

45
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,610
-No, that's not right. -I'll repeat it.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,330
My dear ancestors,

47
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,600
It's a pity that

48
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,770
you don't live in a civilized, democratic,

49
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,380
full of sunshine,

50
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,500
I didn't realize that the society is full of love.

51
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,120
But don't be too sad.

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,240
Your fate will come eventually. Don't forget it.

53
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,770
All things can't be calculated in the hit.

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,190
People do when they die.

55
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,180
But those are limited.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,520
Or there's no coffin to bury you

57
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,750
and no incenses to worship you.

58
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,230
We have smoke, right?

59
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,780
The ancient ancestors didn't smoke.

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,510
I used cigarettes to worship them.

61
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,770
Why is this here?

62
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,790
Stop assembling it.

63
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,210
When did you get this?

64
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,200
Did I take it when I attacked the red hairy monster?

65
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,300
You shouldn't have taken it

66
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,160
why did you take this?

67
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,880
I didn't.

68
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,260
He didn't. I was a witness.

69
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,720
That we'd been together all the time.

70
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,640
That's strange.

71
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:19,840
What?

72
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,380
I put them back.

73
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,120
What's the matter?

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,780
It must be gratitude.

75
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,300
You two risked your lives

76
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,420
to bring them out.

77
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,570
Should be

78
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,180
as the saying goes, good goes with evil.

79
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,060
Tell me about it, right?

80
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,970
Our tomb is so simple.

81
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
These two young ancestors treated us so well.

82
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,980
We have to make it better.

83
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,710
That's right.

84
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,220
Get it ready.

85
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,910
Come on.

86
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,130
There are more over here.

87
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,330
Come on.

88
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,710
Come on.

89
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,900
Alright.

90
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,100
Thank you two.

91
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,930
Thank you for saving us.

92
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,780
You two just have a good rest here.

93
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,160
Please leave.

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,150
Please leave.

95
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,580
What a poor thing. We can't wait for daylight.

96
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,080
Look at yourself.

97
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,210
Watched it a hundred times.

98
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
That's enough.

99
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,460
Stop eating it.

100
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,060
Give it to me.

101
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,420
Why would I give it to you?

102
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,540
I have to keep it safe.

103
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,340
Yingzi,

104
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,080
we have things to do.

105
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,160
When we get there,

106
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,090
we'll head for the county.

107
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,700
What? You won't go back?

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,620
Not going back?

109
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,700
We have urgent things to do.

110
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
How can I do that?

111
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,680
My secretary told me

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
take you back.

113
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,260
Otherwise, I won't complete the mission.

114
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,350
Yingzi,

115
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,850
didn't your father tell you to be flexible?

116
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,140
Not to admit death.

117
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,000
- Fat Bro, it's not... - No.
-Young Zi.

118
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,530
If we go to the Japanese garrison,

119
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,540
do you remember the way?

120
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,290
No problem. I'm a good hunter.

121
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,590
As you can see,

122
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,100
there are a lot of supplies

123
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,800
there are generators and other things.

124
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,600
Everyone in the village would need them.

125
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,350
Didn't they burn it all?

126
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,080
It's the main chamber.

127
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,520
The warehouses in the fortress are insulated.

128
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,220
It's not a big problem.

129
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,260
When will you come back?

130
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,220
We'll come back as soon as we finish our business.

131
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,060
Really?

132
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,970
Of course,

133
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
we have to take our folks

134
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,550
to get rich together.

135
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,180
Come on.

136
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,300
Come on.

137
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,900
Come on.

138
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,140
Don't forget that

139
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
I still owe you a meal.

140
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
Okay. We can eat it when we come back.

141
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,570
- Come.
-Go.

142
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,390
No, I need to lower the price.

143
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,530
Alright.

144
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,170
He thought the price is a little expensive.

145
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,540
He really wants to buy it.

146
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,870
Please give him a real price.

147
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,990
You don't stand for that!

148
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,120
You're always defending him.

149
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,950
Tell him that the price is absolutely fair.

150
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,460
He said the price can't go any lower.

151
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,640
I think you can negotiate more.

152
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,500
His decision?

153
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,020
Please wait.

154
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,640
Maybe I can accept you.

155
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,340
She's coming.

156
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,600
Uncle Hu,

157
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,320
uncle Fat.

158
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,670
Have a seat.

159
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,450
I have something to discuss.

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,940
Look, there are more customers!

161
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,320
How about this?

162
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
Go back and think about

163
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,350
think twice then.

164
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,950
I don't worry about buyers.

165
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,540
He said that he has another buyer.

166
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,090
It's OK.

167
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,700
It's good.

168
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,080
Great!

169
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Yes, old friend.

170
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,260
An old friend?

171
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,400
Come here.

172
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,040
Handle and release with care.

173
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,310
Welcome.

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,260
Come on.

175
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,640
-Bye.
-Bye bye.

176
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,640
See you then.

177
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,610
I'm not open for business for a long time.

178
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,010
These foreigners

179
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,800
who stole two fake jars.

180
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
Please have a seat.

181
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,080
In the year of Boxer, the Eight Powers Allied Forces entered Beijing

182
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,350
when the Eight Powers Allied Forces entered Beijing in the Boxer Rebellion.

183
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,090
Did you do the duty for Heaven today?

184
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,900
That's right.

185
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,100
When Huo Yuanjia defeated Russian strong men,

186
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,940
but now our Master Jin

187
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,180
taking the ill-gotten wealth of the foreigners and bringing honor to the country.

188
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,040
Okay. Don't make me shabby.

189
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,460
You two are real people. I give in.

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,420
I want to show you something.

191
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,320
Look, the whole country has known it.

192
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,820
Niu Xinshan found a fortress of Japanese Guandong Army

193
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,960
your former party secretary is more conscious.

194
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,910
Hand it over to the State

195
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,960
did you bring anything good home?

196
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,290
Just to broaden your horizon.

197
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,300
I brought back two jade stones.

198
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,190
Give me some.

199
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,610
I know your temper well.

200
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,410
Let me get straight to the point.

201
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,610
They are just mediocre in appearance.

202
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,540
At least they're worth some money.

203
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,480
Both of you must have poured it out

204
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,380
general's tomb in Jin Dynasty.

205
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,880
Why do you say that?

206
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,110
In ancient times, this moth is a symbol

207
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,570
a symbol of sacrifice in ancient times.

208
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,090
And brave the fire bravely.

209
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,340
They even plunge themselves into the flames even when they know they'll die.

210
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,420
The ancients admired the spirit of these moths highly.

211
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,640
And used these moths to make accessories

212
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,340
as rewards for military achievements.

213
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,280
It is such a great honor for him.

214
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,310
Master Kim, we don't understand what you say.

215
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,300
I just want to know

216
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,560
are worth.

217
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,190
Don't worry, Uncle Fat.

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,150
I'll estimate the bottom price for this couple.

219
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,120
Based on the current situation,

220
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,120
30,000 to 40,000.

221
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,700
Of course, it's higher

222
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,540
It can be higher abroad.

223
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,320
This is the best market in our country.

224
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,500
To find a suitable buyer.

225
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,500
May be higher.

226
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,640
But I don't know how much.

227
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,640
It depends on the circumstances.

228
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,280
You all know

229
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,880
antique toys are sold at random.

230
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,800
They are not like white sugar briquettes.

231
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,270
To pay as much as you need.

232
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,250
If you come across a target

233
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,450
you can ask for a higher price.

234
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,740
Otherwise, no one would buy the best thing.

235
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,760
Not to be worth a hair

236
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,400
we want to sell it as soon as possible.

237
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,250
You find us a buyer as soon as possible.

238
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,300
So, if you two trust me,

239
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,380
I'll take 40,000 for this pair of jade.

240
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,040
Leave them with me.

241
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,630
If I find any suitable ones, I'll sell them.

242
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,570
The money is mine.

243
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,920
Put it with me if you can't sell it.

244
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
I won't lose money.

245
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,300
Alright?

246
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,890
Old Hu,

247
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,240
that's great.

248
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,940
I really like your straightforward people.

249
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,180
We've been in the past.

250
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,280
I was wrong.

251
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,950
We are all brothers from now on.

252
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,450
If there's any good stuff,

253
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,020
you should come to me right away.

254
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,260
I'll help you find a buyer.

255
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,010
I'll make it worth your while.

256
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:49,960
What about

257
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,640
of course

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,780
master Kim,

259
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,460
you can't find another one

260
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,910
In this world.

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,870
Well, everyone has his own expertise.

262
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,350
We're not as good as you in these things.

263
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,340
But you can't fool us either.

264
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,450
Yes, Master Kim.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,160
Tell us what

266
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,060
what is the most valuable thing on the market now?

267
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,790
Porcelain?

268
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,180
What do foreigners call our China?

269
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,620
Chinese porcelain

270
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,570
porcelain is always the hottest.

271
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,520
The foreigner just now

272
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,480
two thousand dollars

273
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,420
got two fake porcelain wares from Ming and Qing Dynasties.

274
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,340
And they're still bouncing around.

275
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,230
How many?

276
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,270
Two thousand.

277
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,680
You know what?

278
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,220
When our ancestral porcelain was at the height of its popularity,

279
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,810
even the most advanced technology now can't compare.

280
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,230
Master Jin, it was made in Song Dynasty

281
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,720
how much does it cost?

282
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,450
It ranges from tens of thousands.

283
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,740
Then

284
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,710
this big?

285
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,090
How big is it?

286
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,140
This big?

287
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,700
I haven't seen Priceless.

288
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,070
Old Hu,

289
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,860
In order to smash that stupid thing,

290
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,600
In order to get that thing back.

291
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,020
That's not porcelain, Fatty.

292
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,020
How much is pottery?

293
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,770
Pottery is worthless.

294
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,960
That's better.

295
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,560
I have another question for you, Master Kim.

296
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,920
How much the mask

297
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,200
of the zongzi is worth?

298
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,510
Where is it?

299
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,450
Bring it out and have a look.

300
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,380
All black.

301
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,940
Did you pick it?

302
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,830
It's gold.

303
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,220
Anything with black rust

304
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,650
are all precious metals.

305
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,360
This thing alone is valuable.

306
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,640
Why did you throw this away?

307
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:04,970
Fatty!

308
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,840
Why are you stomping on me?

309
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,400
I think those are copper.

310
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,560
Copper is valuable too.

311
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,720
You're right.

312
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,060
When I pick up my things next time,

313
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,200
to collect my stuff later?

314
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,240
Be clear about the door,

315
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,500
It costs over 100,000 yuan for the trip.

316
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,440
That doesn't matter.

317
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,600
However,

318
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,700
I can't go out with you

319
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,570
to gain some knowledge.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,590
In the future,

321
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,170
In the future.

322
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,530
It's true that

323
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,450
that suits you well.

324
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,460
What's the matter?

325
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,300
Recently, our country

326
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,550
Is organizing an archaeological team to Xinjiang.

327
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,420
The leader is a professor surnamed Chen.

328
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,520
Who is very familiar with my dad.

329
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,910
They often discussed antique together.

330
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,670
The old man had requested

331
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,970
to go to Xinjiang

332
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,580
to investigate, excavate and preserve cultural relics.

333
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,930
You know our country is poor.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,390
An American wants to

335
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,090
will sponsor this field trip.

336
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
They lack someone

337
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,930
someone who knows how to spot the gold

338
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,580
I'll tell them about your

339
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,320
your background,

340
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,230
they're very interested in it.

341
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,530
Now, I wonder if you two

342
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,930
Interested in this project.

343
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,160
Of course, it would be a good opportunity.

344
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,010
And I'm sure you can learn a lot

345
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,440
you can definitely learn a lot.

346
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,110
But there's one thing I can't figure out.

347
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,660
An American.

348
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Why did he fund our Chinese archaeological team?

349
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,020
Could it be something fishy?

350
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,570
That's right.

351
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,880
The Americans are active Lei Feng.

352
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,140
Why would they invest if they had no good?

353
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,490
This is the case.

354
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,120
The investor

355
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,190
Is an American Chinese woman.

356
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,120
Her father is a Wall Street tycoon

357
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
he is very rich

358
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,910
the father and daughter really like archaeological exploration.

359
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,410
A few years ago,

360
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,750
this old man followed a Chinese expedition

361
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,450
to Xinjiang

362
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,080
he was particularly interested in the exquisite culture of the Western Regions

363
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,040
the exquisite culture of the Western Regions.

364
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,400
But he never came back.

365
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,670
No one returned.

366
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,450
The local garrison has been searching for them. They didn't find them.

367
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,750
Then the woman

368
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,740
she inherited a large legacy from the old man.

369
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,090
He probably wouldn't give up.

370
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,000
Without giving up.

371
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,600
As much as possible

372
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
and look for his loved ones again.

373
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,380
We Chinese.

374
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,480
Where are traditional ideas?

375
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,600
And left to rot in the desert.

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,480
It's not a big deal, right?

377
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,460
That's a valid reason.

378
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,260
The key is that they are well paid.

379
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,780
The pay is attractive.

380
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,120
And beautiful.

381
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,970
Beautiful.

382
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,930
Old Hu,

383
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,660
I'll get you the money.

384
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,780
A beautiful one.

385
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,440
40,000. Count it.

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,260
I'll write down the professor's address.

387
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,530
Mention me when you see him.

388
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,940
I said two more portions of mutton.

389
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,540
Alright.

390
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,520
-Two more servings of mutton.
-It's almost enough.

391
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,390
Can we finish so many?

392
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,600
What are you afraid of?

393
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,020
We are rich now.

394
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
In the future, when we eat out,

395
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,940
here is your mutton.

396
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,050
Alright.

397
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,130
That's enough.

398
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,780
Use it slowly.

399
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,220
Slow down. Slowly.

400
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,070
Look at your eating. No one is fighting with you.

401
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,820
That the game in the mountain is for free.

402
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Eating meat is not enough.

403
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,240
Besides, game is game,

404
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,440
Instant-boiled mutton is hot pot.

405
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,470
That's the same thing.

406
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,580
- Come on. - Cheers.

407
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,260
Fat Bro,

408
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,630
I have an idea.

409
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,860
Go on.

410
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,600
I want to give them a share.

411
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,240
We give that to each other.

412
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,040
What would I say if it's just us?

413
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,960
I wanted to

414
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,540
first, your share.

415
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,920
This time, Yingzi risked his life

416
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,260
to us,

417
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,970
we need to share her.

418
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,250
Yingzi was having a hard time.

419
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,660
We should give her one.

420
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,740
Then the secretary

421
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,170
we need to give him some

422
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,740
to give it to the folks.

423
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,210
We promised that

424
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
that we would lead everyone to become rich.

425
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,830
We can't just talk without practicing.

426
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,620
Even if we can't repair the road with this amount of money,

427
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,950
we can at least pull the wire.

428
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,380
No matter how much it is, please show us.

429
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,870
That's right, we should let the villagers have some good.

430
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,440
We were immature back then.

431
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,850
We brought trouble to the folks.

432
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,140
They really treat us as their own children.

433
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,680
You know that people from the city

434
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,790
are not used to the countryside food.

435
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,540
He saved the good things for us.

436
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,130
Now think about it, he's really great.

437
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,340
Also, I want to send the

438
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,920
I want to send the shares to the families of my comrades.

439
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,760
My parents have the country to support them.

440
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,420
I only need to feed myself.

441
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,310
Including those who died in the war.

442
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,800
Their parents are old.

443
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,420
And their school fees

444
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,610
and their children's school fees.

445
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,480
Although the state has subsidies,

446
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,900
It's hard for our family

447
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,700
that's very difficult.

448
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,800
So I need to do something for them.

449
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,610
Mr. Hu, you don't want my share either.

450
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,240
Let's set aside some money for our living.

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,350
And wire the rest

452
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,440
to your comrades and families.

453
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,720
My greatest wish

454
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,470
was to be a soldier and fight in wars.

455
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,060
But my father died young,

456
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,160
I never had that chance.

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,420
Old Hu,

458
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,800
please fulfill this wish for me.

459
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
It's also my respect to them.

460
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,260
Fatty, do you want to hear the truth?

461
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,010
Shoot.

462
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,510
You have made so much progress.

463
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,350
Master of you!

464
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,850
Toast you.

465
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,570
Toast you!

466
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,920
There aren't many chances to make money in the future.

467
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,950
That's right.

468
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,380
This time we let the Americans earn the money.

469
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,220
Alright.

470
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,000
(No. 17 Chubag Alley)

471
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,880
Is this the place?

472
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,060
It's written on the Golden Tooth.

473
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,170
17th. Look, this is the place.

474
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,950
There's no sign here.

475
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,330
This is called great seclusion in the market.

476
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,130
In the city.

477
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,780
Everyone should have a sign.

478
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,200
Fatty, let me remind you something.

479
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,170
Don't ever mention being in the tomb.

480
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,450
Don't worry.

481
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,100
Who are you looking for?

482
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,630
Is Professor Chen here?

483
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,730
He's inside

484
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,550
alright.

485
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,850
We learned a lot about archaeology by ourselves.

486
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,200
We've read dozens of books on archaeology alone.

487
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,030
That's right.

488
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,070
We attach great importance to this investigation.

489
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,880
Look at this is our

490
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,720
that we published on archaeology.

491
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,880
Please have a look.

492
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,180
And these.

493
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,950
We haven't brought some with us this time.

494
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,640
Two of our colleagues and the other one.

495
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,080
(Topographic map of Xinjiang's Taklimakan Desert)
See that?

496
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,640
That woman should be

497
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,930
the organizer of this operation.

498
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,690
The cop is honest

499
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,050
he's still young

500
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,970
both of you are not up to our standard.

501
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,390
Let's not waste time.

502
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,710
Come on,

503
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,190
both of us have been prepared

504
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,980
prepared for this.

505
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,920
-Yes, that's right.
-I know.

506
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,580
We can do whatever you want.

507
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,440
But you can't meet our requirements.

508
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,380
I won't see you off.

509
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,360
All right, let's go.

510
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,340
Hello, Professor.

511
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,750
We are...

512
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,980
That's enough.

513
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,960
I know why you have come.

514
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,700
I guess you both know

515
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
the archaeological team is demanding, right?

516
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,410
We're the exception among the exceptions,

517
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,820
the best of the exceptions.

518
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,540
Both of you have experience in desert survival exploration

519
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,600
you still understand the importance of archaeology.

520
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,220
If we don't have the skills,

521
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,620
no one will accept it.

522
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,800
Can you sit down and talk about it?

523
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,800
If you don't have the skills,

524
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,940
If you don't have the ability to be like this.

525
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,560
How could you talk like that?

526
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,060
I'm the one

527
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,620
are you Hu and Wang?

528
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,380
We are

529
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,790
and you are?

530
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,680
My family name is Chen. Chen Jiuren.

531
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,960
Nice to meet you.

532
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,630
Nice to meet you.

533
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,220
Nice to meet you.

534
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,200
This is Wang Kaixuan.

535
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,020
Hello, how are you?

536
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,910
Nice to meet you, too.

537
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,790
This is Professor Hao Aiguo, an archaeological expert.

538
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,320
Let the guests sit down and have a talk.

539
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,370
Yes, Miss Mo.

540
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,790
Please have a seat.

541
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,450
-Please.
-I'm talking. -Let's sit down.

542
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,570
Please.

543
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,510
I think

544
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,550
made it clear to you, right?

545
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,090
Xiao Jin, the eldest son

546
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,000
the Big Golden Tooth

547
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,040
right.

548
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
He also introduced

549
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
your situation.

550
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,020
About you two.

551
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,890
He was a company commander in the PLA

552
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,560
and he took part in the battle.

553
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,320
And also traveled through the desert and glacier.

554
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,640
That's not easy.

555
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,720
You're more than capable

556
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,720
to be the leader of us nerds.

557
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm not worthy of such a honor.

558
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,380
But I did travel to the depths of the desert

559
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,240
to the depths of the desert

560
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,390
and conducted military drills.

561
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,000
But there is one additional requirement

562
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,160
for the team leader.

563
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,280
That is the Star Feng Shui.

564
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,480
Star Feng Shui.

565
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,960
I don't know if you can understand.

566
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,430
Hu, tell them

567
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,440
professor Chen

568
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,920
the Star Fengshui you mentioned

569
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,480
also known as Vault of Heaven,

570
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,200
It is SkyShi Tactic of the 16-character

571
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,870
of the 16-character Yin and Yang Feng Shui.

572
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,260
Is the most obscure chapter.

573
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,880
I just know a little about it.

574
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't think

575
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,000
we won't have two more guests.

576
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,000
No, that's not the case.

577
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,290
Take it easy.

578
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,860
I don't like what you say.

579
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,960
Patriotic? Sit down.

580
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,860
Comrade Wang,

581
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,720
professor Hao didn't target at you.

582
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,270
Yes, in these two days,

583
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,030
there will be people

584
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,340
every day.

585
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,240
He was anxious and angry,

586
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,720
hu, please continue.

587
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,450
All right.

588
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,750
I'll tell you everything I know.

589
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,820
As for feng shui,

590
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,620
Is known as the best in geomatics.

591
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,520
The place of geomantic omen

592
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,060
can be simply summarized as

593
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,300
a place that gathers wind and obtains water.

594
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,380
Later generations

595
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
to geomancy later.

596
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,480
To put it bluntly,

597
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,180
Is a science to analyze the relationship

598
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,960
the relationship between Heaven, Earth and Human.

599
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,250
Let's just focus on that branch today.

600
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,200
Star Fengshui.

601
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,410
Great!

602
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,760
The emperors and nobles of ancient times

603
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,420
attached great importance to their life after death.

604
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,390
They believe that they should be entitled to

605
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,530
should be inherited after their death.

606
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,380
They believe that the world rises and falls from the dragon vein.

607
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,850
That's why the tomb should be in a place with good fortune.

608
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,850
The tomb selected by Emperor Yongzheng before his death.

609
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,540
Is known as

610
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,340
where the beauty of universe gathers,

611
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,180
where the Yin and Yang meet,

612
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,640
the Dragon's Lair is a place of beauty.

613
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,080
All aspects of political situation and qi are prepared.

614
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,550
Emperor Yongzheng read it and approved it.

615
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,320
The mountain and water laws are well organized.

616
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,720
Xun is the most auspicious soil.

617
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,850
He's right.

618
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,880
But it's only half true.

619
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,320
That's because the ancient people

620
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,520
not only the mountains and rivers,

621
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,820
but also the sun, the moon and the stars.

622
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,760
Since ancient times,

623
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
people began to observe the astronomical phenomena

624
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,350
they studied the changes of stars.

625
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,120
Which can predict good or bad luck.

626
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,980
To look for auspicious places,

627
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,560
to search for such places.

628
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,210
The connection between heaven and earth

629
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,570
each other for eighty-four thousand li.

630
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,660
When people's hearts and kidneys are at variance,

631
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,250
Is 8-inch and 4-inch.

632
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,500
Human Body. Gold Wood Fire.

633
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,210
It should be five stars.

634
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,480
Twenty-four stars correspond to the geographical distribution of the world's mountains.

635
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,440
The stars are beautiful and the evil places are auspicious and inauspicious.

636
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,420
Any auspicious soil

637
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,480
It must echo the sun, moon and stars in the sky.

638
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,120
And Black Technique used to determine the location by the circulation of nebulae

639
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,990
Is the most difficult

640
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,130
of all the points.

641
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,010
The sky has 24 days, and the sun has 24 hours.

642
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,340
And every year has 24 solar terms.

643
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,560
Therefore, feng shui has twenty-four directions.

644
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,680
Someone could observe the arrangement of the stars

645
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,590
and compass positioning,

646
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,880
we can find the place we want to find.

647
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,500
However, there are many schools of this kind of star feng shui.

648
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,680
Each has its own rules.

649
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,630
Some of them were contradictory too.

650
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,900
That's well said, Hu.

651
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,390
A thousand years later in the Xinjiang desert,

652
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,450
the oasis city has become a sand sea.

653
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,850
Just like the ancient Kongque River Road has been dried up and hard to find.

654
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,150
Not to mention

655
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,900
In the desert.

656
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,900
Comrade Hu,

657
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,620
since ancient people chose their own lair

658
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,880
based on mountains and water,

659
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,100
In order to find those

660
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,530
along the ancient Silk Road,

661
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,900
using the Star Feng Shui

662
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,600
Is the simplest and most effective way. Isn't it?

663
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,140
Going forward,

664
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,500
peering through a gap,

665
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,540
to see more clearly.

666
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,420
My bravery

667
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,860
with my courage

668
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,180
be together.

669
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,060
In my heart,

670
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,700
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

671
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,660
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

672
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,340
Fate only beckons.

673
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,340
But doesn't care

674
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,900
the result.

675
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,300
Trapped in the present

676
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,180
stuck in the present

677
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,100
down the unknown river

678
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,300
down the river,

679
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,140
the greater the desire,

680
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,340
the more you demand.

681
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,060
With full stomach,

682
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,100
they kept their mouths shut.

683
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
♪ Fate has promised ♪

684
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,180
Will change.

685
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,140
She poured out her love words

686
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,220
but lying to me.

687
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,140
You'd climb to Heaven...

688
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,820
And hides again.

689
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,260
Looking young.

690
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,060
And grey overnight.

691
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,240
Down the river

692
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,130
overnight, my hair turns grey.
