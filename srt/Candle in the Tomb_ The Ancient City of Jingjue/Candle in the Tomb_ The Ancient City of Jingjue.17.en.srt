= Episode 17 =

4
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,460
Why were the floors

5
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,960
are all black?

6
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,260
And spooky.

7
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,240
It is furnished with black stones

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
black stone transported from Cishan.

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,300
It's not strange that

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,860
It's creepy.

11
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,640
The carvings on the stone pillars are true to life.

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,400
This shows the great craftsmanship

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,380
their skills back then.

14
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,600
Professor Chen

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,720
why are the carvings on these stone pillars

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,180
why are they not the same as down there?

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,720
What does that mean?

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,700
I'm also thinking about that.

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,720
But I haven't come up with any ideas yet.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,420
Let's go up and take a look.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,100
We need to find

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,780
the entrance to the queen's tomb

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,300
I know. Don't panic.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,480
-Give your eyes wide and look around.
-How's Ye Ye?

25
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,880
-What are you worried about?
-That's fine.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
There will be more monsters.

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,900
Anything is possible.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,420
We have AK.

29
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,460
Hu, come here quickly.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,420
I have a plan now.

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
Generally speaking,

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,880
shrines are guarded by spirits.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,140
But this place is totally different.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
I think

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,700
the sequence of the stone pillars

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,360
could be a symbol

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
a spiritual symbol.

38
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,240
Has an obvious rank.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,020
From low to high,

40
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,280
and from low to high.

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,640
The front row are animals,

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,820
In the second row are the ordinary people.

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,320
Including all the Hu people from the Western Regions.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,620
Their status is only higher than cattle and sheep.

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,120
Which is equivalent to slavery.

46
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,500
And on this row of stone pillars,

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,860
are big-eyed portraits.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,760
Arranged like this,

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,480
the higher

50
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,700
the higher your status is.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
Old Hu,

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
do I look like the

53
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,540
the strange snake we met in the mountain pass?

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,420
This look

55
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,540
suggests an evil majesty.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,480
It should be a guardian angel.

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,420
It also has

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,120
on its head too.

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,920
It seems that in essence culture,

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,940
the eyes are the source of all power.

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,060
If

62
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,240
that our eyes still have a high place

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,220
In the elite culture?

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,400
That excellent queen's eyes.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
It is possible that

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
that no ordinary person can explain.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
You mean who she sees?

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,880
Will disappear?

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,540
Went to another dimension.

70
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,640
Those are lies

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,920
made up by the ruling class.

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,920
I think

73
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,720
there's another possibility

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
the Queen is an alien.

75
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
You think so too?

76
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,120
He thinks that

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
that you have no other possibility.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,920
Don't laugh at him.

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,940
Well, that's possible.

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,720
After all, there are

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,620
unknown areas,

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,880
just like superstition and science.

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,540
Compared with the past,

84
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,840
we are scientific.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,540
But for the future,

86
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,940
we may be superstitious

87
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,500
are superstitious.

88
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,140
That is why

89
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,340
anything.

90
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,300
From all angles, right?

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,380
Professor.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,180
From my understanding.

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,160
Thank you.

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
I should not thank you.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,000
All the way,

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
It's your mind

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
which helped me open up my mind.

98
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,480
Hey, check this out!

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,860
Why is there nothing here?

100
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,560
Only piers but no pillars.

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,220
Could this temple

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
was built when

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,660
was not finished yet.

104
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,980
It's impossible

105
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,280
according to Professor Chen's analysis,

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
this is the noblest manifestation

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,900
of the essence culture.

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,000
It is next to such an important position.

109
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
It can't be nothing.

110
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,300
I have an idea.

111
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,040
- It's an alien planet.
-Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,380
It's really not what you think.

113
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,280
Hu, please tell me.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Imaginary space?

115
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,420
-What space?
-The imaginary number?

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,760
It is an American boy

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,980
an American boy.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,140
He could contact

119
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,560
a space that cannot be explored.

120
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,140
You said it represents imaginary space?

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,500
Old Hu,

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,860
when did you start to believe

123
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,100
these unknown concepts?

124
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,760
This is also the inspiration

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,280
from Professor Chen

126
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
old Hu,

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,280
you changed your thinking too fast

128
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
professor Chen

129
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,480
to you, I'm Xiao Hu

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,980
you're right.

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,880
You're above the guardian spirits of the fourth row.

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,360
It's an unknown imaginary number space.

133
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,900
The power admired the most by Essence Culture

134
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,080
Is above this space

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,220
and controlling it.

136
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
Is there really such a thing?

137
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,980
A common sense of mankind.

138
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,340
That human beings cannot explain.

139
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,200
Without using the eyes of the queen,

140
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,920
and controls the space

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
Is she really a demon?

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,860
Fortunately, she is dead.

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,580
The balls above are our eyes.

144
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,100
It's like they're looking at us.

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,520
The eyes of the Queen.

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,600
That's impossible.

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
Whose eye is so big?

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
Science still exists

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
there are still

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
uncharted territories

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,420
and inexplicable phenomena.

152
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,560
Let's go and take a look.

153
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,360
Don't move!

154
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,980
Don't touch it

155
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,100
professor Chen

156
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,460
Is this jade?

157
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
They must be.

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,040
It's all natural.

159
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,720
Two thousand years ago,

160
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,660
artificial skills

161
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,940
that my artificial skill

162
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,180
what a surprise!

163
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,240
How much is it worth

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,980
Is worth?

165
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,120
This is priceless, Wang.

166
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,020
It can't be measured in terms of money.

167
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,180
That's right! Priceless!

168
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,600
Money is vulgar.

169
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,900
Sally and Chu.

170
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,020
Take the record.

171
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,600
Hurry!

172
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,080
Don't worry.

173
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,700
Jing Jie State is mainly composed of the Gudong Clan.

174
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,440
They were already extinct.

175
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,680
So

176
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
the origin and background

177
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,340
of this race,

178
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,580
we have always had

179
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,520
on research.

180
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,280
But today,

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,160
wang.

182
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,240
But today,

183
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
we can confirm that

184
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,400
the Ghost Cave Clan uses their eyes as their totem.

185
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,620
This is a major breakthrough

186
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,560
of the ancient Western Regions.

187
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Marvelous.

188
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,020
All we found today

189
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,440
Is of great value to the study

190
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,660
for the study of ancient history and culture.

191
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,460
It's very meaningful.

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
I firmly believe that

193
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,460
there must be underground palaces and underground rivers

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,300
there must be underground palaces and underground rivers.

195
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,320
In other words,

196
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,460
the tomb of Wonderful Queen is underground,

197
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,000
It's very likely

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,980
ancient Western Regions states

199
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,700
often set the tombs of their royal family

200
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,640
In the city.

201
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,840
Unlike the Han people in the Central Plains,

202
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,960
as we do in the Central Plains.

203
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,220
The tomb of Prince Gumo

204
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,540
was built in the Sheng Well in the old city.

205
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,580
Hu said that

206
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,600
here

207
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Is the best treasure trove.

208
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,480
The tomb of Heavenly Empress

209
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,100
Is under the underground palace of the Heavenly Empress.

210
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,040
It's not strange.

211
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,260
There must be a secret passage in the temple,

212
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,360
It leads directly to the imperial palace.

213
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,120
Let's have a look.

214
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,880
Alright.

215
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,120
Fatty!

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,340
What are you doing?

217
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,560
Let go of me now.

218
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,580
I am the one

219
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll research it.

220
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,160
Wang,

221
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,200
It is a precious relic.

222
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,660
How can we destroy it by force?

223
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,080
How can we destroy it?

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,940
Fatty, tell me the truth.

225
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,120
What are you researching?

226
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Hold on.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Look at this.

228
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,000
Isn't this strange?

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,300
This is not round enough.

230
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,520
There's a groove on this.

231
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,120
Fatty.

232
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,760
That jade pendant of yours

233
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,400
Is also heptagon.

234
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,840
This is incredible.

235
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,220
That Wang

236
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,440
tell us about

237
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
about

238
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,260
when I was suppressing bandits in Xinjiang,

239
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,340
to be honest,

240
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,420
he was my dad.

241
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
His old comrade.

242
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
That year, Nia led the army

243
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,620
near Nia in the Taklimakan Desert

244
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,940
she encountered a group of bandits.

245
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,080
After a fierce battle,

246
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
we captured this

247
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
we captured this.

248
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,020
My uncle had it

249
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,680
my uncle gave this jade pendant

250
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,300
as a wedding gift.

251
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,780
No, it's not.

252
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,920
Birthday gift.

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,420
Is your uncle still alive?

254
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,840
Did he tell you anything specifically?

255
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,860
And died when I was little.

256
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,680
I listened to my father about those things.

257
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,700
It seems that there is no way to know it further.

258
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,300
How could such an important relic

259
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
just send it to another place like that.

260
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,840
That's too child's play.

261
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,240
It should be left to the government.

262
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,120
-Wang, what are you doing?
-What are you doing?

263
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,100
What are you doing?

264
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,180
Put it down.

265
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,980
You put it back now.

266
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,600
The big eyeball belongs to me.

267
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll get angry if you take it.

268
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,880
I won't be polite to you then.

269
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,780
Wang, don't do something foolish.

270
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,040
Put it back!

271
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,500
Put it back.

272
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,560
I haven't worn this jade pendant

273
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,980
I have been wearing it

274
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,280
I've been wearing it all the time.

275
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,320
You can see that.

276
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,160
It fits the jade eye perfectly.

277
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,780
It means that it's mine.

278
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,900
This is a relic.

279
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,880
How come it's yours?

280
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,600
Cut the crap.

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,400
Can it move without my pendant?

282
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
- By the rules...
- Fatty.

283
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,260
Cut the crap.

284
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,240
Sa is right.

285
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,840
These are relics,

286
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,320
It must be handed over to the state.

287
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,020
-Right. Exactly.
-That's right!

288
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,180
Professor Chen

289
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
could it be

290
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,140
that leads to the underground?

291
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,240
It's totally possible.

292
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,140
Wang, put the jade eye back.

293
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,380
Little Hu!

294
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,160
Fatty, give it to me.

295
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,140
Be careful, be careful.

296
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,880
Be careful

297
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,060
snakes!

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,820
Move away.

299
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,960
Get out of the way!

300
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,680
Watch out, everyone.

301
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,340
See if there are other snakes.

302
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,140
This is priceless!

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,620
I didn't expect that

304
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,200
It's so not sturdy.

305
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Professor Chen

306
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,280
hu didn't do it on purpose.

307
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,620
Let me see if I can

308
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,520
see if I can glue it together.

309
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,980
It doesn't matter if you break it.

310
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I didn't mean to do it.

311
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,300
Is too broken.

312
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,300
Try to find a way.

313
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,480
Look at this, Sal.

314
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,980
Look at this!

315
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,460
Your eyes.

316
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,700
They're moving!

317
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,760
They're really moving!

318
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,780
Get out of the way!

319
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,040
- Run.
- Run.

320
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,080
Run!

321
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,880
Get behind me!

322
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,620
Run!

323
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,340
This kind of snake is afraid of bright light.

324
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,800
Flashbang.

325
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,720
Beware of monuments!

326
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Beware of historic sites!

327
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,920
Sorry, everyone.

328
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,900
Run!

329
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,600
Hurry.

330
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,300
Am I wrong?

331
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,300
It turned and went back.

332
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,820
Hey,

333
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,100
hu, pushed it back

334
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,140
hu, you knocked it back.

335
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,860
You're so great!

336
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,080
Not at all!

337
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
I even destroyed that priceless treasure.

338
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,260
It's not your fault.

339
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,840
If you want to blame,

340
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
the Black Snake was to blame.

341
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,960
Hu, you're so awesome.

342
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,980
Enough.

343
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,640
- Watch the surroundings.
-Oh!

344
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,680
Professor Chen

345
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,660
we have to leave as soon as possible

346
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,960
hu,

347
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,860
you can't give up now.

348
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,940
I firmly believe that

349
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,840
underground palaces and rivers.

350
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,400
But it's too dangerous here.

351
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,080
I must consider everyone's safety.

352
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,700
Look at that.

353
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,180
On that platform.

354
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,700
On the platform?

355
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,840
It seems higher.

356
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
It seems...

357
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,220
Where are you going?

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,040
Come back!

359
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,540
Shirley, come back

360
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,600
there must be something wrong with the table.

361
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,220
Everyone, stay still!

362
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,440
Fatty, stay here!

363
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,140
Hey!

364
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,480
Hey, Old Hu.

365
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,360
Hu, what kind of tricks are you two?

366
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
Be very careful.

367
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,100
No snake will escape.

368
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,760
Look at that.

369
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,100
It's a little higher than before.

370
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,420
The bottom is round.

371
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,320
Since the platform is separated,

372
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
they should be able to rotate.

373
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,280
Let's do it together.

374
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,040
Don't move

375
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
you and Professor Chen both said

376
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,120
that there's a secret passage

377
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,420
which leads to the underground river and the tomb.

378
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,940
Yes

379
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,520
but if we turn a wrong direction

380
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,920
and trigger some gear,

381
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,800
It'll be another disaster.

382
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,080
What are you doing, Hu?

383
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,790
Professor Chen

384
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,850
I think the layout

385
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,530
of the sixteen stone pillars

386
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,480
Is the same as the Sixteen Dragons.

387
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,390
It secretly matches the number of Giant Clans.

388
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,260
Some ancient tombs of Han Dynasty

389
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,840
by using such mechanisms.

390
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,560
You must have found the traps.

391
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,240
Fatty, stay back!

392
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,520
Tell everyone to step back.

393
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,010
Come on.

394
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,550
Back up.

395
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,030
Believe me?

396
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,930
Believe in me.

397
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,110
Then listen to me.

398
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
Clockwise and counterclockwise.

399
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Not more,

400
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,680
no less.

401
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Well

402
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,910
old Hu, be careful.

403
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,950
Old Hu, don't you regret?

404
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,000
You saved my life just now.

405
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,170
Then I'll pay you back.

406
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,920
What?

407
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,840
I still can't believe

408
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,140
that I am capable of this

409
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,810
I believe in you

410
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,890
come on, one of us.

411
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,260
Fatty.

412
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,900
Hey!

413
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,310
Take everyone to hide behind the pillars.

414
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,800
If there is any problem, run immediately.

415
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Don't hesitate.

416
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,920
They are crazy.

417
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,440
Come on.

418
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,370
Hide behind the pillars.

419
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,190
- Come on.
- Come on.

420
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,880
Come on.

421
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,740
Can you count it?

422
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,140
Of course I can.

423
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,070
Five steps of Shun Yang, one of Yin.

424
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Let's spin.

425
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,820
Hold on.

426
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,840
Can you tell me something

427
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,640
I can understand.

428
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,160
Five strokes clockwise,

429
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,790
turn clockwise.

430
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,450
Let's turn it around.

431
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,740
Come on.

432
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,950
Come on. One more time.

433
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,770
Come on. One more time.

434
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,510
One, two.

435
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,160
- Three.
- Three.

436
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,920
One, two.

437
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,490
Four.

438
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,050
One, two.

439
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,460
- Five.
-Five!

440
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,400
Fatty, come here!

441
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,510
Hey!

442
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,220
No danger. It's safe.

443
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,890
Hu,

444
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,890
your investigation on

445
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,780
on our research trip

446
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,040
In the study of Western Region culture.

447
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,220
Professor Chen, don't praise me

448
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,260
how did you know

449
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,460
about the mechanism?

450
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,770
I feel it's amazing.

451
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,030
Because Miss Yang

452
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,640
she noticed the changes on the platform.

453
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,570
Hu, you're awesome.

454
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,460
How do you know

455
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,610
how many times do I have to turn it around?

456
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,770
The Sixteen Dragons Throughcast

457
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,200
the layout of the secret passage

458
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,120
are handed down by ancient times.

459
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,200
The Giant Clan formation

460
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,950
so it is called Giant Gate

461
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,360
because these traps

462
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,640
were mostly used

463
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,710
on ancient roads.

464
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,360
And these numeration skills

465
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,520
were based on Luo numbers

466
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,240
and the arrangement of stars in the sky

467
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,090
of the universe.

468
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,240
What is a low number?

469
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,890
What is low number?

470
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,680
It's so deep.

471
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,410
You won't be able to understand.

472
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,880
Tell me about it.

473
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,310
How would we know if we didn't tell?

474
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,440
- Right?
- What are you talking about? - No.

475
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,620
Let's go look for water.

476
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,530
I'm almost thirsty.

477
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,490
That's right.

478
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,420
Professor Chen

479
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,940
let's go downstairs

480
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,970
the path inside might be longer.

481
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,110
Be careful, everyone.

482
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,280
OK.
-OK.

483
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,800
Sa, hold on to Professor.

484
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,530
Alright.

485
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,810
Come on.

486
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,380
Slow down, Hu.

487
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,000
Don't worry about me.

488
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,850
Watch your step, everyone.

489
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,430
Alright.

490
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,150
Fatty broke the empress.

491
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,320
That's right, Fatty.

492
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,350
Mind your own business.

493
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,010
If you fall now,

494
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,420
everyone will be rolled.

495
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,140
Hey!

496
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,930
You two have a perfect chemistry.

497
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,200
Shut up.

498
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,020
Be careful

499
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,910
did you notice

500
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,800
the moisture is heavier and heavier.

501
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,630
I agree.

502
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,040
I felt it the moment I came down.

503
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,820
There must be an underground river.

504
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,550
Great!

505
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,970
We'll have water later.

506
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,880
Well

507
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,000
watch your step.

508
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,030
Hey!

509
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,560
Why don't you leave?

510
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,620
Listen to this.

511
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,310
What did you hear?

512
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,490
Didn't you hear the loud water?

513
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,010
We're close to the underground river.

514
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,920
It's getting flooded.

515
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
- Really?
-Right.

516
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,140
Where is there water sound?

517
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,040
Install it again.

518
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,010
Are you deaf?

519
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,640
I really didn't hear it.

520
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,200
Don't make fun of me, Hu.

521
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,910
Get behind you.

522
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,200
Your ears can't bring back your queen.

523
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,480
I really didn't hear it.

524
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,350
I didn't hear that.

525
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,770
What's the matter?

526
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,980
Are you too tired?

527
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,280
Ye Ye, hang in there.

528
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,760
Old Hu,

529
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,960
you didn't hear it. Now you see it, right?

530
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,680
He has seen it.

531
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,370
Finally, I have some water to drink.

532
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,250
Great!

533
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,760
Ye Jie, come and drink more.

534
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,920
Ye Ye, wait a second.

535
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,810
You can't drink it now.

536
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,420
You're dehydrated.

537
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,200
You can't drink like this.

538
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,200
I need some salt for you.

539
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,120
Mr. Hu, here's some salt.

540
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,940
Spring water on the border

541
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,530
miss Yang,

542
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:30,670
thank you.

543
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,730
♪ Pure and clear ♪

544
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,630
Songs of the frontier warm people's hearts

545
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,560
enough. Stop singing.

546
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,300
Come with me and walk around there.

547
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,390
Take a rest?

548
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,390
Miss Yang has said

549
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,230
we need a rest now.

550
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,560
Cut the crap. We'll rest when we get back to Beijing.

551
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Get up now.

552
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,260
- Chu Jian.
-Hey.

553
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,520
You and Sa...

554
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,930
Fill all the water cans.

555
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,660
After that, everyone can have some food

556
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,590
and rest there.

557
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,740
Alright.

558
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,260
Come on.

559
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,760
Professor.

560
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,520
The river flow is heavy

561
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,530
and it's very deep.

562
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,400
Might have just disappeared?

563
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
The Du Dark River

564
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,750
that's right.

565
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,430
The Zidu Dark River has never dried up

566
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,640
It is really a miracle that

567
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,570
It's a miracle of nature.

568
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,370
Little Sa and Little CHU...

569
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,750
You finished?

570
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,520
Take the samples and record them.

571
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,050
Hey

572
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,300
sherry

573
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,140
any new discoveries?

574
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,650
Nothing.

575
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,870
- Miss Yang, here you are.
- Come on.

576
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,370
Thanks.

577
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,610
Sit down and take a rest.

578
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,070
Miss Yang.

579
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,610
There you go.

580
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,280
Thank you.

581
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,920
Ye Ye,

582
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,000
professor.

583
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,200
How is it going, Hu?

584
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,440
If you find anything,

585
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,210
please come with me.

586
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,620
If you find anything,

587
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,840
look at this.

588
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,710
Chu Jian, torch.

589
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,270
Hey.

590
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,610
There's a door.

591
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,690
Right.

592
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,220
This should be a heavy gate.

593
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,670
It must be the entrance.

594
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,110
We need to check it out.

595
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,080
You can wait.

596
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,860
How deep is the water?

597
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,770
We don't know

598
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,640
what's inside.

599
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,690
We can't be blind.

600
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,510
Hu, what are you looking at?

601
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,470
I think there must be booby traps.

602
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,510
Chu Jian.

603
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,790
Flashlight.

604
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,530
It should work here.

605
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,770
Fatty, give me the engineering shovel

606
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,830
and crowbar!

607
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,500
Fatty!

608
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,240
Fatty.

609
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,990
Why did you go there?

610
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,630
Brother Wang.

611
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,380
No need to turn around.

612
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,470
It's not that troublesome.

613
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,640
There's a hidden bridge here.

614
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,650
Look, there's a hidden bridge here.

615
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,250
Back off!

616
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,760
Got it.

617
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,890
The string of hidden stones

618
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,730
they are the same

619
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,680
that I mentioned.

620
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,480
Was opened by someone.

621
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,240
Everybody, stay still.

622
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,580
I'll take a look first.

623
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,140
Hu, this is

624
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,050
come with me.

625
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,620
Old Hu,

626
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,180
go back.

627
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,750
Protect Professor and his fellows.

628
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,050
Be careful.

629
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Slowly.

630
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,420
And went forward.

631
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,800
Peering through a gap,

632
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,090
to see more clearly.

633
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,130
My bravery

634
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,930
with my courage

635
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,930
be together.

636
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:51,960
In my heart,

637
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,880
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

638
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,720
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

639
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,070
Fate only beckons.

640
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,720
But doesn't care

641
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,610
the result.

642
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,720
Trapped in the present

643
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,210
stuck in the present

644
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,570
down the unknown river

645
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,190
down the river,

646
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,650
the greater the desire,

647
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,160
the more you demand.

648
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,750
With full stomach,

649
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,750
they kept their mouths shut.

650
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,560
♪ Fate promised ♪

651
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,140
You'll change your mind.

652
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,590
Giving me sweet words

653
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,170
but lying to me.

654
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,670
You'd climb to Heaven...

655
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,220
And hides again.

656
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,560
Looking young.

657
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,520
And grey overnight.

658
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,410
Down the river

659
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,150
overnight, my hair turns grey.
