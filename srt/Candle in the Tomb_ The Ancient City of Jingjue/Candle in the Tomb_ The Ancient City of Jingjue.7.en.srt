00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,020
Let's pull together.

5
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,770
We must be tight.

6
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,430
OK.

7
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,240
Xiao Chu must be tied tightly.

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,310
Rest assured, Hu.

9
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,840
Miss Yang, let me help you.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,610
Alright.

11
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,170
I'll take care of it, Hu.

12
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,680
Be careful,

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,660
little Chu and Sa...

14
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,400
Take care.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,070
Professor knows about it. Don't worry.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
Mister, is it tight?

17
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,150
OK.

18
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,680
- Fatty!
- Hey!

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,200
Are you alright?

20
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,600
OK?

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,130
Don't pretend.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
You're afraid of heights.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,290
Your fear of heights.

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,520
If you can't find it,

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,550
stay here and wait for us.

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,620
I'm fine, I'll be fine.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,800
I'll follow you to the second place.

28
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,980
Are you sure there is no problem?

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,180
Are you sure he's fine?

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,810
Liu, we have to commission

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,920
as soon as possible.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,720
Alright

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,260
professor Chen?

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,560
Professor Chen, in addition to Ye Yixin,

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,650
If there are any members who can't leave,

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,890
for example, your physical condition

37
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,520
or your mental condition is not ideal.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,530
Hurry up.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,610
It's also necessary

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,910
to do that.

41
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,500
It's fine even if I ask.

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,000
Since you're here,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,560
everyone wants to go down and have a look.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,670
After all, an opportunity like this is very rare.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,310
Maybe it's just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,100
Alright.

47
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,100
Listen up, everyone.

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,700
Keep the emphasis on mind.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,170
And after that,

50
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,520
no one knows what happened.

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,320
You are likely to encounter

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,870
you will encounter strange phenomena and creatures.

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,120
And even remains.

54
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,460
So no matter

55
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,770
whatever happens,

56
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,520
we must stay calm,

57
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,070
change tactics as the situation demands

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,280
don't be too nervous.

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,590
Me and the tall guy

60
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,920
we're the company's sharpshooter.

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll ensure your safe return.

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
Okay. Get ready, everyone.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,870
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Got it.
-Okay. -Good.

64
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,040
Ga Wa, how are you?

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,820
I'm good with it.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,380
Miss Mo, step on the right foot.

67
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,120
Hold your hand tightly.

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,560
Wang.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,210
-Brother Wang, are you all right?
-Are you all right?

70
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,000
Fatty.

71
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,450
Are you alright?

72
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,190
It's fine.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,860
Slow down.

74
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,760
Ga Wa, let's take a look around.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,590
Come on.

76
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,870
Can't you be more careful?

77
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,080
You scared me.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Look at your guts.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,730
Miss Mo.

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,540
Look at her.

81
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,960
How is her?

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
She even wants to fly down here.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,050
I read her.

84
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,020
You're professionally trained.

85
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,280
Come on.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,200
I'll take it off for you.

87
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,320
Do you have any?

88
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,410
Scared?

89
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,360
How come?

90
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,540
To ward off evil spirits.

91
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,160
The corpse.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
There is a corpse over there.

93
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,160
Don't move. Watch out for the fire insects.

94
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,200
A fire ladybug.

95
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,400
Yeah, a ladybug on fire.

96
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,890
Old Hu,

97
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,070
comrade-in-arms?

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,770
No, the clothes are totally different.

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,420
It should be my father's expedition.

100
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,130
They all have similar equipments.

101
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I've seen them before.

102
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,000
How could this person die here?

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,750
It wasn't the fire ladybug.

104
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,610
The ladybugs

105
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,920
what should be ashes.

106
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,350
But in my opinion,

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,120
this is not bad news.

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
At least it can prove

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,380
that the signal you received before

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,360
Is correct.

111
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,510
Yes

112
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,870
captain Hu,

113
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,870
we've seen everything around here.

114
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,150
Only one direction we can go.
- That's right.

115
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,520
Alright.

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Yang is in danger. I'll block her.

117
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
How can you block her?

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,270
I'm a sharpshooter.

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Miss Yang, you're familiar with guns.

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,620
Take this gun.

121
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,030
Pay attention to your safety.

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,190
Alright, I'll walk to the back

123
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,850
professor Chen, how are you?

124
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm alright

125
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,130
thank you for your concern, Comrade Hu.

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,450
The signal of the transmitter is normal.

127
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,120
Alright.

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,110
Let me emphasize again.

129
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,960
Don't get separated.

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,720
Follow the group.

131
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,830
There are many magical places in Kunlun Mountain.

132
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,250
There are many magical things.

133
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,060
Don't make too much noise.

134
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,910
Quiet Please

135
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,750
anyway, I want everyone to be safe.

136
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,560
Pack your things

137
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,350
get ready to go.

138
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,280
- Yes, Your Majesty.
-OK.

139
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,910
Let's be patriotic.

140
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,380
Teacher, I'll do it.

141
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,480
Liu, come here.

142
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,320
There's a signal.

143
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,760
Look, I got the signal

144
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,880
It means Professor Chen and others

145
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,950
should be smooth so far

146
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,590
that's great.

147
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,950
I'll report to the campsite now.

148
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,870
Temporary camp. Temporary campsite.

149
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,800
This is the inspection team. Please answer when you hear me.

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
Roger, temporary camp. Roger.

151
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,610
Inspection team, please speak up.

152
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,760
The inspection team has successfully received

153
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,800
from the archaeological team.

154
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
All is normal now. Over.

155
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,250
Please keep all communications clear.

156
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,040
Roger that.

157
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,320
Inspection team understand.

158
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,140
That's great.

159
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,300
Well begun is half done.

160
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,910
That's right.

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,840
Miss Yang, be careful.

162
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,240
This is the south.

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
This gap should be

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,530
between two mountains.

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,760
This is the east.

166
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,360
Go further and we'll be

167
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,750
the lower part of the glacier.

168
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,640
So many mica.

169
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,130
Is it male or female?

170
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,310
They're not animals, they're crystals.

171
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,520
Micas and crystals usually grow in the same stratum.

172
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,390
Like these.

173
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,070
The color of these micas is very deep.

174
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,080
That means

175
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
were also at a very deep place.

176
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,850
We can see them

177
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,810
we can see them

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
Is because

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
of the crustal movement.

180
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,940
Everyone, keep up.

181
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,800
Ga Wa, watch the back.

182
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,070
Don't worry.

183
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,070
Is it valuable?

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Comrade Ye.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,270
I wasn't able to work at the front line this time.

186
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,320
Sorry?

187
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,370
To be honest, it's a pity.

188
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,020
But everyone is taking care of me.

189
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,160
And worried about my health.

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,870
In fact, for me

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,400
professor Chen

192
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,280
professor Chen to the trip

193
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,940
goes to see us.

194
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,860
Inspection team.

195
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,810
This is the temporary campsite. Please reply upon receipt.

196
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,720
Inspection team, roger.

197
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,920
Please instruct the temporary camp.

198
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,400
Got the latest weather forecast.

199
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
There will be a blizzard in three hours.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,150
Please protect the archaeological team

201
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,240
after they finish the archaeological work,

202
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,760
supervise their evacuation. Over.

203
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,020
Please rest assured at the temporary camp.

204
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,190
We'll follow the order

205
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,500
mission completed. Over.

206
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,920
Slow down.

207
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,840
It sounds like running water.

208
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,090
Could there be an underground river?

209
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Professor.
I've never seen an underground river.

210
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,460
The earth is amazing.

211
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,770
It's so big down there.

212
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,420
To build a secret base here?

213
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,970
Ga Wa, if you don't speak,

214
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,460
no one is treating you as dumb.

215
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,390
Brother Hu,

216
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,560
have you been here before?

217
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll tell you the story

218
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,500
when I'm out.

219
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,720
No need for you to tell me.

220
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,060
I can think of it with my toes.

221
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,340
I'm sure you've been here before.

222
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,480
You're not a normal person.

223
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,630
He can have you.

224
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,790
Your toe? You have another idea?

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,930
The Party teaches us to emancipate our minds.

226
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,370
But you should also seek truth from facts.

227
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,830
Oh, let go of me.

228
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,160
You should treat comrades as warm as spring.

229
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,840
Don't you know?

230
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,560
Cut the crap!

231
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,770
Get to the back!

232
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,320
In the back?

233
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,070
Hu, this is the underground river.

234
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,170
Professor Chen

235
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,690
we may have to

236
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,400
need to cross the river.

237
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,780
Take a rest here.

238
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,880
Fatty and I will take a look.

239
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,780
- Alright.
-OK.

240
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,810
Brother Hu,

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,720
oh, no. Miss Yang is gone.

242
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,720
Didn't I ask you to take care of her in the back?

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,340
Why did you run in front

244
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,320
what are you talking about?

245
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,840
Calm down. Don't panic.

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,830
You two stay alert.

247
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,850
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Right.

248
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,840
Comrade Hu,

249
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
could Miss Yang have

250
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,240
miss Yang?

251
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,300
Could it be aliens?

252
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't be ridiculous.

253
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,860
She's back.

254
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,990
Miss Yang, where were you?

255
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,060
You gave us a scare.

256
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,360
That place was pretty.

257
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,910
So I went and took a few photos.

258
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,220
Or I can't explain to the magazine

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,920
there's no way to explain.

260
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,710
Shirley.

261
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,320
You scared us.

262
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,550
If there is anything in the future,

263
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,040
tell you about it in the future.

264
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,470
Sorry to make you worry.

265
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,310
Are you hiding from us on purpose?

266
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,120
What did you find?

267
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,200
- Nothing.
- That's enough.

268
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,060
As long as you're fine.

269
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,630
Let's take a rest here.

270
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,040
Fatty and I will test the depth of the water.

271
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,620
Alright.

272
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,230
Alright.

273
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,280
Old Hu,

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,630
I think the American chick is fishy

275
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,080
professor Chen and his team

276
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,950
I can understand

277
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,150
but these are

278
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,190
the spoils?

279
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,290
Stop it.

280
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,120
This American girl.

281
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,430
She may be Chinese,

282
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,030
but she's actually an American.

283
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,770
Why must she sponsor

284
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,780
the archaeological team?

285
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,780
There must be a clue.

286
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,000
Listen to me. Don't forget that

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,560
we've only got the deposit.

288
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,680
The bulk of the money is yet to come.

289
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
Don't just think about money.

290
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
Is the water deep?

291
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,210
It shouldn't be.

292
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,550
You know what?

293
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,750
If anything happens to you,

294
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,760
I have to watch this American girl

295
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,670
this American girl.

296
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,730
Give me the ice ax.

297
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,640
Here you go.

298
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,450
Slowly.

299
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,080
Everyone, come here.

300
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,520
What's up

301
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,640
old Hu,

302
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,720
what's this character?

303
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,710
I don't know.

304
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,880
Didn't you see him when you came in the past?

305
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,390
No, I didn't.

306
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,310
But I feel that

307
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,940
he looks familiar?

308
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,460
He looks familiar?

309
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,950
Comrade Wang.

310
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,960
What?

311
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,580
Can you give me

312
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,810
the jade?

313
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,760
That's great.

314
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,030
Let me see...

315
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,330
What are you doing? She's a human!

316
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,290
Where are you holding my hand?

317
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,270
Let me take a look.

318
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,840
Just go.

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,840
Professor.

320
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,860
Why do I feel that the writing on this jade

321
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,640
are almost exactly the same

322
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,500
no. It's almost exactly the same.

323
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,370
These are all Ghost Cave Script.

324
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,300
What Ghost Script?

325
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,560
These scripts are written by the Jing Jie Kingdom,

326
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,300
It's called Ghost Cave Script.

327
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,420
Jingjie State was a state

328
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,160
which was located in the Western Region.

329
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,190
Wang, I remember that

330
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,800
when we first met, you said

331
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,250
I got this jade when I suppressed the bandits

332
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,490
yes. In the Nia Oasis,

333
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,070
I beat the bandits hell.

334
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,160
I even killed a bandit leader.

335
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,890
Stop it

336
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,410
professor Chen

337
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,190
you mean this script

338
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,920
are related to the ancient city?

339
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,160
At least it's the same script.

340
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,240
Professor,

341
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
what kingdom is it from the Western Han Dynasty?

342
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,180
Which means this jade

343
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,520
Is more valuable than Liao Jin's

344
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,610
professor Chen

345
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,200
that is to say,

346
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,290
that place

347
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,450
Is really relevant to

348
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,600
with finding the ancient city.

349
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,970
That's right, Hu.

350
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,950
Our discovery today

351
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,260
will open a new chapter in the archaeology of the Western Regions.

352
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,510
Sherry.

353
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,540
It seems your father detoured the Kunlun glacier

354
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,680
to bypass Kunlun Glacier.

355
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm not interested in the Diary

356
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,860
the diary about Ancient City

357
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,480
look forward to it even more.

358
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,360
Patriotic!

359
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,960
You should lead the students

360
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,210
to record all the words

361
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,250
on the cliff.

362
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,760
OK, OK.

363
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,110
- Little Chu.
-The team leader Hu.

364
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
-Let's hurry up.
-Little Chu. -You take the photo.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
- Keep moving.
-OK.

366
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,100
Go on.

367
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,770
Alright.

368
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:58,960
Alright.

369
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,370
Sam.

370
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,530
Turn off the flash.

371
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,300
Turn it off.

372
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,520
Turn it off soon.

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,230
Inspection team.

374
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,910
You must leave in one hour.

375
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,250
We must evacuate. That's all.

376
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,410
Roger, Inspection Team.

377
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,310
- Fatty.
- Hey!

378
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,670
- Take care of the back.
-Hey.

379
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,460
Slowly.

380
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,100
OK.

381
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,190
Teacher, be careful.

382
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,270
Watch your step.

383
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,500
Slowly.

384
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,110
Chu Jian.

385
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,980
Hold on to the top of your head.

386
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,370
Are you observing me?

387
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,200
Just be frank with me.

388
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,060
I know you came here

389
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,130
for your own reasons.

390
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,560
But I want you to know that

391
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,380
that there are many dangers here.

392
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,570
No matter how hard we try

393
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,870
and try to hope in luck,

394
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,060
you should not ignore the danger.

395
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,340
Please think about them.

396
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,650
Stop thinking about yourself.

397
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,720
Old Hu,

398
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,360
this cave is warmer than the outside.

399
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,130
I thought the water is so cool.

400
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,780
The temperature is surprisingly comfortable.

401
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,280
It's possible that there's frequent crustal activity here,

402
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,710
and a geothermal source.

403
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,760
But that's actually not a good thing.

404
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,080
What do you mean?

405
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,910
No matter what.

406
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,910
The same with other things.

407
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,780
You're afraid of fire ladybugs.

408
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,890
Not only fire ladybugs,

409
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,620
maybe there are other things.

410
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,510
For example,

411
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,850
If piranha is found,

412
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,650
or something?

413
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,040
Don't always create this tense atmosphere.

414
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,710
It's scary enough already

415
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,490
professor Chen, is it alright?

416
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,360
No, we are fine

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
stay still, everyone.

418
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,270
Big guy and I will go check it out.

419
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,330
Come on.

420
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,880
Don't take the photo.

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,950
Old Hu,

422
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,770
what happened

423
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,370
off all the headlights.

424
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,810
Don't direct the flashlight.

425
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,250
Ga wa,

426
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,570
you're in military uniform.

427
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,110
But you're still practicing religion and superstition.

428
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,760
Stand up.

429
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
What the hell is this place?

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
So many people died.

431
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,160
This is the legendary nine-story demon tower.

432
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,510
The nine-story demon tower?

433
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,980
This is the burial form of kings' tombs

434
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,960
of kings in ancient Demon Kingdom.

435
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,940
Professor.

436
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,490
I've read about it in the book before

437
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,580
there's a similar relic of the demon tower

438
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,980
similar to this demon tower.

439
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,940
Right.

440
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,930
It's a pity that Demon Tower

441
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,030
was destroyed by the hero King Gesar

442
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,430
It was destroyed by the hero King Gesar.

443
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,930
This building

444
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,990
It's also a big tomb.

445
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,460
Am I right?

446
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,530
That's right. We've been studying this our whole lives.

447
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
No one has ever seen

448
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,830
no one has ever seen it.

449
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,330
Then there must be

450
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,630
there must be a lot of antiques

451
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,260
not only antiques,

452
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,370
everything is worthwhile.

453
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,000
Shirley,

454
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,830
we are valuable to be here this time.

455
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,570
Maybe your father

456
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,970
just for the nine-storey demon tower

457
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,920
nine Layers of Demons.

458
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,610
Don't disturb them when they sleep.

459
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,240
Who's that?

460
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,780
The dead?

461
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,760
No, it's not.

462
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,960
A fire ladybug.

463
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,120
You mean that kind of insects

464
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,400
that can get angry?

465
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,560
That's right.

466
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,910
We didn't encounter any fire ladybugs

467
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,240
along the way.

468
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,110
I thought I could escape from it.

469
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,840
I didn't expect to encounter their den.

470
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,660
There are lots of blue lights on it.

471
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,720
Are emitted

472
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,750
from that thing.

473
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,530
Yes, that's right.

474
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,000
What is this?

475
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,820
Professor, slow down.

476
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,990
Don't move.

477
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,320
Don't touch it.

478
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,310
Professor.

479
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,610
It should be the ladybug that attacked

480
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,670
miss Yang,

481
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
speak the plain truth

482
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,670
your father's expedition

483
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,930
might have been

484
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,830
I know.

485
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,970
I've prepared for the worst

486
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,220
for the worst.

487
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,470
We have to evacuate.

488
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,430
Hu,

489
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,360
professor Chen

490
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,000
what I meant was

491
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,300
that we have to make it clear.

492
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,580
This place is very dangerous.

493
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,860
We must leave here right now.

494
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,380
Comrade Hu.

495
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
Why are we here?

496
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,900
What is our objective?

497
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
The thing we're looking for

498
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,070
means too much to us.

499
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,440
Now that we're here,

500
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,880
to look for them as much as possible.

501
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,060
Hu,

502
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,620
I hope you can understand.

503
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,680
This is the foundation for generations

504
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,190
have been waiting for

505
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,840
you've been waiting for.

506
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,770
Don't look at me.

507
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,830
You're the boss.

508
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,920
Snow, Shirley, Yang, what are you doing?

509
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,950
Stop!

510
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,230
Don't mind me.

511
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,400
Professor.

512
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
You don't have to follow me.

513
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,110
Fatty, let's go.

514
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,860
Great!

515
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
It's not easy.

516
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,630
Liu, I'll go down to inform them.

517
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,100
We don't know the situation down there.

518
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,600
If you encounter any danger again,

519
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,660
the situation will be more complicated.

520
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,830
Then we can't just

521
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,790
can't do that.

522
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,790
Don't be anxious.

523
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,140
I'll consult the base camp.

524
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,330
Temporary camp. Temporary campsite.

525
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,330
I'm the inspection team. Please answer when you hear me.

526
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,350
This is the inspection team. Please reply when you hear me.

527
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,370
Temporary camp.

528
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,920
Do you know

529
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,990
how dangerous these things are?

530
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,870
I know.

531
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,260
Let's search separately.

532
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,030
Fatty!

533
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,530
Stop them.

534
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,510
Don't let them fall into the ditch.

535
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,020
All right.

536
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,210
Chu Jian.

537
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,300
You must record them carefully.

538
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,160
Maybe we can infer from the quantity and scale

539
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,640
the identity and status of the tomb owner

540
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,870
the tomb owner's identity and status.

541
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,190
Got it, Professor.

542
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,970
Take this.

543
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,590
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

544
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,850
no one would believe that

545
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,140
there would be such a magnificent

546
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,390
In the underground.

547
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,380
Built by aliens?

548
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,280
The ancestors of human

549
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,070
could build Pyramids, Great walls

550
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,390
and the Great Wall,

551
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,990
what's so great about it?

552
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
Foreign experts speculated that

553
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,900
that aliens

554
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,320
was built by aliens.

555
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,470
You're majoring in archaeology.

556
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,790
Don't always think about studying aliens.

557
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,190
-That's Sage.
- Alright, alright.

558
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,250
Hold this for me.

559
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,160
The sacrificial offering was brutal.

560
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,750
In those days,

561
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,330
the helpless fate

562
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,630
are due to class differentiation.

563
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,110
In fact, archaeology and sociology

564
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,350
can't be separated from sociology.

565
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,570
To do archaeological research,

566
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,780
It's not enough to just study your major.

567
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,850
- Leave it to Chu Jian.
-We should also pay attention to...

568
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,100
-to keep it well.
-Others are professional.

569
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,370
- Hold on to me.
-Come.

570
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
Go! Hurry up!

571
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,410
Patriotic?

572
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,630
Is Chu Jian all right?

573
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,920
He's fine.

574
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,100
Put them down.

575
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,100
Old Hu,

576
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,350
give me the bag.

577
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,090
Give me the bag.

578
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,230
Why should I?

579
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,260
Stop!

580
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,320
Give me the bag.

581
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,220
And went forward,

582
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,600
peering through a gap,

583
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,890
to see more clearly.

584
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,930
My bravery

585
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,730
with my courage

586
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,730
be together.

587
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:01,760
In my heart,

588
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,680
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

589
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,520
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

590
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,870
Fate only beckons.

591
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,520
But doesn't care

592
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,410
the result.

593
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,520
Trapped in the present

594
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,010
stuck in the present

595
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,370
down the unknown river

596
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,990
down the river,

597
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,450
the greater the desire,

598
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,960
the more you demand.

599
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,550
With full stomach,

600
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,550
they kept their mouths shut.

601
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,360
♪ Fate promised ♪

602
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,940
You'll change your mind.

603
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,390
Giving me sweet words

604
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,970
but lying to me.

605
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,470
You'd climb to Heaven...

606
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,020
And hides again.

607
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,360
Looking young.

608
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,320
And grey overnight.

609
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,210
Down the river

610
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,950
overnight, my hair turns grey.
