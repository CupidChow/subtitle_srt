00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,720
Slowly.

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,760
All of you stand back.

6
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,820
Watch out!

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
What happened with Mr. Hu?

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,140
Look at this!

9
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,240
There are traces of explosion by explosives.

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,560
And there's also traces of

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
by a crowbar.

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
Do you think it's possible

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,700
has something to do with the person who wrote that note?

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,100
With the owner of the notebook.

15
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,920
Judging from the extent and trace of the damage,

16
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,640
are not recent.

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,420
There must be at least ten years ago

18
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,400
there might be more than one group of visitors.

19
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,640
Look at the stone gate, which is so thick,

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,460
and it's underground.

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,460
It's so deep.

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,420
If I'm right,

23
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,960
the tomb of the Marvelous Queen

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Is probably inside it.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
That means

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,740
this will be our ultimate goal.

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm just worried that

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,340
this has gone too well.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,860
Since more than one group came,

30
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,600
but there is no record of them.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,900
Why?

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,900
I understand your concern.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,540
But no matter how,

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,920
I need to enter the queen's tomb

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,460
to take a look

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,360
don't be anxious.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,560
What worries me more is the Qianjin Brake.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,180
If it's dropped,

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,060
no one is allowed to get out.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,040
How about this?

41
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,900
We'll discuss it with Professor Chen

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,660
with Professor Chen

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,420
what do you think

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,440
I have to go in and check it out.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,340
What Queen Jingjie's tomb

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,840
the tomb of the Flawless Queen is like.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,060
Was stolen or vandalized?

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,720
I wouldn't rest in peace if I didn't see them.

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,200
I must go, even if it's for

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,520
I must go

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,880
to fulfill his lifelong dream.

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,600
Professor.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Professor, we are going with you.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes, we're going together.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,240
I have to go. No matter what happens,

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,560
how about this?

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,940
I can go in alone.

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,440
I'll take a look first.

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
If there's no problem,

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
you all go in again.

61
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,160
If I've been in there for more than four to five hours,

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,020
and I'm still in there,

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,180
don't go in there.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,340
Don't wait for me.

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,580
Leave now.

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,320
No way!

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm going with you.

68
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,980
We can take care of each other.

69
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,320
I can go alone.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
I'm lucky.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,800
Stay here.

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
If anything happens to you,

73
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
If anything happens to you.

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
To get everyone out of here safely.

75
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,300
That's enough. Don't sound so tragic.

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,380
I'll go with you.

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,540
Stop joking around.

78
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,340
What if it is dangerous

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,200
If there's any danger,

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,060
It's easy for me to escape.

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,040
I can't take care of you if you're away.

82
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,680
It's hard to tell who will take care of whom.

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,380
In short,

84
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,340
I won't let you enter Her Majesty's tomb

85
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,480
her Majesty's tomb alone.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,220
Alright.

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,340
Then two of us will go.

88
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,520
Fatty, stay here.

89
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,040
I'll take care of everyone.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,580
Hey.

91
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,880
How come I get the job

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,860
all mine.

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,060
Don't be picky.

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,360
No matter what you do, everyone is high or low.

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Chu Jian Spear.

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,360
A rifle is different from a pistol.

97
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,620
Can you use it?

98
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,940
Of course I can.

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,420
My pistol is empty.

100
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,360
Be careful

101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,640
we have to be careful when we get in there.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,100
And we especially have to be careful

103
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,620
don't trigger any mechanism.

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Also, you need to watch out for

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,060
are the strange snakes with crowns on their heads.

106
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
They are so fast that they are difficult to dodge.

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,760
Well

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,180
great Founder.

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,860
Watch out!

110
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,360
This isn't the end yet.

111
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,380
Do you think we're already

112
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,020
In the tomb path of the Queen's Tomb?

113
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,260
It's hard to say for sure.

114
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,560
Tombs in the Central Plains

115
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
In Central Plains.

116
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,120
But someone came here before.

117
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
And helped me.

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
If there were traps,

119
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,300
they might leave traces behind.

120
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,740
Hu, let me ask you one thing.

121
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,780
Answer me honestly.

122
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,320
Are you a tomb robber?

123
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,400
That's not possible.

124
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
What makes you think so?

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,280
It's just a guess.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,280
So I ask you something.

127
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,640
I think you know the long lost

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
the long-lost art of dividing gold and locating a tomb.

129
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,460
And is familiar with

130
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,600
various tombs.

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,280
He is as familiar as your own backyard.

132
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,800
It really looks like tomb robbing.

133
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,020
I told you that

134
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,080
these are all the skills

135
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,520
passed down in our family.

136
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,280
My grandfather

137
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,980
used to be a famous

138
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,380
In the countryside

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,660
who always pointed out the grave houses to people.

140
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,440
My father had been a soldier all his life,

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,380
and didn't learn anything

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
Instead, you came to me.

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,580
Then he became

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
It's just my hobby.

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,500
Oh!

146
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,100
Don't you know me?

147
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,820
I love studying

148
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,320
oK.

149
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,820
Comrade Lei Feng, do you know that

150
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,540
who is it?

151
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,600
The spirit of nails

152
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,320
lei Feng's nail spirit

153
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Is just one thing.

154
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,120
And study hard.

155
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,480
Of course,

156
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,480
that's just my personal understanding.

157
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,000
Do you still want it, Ye Ye?

158
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,520
Ye Ye, come and eat something.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,340
Chu Jian, come here.

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
Professor.

161
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,160
My goodness!

162
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,600
Brother Wang!

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,660
Brother Wang.

164
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,360
I want to ask you a question.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,940
What question? Do you want to ask me?

166
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
Are we that childish?

167
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,380
To be with us

168
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,580
the nursemaid

169
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,420
I didn't mean to

170
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,460
to my dad on purpose.

171
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,540
Why did you take it seriously?

172
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,740
Ye Ye,

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,420
out of power there?

174
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,140
I have batteries here.

175
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,280
I'll get you the batteries.

176
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,360
Go now. Hurry to get back to work.

177
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,900
Don't be idle.

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
Hurry up. Here you are.

179
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,580
Thank you, Brother Wang!

180
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,520
You're welcome.

181
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,160
Professor, Chu Jian.

182
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Just talk to me.

183
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,440
-No problem.
-OK.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,540
It seems there's no way.

185
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,180
Has come to an end.

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,620
What are you doing? Don't walk forward.

187
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,700
Take it easy.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,700
I wanted to see how deep it is down here.

189
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,820
Maybe the queen's coffin is still down there.

190
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,960
After she was buried,

191
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,500
she was a remarkable woman.

192
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,060
So he destroyed

193
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,780
without warning.

194
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,560
In this way, no one will

195
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,700
can disturb the queen's peace.

196
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,880
We can go back now.

197
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,500
Miss Yang,

198
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
you also saw

199
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,600
the treasures.

200
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,800
I saw them.

201
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,420
Didn't you see it?

202
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
That's right.

203
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,100
I thought

204
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,460
I just don't think it's realistic.

205
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,820
So what do you think now?

206
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,700
I don't have any ideas.

207
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,520
I was thinking that

208
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,200
It's possible that these things

209
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,160
could be buried with Queen Jingjie?

210
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,760
If that's the case,

211
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,780
we are really not far

212
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
to her tomb.

213
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,180
Stop guessing.

214
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,760
Let's go down and find out.

215
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,580
Look at this place.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,300
This might be

217
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,260
left by the expedition before.

218
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,680
Looks solid,

219
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
but I don't know how long it's been there.

220
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,340
To go back

221
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,540
to get our own rope ladder.

222
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,760
Hold on.

223
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,700
Have you ever thought that

224
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,780
there are so many treasures down here,

225
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,500
why didn't those explorers

226
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,880
didn't take it away?

227
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Nicely, they're called explorers.

228
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,940
To put it bluntly,

229
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,980
they are thieves who came to China

230
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,940
to steal things in China.

231
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,820
You should know that a thief never leaves.

232
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,540
Do you mean to say

233
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,220
what's down there?

234
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,580
Beast traps?

235
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,300
That's right.

236
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,060
Everything will be fine.

237
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,880
The simpler something seems,

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,720
the more complicated it seems.

239
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,540
Just like now,

240
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,460
we have so many treasures

241
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,120
we have so many treasures,

242
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
within our reach.

243
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,860
Instead, I feel restless.

244
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,520
Do you still remember

245
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,300
the curse in the black desert

246
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,700
the curse in the black desert?

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,020
No matter who you are,

248
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,620
whoever takes it

249
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,380
he would be buried in the black desert

250
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,140
In the Black Desert along with those treasures.

251
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,980
This curse

252
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,060
In the West Stories of Tang Dynasty,

253
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,040
he also mentions

254
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,460
the city buried by the black desert

255
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,740
was called Jirojialai.

256
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,440
I think

257
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,160
the curse is

258
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,060
for us

259
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,760
after all, Professor Chen and his friends

260
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,940
are archaeologists

261
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,420
wouldn't touch these things.

262
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,180
What do you mean?

263
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260
I worry most about fat people.

264
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,000
Why did you say that?

265
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That makes my brother look like thieves.

266
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,980
You know what?

267
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,400
We are poor,

268
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,120
but we are poor with high aspirations.

269
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,840
I dare to stake my head

270
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,860
on my head.

271
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,020
These things

272
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,540
as long as I tell Fatty Wang

273
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,320
not to touch it,

274
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
he won't take it.

275
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
By the way,

276
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
back in the year of Boxer,

277
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
the Allied Forces of the Eight Powers came to China to kill people,

278
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,740
they've destroyed so many treasures.

279
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,260
You Americans aren't here?

280
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,860
You are talking about us?

281
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,100
The moment I talk about it, it makes me angry.

282
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
When we talk about fatty,

283
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,800
look at how serious you are.

284
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,740
What's wrong? Am I wrong?

285
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,520
Come on.

286
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,160
Come on.

287
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,540
Ye Ye,

288
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,780
how are you now?

289
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,000
I feel much better.

290
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,060
I feel stronger even after I have some water.

291
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,140
That's good.

292
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
Little Chu and Sa

293
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm sure you will

294
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,100
fill it with water

295
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,460
we can't have any more problems.

296
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Wang.

297
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Hey!

298
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,020
What are you doing?

299
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,380
Professor.

300
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,640
Hu isn't back yet.

301
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,980
I'm a little anxious.

302
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,180
I'm worried about them.

303
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,980
Right. Right.

304
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,060
And I wonder what happened

305
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,540
behind the Qianjin Brake.

306
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,500
Why don't you go and have a look?

307
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
Nothing is dangerous here.

308
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,020
Okay, I'll go and take a look.

309
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,060
Alright.

310
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,980
Professor, how come that brilliant queen

311
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,540
how could she treasure

312
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,900
be hidden under the water

313
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,420
Is hiding under the water?

314
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,580
Not without possibility.

315
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,220
What? Have you found anything?

316
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,740
What can I find?

317
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,220
Don't think too much.

318
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,900
Let me have a look.

319
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,540
Hu, you're finally back.

320
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,480
Why did you come here?

321
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,280
Who asked you to come here?

322
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I have something to tell you.

323
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,140
What is it?

324
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,960
Sorry

325
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,300
I'll go first.

326
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,340
Take it easy.

327
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,600
I'll be right there.

328
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,480
Well

329
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,700
what is it? You're being sneaky.

330
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,980
Look at this.

331
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Gold coins.

332
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,400
They don't know.

333
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,760
I found it in the river.

334
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,080
Well

335
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,440
a gold coin.

336
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,420
What's going on?

337
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
What did you find inside?

338
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
Are they treasures?

339
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,900
What did I tell you?

340
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,300
I told you there is treasure inside.

341
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,140
You know what?

342
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,740
You must value what I say in the future.

343
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
Much?

344
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,780
Many.

345
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,780
A lot.

346
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,820
But that's not the point.

347
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
The point is that Shirley Yang

348
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,820
that we're tomb robbers.

349
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,680
She asked me inside.

350
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,660
That's impossible!

351
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,980
How could she know?

352
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,880
It's impossible.

353
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,340
How many times have you just said it?

354
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,280
Professor is so lucky.

355
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,140
These intellectuals are innocent.

356
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,200
Anyone can see that.

357
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,800
At least they will suspect us.

358
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,600
But she's American.

359
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,740
Why does she come here?

360
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,980
She didn't tell us clearly.

361
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,420
Can you guarantee that

362
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,020
she didn't come here

363
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,200
for the treasures.

364
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
That was it.

365
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,380
Let's pack up.

366
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,360
Alright.

367
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me tell you something, Hu.

368
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,480
I think she is probably

369
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
sent by the American KGB.

370
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,980
The Palace Guards?

371
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,340
When did the US emperor and Su Xiu

372
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,380
the U.S. and Su Xiulian together?

373
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,920
What is the name

374
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,680
what should he be called?

375
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,300
That's enough.

376
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,840
Miss someone, okay?

377
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,660
Slow down.

378
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,820
Hu, I heard that

379
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,660
the tomb of Queen Jinjie is next.

380
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,900
Yes, we are just speculation and judgment.

381
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,480
-But Professor...
-Stop it.

382
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,240
Shirley, lead the way.

383
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Sa.

384
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,020
Chu Jian, give me more bullets.

385
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,440
It's over. I don't have any.

386
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,280
Hu, do you have any small-caliber bullets

387
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
bullets from a small-caliber rifle.

388
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,440
Fatty.

389
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,100
Ah

390
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,140
give the bullet to Miss Yang.

391
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,280
Alright. Thank you.

392
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,340
Old Hu,

393
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
I felt something was wrong

394
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,100
was a little strange?

395
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,260
Shirley

396
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,780
-Slowly.
-So, you're interested.

397
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,220
You started sticking

398
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,400
and started to stick.

399
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,340
I didn't see that.

400
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,180
How can you tell?

401
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,040
The expression in your eyes is the only thing wrong.

402
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,360
I...

403
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm not interested in her.

404
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,360
Nobody wants women who are too dominant.

405
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,100
Furthermore,

406
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,220
I can't bring an American girl home.

407
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,920
Right?

408
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,800
Comrade Bayi.

409
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
It's good that you should have such awareness.

410
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,780
You must resist

411
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,380
the sugar water cannon ball.

412
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,360
We won't betray the organization's trust in you.

413
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,840
Ye Ye, be careful!

414
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,800
Old Hu,

415
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,000
touch the Golden Talisman. Black donkey's hoof.

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Did you bring them?

417
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,700
Yes. Don't mess with it inside.

418
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,480
Don't worry.

419
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,680
Where is the treasure?

420
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,660
These must be

421
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,520
the burial goods of Queen Jingjie.

422
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,460
That Queen's tomb

423
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,820
must be here.

424
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,060
Really?

425
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
Really.

426
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,760
We're here, Professor.

427
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,340
No need to ask.

428
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
Don't just stand there.

429
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,520
Hurry and leave.

430
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,380
Let's see what we can do

431
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,120
before it gets dark.

432
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,040
Wait a second.
-OK. OK.

433
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,700
Professor.

434
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,980
Let's make a deal.

435
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,820
Follow the usual rules.

436
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,140
I'll cut down your rear first.

437
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,480
Wait, why am I doing it again?

438
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Besides, you are already one day old,

439
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,760
the one who has broken down after another?

440
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,380
But I'm the sole heir of my family.

441
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,360
You're cursing me.

442
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,920
Hu only said that

443
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,700
to retreat.

444
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,380
We can go down there and move forward.

445
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,580
Look at this.

446
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,760
Really?

447
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,320
Well

448
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,620
that could be

449
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,440
I always charged to win the war

450
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,920
I never retreated.

451
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,400
Here, take this.

452
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Come.

453
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,220
Come down.

454
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,980
Hey!

455
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,580
I just can't touch it.

456
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm telling you, do not touch it!

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,300
They are watching you.

458
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,380
Alright, I know. I got it.

459
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,560
Slowly.

460
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,940
Slowly.

461
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,960
My goodness.

462
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,840
-How!
-Hey.

463
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,900
Each of these treasures

464
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,880
are priceless.

465
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,820
Inform everyone

466
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,200
they must cherish

467
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,680
especially the bottom of your feet.

468
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,260
Be careful.

469
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,220
Don't worry.

470
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,760
Of this matter.

471
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,980
Alright.

472
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Slow down, Sam.

473
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,740
Come on, Sammy.

474
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
Come on.

475
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
Take a photo of me.

476
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,020
Brother Wang,

477
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,080
this camera is for shooting data.

478
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,780
Our company has rules that I can't take any pictures.

479
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,560
Just one photo.

480
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,420
Sam,

481
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,460
just one photo of Wang.

482
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,020
It's been through fire and water.

483
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,640
What's the point of taking a photo?

484
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,620
Take a picture of me.

485
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,560
Thank you, professor.

486
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,300
Come here.

487
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,360
Hu, the cultural relics here

488
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,160
many of the artifacts

489
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,080
It's the first time for me to see them.

490
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,300
Like this.

491
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,980
Take a closer one of me.

492
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,720
Come on.

493
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,160
What's going on?

494
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,460
Take one more photo of me.

495
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,800
Wang, what are you doing?

496
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,180
Why do I have this?

497
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,360
Hold on.

498
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,260
I didn't want to take that. This...

499
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
He's out of control!

500
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,840
What... what's going on?

501
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,500
Shut up, will you?

502
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,100
Turn a deaf ear to my words!

503
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,120
How many times have I told you?

504
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,180
You can't move!

505
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,060
Yeah, I didn't want to.

506
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,520
How did it come to my hand?

507
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
Little Wang.

508
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,100
Everything here is cultural relics.

509
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,400
Belong to our country.

510
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,340
Put it back.

511
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll put it back!

512
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,560
I've put it back!

513
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,900
Any more in your pocket?

514
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,780
No, I...

515
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,000
Give it to me.

516
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,620
I...

517
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,240
Hey.

518
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,260
This...

519
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,620
This isn't...

520
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,040
Isn't this...

521
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,800
Put it down!

522
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,480
Put it down now!

523
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Hey!

524
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,480
Put it down!

525
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,220
Put it down!

526
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Wang,

527
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,360
when I first started doing archaeology,

528
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,180
I saw these treasures

529
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,720
I had selfish motives, too.

530
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,280
It's fine.

531
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,420
This is human nature.

532
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,180
You can resist it if you see it too often.

533
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,700
This is it for today.

534
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,660
Go home. No one can talk about this anymore.

535
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,540
Thank you, professor.

536
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Thank you all.

537
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,340
There's a light ahead.

538
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,220
Come on.

539
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,400
Let's move forward then.

540
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,960
Alright.

541
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,460
Chu Jian, give it to me.

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,500
-Here you go.
-OK.

543
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
- Let's go, Fatty.
-Give it to me.

544
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,840
Come on!

545
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,020
Fatty, you cover us.

546
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,940
Alright.

547
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,220
Brother Wang,

548
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,000
Is this the

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,580
the legendary Ghost Cave?

550
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,200
This must be the holy place of Jinjie State.

551
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
The Ghost Cave Clan

552
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,920
the Ghost Cave Clan's name.

553
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,440
What hole?

554
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,260
What are you talking about?

555
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,360
It's said that

556
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,540
jingjie State is mainly composed of Ghost Cave Clan.

557
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,720
The Ghost Cave Clan is called

558
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,660
because they're guarding

559
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,280
a cave that looks like an abyss.

560
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,840
But below this

561
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,860
to the next building?

562
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,000
We can't go any further.

563
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,260
For half my life.

564
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,520
I've always believed

565
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,940
the legends about the Jinjie State

566
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,440
are mere legends.

567
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,380
But I never thought

568
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,380
today, I actually saw

569
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,460
such a huge cave today.

570
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,360
Professor, don't be too excited.

571
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,000
How can I not be excited?

572
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,780
This is the Demon Realm

573
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,520
that appeared again and again in the legend of the Ghost Cave Clan.

574
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,180
The world?

575
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,300
Is empty space.

576
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,320
That is to say,

577
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,420
fall off from here,

578
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,780
he won't fall to his death.

579
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,720
He just disappeared.

580
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,480
Hey!

581
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,820
To an unknown world.

582
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,620
They can't come back.

583
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,400
This place is most likely

584
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,540
that connects virtual space.

585
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,120
Maybe it's the place

586
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,620
the connection to hell.

587
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,420
I can't. My legs are weak.

588
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,960
Don't worry.

589
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,280
Fatty's afraid of heights.

590
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,360
It's been like this since childhood.

591
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,680
It's so deep here.

592
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,880
You sounded so scary.

593
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,780
Isn't it scary at all?

594
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,440
I think it's better to have a safety rope.

595
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,860
- Old Hu.
- Yes.

596
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,940
And pull me.

597
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,540
What are you doing?

598
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,420
I think there's something up there.

599
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,320
Come on

600
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
shirley, be careful.

601
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,020
She's dying!

602
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,800
It's crazy.

603
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,080
There's something up there.

604
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
What is it?

605
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,880
There's a big stone mound.

606
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,460
There is something above it.

607
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,240
But I can't see exactly what they are.

608
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,120
Who cares?

609
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,740
Let's go up and have a look.

610
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,020
There's a way.

611
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,820
Where is it?

612
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,260
Miss Yang,

613
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,020
- Go. - Come on.
- Be careful, everyone.

614
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,760
Alright.

615
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,620
Come on.

616
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,300
Be careful

617
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,900
come.

618
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,720
There's

619
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,480
on it?

620
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,160
It should be the divine wood of Kunlun.

621
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,580
What's that

622
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,080
my grandfather once said that

623
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,900
to make a coffin

624
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,600
the best method is to make a grave wood cellar.

625
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,200
But there's another kind of wood

626
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,980
of the best divine wood.

627
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,660
Is this special Kunlun wood.

628
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,440
Even if there is only one segment of it,

629
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,900
without soil, water or sunlight,

630
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,240
and will not be dry.

631
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,060
That there is

632
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,580
there is such magical wood.

633
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,820
What's more,

634
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,500
the corpse will be immortal

635
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,020
It will be immortal.

636
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,220
Old Hu,

637
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,460
according to you,

638
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,040
the queen

639
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
she might

640
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,720
that she is up there.

641
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,680
It's very likely that

642
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,800
It's recorded in ancient books that

643
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
this kind of magic wood

644
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,860
Is as old as the Kunlun Mountains.

645
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,420
Back then, Qin Shi Huang

646
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,680
wanted to find this kind of magic wood

647
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
as his coffin.

648
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,300
This wood

649
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,020
must be more valuable

650
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,220
than any coffin.

651
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,600
Slowly.

652
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Professor.

653
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,520
Everyone keeps up.

654
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,240
Hey!

655
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,180
Watch your step.

656
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,640
There seems to be something

657
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
on the magic wood.

658
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,860
Professor.

659
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
- Professor?
-The professor.

660
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,780
Please take good care of him.

661
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,600
You scared me to death.

662
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,240
Professor, my heart is racing.

663
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,000
It's OK. I was just checking the blog.

664
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,800
Look at that.

665
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,460
What is on top of the magic wood?

666
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,940
What's that?

667
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,980
It looks like a taro root.

668
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,140
Could it be that

669
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,480
bury her here as a seed

670
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,620
here comes the taro.

671
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
They are not.

672
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,880
It should be the legendary

673
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
It's called "corpse fragrance."

674
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,860
I didn't expect that

675
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,940
that such a thing could really exist.

676
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,280
And went forward,

677
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,560
peering through a gap,

678
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,560
to see more clearly.

679
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,640
My bravery

680
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,920
with my courage

681
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,760
be together.

682
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,320
In my heart,

683
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,580
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

684
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,640
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

685
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,560
Fate only beckons.

686
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,320
But doesn't care

687
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,040
the result.

688
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,320
Trapped in the present

689
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,200
stuck in the present

690
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
down the unknown river

691
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,240
down the river,

692
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,160
the greater the desire,

693
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,320
the more you demand.

694
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
With full stomach,

695
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,120
they kept their mouths shut.

696
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
♪ Fate promised ♪

697
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
You'll change your mind.

698
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,160
Giving me sweet words

699
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,240
but lying to me.

700
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,160
You'd climb to Heaven...

701
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,840
And hides again.

702
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,160
Looking young.

703
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,520
And grey overnight.

704
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,110
Down the river

705
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,850
overnight, my hair turns grey.
