00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,880
An ability full of strength.

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Someone's here.

6
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,800
The Uyghur

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,120
come on.

8
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,500
The Han nationality.

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,090
An liman.

10
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,820
Now I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself.

11
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,100
If you do that,

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,670
you'll be different to others.

13
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,370
What are you doing?

14
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,860
They are all from Beijing.

15
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,050
Enough. Enough.

16
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,930
Stop mumbling.

17
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,060
I don't know which god you believe in.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,020
Director.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,020
Why did I see the camels

20
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,920
and look listless?

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,840
I am dying.

22
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,970
Jerk!

23
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,920
Jerk.

24
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,500
- Eighty thousand!
-How did you promise me that

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,200
didn't you want to treat my camel well?

26
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,580
Are you intending

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,780
kill my camel?

28
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,110
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,770
How could I do such an evil thing?

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,320
I haven't seen my camels

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,720
for a few days.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
I don't know

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
to what extent you've tortured them.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,330
Who tortured your camels?

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,790
They are fine now.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
As long as you help the country complete its task,

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,100
and return your camels.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,850
I really knew nothing.

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
If I had known that

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,270
they're from Beijing.

41
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,860
Beat me to death?

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,590
I dare not take them to the desert.

43
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,330
Furthermore,

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,600
It's not that I don't care about them.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,210
They abandoned me.

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,000
Right.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
We aren't talking about the same thing.

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,340
Honey,

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,680
we're not here to ask you

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,090
the foreigners' matter.

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,470
We're archaeological.

52
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,740
We hope you can lead us into the desert

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,320
we hire you to be our guide

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
to go into the desert.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,430
That's right.

56
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,360
They are different

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
are two different things.

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,960
As long as you're willing to help us,

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
we won't care about the money.

60
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,070
As for this matter...

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,030
Jerk!

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,940
If I take them to the desert,

63
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,680
can you return all the camels back?

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,510
I will certainly return them to you.

65
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,230
You don't have camels,

66
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,590
how can you lead them to the desert?

67
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,620
Please.

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,380
It's done.

69
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,840
We're just friends.

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Now it's the wind season.

71
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,250
Are you sure you can enter the desert?

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,980
The wind season?

73
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,780
I've been to the desert all the year round.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
I don't know what is monsoon.

75
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,190
Thank you, then.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Don't be shy.

77
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,620
Come on!

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,170
Come on!

79
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,550
Uncle An Liman.

80
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,020
When can we set off?

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,500
These people

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,070
know how to keep camels at all.

83
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,310
You've lost weight.

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,240
The formalities are done.

85
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,170
When can the old man start?

86
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,210
That's all waiting for you.

87
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,890
To see if my camels

88
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,260
when will my camels have enough food and drink?

89
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,950
When will

90
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,230
to have an adequate meal?

91
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,050
That all depends on you.

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,750
We wait for him and he's waiting for the camels.

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,160
The camels wait for us?

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,040
What does that mean?

95
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,260
Wait, what do you mean?

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,130
You people

97
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,200
are so stupid?

98
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,230
How could you buy food without money?

99
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,560
Without money, how can they

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
how can my camels have enough food?

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,920
And drink enough?

102
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,950
What did I tell you again?

103
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,840
To take a step back,

104
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,920
I can give it away,

105
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,840
but my camel can't.

106
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,520
It doesn't matter. How much do you want?

107
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,670
You only need to tell us

108
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,930
when we can set out,

109
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,190
It's good as long as I have money.

110
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,630
We can set out soon.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
When is that?

112
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,720
In two months.

113
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,300
The season will be over in two months.

114
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,170
That's right.

115
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,560
It's the windy season.

116
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,110
You will die when you enter the desert.

117
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,050
Didn't you just say that

118
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,570
you can enter the desert all the year round

119
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,030
Is the monsoon season nothing?

120
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,200
I mean that

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,140
so I've been in the desert all the year round.

122
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,070
But I've never encountered any monsoon season.

123
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,670
Don't be unreasonable.

124
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,730
You just wanted to come out from the police station earlier,

125
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,420
you never want to

126
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,410
to lead us to the desert at all.

127
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,040
Right?

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
How could you say that?

129
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,010
How come I never said that?

130
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,240
That's right.

131
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,160
I told you just now

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,690
after the season is over?

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,560
How about this?

134
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
I would pay double

135
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,530
for double the price.

136
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,440
When we get back from the desert,

137
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,550
the camel or your money.

138
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,100
How about this?

139
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,880
And the money is mine.

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,870
It's all yours.

141
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,020
No way!

142
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,460
No. No.

143
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,670
Entering the desert during the monsoon season?

144
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,880
The God will have to put the blame on others.

145
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,980
No way.

146
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,720
I can't wait for two months.

147
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,380
The ruins of the ancient city must be found during the monsoon season.

148
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,530
To find the remains of the ancient city.

149
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,210
It's written in my notebook.

150
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,580
It's not that he won't go.

151
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,040
He's just greedy.

152
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,020
To play some circuitous tactics with us.

153
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,550
Fatty!

154
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
I can't.

155
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:47,960
What are you doing?

156
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,460
Move it.

157
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,290
What are you doing?

158
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,360
-What is he doing?
-Dad.

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,290
Sorry,

160
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,720
go back to the police station.

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Give me your hands. Please let me go.

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,080
You are such a comrade.

163
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,600
Being like this?

164
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,340
Haven't you gone through all the formalities?

165
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,490
Go through the formalities on your way out.

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,630
No need to go back.

167
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,950
We're scared. We don't want to go.

168
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,730
- Come on.
-No.

169
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,870
How can you be

170
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,270
we can talk this over.

171
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,370
Don't be physical.

172
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,700
I have something to explain.

173
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,710
Give me a few more days to prepare.

174
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,330
Several days?

175
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,260
- Ten days.
- The day after tomorrow.

176
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,280
Seven days?

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,080
You want to escape, right?

178
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,240
Why would I run?

179
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,220
Where can I run? My camel.

180
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,980
What's up

181
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,560
what are you doing? What?

182
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,110
What did he say?

183
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't know.

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,960
You lead so many people into the desert.

185
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,100
You can't understand what I said.

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,970
The day after tomorrow.

187
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,420
We'll leave the day after tomorrow.

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,530
Yes. The day after tomorrow.

189
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,950
Money. The promised money.

190
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,040
The promised amount.

191
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,240
It's a deal then.

192
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,040
That's it.

193
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,280
You're so reckless.

194
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,790
You go back first.

195
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
I'll find something to eat.

196
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,610
Isn't he going to eat with us?

197
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,390
Fatty is thoughtful.

198
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,890
He said he went to get food,

199
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,000
but she's worried.

200
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,050
On the stakeout.

201
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,440
He is

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,730
he's really something.

203
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,250
He knows better than me.

204
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,030
If he thinks there's something wrong with someone,

205
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,000
then he is very likely to be wrong

206
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,720
hu Bayi

207
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,100
what did you tell An Li Man about?

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,920
We have

209
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,720
we have your money,

210
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,720
don't worry.

211
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,060
We'll take care of it.

212
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,600
We're a team now.

213
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,020
I know that the Americans

214
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,120
values individualism.

215
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,710
But now we are in China.

216
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,610
We value collectivism.

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,310
I know.

218
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,260
Life always comes first.

219
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,110
Remember these things.

220
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,810
Hey!

221
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,500
(Guest House)
An Liman, old brother.

222
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,920
We put all the things here.

223
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,970
Everything is here.

224
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,820
Alright.

225
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,920
-I'll do it later.
- Fatty!

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,710
Hey!

227
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,350
Anything else

228
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,980
yes, I'll take it.

229
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,510
I borrowed it from Mr. Wang.

230
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,470
Eighty thousand yuan?

231
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,660
Take good care of it.

232
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,430
This thing can't scare birds.

233
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,680
And scare small animals.

234
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,450
Speaking of the young comrade...

235
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,040
Ah

236
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,870
bring both bags here.

237
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,840
Please.

238
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,630
Oh my God! What is this?

239
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,570
This is so heavy.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,310
Delicious bean cake and salt.

241
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,790
Is that all?

242
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,280
Isn't it more and more thirsty?

243
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,620
My little comrade.

244
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,520
You can eat it too.

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,160
But my camels will have no food.

246
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,770
He's holding a grudge.

247
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,070
We've finished packing.

248
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,640
It's done.

249
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,170
I think

250
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,900
you're going to suffer with us.

251
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,590
You can't say that.

252
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,980
It's not suffering, it's getting your own life.

253
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,000
But that's okay. As a friend,

254
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,810
It sounds like

255
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,030
It doesn't sound right for an old man

256
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,040
to be a friend?

257
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,940
And pretentious.

258
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,360
Where did you get this?

259
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,850
I just accepted it.

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Comrade Hu,

261
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,750
- What?
-Come here. -Come on.

262
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,680
An Liman can't be the guide.

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
I don't agree.

264
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,350
Professor Hao, I've asked

265
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,600
I've asked around.

266
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
There's a problem with her quality.

267
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,230
We can't leave our lives

268
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,560
In the hands of such kind!

269
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,280
What if he steals things

270
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,490
he murders me for money?

271
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,000
And leave us in the desert?

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,840
This kind of thing

273
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,600
In probability.

274
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,230
Hey!

275
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,210
It seems you're the one who did it.

276
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,760
You

277
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,210
this kind of thing

278
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,030
It's possible that

279
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,540
I...

280
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,370
Professor Hao,

281
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,230
fatty and I are watching him.

282
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,230
Even if he doesn't care about us,

283
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,720
he should also take care of himself.

284
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
Nothing can happen like that.

285
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Being patriotic

286
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,820
every field work

287
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,470
Is bound to be dangerous.

288
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,400
You are an old archaeologist too.

289
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,720
The route this time

290
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,400
has been carefully considered.

291
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,370
Hu is also experienced in the desert,

292
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,400
this Anli is full of desert living map

293
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,450
I think we should suspect no one.

294
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,280
I know sir

295
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,240
you've been preparing your whole life

296
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,840
you've been ready for this your whole life.

297
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,200
Well, in that case,

298
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
let's pack up.

299
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,980
OK.
-OK.

300
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,280
Are you all done with your discussion?

301
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,180
I have something to say.

302
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,060
It's the wind season now,

303
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,000
It's the most dangerous time in the desert.

304
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
Are you going to die?

305
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,820
I have to tell you that

306
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,100
I ran into a wind...

307
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,360
Saving your own life is the most important.

308
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,860
That's why I'm here.

309
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,680
Hubby.

310
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,240
What do you mean?

311
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,020
What is your point?

312
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,700
Is about money, right?

313
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,180
You see that?

314
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,260
This friend is right.

315
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,340
For my money,

316
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,660
I can give you any.

317
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,680
We're both friends.

318
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,240
Honey.

319
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,560
This is a scientific research.

320
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,780
How can you say that?

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Scientific research.

322
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,600
I also hope

323
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
that you can study it.

324
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,040
What does he mean?

325
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,920
Comrade Hu,

326
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,660
what do you think?

327
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,420
I think you can make it.

328
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,580
Alright.

329
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,380
Then we'll all

330
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,540
will follow your instructions.

331
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,220
Pack up.

332
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,240
For this period,

333
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
starts from Lake Bosten

334
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,600
and follow the ancient river course of Kongque River

335
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
to the south.

336
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,680
Bost means standing.

337
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,320
The name

338
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,140
because there are three central mountains

339
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,840
standing in the lake.

340
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,840
In ancient times, this lake was also called Fish Sea.

341
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,400
It's the largest

342
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,540
largest inland freshwater lake in China.

343
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,280
From here, the Kongque River originates

344
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,760
and flows to the depths of the Taklamakan.

345
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,860
Didn't Uncle Anliman say

346
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,620
how dangerous the desert is?

347
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,360
How is it dangerous?

348
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,060
He has to say it's dangerous!

349
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,760
He wants more money!

350
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,860
The desert is so beautiful.

351
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,080
Xinjiang is a great place.

352
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,120
A good ranch in the Tianshan Mountains.

353
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
The Gobi Desert becomes fertile.

354
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,740
Why not run around in the back?

355
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
Relax, my team leader.

356
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,780
You've been away for such a long time.

357
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,840
And I've not seen anyone.

358
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,100
Is the old man so divine?

359
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
I think the camels know the way better than him.

360
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,740
What do you know?

361
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,160
On our way here,

362
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,060
the broken relics

363
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,300
and the scattered populus trees.

364
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,400
Didn't escape him.

365
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,400
When these things are strung together,

366
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Is just one route.

367
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
Good for you, Hu.

368
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,240
Watching him closely.

369
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,300
I need to tell you something.

370
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,360
I've been thinking about it the way.

371
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,000
What's the matter?

372
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,440
That foreign girl came all the way here

373
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,100
and spent so much money

374
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,880
why do you look for the Ancient City?

375
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,940
Tell me now.

376
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,780
There must be treasure in this Ancient City.

377
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
And it's absolutely astronomical.

378
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,800
How did you know that?

379
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Brother, can you have a little imagination?

380
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,600
Every adventure story

381
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,760
It's all about treasures.

382
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,900
What are your thoughts

383
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,400
with your mind all day?

384
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,340
Think about it.

385
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,980
That English guy

386
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,140
why did he come all the way

387
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,560
to find the ancient city?

388
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
The foreign girl's father tried so hard

389
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,700
on the way here.

390
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,980
Besides, the foreign girl herself

391
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,880
she cares about the notebook.

392
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,500
There is no other possibility except the treasure.

393
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,660
Fatty, be honest with me.

394
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
You wouldn't have come here

395
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,020
you wouldn't have come, right?

396
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,640
You can say what you want.

397
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,900
But let me tell you this.

398
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,300
If there's really treasure,

399
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,740
the Americans want to keep all of them?

400
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,940
No way!

401
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,340
Forget it. Stop it.

402
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,100
Get to the back.

403
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,020
All right. Watch the old man.

404
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,840
I'll watch that foreign girl closely.

405
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,820
Wash your hands before eating, Professor.

406
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,780
You won't?

407
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,760
I should wash it.

408
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,180
There, right there.

409
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,160
-Go on.
- Hey!

410
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,740
Water is precious!

411
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,240
Please don't drink too much.

412
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,820
Alright.

413
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,480
See that?

414
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,280
The Holy Tomb Mountains.

415
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
There are more than five meters high

416
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
on the mountain.

417
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Professor Chen

418
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
can you handle it?

419
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,940
Don't worry. I will.

420
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,580
Take a few pictures

421
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,240
and take some photos

422
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,500
professor Chen

423
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,680
Is what Uncle An Li Man said the truth?

424
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,480
Is the desert really so dangerous?

425
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,280
Ye Ye, are you scared?

426
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,940
Not scared.

427
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm just worried.

428
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Isn't it beautiful?

429
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,420
Yeah, it's so beautiful.

430
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,700
But the more beautiful it is,

431
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
the more dangerous and scary it is.

432
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,520
The conditions we'll have

433
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
than before.

434
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,100
Not the food.

435
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,760
It's mainly because I consume the water too fast.

436
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,180
If we go on like this,

437
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,980
we'll most likely die in the desert.

438
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,520
What about

439
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,180
It's not too late to return now.

440
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,300
Old Man.

441
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,900
There were many times

442
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,000
you left with them halfway there

443
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,120
so you're already back?

444
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,560
Let me tell you the truth.

445
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,180
You've been the ones

446
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,880
hold on for the longest.

447
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
Go back.

448
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,960
Don't let your life be for nothing.

449
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,200
To be honest,

450
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,640
we didn't expect

451
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
the water would be consumed so quickly.

452
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,780
You must know

453
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,340
where's water source around here?

454
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,760
Bring us some water first.

455
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,000
I know you're going to

456
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,720
the ancient city of Jinjie?

457
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,000
It's said that

458
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,980
there was a lot of treasure

459
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,780
but no one ever

460
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,420
found the building where

461
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,880
the way we just walked,

462
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,800
It's not a desert actually.

463
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,560
When you cross the river bend,

464
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,060
that is the real desert

465
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,160
that's the real desert

466
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,740
old man,

467
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,760
what is black desert?

468
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,120
There are many cities and treasures

469
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
In the black desert.

470
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
But no one was able to

471
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,920
out of the black desert,

472
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,340
even with only one gold coin,

473
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,940
we would get lost in the black desert

474
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,700
they will be buried there forever

475
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,500
they'll never get out.

476
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,880
That's too strange.

477
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,520
The God uses this place

478
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,720
to punish those greedy people.

479
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,100
Please go back.

480
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,560
Professor.

481
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,360
Come on.

482
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Hubby.

483
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,280
Is a weather changing?

484
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,440
The sunset glow never leaves the house and travels thousands of miles.

485
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,260
The fiery red clouds in the morning

486
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,560
the red clouds in the morning.

487
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,220
That's right.

488
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,740
The clouds in the sky are bleeding.

489
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,260
Perhaps God is angry.

490
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,120
It is going to be windy in the desert again.

491
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,120
It is going to be a very strong wind.

492
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,160
Mr. An Liman said the wind is rising.

493
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
It's going to be very windy.

494
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,320
So we can't rest during the day.

495
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,140
We have to get to the ruins

496
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,280
the remains of the ancient city of West Night

497
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,460
how strong can the wind be?

498
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,940
He said even if we built a wall of sand,

499
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,720
even if we build sand walls.

500
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,820
So we must get there

501
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,680
otherwise, it's most likely buried in the desert.

502
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
Hu, you are the leader.

503
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,940
We'll follow your instructions.

504
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,620
What is he doing?

505
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,580
Are you in a hurry?

506
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,460
What are you doing?

507
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,280
Be steady.

508
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,920
What happened?

509
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,500
Hurry up!

510
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,380
Or else they would be buried

511
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
the black desert.

512
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,460
-Hurry! Get the camels!
-Go on the camel!

513
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,660
-Sir, get on the camel!
-Hurry up!

514
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,440
Come on! Hurry!

515
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,900
Fatty, keep an eye on anyone who falls behind.

516
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,080
Got it.

517
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,260
Hubby.

518
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,840
Stop and let everyone have a rest.

519
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,040
You run too slowly.

520
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,320
He will die.

521
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,620
Old Man

522
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
I think Professor Chen is dying

523
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,600
stop to have a rest

524
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,360
let's have some water before you run.

525
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,040
Professor.

526
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,860
Professor.

527
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,860
My glasses are gone.

528
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,780
What should I do in the future?

529
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,520
Miss Mo.

530
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,360
I have a spare eye here.

531
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,940
Make do with it.

532
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,780
Can you see it?

533
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,880
Great!

534
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,040
Ye Ye,

535
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,000
you should hurry up.

536
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,740
What's the matter, Hu?

537
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,700
The bodies of these intellectuals

538
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,820
If only they could kill me!

539
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,260
Miss Yang.

540
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,320
Are you alright?

541
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm alright.

542
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,960
Look at that.

543
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,520
He's grown up eating steak and milk,

544
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,460
he's really different.

545
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,700
Chu Jian, check the supplies.

546
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,920
Alright.

547
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,720
Professor, you can take a rest here.

548
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,000
Ye Ye, how are you?

549
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
What about

550
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,360
the hyacinth is here.

551
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,260
Stop sleeping!

552
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,920
- Everyone, hurry up.
-Hurry up! Hurry up!

553
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,620
Get the camel. Get a camel.

554
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,900
Sadipeng, bring Little Ye.

555
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,760
Hurry up! Everyone, get the camels!

556
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,680
Hurry! Little Ye!

557
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,780
Hurry! Get on the camel!

558
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,320
Hurry up! Hurry!

559
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,960
Fatty!

560
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,560
Hey!

561
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
What's up

562
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
why is there one missing?

563
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,260
Can you see clearly?

564
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,780
Who's left behind?

565
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,460
She isn't American, is she?

566
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,740
I can't lose her.

567
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,320
She lost the money and was gone.

568
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,700
What American or Chinese?

569
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,980
No one must be left behind.

570
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,140
Catch up with An Li Man.

571
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,640
You must stop him.

572
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,440
This is an order

573
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,240
yes

574
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,540
professor Chen

575
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,860
professor Chen?

576
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,820
Professor Chen?

577
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,760
Professor Chen?

578
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,380
What happened?

579
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,240
It bumped down.

580
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,740
Are you alright?

581
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,680
She's alright.

582
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,960
Come on. Get up.

583
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,500
Come on

584
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,600
Is Professor Chen alright?

585
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,240
He's over there

586
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,720
professor.

587
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,980
Old Hu.

588
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,080
-The Professor Chen
-It's fine.

589
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,120
Where are the rest?

590
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,160
They are fine.

591
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,520
I jumped that old man An Liman

592
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
an Liman off the camel.

593
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,400
Cow!

594
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
-Don't help me. Go help him.
- Hey.

595
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,400
What happened?

596
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,150
Why does he not leave?

597
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,640
-He can't run.
- Professor.

598
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,980
- The camels are freaking out.
-It's alright.

599
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,660
It knows what a black sand storm can do.

600
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,560
It's useless to run away.

601
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,380
Just kneel here and die.

602
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,060
Grandpa, you are a living map.

603
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,980
Do something!

604
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,880
There's no other choice but to wait for death.

605
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,460
We have to do something.

606
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,920
We can't wait for death here

607
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,360
hu Bayi

608
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,620
look at this

609
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,240
don't just stare at the view.

610
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,420
Let's hit the road.

611
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,760
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Hurry up.

612
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,180
Get on the camel. Let's go.

613
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,440
Old Man.

614
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,360
Can the wall block the wind and sand?

615
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,940
That's up to God.

616
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,480
Old Hu,

617
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,040
fatty, do you see that?

618
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,540
Take everyone to hide there.

619
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,220
Hurry up and take everyone to keep an alert.

620
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,620
Hurry!

621
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,520
Come on!

622
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,880
Follow him.

623
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,200
Professor.

624
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,020
Professor, are you OK?

625
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,720
And went forward,

626
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,100
peering through a gap,

627
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,390
to see more clearly.

628
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,430
My bravery

629
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,230
with my courage

630
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:28,230
be together.

631
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:36,260
In my heart,

632
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,180
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

633
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,020
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

634
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,370
Fate only beckons.

635
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,020
But doesn't care

636
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,910
the result.

637
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,020
Trapped in the present

638
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,510
stuck in the present

639
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,870
down the unknown river

640
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,490
down the river,

641
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,950
the greater the desire,

642
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,460
the more you demand.

643
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,050
With full stomach,

644
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,050
they kept their mouths shut.

645
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,860
♪ Fate promised ♪

646
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,440
You'll change your mind.

647
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,890
Giving me sweet words

648
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,470
but lying to me.

649
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,970
You'd climb to Heaven...

650
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,520
And hides again.

651
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,860
Looking young.

652
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,820
And grey overnight.

653
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,710
Down the river

654
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,450
overnight, my hair turns grey.
