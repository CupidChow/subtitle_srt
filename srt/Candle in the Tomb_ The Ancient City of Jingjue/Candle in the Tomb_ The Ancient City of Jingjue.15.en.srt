(Episode 15)

4
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,320
Based on your many years of experience,

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,020
we know that many foreigners

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
to rob tombs here?

7
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,720
A lot.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,660
Especially before liberation.

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,180
Our country was unstable.

10
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,020
For years of war and strife.

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,100
Many imperialist countries

12
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,220
In many imperialist countries

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,440
they took advantage of it.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Let's talk about the Western Regions.

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,620
This is because

16
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,260
the natural conditions here are harsh.

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,760
Few people tread

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,380
this has become

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,340
a paradise for tomb robbers.

20
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,520
The tombs and relics in Xinjiang

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,620
was looted in the most massive way.

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,640
Was before World War II.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,780

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,640
Loulan in the eastern Taklamakan.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,980
Niya on the southern edge,

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,000
as well as the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, Gansu.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,140
Many relics

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,240
were looted.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,740
(Map of the Dry Desert)
Many ruins

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,700
were totally destroyed.

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,320
The owner of the note

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,020
was also

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,400
from England to Xinjiang.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,060
Xiao Hu.

35
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,220
Let me put it this way.

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,800
The foreigners of that time

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,480
called themselves explorers.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,420
But in fact,

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,460
are for our relics.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,700
If it's such a long way,

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,260
and it's very inconvenient to travel.

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,600
And even risk your life

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,580
to do that?

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,100
Those who sponsor them

45
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,200
for what?

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,260
What you said is true.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,660
However, there are

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,800
are there.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,180
Hu,

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,160
I've spent half of my life researching,

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
and also battling tomb robbers.

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,480
I may not be fighting them

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,260
face to face,

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,680
but I'm fighting against them

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,460
every day.

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,160
Archaeology and tomb robbing

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,440
are like a battlefield without smoke.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,580
We dig, study and protect them,

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,520
they are stealing, destroying and reselling.

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
We really hate

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,980
we really hate them.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,240
The same to me.

63
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,160
Old Hu,

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
what's the matter?

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,820
There's something wrong with my compass.

66
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,680
It's okay. I have something here.

67
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,460
It's not broken.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
It's been a while.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,620
My watch has stopped.

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
It's more than half a day.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
What's going on?

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,860
Stop

73
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,920
everyone, take a rest there.

74
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,920
We can't find anything.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,680
We can't find anything?

76
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,940
Miss Yang, what happened?

77
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,060
What's your performance now?

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,620
Stop.

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
Mine is not leaving, either.

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,480
Look at this.

81
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I have been stringed before.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,320
Look at this.

83
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,960
What is so exciting about this?

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,060
Uncle An Liman,

85
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,920
tell them your bad news.

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
The bad news?

87
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,860
Spill it.

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,500
Anyway, it's a long journey

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
no good news for you either.

90
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,040
What exactly happened to him?

91
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,060
I just checked it.

92
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,560
We're out of the

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,440
the area covered by Zidu Dark River.

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,200
I can't find

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,500
any traces of the underground river.

96
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,840
So where's the last trace?

97
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,760
Leave the last trace?

98
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,900
Half a day ago.

99
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Don't go any further.

100
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Any further?

101
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,200
I really can't find the way back.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,840
So it's all true.

103
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,460
Hu doesn't have any

104
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,600
they're not close to each other.

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,380
Miss Yang,

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,400
are you out of your mind?

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,840
Or are you going too fast?

108
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,300
I thought

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,460
It was just a coincidence.

110
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,000
But now everything

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Is matching.

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
According to the note,

113
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,720
and lost the trace of Zidu River deep in the desert.

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,260
It's a barren land.
-Miss Yang,

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,760
miss Yang, you...

116
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
Speak Chinese.

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,040
Alright.

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,740
The notebook says that

119
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
deep in the desert,

120
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,580
and lost no trace of Zidu River.

121
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,720
In the barren sea

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,840
In this barren sea of death,

123
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,140
two huge black magnetic mountains

124
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,700
facing the last rays of the setting sun

125
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,720
and stand opposite to each other.

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,980
Are just like two ancient warriors

127
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,280
wearing black armor.

128
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
Guarding ancient secrets in silence

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,580
through a valley like a gate,

130
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,620
and then a legendary city

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,840
that appeared.

132
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Wait, what mountain is that?

133
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,220
The magnetic mountain?

134
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,860
Magnetic mountain?

135
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,580
Then we have

136
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,640
are having problems,

137
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,060
does this mean that we're here

138
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,920
around Ci Mountain?

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,600
Yes

140
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,700
If there are two mountains

141
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,040
mountains nearby,

142
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,660
If Zigu Dark River is underground,

143
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,400
It might be stopped by Cishan.

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,380
So we couldn't find

145
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,240
and couldn't find any trace of Underground River,

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
to have a crush on him.

147
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,920
You have a point. Carry on.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,900
That's it.

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,120
Fatty has a good point.

150
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,180
What did you call me?

151
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,020
That's not important.

152
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,220
We should focus

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,420
should focus

154
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,800
on the nearby Ci Mountain

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,700
finding Ci Mountain

156
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,740
we've found

157
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,340
to enter Jingjie Ancient Town.

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,180
Here, telescope.

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,540
Where are you?

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Miss Yang,

161
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
are you sure about

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,160
the contents

163
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,060
In the notebook?

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Oh, right.

165
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,660
Nothing missing?

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm sure there aren't.

167
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
This is the most important moment.

168
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,780
You must help me find it.

169
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,520
Please.

170
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Okay, I'll try my best.

171
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,060
Ye Ye.

172
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,640
Ye Ye, what's wrong?

173
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
You Ye.

174
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,160
What's up

175
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
ye Ye,

176
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong, Ye Ye?

177
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,280
-What's wrong?
-The Little Ye.

178
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,420
-Left.
-Left.

179
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,660
-Left.
- Your Highness.

180
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,980
What's wrong with Ye Ye?

181
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,080
It's hot.

182
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,140
Give Ye Ye some water now.

183
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Chu Jian,

184
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
we brought antipyretic, right?

185
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,060
Yes

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,540
go find her!

187
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,280
Alright.

188
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,480
Have some water.

189
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
How could this happen?

190
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,660
I was careless.

191
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,500
I didn't notice that

192
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,380
I didn't notice it.

193
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,040
Don't worry.

194
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,800
Actually, I always knew that

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,060
It's Ye

196
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,980
Insisted not to tell everyone.

197
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,380
You're being silly, Sam.

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,420
Can we hide something like this?

199
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,880
This is going to kill her.

200
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,400
I...

201
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,140
I have never expected this.

202
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,720
Professor, I'm fine.

203
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,640
Ye, don't talk.

204
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't talk first.

205
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Leave me alone. I'm really fine.

206
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,040
When I get to Jingjie Ancient City,

207
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,460
and have a good rest, he'll be fine.

208
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

209
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,780
Don't care about your student.

210
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,100
Isn't that fascist?

211
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,380
With your current health,

212
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,620
to go to Ancient City?

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,040
If you are in danger,

214
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,260
no one is in danger.

215
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,680
Patriotic, control your emotions.

216
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,940
Please don't, Professor.

217
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,460
You've gone through great trouble to get here.

218
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,040
I don't want to hold you back

219
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,180
to hold you up.

220
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,840
I was

221
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,460
I suddenly felt very sleepy just now.

222
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,060
But I'm fine now.

223
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Really?

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,520
I know my health.

225
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,180
It won't be dangerous.

226
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,180
Ye Ye,

227
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
we are glad that

228
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,620
we're very happy.

229
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,140
But you are still young.

230
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,940
You can't do everything

231
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,760
must not be at the cost of

232
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,620
not to mention your life.

233
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,440
Got it?

234
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,800
Professor.

235
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,780
I...

236
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
The medicine is here.

237
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,080
Water.

238
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,860
Slowly.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Ye Ye,

240
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
Is there no problem?

241
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,520
It's fine.

242
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,320
Alright.

243
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,060
Have a good rest.

244
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,220
-Sat, take care of her. -Sat.
-Oh.

245
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,100
Professor Chen, Miss Yang

246
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,160
let's come here to discuss

247
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,460
okay, take a rest.

248
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,520
-Sa, take care of Ye.
- Hey.

249
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,140
Sadipeng.

250
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,520
Why are they discussing it?

251
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,640
Are they because I dragged everyone down?

252
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,700
Come, Ye Ye. Don't think too much.

253
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,220
Have a good rest

254
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,720
- Professor Chen?
-Ah.

255
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,220
Now it seems

256
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,160
there's something wrong

257
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,620
and compass are all wrong.

258
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,260
It should be the magnetic mountain.

259
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,160
According to

260
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,440
In the notebook,

261
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,640
we're now

262
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,020
near the Ci Mountain now

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,820
If we can find Ci Mountain successfully,

264
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,780
we would have found

265
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,520
the entrance to Jingjie Ancient Town.

266
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,880
The problem is,

267
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,640
even if we're very close,

268
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,220
where on earth is Ci Mountain?

269
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,020
Where it is.

270
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,180
That is objective nonsense.

271
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,400
Cishan Mountain is nowhere near the Ancient City

272
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,320
away from the city.

273
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,340
Or a few days?

274
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,220
Or even farther away.

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,860
And our drinking water

276
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,900
barely enough to

277
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,460
to the well in Prince Gumo's tomb.

278
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,280
If we go further,

279
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
we won't have enough water.

280
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,520
But all the ancient cities

281
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,180
would be built next to water veins.

282
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,900
The underground river in Prince Gumo's Tomb

283
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,000
Is an example.

284
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,060
I believe a country like Jingjie State

285
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,640
as thriving and thriving as Jingjie State,

286
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,960
has an underground water channel.

287
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,020
That's right. I believe in that too.

288
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,900
But the point is,

289
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,920
If we don't find

290
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,780
that we can only find

291
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,400
we can only eat camel meat

292
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,780
and drink salty water from sand nests.

293
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,760
We'll drive all the way.

294
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,940
This is

295
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,740
that could be achieved

296
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
what do you mean by that?

297
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,320
Is to walk back on your legs.

298
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,500
Got it.

299
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,200
Two different paths

300
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,260
there are two paths.

301
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,900
One is to reach Jingjie Ancient City.

302
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,140
But it's risky.

303
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
The return to Prince Gumo's Tomb

304
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,780
relatively safe, right?

305
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,540
That's right.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,380
But the more important one

307
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,620
It's Ye Qiu.

308
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,240
She fainted and had a high fever.

309
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,120
If we continue,

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,500
her health or even life

311
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,180
her health or even life.

312
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
So many things.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,780
I just wanted to show everyone

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,600
to everyone.

315
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Listen carefully

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,920
their opinions.

317
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,060
Now,

318
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,580
every opinion of us

319
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,960
Is important.

320
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Professor Chen

321
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,780
what's your opinion?

322
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,140
Personally, I've always wanted

323
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,880
I have sought the Ancient City in my life.

324
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm only one step away from that now.

325
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,140
I can't accept it

326
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,380
I really can't accept the reality.

327
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,460
If I could have a look at the Ancient City,

328
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,960
It's no problem for me

329
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,420
will be worth it to me.

330
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,500
Your standard is too high.

331
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,460
I'm the oldest

332
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,160
In this team.

333
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,200
And I'm the project leader.

334
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,020
I will take full responsibility

335
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,300
I have to take full responsibility.

336
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
On the way,

337
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,780
we experienced life and death.

338
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,620
But that's not a choice.

339
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,400
If I could choose now,

340
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,640
I have to make sure that

341
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,840
you will be responsible

342
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,340
to the organization and your families

343
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,600
so,

344
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,700
I agree to go back.

345
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,160
I don't agree.

346
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,520
Professor.

347
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,720
I've followed you since I was 20.

348
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,820
I know exactly how you feel

349
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,840
I know best.

350
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,880
How much effort

351
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,340
to make this trip.

352
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,480
And I know best

353
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
and I know best.

354
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,660
Miss Mo,

355
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,000
we can't give up.

356
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,240
And I agree to go back.

357
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,760
Chu Jian, why are you...

358
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,760
If you go back,

359
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,860
you won't be my student.

360
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,420
Aiguo has said that.

361
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
We now need to listen to everyone's opinion.

362
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,600
Everyone represents himself.

363
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
Calm down.

364
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,220
Chu, please finish your sentence.

365
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,060
Professor.

366
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,740
It's not easy

367
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,060
to get here.

368
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,260
To be honest,

369
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,700
If you give up now,

370
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,940
I can't accept it.

371
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,160
But after looking at Ye Ye's body,

372
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,100
now this is the case.

373
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm really worried.

374
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm worried something might happen to her.

375
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,100
Professor Chen, Prof Hao

376
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,400
ye Ye, who is

377
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,680
why are you up?

378
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,020
I'm alright.

379
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,580
Ye Ye is feeling somewhat better.

380
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,880
Drank some water, too.

381
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,840
Professor. Professor. Chu Jian.

382
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,420
I know you all want to

383
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,480
to Jingjie Ancient City.

384
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I want to go, too

385
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,140
ye Ye also wants to go, right?

386
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't be so hard on everyone.

387
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,740
Don't mind me so much.

388
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm not that effeminate actually.

389
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
I also don't want you

390
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,540
to regret for the rest of your life.

391
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,160
Professor.

392
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,580
That's my personal opinion

393
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,800
It's also my real thought.

394
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,640
Hold on a little longer.

395
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,980
When we arrive at Jingjie Ancient City,

396
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,680
after we reach the ancient city.

397
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,720
It'll be fine.

398
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,380
Don't worry.

399
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,100
Before we enter the desert,

400
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,560
everyone is ready

401
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,840
and are ready.

402
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,040
The purpose of our trip

403
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,420
was to look for

404
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,800
the ruins of Jingjie Ancient City.

405
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,740
No matter what the result is,

406
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,460
I want to keep moving forward.

407
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,040
Hu, what's your opinion?

408
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,800
To be honest,

409
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,400
at first I just wanted to earn some money.

410
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,320
I didn't think anything.

411
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,080
But after being here,

412
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,200
I've also seen a lot of things.

413
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
So many dangers I've been through,

414
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,960
but I've also wanted to see

415
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,140
I want to see this Jing Jie Guo.

416
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,380
I want to see

417
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,540
where you said

418
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,780
lived in before.

419
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,560
So if I go home now,

420
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,580
It might really be

421
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,080
In your lifetime.

422
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,320
Objectively speaking,

423
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
It might not be completely safe

424
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,160
even if we turn back now.

425
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,940
What's your opinion?

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,400
There is only one sky in the world.

427
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,020
There is only one sun in the sky.

428
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,300
The God will give us

429
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,340
another direction.

430
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,380
I listen to the God.

431
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,540
Well, you hurry up and ask

432
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,440
the old man

433
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,980
what did he say?

434
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,580
Old man, is it enough?

435
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,240
There's enough.

436
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,480
The God has given us

437
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,820
the direction.

438
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,540
Which direction?

439
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,880
-Everybody...
-He is here.

440
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,640
Well

441
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,120
up to now,

442
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,300
think carefully before you speak.

443
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,000
Think twice.

444
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,480
As for the front,

445
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
let's go back.

446
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,620
Negative. Let's go back the same way.

447
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,540
Grandpa.

448
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,380
Are you sure this is not a joke?

449
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm not joking about it.

450
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm serious.

451
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,740
Ah, right.

452
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,340
You should be serious when making jokes.

453
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,740
Fatty, be serious!

454
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,780
Professor Chen

455
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,420
you're the elder,

456
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,060
you toss the coin.

457
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
Of the result.

458
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,600
This is the will of God.

459
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,380
Now, throw it.

460
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,360
Honey,

461
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,540
professor Chen

462
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,540
I'll do it

463
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,100
alright.

464
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,940
What do you mean by that?

465
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,220
We don't know

466
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,780
you won't say anything.

467
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,960
It's the will of the God...

468
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,160
It is the will of God.

469
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,420
It is a black desert,

470
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,140
god doesn't want to come here.

471
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,880
Fatty, be serious.

472
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,780
Look at that!

473
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,420
Is that Cishan?

474
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,660
How come I didn't see that?

475
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,660
Come here, Ye Xie.

476
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,620
The characteristics of that mountain

477
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
are exactly the same as those in my notebook.

478
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,040
This must be Ci Mountain.

479
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,920
Go on a journey of thousands of miles

480
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,760
It was finally possible.

481
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,680
However, Ye Ye...

482
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,240
Don't worry, Professor.

483
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,920
I'm much better now.

484
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,800
I can hold on to Ci Mountain.

485
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,700
Professor.

486
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,820
I'll take care of her.

487
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
Don't worry.

488
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,840
Then everyone,

489
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,580
hurry up and let's go.

490
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,460
Whether we can find the Jingjue Town or not,

491
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,800
thank you all.

492
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,400
- Thank you. - Thanks.
- Come on.

493
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,560
-Let's go.
-Come on. -Let's go.

494
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,400
Come on.

495
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,120
Ye Ye,

496
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,880
you have to take the medicine.

497
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,480
You must get your fever down first.

498
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,980
-Miss Yang,
-Don't worry.

499
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,760
If we really find the Jingjue Town,

500
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,420
you promised to pay Hu and me

501
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,940
for each of us.

502
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't worry.

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,280
I won't give you any less.

504
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,880
The distance.

505
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,200
# I woke up from a dream #

506
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,060
There was no fear or desolation.

507
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,400
Everything is natural.

508
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,220
Old Hu,

509
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,640
I have to find a way

510
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,360
to get the gun from her.

511
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,040
-What are you doing? -What do you mean?

512
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,440
She can't have the gun.

513
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,400
If we find Jingjue Town,

514
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
and we find there really is so much treasure,

515
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,960
she'll kill us all.

516
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
What if she keeps us all?

517
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,960
Your brain

518
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,240
was your brain removed?

519
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,240
Why would I?

520
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,960
I can't believe you didn't think anything.

521
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,140
Of course I thought about it.

522
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm thinking about the ruins of the ancient city

523
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,380
were buried by the sands.

524
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,420
Will we be able to find

525
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,920
If we can find water or not.

526
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,820
What does the queen really look like?

527
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,940
Can she pose a threat to others

528
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,260
and pose a threat to others

529
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,000
Including the British explorers.

530
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,720
How they died before

531
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,100
these are still unknown.

532
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
Fine. Fine. Enough.

533
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,920
I can't keep up with my brain.

534
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,780
I hope I'm overthinking it.

535
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,080
I've also thought of

536
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,900
macArthur's words.

537
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,420
What did he say?

538
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,360
At the beginning,

539
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,220
we thought we knew everything.

540
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,200
But then I found out

541
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,100
the truth is

542
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,760
we know nothing.

543
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,180
That's enough, brother.

544
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
Don't scare yourself.

545
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,900
Who cares?

546
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
That's it.

547
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,400
Go forward.

548
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,920
Hey, this is the fearless

549
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,960
the fearless Hu Bayi

550
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,220
I told you to stop taking things in stride

551
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,620
be careful you bump off.

552
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,380
Look at yourself.

553
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,900
You can't expect anything less than that.

554
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,360
I thought we would get there by dark.

555
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,760
Now it's the middle of the night.

556
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,400
Anyway, as long as you said it,

557
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,020
It's Sam!

558
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,620
Hey!

559
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,860
Ye Ye still has a fever.

560
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,860
His body temperature hasn't dropped.

561
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,060
He's already dehydrated.

562
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,380
I still have saliva here.

563
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,800
Let's thank you for your hard work.

564
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
And hurry up.

565
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,620
If we can't find water,

566
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,900
ye Hua is in danger.

567
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,160
Right. Quickly find water.

568
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,460
Help Ye Xie off the camel quickly.

569
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,640
Don't let her fall.

570
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,360
Hey!

571
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,840
Come here, Ye Ye.

572
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,020
Go hold the equipment.

573
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
Team Leader Hu.

574
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,740
My camel

575
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
like this before.

576
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,740
Judging from their appearance,

577
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,680
they seem to have been

578
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,920
In his mouth.

579
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,200
That's the God who

580
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,420
that we can't go any further.

581
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,780
Let's go back quickly.

582
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,900
How can that be?

583
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,280
It took us so much trouble to come here.

584
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,840
How can we go back?

585
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,060
They're moving forward.

586
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,960
Hu, don't be anxious.

587
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,480
Uncle An Liman.

588
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,020
There must be something ahead,

589
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,800
that is scaring the camels.

590
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,160
Check it out first.

591
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,460
What's going on?

592
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,940
Did you see it clearly?

593
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,340
It seems that Mr. Hu is a human.

594
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,580
What do you mean?

595
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,260
My friend in front of my friend.

596
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,960
Don't play dumb with me.

597
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,520
Fatty, don't hit me!

598
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,400
Got it.

599
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,760
Don't move.

600
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,220
Could he be a dead person?

601
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,420
Miss Yang and I

602
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,320
let's go and take a look.

603
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,140
- Fatty!
- Hey! - What?

604
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,360
You and Chu Jian...

605
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,400
Watch the back.

606
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Make sure everyone's safety.

607
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,320
-Don't worry.
-Hey.

608
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,420
If something happens, both of you get away quickly.

609
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,680
My fire support

610
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,240
I promise to defeat him.

611
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,180
He can't defeat me. He writes it backwards.

612
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,600
Hu, what Fatty said just now is not right.

613
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,020
But it's "Wang" again.

614
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,180
You're serious now?

615
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,480
He just died.

616
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,520
The color of the corpse is weird

617
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,820
hu, what happened?

618
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,920
He's fine. I'm dead.

619
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,040
Old Hu,

620
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,100
there's another one over there.

621
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
Don't go there yet.

622
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,400
Give me one more firework.

623
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,860
It's made in the USSR.

624
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,500
Once fired, the bullet is missing.

625
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,200
Look at the shells here.

626
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Got weapons?

627
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,220
You two.

628
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,580
Go and check something.

629
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,700
But don't touch the corpse.

630
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,300
Alright.

631
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,840
It's possible that

632
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
were the guys who stole the mummies

633
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
old man.

634
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,920
Hey!

635
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,080
Do you know how to use a gun?

636
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,340
Yes, I can.

637
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,040
I joined the militia training.

638
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
Grandpa, look carefully.

639
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,520
Are these the men you brought

640
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,200
that's right.

641
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,680
They are the foreigners

642
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,260
I brought before.

643
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,860
How many people are there?

644
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
We're all here.

645
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,700
(Dynamite)

646
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,220
Dynamite!

647
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,180
Old man.

648
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,860
Well

649
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,000
go back and get your camel cleaned.

650
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,340
You can't stay here for long.

651
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,540
We have to leave here quickly.

652
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,180
Well

653
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,340
professor Chen, Prof Hao

654
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,080
come here now

655
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,600
hey!

656
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,420
Old Hu,

657
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,240
look. The explosives.

658
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,180
Hu, don't you think

659
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,360
It is a little strange?

660
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,700
It's strange.

661
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,780
These people died in a very strange way.

662
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,460
In such a concentrated manner.

663
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,240
Who could they be?

664
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,900
Is there more than one bad guy?

665
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,360
It's completely possible.

666
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,960
The point is they're fully armed

667
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,720
they shot and still died.

668
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,420
It means that they are outnumbered

669
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,940
or they're more powerful.

670
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,680
Without weapons or explosives.

671
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,160
The key is

672
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,560
there are no obvious injuries on her body.

673
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,460
Don't think about it.

674
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,700
Let's get out of here now.

675
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,840
Carry it on your back.

676
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,420
Alright

677
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,020
professor Chen

678
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
what do you think

679
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
I'm fine.

680
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,580
Okay. Hang in there.

681
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,200
Still having a fever.

682
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,180
It's OK. I'm much better now.

683
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,140
Hold on a little longer.

684
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,620
Fatty.

685
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,540
Lead them forward.

686
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,280
Miss Yang and I

687
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,520
will go and help Mr. An Liman.

688
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,400
We'll catch up later.

689
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Alright.

690
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,480
Little Hu,

691
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,020
you'd better be careful.

692
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,800
Okay. Be careful.

693
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,900
Here, Professor.

694
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,800
-Let's go, Professor.
- Come on.

695
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,540
Professor Hao, don't move!

696
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,780
There's water in it.

697
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,880
Give Ye Ye some water.

698
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,980
Don't move the corpse.

699
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,740
Be careful

700
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,420
what a close call. Thanks to

701
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
being patriotic.

702
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,500
- Professor. Professor.
- Professor?

703
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,120
Patriotic?

704
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,580
And went forward,

705
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,860
peering through a gap,

706
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,860
to see more clearly.

707
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
My bravery

708
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,220
with my courage

709
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,060
be together.

710
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,620
In my heart,

711
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,880
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

712
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,940
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

713
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,860
Fate only beckons.

714
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,620
But doesn't care

715
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,340
the result.

716
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,620
Trapped in the present

717
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,500
stuck in the present

718
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,420
down the unknown river

719
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,540
down the river,

720
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,460
the greater the desire,

721
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,620
the more you demand.

722
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
With full stomach,

723
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,420
they kept their mouths shut.

724
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
♪ Fate promised ♪

725
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,500
You'll change your mind.

726
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
Giving me sweet words

727
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,540
but lying to me.

728
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,460
You'd climb to Heaven...

729
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,140
And hides again.

730
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,460
Looking young.

731
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,820
And grey overnight.

732
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,410
Down the river

733
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,150
overnight, my hair turns grey.
