00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,740
Professor, are you all right?

5
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,810
Grandpa!

6
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,940
The wind and sand

7
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,160
will the wind blow?

8
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,610
This is just the beginning.

9
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,570
Who can be sure?

10
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,360
Don't you have something?

11
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,200
You are really something.

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,440
Go ask the God.

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,110
In such a serious black sand storm,

14
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,950
I wanted to escape long ago.

15
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,120
You let that fat man stop me.

16
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,220
Come on.

17
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,990
No one can escape now.

18
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,240
If this old skeleton of mine

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,500
to die with all of you.

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,610
What else do you want me to say?

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,140
Old Hu,

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,780
ah

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,280
hey!

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,360
I've checked everywhere. It's safe.

25
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,730
We've saved our lives.

26
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,070
Not necessarily.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Why?

28
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,240
Look at the house.

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,850
It's full of holes.

30
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,520
The black sandstorm

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,570
we don't know how many days it will blow.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,900
We'll all just wait

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,980
and be buried alive here.

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,920
Miss Yang,

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,870
what's wrong?

36
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,880
Nothing.

37
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,080
Let me have a look.

38
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,830
What's wrong with your eyes?

39
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,780
Miss Yang, are you alright?

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,180
I have sand in my eyes. I'm fine.

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,340
Ye Ye,

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,600
give Ms. Yang the water bottle.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,080
Oh!

44
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,390
Get up. Come on.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,330
Run.

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,630
Weren't you really able to run just now?

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,800
Why aren't you running now?

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,480
Run as you please.

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,290
Let go of me.

50
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,080
No one is stopping you.

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Let go of me.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,060
Come on!

53
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,400
- Fatty.
-Let go of me.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
-Let go of me!
-Let go of me. -Lands off.

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,640
What are you doing?

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
The old man

57
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,540
Is always talking about

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,700
always hanging up friends.

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,300
If I hadn't stopped him,

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,080
he'd have gone.

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,440
She still cares about us.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,260
What are you?

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,860
When I was about to start

64
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,620
when we were leaving?

65
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,200
Listen to me. Aren't you listening?

66
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,520
Come on. We are all trapped here.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,080
You can't blame me, can you?

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,380
You think you're right?

69
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,240
-Okay. Fine. Fine.
-You can't blame me.

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,720
Let's calm down.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,660
Calm down.

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, he came here and forced me.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,540
Grandpa.

74
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,600
It is already the case.

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
Let's move on.

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright?

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,660
Everyone.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,360
When will the black sand storm

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
will pass.

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,620
I think

81
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,080
we have to stay here tonight.

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Fatty.

83
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,020
You take Sadipeng and Chu Jian

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,000
to get the food,

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,780
fuel and sleeping bags.

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
Besides, we'll have to

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,960
tonight.

88
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,120
If we can't monitor

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,620
If the holes around the house

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,420
If it is buried by sand,

91
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,180
It will be no different from outside.

92
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,740
Xiao Hu is right.

93
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,700
Come with me.

94
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Hey!

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,040
- Come on.
- Hey.

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,440
What about

97
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,720
brother Hu,

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,280
sister Yang, the sand in your eyes is a bit troublesome.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,380
I'll...

100
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,340
It's okay. Let me do it.

101
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
Come on, wash your hands for me.

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,880
OK. Come on.

103
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,400
Don't hide.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,620
Hold it together.

105
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,600
It's blown.

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,380
Don't rub it!

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,060
Don't rub it! Hold your breath!

108
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,380
How do you feel better?

109
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,520
Well

110
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,720
that's much better.

111
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,580
Keep that in mind.

112
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,060
If you get sand in your eyes,

113
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,420
don't rub it after blowing it.

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,060
You will be fine after putting up with it for a while.

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,080
Alright.

116
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,040
Got it.

117
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,040
Well

118
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
I'll go out and take a look.

119
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,380
Mr. Hu,

120
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,360
thanks.

121
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,720
Hu, be careful, too.

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Alright.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
The massive sand storm outside has arrived.

124
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
The solid fuel we brought here

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
-Give it to me.
- Try to be economical.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,520
Hu, go and have a rest.

127
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,680
Are you alright?

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,420
It's alright.

129
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,980
- Professor.
- Put it all down.

130
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Are you alright?

131
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,480
I'm alright.

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,980
Anything else

133
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,940
my goodness, it's windy.

134
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,120
The three of us wouldn't be together.

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,880
It would hit the sky.

136
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
Give it to me!

137
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,640
Give it to me.

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,520
Everyone has dried meat.

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
We have all.

140
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,520
-The Ye.
-Hey.

141
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,500
Old man,

142
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,020
your camels are still fine.

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,100
Don't worry.

144
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll go if I have something to do.

145
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,700
I'd rather die of exhaustion

146
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,900
I won't let you move.

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,680
That Wang

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,460
he won't run away

149
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,900
he won't run away.

150
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,160
Right, old brother?

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,780
I can't care about that.

152
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,540
I feel at ease

153
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,760
I feel at ease.

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,020
Uncle Anliman.

155
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,880
I found some animal footprints

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,280
some animal footprints.

157
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,420
They're wolves' footprints

158
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,720
I almost forgot.

159
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,880
I saw six or seven yellow sheep

160
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,460
by the wall just now.

161
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,920
In this place,

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
that God

163
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,380
for the animals in the desert.

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,760
You have only seen a yellow sheep.

165
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,980
Maybe there's a wolf and a leopard hiding.

166
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,900
The sand storm

167
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,340
Is blowing in the sky.

168
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,000
All the animals on the ground are scared.

169
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,940
When the sandstorm is over,

170
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,200
you will find that

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,200
wolves and sheep

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,240
In the same room.

173
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,080
By that time,

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,380
If it's the wolf, it should show its teeth.

175
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,700
It's Yellow Sheep.

176
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,140
It's time to show its horns.

177
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,780
In that case,

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,300
after the sand storm,

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,760
the wolves and the leopards

180
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,480
they will find us.

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,100
Right.

182
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,200
We can avoid the storm,

183
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,440
but we can't escape the beast.

184
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,960
Hu Sadipeng is timid.

185
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,620
Please don't scare him.

186
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,180
That's right, Brother Hu.

187
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,600
Come on.

188
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,920
Stop joking around.

189
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,780
I just wanted to...

190
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,200
Atmosphere.

191
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,320
Look at this.

192
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
This is the first time

193
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,640
how brutal the desert is.

194
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,180
You learned it this time, right?

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,940
This is

196
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,040
fight against heaven and earth.

197
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,820
It's enjoyable.

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,880
What I said

199
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,460
made a lot of sense.

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,540
Lil Ye.

201
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,920
What is that?

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Ah

203
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,940
bones.

204
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,620
-There are many more.
-It's okay, Ye Xie.

205
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,820
There are so many bones.

206
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,540
We archaeologists...

207
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,420
Are you still afraid of bones?

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Sorry, Miss Hao.

209
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,320
I didn't expect that

210
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,700
anyone's bone in this.

211
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,340
They are not well-prepared.

212
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,220
It really is a human bone.

213
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,780
Professor Hao.
-Yes.

214
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
There's something strange about these bones.

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
What's so strange about that?

216
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
The dead in the desert

217
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,480
their flesh won't rot.

218
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,700
Is normally dried by air,

219
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,580
and became mummies.

220
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
But there are no flesh

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
there is no flesh at all.

222
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,100
Well

223
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,640
maybe they were eaten by wolves.

224
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,880
Most likely,

225
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,380
he probably

226
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,020
he also stayed here

227
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,080
when he was small.

228
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,960
And was attacked by an animal

229
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,720
so I was not joking

230
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,020
Is not a joke.

231
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,640
We must take turns to stand watch.

232
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,940
Once we discover anything,

233
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,160
we have to tell everyone immediately.

234
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,580
Besides, if the storm can pass,

235
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,340
we need to evacuate as soon as possible.

236
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,280
I think we have guns.

237
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,840
We don't have to wait for the storm to pass.

238
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,120
When the wind eases down,

239
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,160
I'll go out

240
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
to kill these two lambs.

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Let's have some fresh meat.

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm tired of having this jerky.

243
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
No way!

244
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,960
Once your gun fires,

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,140
and you'll scare away

246
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,480
were scared away.

247
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
After they got out,

248
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,780
they will be buried alive

249
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,320
the black desert alive.

250
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,540
We are the same

251
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
these animals.

252
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,700
Both are blessed by God.

253
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,340
To be hiding here.

254
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,140
If you are like this,

255
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
even if we escape,

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,620
god will punish us.

257
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,720
Alright.

258
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,020
- If you are like this,
-Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,980
-Let's see.
-Okay, stop it.

260
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,620
I can't eat.

261
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,820
You can't do that.

262
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,300
You can't be like this.

263
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,220
Hey, please.

264
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,920
I have something to say.

265
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,220
He has so many words for me.

266
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll eat my jerky, okay?

267
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,120
Alright

268
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,400
professor Chen, come on

269
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,460
have some wine to refresh yourself

270
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,160
thanks. Thanks.

271
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,460
In the past,

272
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,480
we always worked in the field.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,200
Then he was imprisoned in a cowshed.

274
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,700
He worked in the Wuqi Cadre School

275
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
and to the labor camp.

276
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
To cut mountains and dig rocks.

277
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,980
Through all these years?

278
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,080
Because of this.

279
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,820
Come. Thank you.

280
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,600
Old Hu,

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,980
If not for you

282
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,980
my old bones

283
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,380
must be left in the desert

284
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,640
they dried to mummies.

285
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,320
Thank you.

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,740
You're welcome.

287
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,160
That's my duty.

288
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,260
Right?

289
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,560
I can't take the money

290
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,820
miss Yang's money for nothing.

291
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,120
But if we proceed further,

292
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,400
even if the storm passes,

293
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
right ahead is

294
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,440
of Black Desert.

295
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,980
The environment would be

296
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,680
might be even crueler than it is now.

297
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,440
I know. Don't worry about me.

298
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,540
My life is

299
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,500
Is for archaeology.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,080
Not to mention

301
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,840
this rare sandstorm

302
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,020
not occur even in a hundred years

303
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,520
we all avoided it.

304
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,020
One must have blessings.

305
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Mr. Hu,

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
mr. Hu,

307
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,000
I thought

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
you are too young to be

309
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,460
you are too young.

310
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,620
I'm worried.

311
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,960
You are not experienced and capable enough to lead others.

312
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,400
But now it seems that

313
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
you're a perfect team leader.

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,480
But there's another thing

315
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,700
need your help.

316
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,300
What is it, boss? Tell me.

317
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,840
Now everyone is trapped here,

318
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,820
and our morale is a bit low.

319
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,020
Let me put it this way.

320
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,500
I hope

321
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,820
you can say something

322
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,500
to motivate everyone.

323
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,060
Do you mean that

324
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,040
to cheer you up?

325
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,060
Well

326
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,680
that's a bit hard.

327
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,700
Hey, comrades.

328
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,520
Comrades!

329
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,560
We march all the way to sing.

330
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
This is a fine tradition of our army.

331
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,340
Let's sing a song together.

332
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,160
Together?

333
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,740
Hu, what do you mean?

334
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,160
How about you sing

335
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,760
how about

336
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,640
let's have a chat.

337
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,220
Sit down for a chat.

338
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,140
I will

339
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,920
let me report to you.

340
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,660
I was working on the front

341
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,780
about something trivial.

342
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,800
Tell a story.

343
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,560
Hey.

344
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,160
Here's the thing.

345
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,300
Once we

346
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,160
we used to attack

347
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
the enemy's high ground fire,

348
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,800
but that fire...

349
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,060
Complement each other.

350
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,020
You're at a blind corner.

351
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,360
Our weapons

352
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,860
with our artillery fire.

353
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,400
So I took them

354
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,660
our sixth consecutive attack

355
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,700
but failed all three times.

356
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,520
He not only injured a dozen comrades,

357
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,900
but also seven soldiers.

358
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,920
Our company is the famous

359
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,280
within the whole division.

360
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
Never fought such a cowardly battle.

361
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,520
That's why...

362
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,060
= The warriors are depressed =

363
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,280
And lost their spirits.

364
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,340
I was worrying about him

365
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,000
but our concertmaster called

366
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,520
he gave me a scolding

367
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,260
and scolded me.

368
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
What are you doing? Okay?

369
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
No! Give up our position!

370
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,100
And give up your title of hero

371
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,200
your heroic company.

372
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,540
Let other companies fight.

373
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,740
I thought this is not good

374
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,660
how could this be?

375
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,040
So I came up with an idea

376
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,220
I'll tell all my comrades back home

377
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,740
to all our comrades in arms

378
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,720
the Central Military Commission

379
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,120
just now.

380
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,640
Mr. Deng knows the heroic deeds

381
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,180
what our sixth company did at the front.

382
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,100
He told me

383
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
good for your company.

384
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,260
You can surely do it.

385
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,840
And take the position.

386
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,980
What are the soldiers saying, Uncle Deng?

387
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,020
Even Uncle Deng knows we've joined the company,

388
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,840
we mustn't lose face then.

389
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,380
When I first arrived,

390
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,560
he captured this position

391
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,320
this position.

392
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,300
Brother Hu,

393
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,480
how did you

394
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,880
attack that position?

395
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
Yeah, how long did you fight for?

396
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
And how many people were sacrificed.

397
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,440
Ah

398
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,800
not really.

399
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,300
I... I mean by saying this.

400
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
That is

401
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,020
any difficulty,

402
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,580
In our way

403
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,860
the worst enemy is ourselves.

404
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,040
As long as we can

405
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,720
and overcome our fear

406
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,960
and overcome your weakness.

407
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,100
We will surely win

408
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
that's a good point!

409
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,960
Who can know

410
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,700
when the black sand storm

411
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,880
the black sand storm?

412
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,720
Who knows?

413
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,960
Fatty.

414
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,520
Ah

415
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,000
let's bury those bones

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,740
It's awkward to put it there.

417
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,780
Bury it there.

418
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,600
It can't go out.

419
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,180
Alright.

420
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,820
Teacher, I've paved the way.

421
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay, have a good rest.

422
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,780
Hey!

423
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,000
What's up

424
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,660
what's the matter?

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,920
That's impossible.

426
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,640
The house shouldn't be so short.

427
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
Is there something down there?

428
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,880
To look at it for you.

429
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,920
What's that

430
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,040
what are these?

431
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,120
Black stone egg.

432
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,240
This house should be a yamen

433
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,020
or a meeting hall.

434
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,780
The sand was half buried,

435
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,020
how big is the rock?

436
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,940
- to push it this high?
-Oh.

437
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,000
Who cares?

438
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,420
Let's dig them out first.

439
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,100
Come on, stand on the right side.

440
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,340
Wang, be careful.

441
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,300
It's a head.

442
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,480
This shape is too ugly.

443
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,700
It looks like an idol worshipped in a mountain temple.

444
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,840
Stop!

445
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,520
Don't move!

446
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,300
Stop moving.

447
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,060
Leave him alone.

448
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,660
He loves the country.

449
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,900
Have we seen this kind of stone statues

450
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,600
we've seen this kind of stone statue before?

451
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,160
Seen it before?

452
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,180
Must be in that coffin

453
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,800
In Xinjiang

454
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,500
one looks exactly like

455
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,840
as its...

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,540
The eyes were extraordinarily huge,

457
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,240
which was different from ordinary people.

458
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,920
This should be the giant pupil stone statue.

459
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,140
There's more than that.

460
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,360
In the Tianshan, Altay and Xinjiang,

461
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,880
he Tian River Basin

462
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,720
and the Mongolian prairie.

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,300
In Mongolia grasslands.

464
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,060
Professor Chen

465
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,420
about the origin of this stone statue?

466
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,700
There is no agreement

467
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,240
about the origin of this stone statue.

468
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,420
Some scholars once suggested that

469
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,080
that it's a kind of god

470
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,740
the Mongolian people worship.

471
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
But others say

472
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,220
that it was left by the Ancient Turkic people.

473
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,700
There's no conclusion yet.

474
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,460
It's a mystery.

475
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,120
Hey, Professor!

476
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
Since this statue is so mysterious,

477
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,120
why don't we dig it out and have a look?

478
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,060
No way.

479
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,060
No way.

480
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,480
The God sent this place.

481
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,980
Whatever you do, you will be punished by the god.

482
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,240
This is a scientific research.

483
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,780
Don't mess around.

484
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,800
Uncle, please get up first.

485
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,980
You change your mind for a while,

486
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,860
now god.

487
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,120
Sometimes god.

488
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
What kind of religion do you believe in?

489
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,420
I trust the one who's good to me.

490
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,060
I can't move.

491
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,720
- It can't move.
-OK.

492
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,280
Honey, let's not move.

493
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,120
Today is a long day.

494
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,180
Rest early.

495
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,580
Come on. Take a rest.

496
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,780
I've had enough sleep.

497
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,180
-She can't move.
-Never move.

498
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,520
Let's clean the sand

499
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,180
In this big room

500
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,960
and see if there are any other clues.

501
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,540
Goodnight.

502
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,240
Night.

503
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,880
Night.

504
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,040
-Sleep. Go to bed.
-Let's take a rest.

505
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Okay. Rest, everyone.

506
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,640
Fatty and I will bury the bones.

507
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,220
Go to bed now.

508
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,920
What are you doing if you don't sleep?

509
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I think Anliman

510
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,880
why did you get up in the middle of the night?

511
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
You want to smoke?

512
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,640
I'll take her place.

513
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,120
Go to bed first.

514
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,180
I'll call you if you can't hold on.

515
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,120
Call me if you need anything.

516
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,720
My friend.

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,480
I'm back. Rest easy.

518
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,040
-Sat.
-Hey.

519
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Let me go sleep for you.

520
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Thanks, Hu.

521
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,320
Brother Hu.

522
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Did An Liman tell you

523
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,480
when will the black sandstorm

524
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,860
the black sand storm?

525
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,900
This will pass.

526
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,940
Go to bed.

527
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,880
We still have to hurry on when we wake up.

528
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,020
Alright, Hu, be careful.

529
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,800
Alright.

530
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
Why are you still up?

531
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,180
Mr. Hu, let me take your place.

532
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,780
You can sleep for two hours.

533
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,340
No need.

534
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,580
I just replaced Sa.

535
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
Or you'll find Fatty.

536
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,860
Go back and have some rest.

537
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,080
Thank you for your help today.

538
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,520
What?

539
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,680
Nothing.

540
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,500
You are welcome.

541
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,820
You heard her.

542
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,040
I didn't realize that.

543
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
Forget it, it's okay. You don't need to explain.

544
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,020
Got it.

545
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,020
Actually, you don't have to thank me.

546
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,560
I didn't do much.

547
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,800
I should help.

548
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,660
I don't want to thank you now.

549
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,260
Oh,

550
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,120
miss Yang,

551
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,100
I've always wanted

552
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,700
I have always wanted to ask you a question.

553
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,180
But all this time,

554
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
find a suitable opportunity

555
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,300
find a suitable opportunity.

556
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
What is it?

557
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,900
Why did you and your father

558
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,680
Insist on looking for the ancient city?

559
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,940
It is said that

560
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,560
the city ceased to exist long ago.

561
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,260
And for all these years,

562
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,600
no one had seen it.

563
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,780
I saw a report once.

564
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,040
It says that

565
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,480
there were three explorers

566
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
who wanted to find the marvelous ancient city.

567
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,820
But after we got here,

568
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,460
after that.

569
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,800
After a long time.

570
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,780
Their bodies were found

571
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,220
at the edge of the desert.

572
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,700
The 3 bodies

573
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,800
all died of dehydration.

574
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,000
The strange thing is,

575
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,100
there is still water

576
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,820
everyone has

577
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,280
has more than half a jug of water.

578
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,940
There are so many things like this.

579
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,640
I just want to say that

580
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,040
people barely know

581
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,060
about the desert.

582
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
We'll try our best to find them.

583
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,840
If we can find it, it'd better not be.

584
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,340
Don't blame yourself too much.

585
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,400
What you said is very reasonable.

586
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,360
But I always believe

587
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
the existence of Jingjie Ancient City.

588
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,820
It's because

589
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,620
after my father went missing,

590
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,260
almost every night,

591
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,320
I have the same dream.

592
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,980
I always dream of

593
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,400
a dark cave.

594
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,660
Was hanging there

595
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,900
It's engraved with Ghost Cave Script.

596
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,540
There was something huge

597
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,060
resting on the coffin.

598
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,900
But I couldn't see it clearly.

599
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,300
Every time

600
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,980
I try to see it clearly,

601
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,980
I will wake up from the dream.

602
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,400
In the past six months,

603
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,920
I kept repeating

604
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,140
the same dream.

605
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,860
I firmly believe that this is the dream my father entrusted to me.

606
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,720
That coffin

607
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,740
Is inside the coffin

608
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,560
I can't believe

609
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,980
you Americans are also so superstitious.

610
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,240
And believe in dreams.

611
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,740
But you can't just because

612
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,200
just because there's such a place

613
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,860
you still believe in

614
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,780
the existence of the Quintessence Ancient City?

615
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,540
My father has always

616
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,860
my father has been

617
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,220
researching on Jingjie Ancient City.

618
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,100
When he was in America,

619
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,700
he bought a group of cultural relics.

620
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,740
Was a group of European explorers.

621
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,000
Who discovered a rare relic

622
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,540
In the Xinjiang desert.

623
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,540
The European explorers

624
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,380
once found the remains of an ancient city

625
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,700
near the oasis in Nia.

626
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,520
After research,

627
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,300
the relics and relics are from the Han Dynasty.

628
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,780
It is very likely that

629
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,880
among the 36 states in the Western Regions,

630
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
of the 36 states in the Western Regions.

631
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,900
My father and Professor Chen

632
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,980
after years of research

633
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
on the ruins of Niya.

634
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,860
It's just a subsidiary city

635
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,140
of Jinjie State.

636
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,580
The real main city of Elixir

637
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,600
should be in the north of Nia,

638
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,460
the downstream of Ziduyin River

639
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,460
my father hoped that while he was alive,

640
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,560
find the Ancient City himself

641
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,040
that's why he took the risk

642
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,640
and organized an expedition to enter the desert

643
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
until the Kunlun glacier was hit.

644
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,140
The Ghost Cave culture

645
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,400
attracted by the

646
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,640
by the excellent Ghost Cave culture.

647
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,940
I'm so sorry.

648
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,100
Sorry for what?

649
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,960
I haven't been able to help you

650
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,780
find your father's remains.

651
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,580
That's why I feel sorry for him.

652
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,140
When he needed support the most,

653
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,820
I wasn't there for him.

654
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,560
With him.

655
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,560
Now I'm following his path.

656
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,820
Seem to understand his feelings.

657
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,120
If the old man

658
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,560
really have a soul?

659
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,040
Everything you're doing right now

660
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,240
everything you do now.

661
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,400
It's just that

662
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,840
about how this once glorious ancient city

663
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,040
not many records exist now.

664
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,160
Jingjie State was a leader of the small states

665
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
were a leader of the small states in the Western Region.

666
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,280
That when the last queen died,

667
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,400
the city

668
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,260
simply disappeared by the Sea.

669
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,440
It was not until World War II

670
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,800
world War II.

671
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,840
An English explorer

672
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,460
called Walter

673
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,640
led the expedition

674
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,180
Into the Taklamakan.

675
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,160
Then he was the only one

676
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,240
survived by himself.

677
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,920
By that time he had completely lost

678
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,200
of his senses.

679
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,200
But these pictures

680
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,460
the photos in his camera

681
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
and the records in the diary

682
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
have confirmed

683
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,340
the existence of Jinjie Ancient City.

684
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,060
Later, someone wanted to

685
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
to search for the ancient city

686
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,320
to find Jingjie Ancient City.

687
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,100
But World War Two broke out.

688
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,320
Many things were set aside.

689
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,700
This is the notebook

690
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,620
the explorer's notebook.

691
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Well

692
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,860
ga Wa died for that!

693
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,360
This notebook

694
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,360
was bought by my father in England,

695
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,480
there was only one line

696
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,340
that they saw a big old town

697
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,720
at the downstream of Zidu River.

698
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,720
Planned the exploration in the morning,

699
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,300
that will be it.

700
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,180
I don't know.

701
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,800
What they encountered

702
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,940
In the ancient city ruins.

703
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,020
How come there was only one person

704
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,720
who lost his sanity and survived?

705
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,600
So many English words?

706
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,380
It knows me.

707
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,120
And I don't.

708
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
There are

709
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,320
many clues about the ancient cities.

710
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,220
I need to do more research.

711
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,700
But at least we've confirmed

712
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,500
the research route is correct.

713
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,180
I need to find it first

714
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,580
to know it.

715
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,340
What on earth has attracted

716
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,880
that has attracted my father all these years.

717
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,380
This has been

718
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,960
a mystery in my heart.

719
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,660
As long as the route is right,

720
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,320
as long as the route is right.

721
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,320
I believe we can find it

722
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,820
the black sand storm

723
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,360
really worries me.

724
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,700
The Jingjue Ancient City is very mysterious.

725
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,160
Thank you for listening to me.

726
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm interested in it.

727
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,060
I didn't force myself.

728
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,740
Enough.

729
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,100
Go and rest now.

730
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,320
We can rest assured

731
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
for the rest of the trip.

732
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,180
Don't worry. I'm not tired.

733
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,500
Did you see that?

734
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,440
I think the eyes of the statue

735
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,560
moved a little bit?

736
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,240
No, you must be tired.

737
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Probably.

738
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,080
I think you're too tired.

739
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,460
Go and have a rest.

740
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,680
I can take care of the rest.

741
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,200
Okay, stay here for a while.

742
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,540
I'll ask Fatty to pick you up.

743
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,620
Such a big ant.

744
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,000
And went forward

745
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,380
peering through a gap,

746
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,670
to see more clearly.

747
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,710
My bravery

748
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,510
with my courage

749
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:47,510
be together.

750
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:55,540
In my heart,

751
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,460

767
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,750
but lying to me.

768
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,250
You'd climb to Heaven...

769
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,800
And hides again.

770
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,140
Looking young.

771
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,100
And grey overnight.

772
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,990
Down the river

773
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,730
overnight, my hair turns grey.
