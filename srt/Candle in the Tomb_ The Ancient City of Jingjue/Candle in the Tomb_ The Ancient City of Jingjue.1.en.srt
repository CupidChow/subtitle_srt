Don't get yourself killed.

I'll attract fire.

Yes

to clear the battlefield.

10
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,750
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Got it.

Go! Hurry up!

Company commander, be careful!

14
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,670
Be alert.

15
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,080
Please

16
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,330

Xizi, please hold on.

It's okay. Hang in there.

Cleaner. Cleaner.

Sanitary technician.

21

Xi Zi, hang in there.

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,970
Hu Bayi, stop!

23
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,060
Get out of the way

24
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,690
hu Bayi, are you crazy?

25
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,510
Are you crazy?

31
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,180
Almost there.

32
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,790
Sorry.
-It's fine. It's fine.

33
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,390
Come on.

34
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,690
All right.

Beijing, the capital of our great motherland.

39
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
Beijing is the political, economic

40
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,540
of our country.

41
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,680

Dear passengers,

42
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,280

You are arriving at Beijing South Railway Station.

44

Look at your feet.

46
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,950

Exit the station via the underground passage.

The God of Heaven covers the Earth.

The pagoda suppresses the river demon,

53
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,450
why is your face red?

54
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,330
Can't find your wife.

55
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,580
How come it turns yellow again?

56
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,350
She got a tigress and scared me to death.

57
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,650
Old Hu,

58
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,460
the Central Red Army

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,780
will finally meet in Beijing!

60
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,920
Fatty,

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,460
you've become so thin.

62
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,850
Don't mention it. You were having such a hard time.

63
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go. The car is waiting for you at the gate.

64
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,150
Come on.

65
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,760
Alright, Fatty. You're awesome.

66
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,800
You already have a car.

67
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,700
You're the one who looks awesome.

68
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,450
Give you a job,

69
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,390
you don't want to go.

70
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,150
Good guy. Yeah.

71
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,610
Don't pretend to be from Beijing.

72
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,140
My family is from Beijing.

73
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,980
So what?

74
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,310
You are from Lantian?

75
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,440
Let's talk about something serious.

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
You were sent back by the army.

77
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,740
Your father didn't beat you, did he?

78
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,100
I thought

79
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,110
I would get my belt at least.

80
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,870
Unexpectedly, the old man not only was not angry,

81
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,880
he was actually happy.

82
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,980
I wonder why this old man

83
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,990
why does he have lower ideological consciousness?

84
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,180
I would be happy if I were your father.

85
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,460
Later, I realized that

86
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,740
my father was afraid that I would die on the battlefield.

87
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,100
Who are you?

88
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,380
Don't take advantage of me.

89
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,500
Fatty, you're so early today.

90
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,160
Relatives come? Quit?

91
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,790
We're home.

92
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,630
Come in and have a seat.

93
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,300
(Tape)

94
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,930
Sit down.

95
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,980
(Beijing's Eighth Division)

96
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,720
I'll tidy this up for you.

97
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,510
Fatty has a lot of inventory.

98
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,880
What inventory?

99
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,960
These are all hard to sell

100
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,800
on their hands.

101
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
The first two years were hard work.

102
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
But not now.

103
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,440
They all directly source their goods from Hong Kong,

104
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,040
they all get their goods directly from Hong Kong.

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
Now the national economy

106
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,240
It's not a good thing.

107
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,770
It's a good city.

108
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,090
Is this your bunk?

109
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,990
You sleep here at night.

110
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,690
Fatty.

111
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,640
You wrote in your letter that

112
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,110
who do you want to hit when you get wronged?

113
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,560
Who?

114
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,020
Tell me. I'll hit him for you.

115
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,020
I really want to hit him recently.

116
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,520
For what?

117
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Now the whole country is engaged in economy.

118
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,880
No one will fight.

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Are you hungry?

120
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,230
Let's go and welcome you back.

121
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,330
Have mutton hot pot in the restaurant.

122
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,090
Forget it, my treat.

123
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,660
Are you scolding me?

124
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,460
No matter how poor I am,

125
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,290
I still have enough money for the meal.

126
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,530
Come on.

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,240
(Beijing Hot Pot, welcome)

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,820
Two waiters.

129
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,570
Here they come.

130
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,510
Four bottles of beer?

131
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,330
All right.

132
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,880
The mutton is so expensive.

133
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,010
I can't afford to eat with this demobilization fee.

134
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,880
Things in the capital are more expensive than us.

135
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,250
These are good things! Have a look!

136
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,160
How many plates of mutton do you think we want?

137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,390
Right now,

138
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,140
the opener.

139
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,220
But I can't do

140
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,880
that lose money.

141
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,190
One simply can't avoid his enemy.

142
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,120
Who is it?

143
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,810
The Gold Teeth?

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,230
I've been looking for him for days.

145
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,210
He's been avoiding me.

146
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,490
What's the matter?

147
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,610
My car was impounded

148
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,900
was impounded by the Industry and Commerce.

149
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,080
After that, we knew the gold tooth.

150
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
He liked the jade.

151
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
And talked with me.

152
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,700
I was waiting for the money to redeem my car.

153
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,200
For only 300 yuan.

154
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,000
With the jade your father left you?

155
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,930
Right.

156
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,880
Darn you, he lied to me.

157
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,410
Do you know how much the jade is worth?

158
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,850
It costs at least two thousand.

159
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,130
What are you doing?

160
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,820
I have never seen this state!

161
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,810
Calm down.

162
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,690
Man, it was paid 3,000 yuan.

163
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
Cash or cheque?

164
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,820
Don't write checks. Only cash.

165
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,800
Friend, the fishbowl belongs to our country.

166
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,000
Not for sale.

167
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,240
Brothers to Triumph.

168
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,900
How come I ran into you here?

169
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,880
What a coincidence!

170
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,890
Who is your friend?

171
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,640
Sir, you got this jade

172
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,960
from my brother, right?

173
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,830
This is?

174
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,200
My name is Hu Bayi

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,270
there may be a misunderstanding about this jade

176
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,620
since we met here today,

177
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,770
we need to tell you.

178
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,520
Sorry, it's not a good time today.

179
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,730
I have friends here. Foreign guests.

180
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,160
To lie to foreigners?

181
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,660
Well, my friend,

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,450
be responsible for your words.

183
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,140
Who did I lie to?

184
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,360
You lied to me.

185
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,710
Guys, we have something to do today.

186
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,170
You can take another day

187
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,150
really

188
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,610
like this.

189
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,570
Another day, I'll treat you to roast duck

190
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,530
and I'll treat you to roast duck.

191
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,310
I have something to do today.

192
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm so sorry.

193
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,350
We should leave.

194
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,340
See you next time.

195
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,840
Alright.

196
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,370
Sorry.

197
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,350
I'll talk to you next time.

198
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,850
What? You want to fight?

199
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,380
Openly?

200
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,110
No.

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
We never snatched anything.

202
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,510
Here is the thing.

203
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,300
The jade

204
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,620
was left to him

205
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,680
by my brother's father.

206
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,550
It's a memento for him.

207
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,070
It is.

208
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
But not this.

209
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,110
As the old saying goes,

210
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,320
antique calligraphy and painting are always cunning.

211
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,400
Before the sale, that's your business.

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
After that,

213
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
It's my business

214
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,400
to get the jade back today,

215
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,870
you can have it for 3,000 yuan.

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
Fatty, sit down.

217
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,090
Sit down first.

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,300
You're behaving willfully.

219
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,770
Do you want to ask

220
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,440
what Master Jin does?

221
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,380
For nothing.

222
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,590
Today, I'm telling you the truth.

223
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,090
This jade really costs more than 3,000 yuan.

224
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,170
A higher price.

225
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,170
The higher it is.

226
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,000
My ancestors

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,140
Is a craftsman in fighting.

228
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,160
Since I was little,

229
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
I know these things about the antique business,

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
but you don't know them.

231
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,890
You have to pay the tuition fee.

232
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,810
We don't have 3,000 today,

233
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,210
you guys don't want to take the jade.

234
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,210
Are you playing dumb?

235
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,440
Then I'll make it clear

236
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,370
made it clear today.

237
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,670
You knew from the very beginning that

238
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,830
that this jade can be worth 3,000 yuan

239
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,440
you can get the 300 yuan

240
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,410
from my brother.

241
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,470
Aren't you lying to him?

242
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,720
You know what?

243
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
You are right.

244
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,330
But you lied to me.

245
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,480
How about this?

246
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,510
Cut the crap!

247
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Either we leave the jade today

248
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,180
or your golden tooth stay here.

249
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,260
And you can only

250
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,390
you can only take one of them.

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,720
What? You want to fight?

252
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,200
We are in the capital city now.

253
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,950
That's right.

254
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
The police station is across the street.

255
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,200
It's all right.

256
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,880
We're all gentlemen before we fight.

257
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,580
We have to fight two against one.

258
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,740
I admit defeat.

259
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,330
Hu, how come you have no temper

260
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,650
when you're a soldier.

261
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,110
We are not afraid of him?

262
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,090
You made me anxious just now.

263
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,010
If you insist on it,

264
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,800
I would've laid it there long time ago.

265
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,020
Why do you

266
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,280
like when you went to the countryside?

267
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,200
We all depend on our own ideas.

268
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,350
Our purpose is

269
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,440
Is to get your jade back

270
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,200
whom are you looking for?

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
Is Wang Kaixuan staying here?

272
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,430
Who are you?

273
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,950
We are his relatives,

274
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,590
you're his relatives?

275
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,940
-How Old Hu!
-What about this room?

276
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,960
Oh, I forgot something.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Tell Big Golden Tooth where I live.

278
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,600
Fatty, you got your relative again?

279
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,320
This room

280
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,730
you're such a fool.

281
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,320
Wang Kaixuan,

282
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,140
five to six came here?

283
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,940
What can we do?

284
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,700
Whatever will come will come.

285
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,250
Come on.

286
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,180
Gold Tooth, what do you want?

287
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,470
You're so generous.

288
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,940
Today I just want to know

289
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,600
Is it this...

290
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,630
Right?

291
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,950
I wouldn't have to help you.

292
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,020
But just ask around.

293
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,270
You have nothing

294
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,320
how much things come in and out?

295
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,220
That never happens.

296
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,200
What do you want then?

297
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,720
- I think...
- Fatty, what's wrong?

298
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,460
The neighborhood committee can help.

299
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,640
It's OK, Mother Pornpan.

300
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,690
They all come to help me move the goods.

301
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,130
Don't talk about it here.

302
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,460
Let's go in.

303
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,980
(Sixteen-character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Magic)

304
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,360
Bro, you know the situations

305
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,100
we're in now.

306
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,200
That's it?

307
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,990
If you think it's okay,

308
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,850
take the money with you.

309
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,930
If you don't think you can,

310
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,350
draw a line.

311
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,430
We'll stay with you until the end.

312
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,750
But let's not bother

313
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,100
and disturb the neighbours.

314
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,660
How much is it?

315
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,210
About 600.

316
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,230
That's not enough.

317
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,760
Hold on.

318
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,980
(Sixteen-character Yin-Yang Feng Shui Magic)

319
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,220
That's yours.

320
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,990
Can I see it?

321
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,150
Compass.

322
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,040
The hexagram of Yi Jing, feng shui location.

323
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,520
Accept the money

324
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,480
If you have time this afternoon,

325
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,340
please give me the pleasure.

326
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,050
Let's rinse the mutton?

327
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,000
I will cook.

328
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,210
Mr. Hu,

329
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,960
I'll show you some face, see you at noon.

330
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,700
See you at noon.

331
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,440
You paid to treat us for lunch?

332
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,210
What kind of approach?

333
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,040
There you are.

334
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,140
Have a seat. Sit. Sit.

335
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,200
Have a seat. Sit here.

336
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,020
Brothers of Triumph.

337
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,980
It's hard for you.

338
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,760
It's my fault.

339
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,600
We won't fight or have a deal

340
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,320
but today Mr. Hu

341
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,410
Is absolutely watertight

342
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,280
you gave me the power to

343
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,090
I only have one word.

344
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,580
I'd like to introduce myself.

345
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,840
I'm called Master Kim.

346
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,330
Panjiayuan is an antique dealer.

347
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,130
In the early years,

348
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,730
was a folk fighting artist.

349
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,670
Later, he let the Kuomintang

350
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,720
the Kuomintang soldiers.

351
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,990
During the Huaihai Campaign,

352
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,390
they rose up again

353
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,420
and joined the PLA.

354
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,240
My father was a cook

355
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,270
In the military.

356
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,820
Then I went to the Korean War.

357
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,450
My legs were ruined,

358
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,200
resulting in a lifelong disability.

359
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,640
Since the reform and opening up,

360
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,730
and went back to Beijing.

361
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,810
He did some antique toy business

362
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,110
mr. Hu should know that too

363
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,000
your father was having a fight

364
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,900
and couldn't find a big one.

365
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,770
To make it.

366
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,030
What zongzi?

367
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,800
Zongzi is a code word

368
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,970
It's a code word in tomb robbing.

369
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,480
It means that the tomb is well-preserved

370
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
and no rotting bodies.

371
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,900
Having a big dumpling

372
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,180
means being in trouble.

373
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,670
Your Highness, please look.

374
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,410
Can you see this tooth of mine?

375
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,990
I dug it out of the tomb.

376
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,680
I couldn't sell the enamel gold of the former Ming dynasty

377
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,470
and put on your own tooth.

378
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,610
The pot is boiling.

379
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,430
Let's play the game.

380
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,090
Oh, come on.

381
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,110
Come on.

382
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,410
Brother Kaixuan, here you are.

383
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,820
(Beijing Hot Pot)

384
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,760
My father

385
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,330
before he was caught in the military,

386
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,080
from a master of Hunan

387
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
a master in Hunan surnamed Cai.

388
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,440
Knows a lot about

389
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
about digging graves.

390
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,730
Their clan

391
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,290
mainly rely on nose to smell

392
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,840
with Luo Yang Shovel in the 12th year of the Republic of China,

393
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,030
we don't have to smell it. We have to rely on our eyes.

394
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,020
We only need the soil from Luo Yang

395
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,510
we can tell what's under the ground

396
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,030
see this?

397
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,840
Bringing this shovel here

398
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,570
porcelain pieces, wood pieces, cloth,

399
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,980
silver, Copper, Iron, Tin, Mercury and Lead.

400
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,660
Including rammed earth,

401
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,070
bricks, and so on.

402
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,120
We can tell the age of

403
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,080
In what time

404
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,960
what kind of layout

405
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,720
but I heard that this craft

406
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,910
It has lost.

407
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,270
My father couldn't walk easily.

408
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,260
I have congenital asthma.

409
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,590
I don't have any clue

410
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,870
I'm dealing in antiques.

411
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,820
Come.

412
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,080
I've heard about

413
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,670
In earlier years, I also heard

414
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,700
In earlier years.

415
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,230
The real martial arts master

416
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,170
no one uses iron rods to shovel

417
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,660
capable people can find out

418
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,330
when you walk to a place,

419
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,380
where they're buried and in what structure.

420
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,610
You can tell that at one glance.

421
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,460
This is called dividing gold to locate acupoints.

422
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,960
That is to say,

423
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,940
wherever there's great feng shui,

424
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,920
there's got to be a huge tomb.

425
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,690
Those buried in there

426
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,710
were not ordinary people.

427
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,880
The tomb is full of treasures.

428
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,560
A man of great ability

429
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,880
Is indeed right.

430
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,400
No one cares about

431
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,450
than the sword blade.

432
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,550
Mr. Hu,

433
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,800
you have studied

434
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,380
about this technique.

435
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,920
Have only a superficial understanding

436
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,290
you earned my admiration.

437
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,650
How about this?

438
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,310
If you don't mind

439
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,260
after the meal,

440
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,540
let's go take a look at my place.

441
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,260
Is this suitable?

442
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,330
Sirs, please

443
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,960
have a seat.

444
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,490
I'll send you two

445
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,390
the two of you?

446
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,880
Mr. Hu, please pay attention

447
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,500
the Triumphant Brothers

448
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,020
hu, what is that?

449
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,110
The Mojin Talisman.

450
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,640
Mr. Hu is right. Mojin talisman.

451
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,940
Back then,

452
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,560
he had an army

453
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,750
that specializes in digging graves.

454
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,250
And use the treasures to pay the soldiers.

455
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,390
In this army,

456
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,200
everyone wears the Mojin Talisman.

457
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,080
The official title is Mojin captain

458
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,020
and then it was spread

459
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,160
In this industry,

460
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,160
one is called Mojin Captain

461
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,710
mr. Hu, you said that you have

462
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,810
the ability to locate a tomb by distinguishing gold.

463
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,490
It's a pity if you don't become a Mojin captain.

464
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,000
In fact, I don't have

465
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,210
experience in this matter.

466
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,550
It's all

467
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,510
sixteen-character Feng Shui Magic Book

468
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,160
the sixteen character Yin and Yang Feng Shui Technique.

469
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,920
From my grandparents.

470
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,170
Tell me the truth.

471
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,820
Back then,

472
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,570
was once a Mojin captain.

473
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,720
But he encountered a big zongzi

474
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,450
that almost cost me my life.

475
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,710
So I don't want to do

476
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,670
I don't want to do it.

477
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,970
I didn't ask you to try it.

478
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,280
I asked you to collect some things.

479
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,630
And sell them as you want.

480
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,520
Is not better than selling cassettes.

481
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,440
Right?

482
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,950
Hold on.

483
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,380
Mr. Hu, please pay more attention

484
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,240
do you know the price of your bowl?

485
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,840
How many?

486
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,720
Three hundred.

487
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,840
Three thousand?

488
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,620
Ten thousand.

489
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,420
The records of

490
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,120
mr. Hu, take a look at this.

491
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,660
Do you know

492
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,490
the foreigners offer for it?

493
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,420
Seven.

494
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,750
Another ten thousand.

495
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,350
It's Western Zhou Dynasty's.

496
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,360
Last week's right?

497
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,640
Mr. Hu, the ones from last week are here.

498
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,390
I got this last week

499
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,640
600 yuan is the cheapest one here.

500
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,530
Even if that's 600 yuan,

501
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,360
even if it's 600 yuan.

502
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,440
I don't have other intentions.

503
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,620
I just want to make friends with you.

504
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,780
I know

505
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,330
you're not ordinary people.

506
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,900
If there's something good in the future,

507
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,000
I'll contact the buyers for you.

508
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,760
You talk it over in person.

509
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,040
When the deal is done,

510
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,950
just give me a little commission.

511
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,120
Even mountains still remain intact,

512
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,600
and green waters flow.

513
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,530
Old Hu,

514
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,100
come on.

515
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,130
Old Hu!

516
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,940
Old Hu!

517
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,550
Brother Triumphant!

518
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,860
Take this away.

519
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,560
No, I'm fine.

520
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,780
Hold on.

521
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,460
I'm leaving now.

522
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,550
Old Hu,

523
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,880
old Hu, what are you thinking about?

524
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,150
As for Big Gold Tooth,

525
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,420
you have no interest in him?

526
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,880
Let's not talk about him. He'll talk about us.

527
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,400
What should we do?

528
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,220
I can't do this job

529
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,490
selling cassettes by bike.

530
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,830
Fatty, do you think Gold Teeth

531
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,190
reliable?

532
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,040
I don't know.

533
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,080
But I heard your conversation during the day.

534
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,810
Your conversation in the daytime.

535
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
It's so learned.

536
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,050
In fact, I think this is...

537
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,390
Say whatever you want to say.

538
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,520
I think you should

539
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,380
you don't have to feel burdened.

540
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,470
There are so many treasures

541
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,730
there's so much gold and silver treasure,

542
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,370
you can't say all the good things

543
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,450
belongs to the tomb owner.

544
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,810
He plundered and exploited

545
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,910
from the citizens.

546
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,580
Take from the people and use it for the people.

547
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,780
What year is it now?

548
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,040
It's the 1980s.

549
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,700
Dedication is advocated, right?

550
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,720
It's their turn to make sacrifices.

551
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,870
They can't get out by themselves.

552
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,700
So we have to do this for them.

553
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,270
Fatty, I've been in the army for ten years.

554
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,570
I'm not allowed to steal a grave.

555
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,210
Don't you dare do that.

556
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,150
Do not do anything illegal

557
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,440
the moral hazard.

558
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,500
But aren't we going to collect it now?

559
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,940
Collect it?

560
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,390
Do you remember the Niuxin Mountain

561
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,300
the countryside?

562
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,920
Of course I remember. Can I forget that?

563
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,810
The locals said

564
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,810
that there is a tomb there?

565
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,240
He said it was from before the Northern Song Dynasty.

566
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,100
We both picked up some porcelain fragments

567
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,060
pick up some porcelain pieces, right?

568
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
Those people in our home

569
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,820
among us all.

570
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,320
Now I guess I can just buy some as I want.

571
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,010
We can sell it at a good price.

572
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,950
That Swallow's Mansion

573
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,530
the pots back in their house

574
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,490
do you think

575
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,290
It would be valuable, wouldn't it?

576
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,670
Hu, don't you want to

577
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,110
to those folks?

578
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,110
Old Secretary.

579
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,250
Swallow

580
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,720
well, let's go to Mount Niuxin

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,180
see them as a visit.

582
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,190
If we receive something,

583
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,510
we can take everyone to get rich together.

584
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,830
I thought you didn't understand.

585
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,000
I didn't expect that you have higher consciousness than me.

586
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,760
Screw you!

587
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,080
But that said,

588
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,830
we can't do it empty-handed

589
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,070
and collect the remaining money.

590
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,760
And bring more gifts.

591
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,350
No problem. Tomorrow,

592
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,940
I'll get rid of all my stocks

593
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,960
by tomorrow.

594
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,680
They sold my car.

595
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,880
How much does it cost?

596
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
Sell it.

597
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,440
It should be worth some money.

598
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,600
Brother Ying.

599
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,560
This is a limited-edition mechanical watch.

600
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,880
It'll fetch a good price.

601
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,700
How about this?

602
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,780
You even return my house.

603
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,380
Retired?

604
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,160
If you are back, where are you going to stay?

605
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,300
Beijing Hotel?

606
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,460
Give my watch back.

607
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,570
What?

608
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,530
All you do is to enjoy yourself.

609
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,350
Hu, I think that watch

610
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,390
Is worth 200 anyway.

611
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,600
The TV is worth 600.

612
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,530
He told us to take it away.

613
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,640
What does he mean?

614
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Are you a fool?

615
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,600
Do you know how to do the math?

616
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,050
I gave him 600 for the jade.

617
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,990
He lost?

618
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,280
The gold tooth is so funny.

619
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,880
To save face and ask for money?

620
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,440
Hurry up.

621
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,140
And make it up for us in private.

622
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,690
He wanted us to remember.

623
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,710
What memento?

624
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,500
Is he the one who suffered?

625
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,520
-Come. Ticket.
- Come on.

626
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,620
(Beijing South Railway Station)
Put it down first.

627
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,200
(Black and white TV receiver)

628
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
You made a lot of stuff here.

629
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,610
Do you want to exhaust me?

630
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,630
Enough, stop blaming me

631
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,020
let's go to the reception to collect things.

632
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,810
There's no need to invest emotionally.

633
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,490
Put in before you produce anything.

634
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,550
This is the last word.

635
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,860
When I think of the villagers I haven't seen for years,

636
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,300
that I haven't seen for years.

637
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,240
Why are you excited?

638
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,180
I don't know yet.

639
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,590
Forget it. Where are the tickets?

640
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,210
I gave you the tickets.

641
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,260
When did you give it to me?

642
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,840
It's over there. Look for it.

643
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,790
No, didn't I give you the ticket

644
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,070
before I went out.

645
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,380
Where is he?

646
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,060
You

647
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,260
come on.

648
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
-Have a nice trip.
-How!

649
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,090
-Gave a safe trip.
- Wait for me.

650
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,780
And went forward.

651
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,780
Peering through a gap,

652
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,440
to see more clearly.

653
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,350
My bravery

654
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,610
with my courage

655
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:19,580
be together.

656
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:26,430
In my heart,

657
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,640
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

658
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,590
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

659
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,710
Fate only beckons.

660
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,650
But doesn't care

661
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:48,010
the result.

662
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,210
Trapped in the present

663
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,740
stuck in the present

664
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,330
down the unknown river

665
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,370
down the river,

666
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,190
the greater the desire,

667
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,410
the more you demand.

668
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,000
With full stomach,

669
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,470
they kept their mouths shut.

670
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
♪ Fate has promised ♪

671
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,730
Will change.

672
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,180
She poured out her love words

673
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,740
but lying to me.

674
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,520
You'd climb to Heaven...

675
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,570
And hides again.

676
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,110
Looking young.

677
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,090
And grey overnight.

678
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,220
Down the river

679
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,110
overnight, my hair turns grey.
