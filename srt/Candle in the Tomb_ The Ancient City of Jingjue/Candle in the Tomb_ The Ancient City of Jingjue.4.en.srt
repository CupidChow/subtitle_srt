Fatty!

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,590
Find something to break the lock.

6
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,860
They're coming.

7
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,900
Get out of the way.

8
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,890
What is this?

9
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,700
A Japanese lunch box.

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,220
(Military Materiel)

11
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,200
What is this?

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,570
My goodness.

13
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,770
This is good stuff.

14
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,000
Come. Take the bag down.

15
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,020
Here you are.

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,480
Yingzi, take this.

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,660
Old Hu Yingzi, come on.

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,570
Thirty-eight covers!

19
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,420
It's brand-new. They're oiled.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't aim at anything.

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,950
Never aim the muzzle

22
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,260
at your own comrades.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,090
Only traitors

24
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,660
will point the gun at their own people.

25
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,490
Why did you nod your head?

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,780
This stupid gun of Japan

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,320
has only five bullets.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,480
Moreover, the loading is too slow

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,780
and the recoil force is very strong.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,410
I can't use that.

31
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,380
Little Devil, this spear works well.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,260
Strong.

33
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,240
When my uncle

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,680
used to use this

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,760
he used to use.

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,080
Why doesn't Mr. Hu like it?

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,050
Ignore him.

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,950
He plays in the army every day.

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,880
He used to play

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,380
with your semi-automatic weapons?

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,700
These old-fashioned guns are not something to be found with.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,410
But here's the deal, Yingzi.

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,860
Such a gun can be accurate.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,180
And it has a wider range.

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,160
Fat Bro,

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,980
why are you so familiar with the gun?

47
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,120
Fatty was always in the military.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,020
He could just walk,

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,460
his father used to play with guns for him.

50
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,740
He became an expert in using guns

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,340
since I was in junior high.

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,100
(Bullet)

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,550
Yingzi.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,340
I'm not bragging with you.

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,510
(100 Level Gunshots)
I shot with great accuracy, Fat Bro.

56
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,400
Riding your horse and lighting lanterns is like fun.

57
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,820
Then come back.

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,840
Put an egg on

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
on your head.

60
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,290
If you don't blow it at every chance,

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,460
my surname is no Hu.

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,480
I don't want to use that kind of spear

63
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,180
because 38 Style

64
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,810
Is not suitable for close combat at all.

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,320
Come here, come here.

66
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,050
Look at this!

67
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,870
Mr. Hu, what's this?

68
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,180
Why does it look this way?

69
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,830
Is it not good?

70
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,090
This is the Man-made

71
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,210
that is man-made.

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,800
Because the production is very small,

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,930
so that's rare.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,990
This was the post-war period.

75
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,090
To deal with the Soviet army

76
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,210
to deal with the Soviet army.

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,340
This gun is much better

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,160
than your pistol.

79
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,010
Even if it malfunctions,

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,760
It will only jam instead of misfiring.

81
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,240
Throw away your stupid gun.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,550
Come on.

83
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,530
That's enough, Hu.

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
Now I have it.

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,430
Ten or eight red-haired monsters

86
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,260
we don't fear anymore.

87
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,420
So, do we want to return home?

88
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,640
Or ask someone else to probe.

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,860
Bring that box here.

90
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Come on.

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,360
Oh my goodness.

92
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,400
If we had this,

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,780
wouldn't be so awkward.

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,200
What's wrong with

95
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,510
right here.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,110
Your hands are so fast.

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
The red monster is still banging on the door.

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
You're so enthusiastic.

99
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,730
Hu, give me ten minutes.

100
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,380
I'll blow it up.

101
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,930
Stop showing off.

102
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,120
Let's find an exit now.

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,950
Safety First

104
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,120
right.

105
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,170
Yingzi, this is your brother Hu.

106
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,100
He's not giving me a chance.

107
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,570
Fat Bro, I'm scared.

108
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,040
I've never been scared.

109
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,160
Hurry up.

110
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,110
Hey!

111
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,080
Look! There's light ahead.

112
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,320
I hope it's the exit. Come on.

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,670
Why did you stop suddenly?

114
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,000
I smell blood.

115
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,600
Do you smell that?

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
That's the exit you're looking for.

117
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,940
Can these people get out?

118
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,280
This isn't an exit. This is a vent.

119
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,120
Why did you push me?

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,970
I didn't push you.

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,520
Mr. Hu, what's wrong with you?

122
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,600
You asked me

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
If I saw a child, right?

124
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,210
You saw that too?

125
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,160
Nothing.

126
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,440
But I also think something is wrong.

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,790
You two don't scare me.

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,970
Don't startle them.

129
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,480
These things are very dangerous.

130
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,840
No, I...

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,970
Call him then!

132
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm out of bullets.

133
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,880
Fire it. Hug the bullet vigorously.

134
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,340
Can't I not be fast?

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm out of bullets, too.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
Cut the crap. Take Yingzi and run!

137
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Run, Yingzi!

138
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,040
Fat, give me the clips.

139
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,970
What magazine?

140
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,800
Hu, come here.

141
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,840
The baby is here.

142
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,720
Fatty!

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,650
Stinky bomb!

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,200
Come on.

145
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,320
Hurry!

146
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
Old Hu,

147
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,400
what's wrong with you?

148
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,730
What's wrong with you?

149
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,870
How many rang just now?

150
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,750
What did it ring?

151
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,650
Just say hand grenade.

152
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,800
What's that?

153
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,460
I told you to come.

154
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,760
What's this hand grenade?

155
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,830
Why didn't it ring?

156
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,990
You've been out there for too long.

157
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,870
What's too old?

158
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,780
Why didn't it ring if I threw it?

159
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,710
Why didn't it ring if you throw it?

160
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,800
Only your hands are too stinky.

161
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,770
Thank God it didn't explode. I was screwed.

162
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,500
If you use any new term in the future,

163
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,570
If you need new words.

164
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,230
Brother Hu,

165
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,780
on your back?

166
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,230
Not on your back.

167
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,610
Look at that.

168
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,240
What's up

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
does it look like a child's handprint?

170
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,250
Just go.

171
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,770
I think you took it yourself.

172
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,200
Brother Hu,

173
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,740
you said that

174
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,080
It seems I was hit by something.

175
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,150
I feel like I was pushed by someone.

176
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,700
And really strong.

177
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,190
Don't scare yourself.

178
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,520
What did you see?

179
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,280
I saw a child flashed by.

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,940
What's it?

181
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,040
Is she a child?

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,500
I think so.

183
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,800
Didn't you say there was no child here?

184
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,700
Let's go and have a look.

185
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,270
Be careful.

186
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Hey!

187
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,690
Why is there a door here?

188
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,960
(Forbidden)
Did that kid come inside?

189
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,430
Old Hu,

190
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,380
we don't have to meet Taoist Laoshan again.

191
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,370
Flashlight.

192
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,380
(Enter the forbidden area)
Put on the ban?

193
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,470
What does it mean?

194
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,800
It means you can't enter by standing.

195
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,900
You have to lie down to enter the door

196
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,640
this must be the mortuary

197
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,830
or a crematory.

198
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,220
Cut the crap.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
The meaning of these four words

200
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
It should mean "not to enter."

201
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,850
Even though I don't know Japanese,

202
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,180
I am familiar with

203
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,960
military facilities.

204
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,940
Look at these.

205
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,700
These are the exhaust vents.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,620
When the iron door is closed,

207
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,480
the air will be pumped out automatically

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
and a semi-vacuum

209
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,370
of it.

210
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,760
This is the air-tight door.

211
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,580
This is supposed to be a storage

212
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,750
valuables should be stored.

213
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,930
Valuables

214
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,630
will there be treasures?

215
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,100
You'll know that "precious"

216
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,920
Valuables must be treasures.

217
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,880
Maybe it's a chemical weapon.

218
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
Or bacteriological weapons?

219
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,850
What's

220
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,210
than those

221
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,870
which is more likely?

222
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,700
I didn't put that there.

223
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,500
How would I know?

224
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,890
This is so annoying.

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,360
Stop taking pictures, Hu.

226
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Are we here for the fortress?

227
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
If there are treasures inside,

228
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,370
those belong to the Chinese.

229
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,700
Was plundered by Japan,

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,480
through burning and plunders.

231
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
As the representatives

232
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
young talents in the new era,

233
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,390
do you think it's necessary

234
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,380
to see the light of day.

235
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,970
Fatty.

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,500
I know what's on your mind.

237
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,650
But now,

238
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,200
finding the exit is the priority.

239
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,800
I'll follow Mr. Hu's advice.

240
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,780
We didn't bring any food.

241
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,870
And we didn't find any food

242
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,360
we didn't find any food in the fortress.

243
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,290
If we are too hungry to crawl,

244
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,730
we can only wait to die.

245
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,080
Old Hu, you're right.

246
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,930
But there're bats blocking it.

247
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,250
What if there's an exit through the door?

248
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,370
Well, shouldn't we

249
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,620
and have a look?

250
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,510
Right?

251
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,260
Not without possibility.

252
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,310
But it's hard to say

253
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,430
there will always be an exit.

254
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,980
Because the room

255
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,390
Isn't labeled as this chamber

256
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,600
It's just that

257
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,710
an exit from here.

258
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,340
But we can try.

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,540
But let's talk about it first.

260
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,320
Everything is under my command.

261
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
Listen to you all the time.

262
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,880
Take this.

263
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,050
Hey, what are you doing?

264
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,590
Hold this.

265
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,420
- One.
- Two. Three.

266
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,420
Is this the coffin museum?

267
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
Why are there so many coffins?

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,580
It seems that I have preconceived.

269
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,340
This is not

270
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,050
to store chemicals.

271
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,820
It should be

272
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,740
opened the fortress

273
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,020
when we opened the fortress.

274
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
You're making so much tension.

275
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,140
Brother Hu.

276
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,360
I'll wait for you outside.

277
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,390
Keep an eye on the door as well.

278
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,970
Don't lock us in here anymore.

279
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,610
Well

280
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,780
It seems that the Guandong Army retreated in a hurry.

281
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,750
They packed up all the treasures in the tomb.

282
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,140
Only these coffins are left.

283
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,680
Little Devil is really good at stealing.

284
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,500
Hu, light the candle for me.

285
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,680
Slowly.

286
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,720
All jerks!

287
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,870
This boy is really wicked.

288
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,690
She follows the policy wherever she goes.

289
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,130
He didn't even leave us

290
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,220
to us.

291
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,920
There's no way out here.

292
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,610
- Here, Fatty.
- Hey!

293
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,400
Shine the light on it.

294
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,150
Hey!

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,040
Old Hu, you missed it!

296
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,140
Old Hu,

297
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,590
whether there's any treasure inside or not,

298
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,040
If we carry this coffin out,

299
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,630
we can definitely make a profit.

300
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,060
Aren't we looking for an exit?

301
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,320
Aren't you outside?

302
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
Why are you here?

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,660
I'm also scared outside.

304
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,730
Old Hu,

305
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,360
you mean the people in this tomb

306
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,660
and the general just now

307
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,520
who's the top?

308
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,600
I don't know.

309
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,460
But in the hundreds of years,

310
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,120
the northern nomads are stronger than ever.

311
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
They gained the state

312
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
on horseback.

313
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,940
So I guess that

314
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
value military over literature.

315
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,090
If you insist on rank,

316
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,320
we'll look at this coffin.

317
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,380
I still think

318
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,120
that guy is more senior.

319
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,300
But he's a martial arts master.

320
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,680
And he has no decent people.

321
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
And taste.

322
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,840
So the objects in the tomb

323
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,160
are horses and weapons.

324
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,800
That's not necessarily the case.

325
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,160
Because everyone

326
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,560
before they died,

327
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,830
they would have buried with different things.

328
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,160
Mr Hu,

329
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,450
I guess there is

330
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,380
mr. Hu,

331
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,680
we can hold the lecture later.

332
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
As long as you don't say the inside,

333
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,890
there won't be any treasure inside.

334
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,460
I have to open it today.

335
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,440
Hold on.

336
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:29,980
The candle.

337
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,200
Brother Hu,

338
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,280
fire.

339
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,240
You know where it's southeast?

340
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,410
No idea.

341
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,500
I don't know.

342
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
Whatever. Light it up.

343
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,640
Yingzi Gao

344
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,400
hold this.

345
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,210
Put it here.

346
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,790
Hey!

347
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
- Yingzi.
- Hey!

348
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,280
Shine it.

349
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,780
One, two. Come on.

350
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,880
Come to the side. One, two.

351
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,180
One more, two.

352
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,640
You should have thought of this.

353
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,620
How could this little guy

354
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,790
leave something for us?

355
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,080
This trip was in vain.

356
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,760
And almost cost me my life.

357
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,490
Fat Bro,

358
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
what happened to you?

359
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,120
Yingzi,

360
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,760
didn't your father tell you

361
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,630
that little devil has three lights policy.

362
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,920
Back then, in China,

363
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,550
burned, killed, plundered and committed all kinds of evil deeds.

364
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,970
- You...
- Fatty!

365
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,030
Come on.

366
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,100
What's up

367
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,240
old Hu,

368
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,340
that's impossible.

369
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,080
They are turning into bones.

370
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,960
Are these two kids false?

371
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,180
This is mercury stain.

372
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,830
It's highly toxic.

373
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Was that the kid I just saw?

374
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
You only scare yourself.

375
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,540
Why are there Mercury

376
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,620
mercury on their bodies?

377
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,430
My grandfather once said that

378
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,130
that these boys and girls

379
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,460
poured mercury into their heads

380
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,860
with mercury from their heads

381
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,990
after the death, the body

382
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,030
after death

383
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,860
and it'd be as if it's made into a specimen.

384
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,570
After ten thousand years,

385
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,720
without rotting.

386
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,900
And if

387
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
to preserve the corpse's appearance,

388
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,860
can only be fed by a living person.

389
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,720
Since the dead can't circulate enough blood,

390
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,060
which can't be filled in.

391
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,000
The wicked feudal society.

392
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,520
This is so cruel.

393
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,070
What's the matter, Fatty?

394
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,860
It's not good in your heart.

395
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,320
It's uncomfortable inside.

396
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,570
Old Hu,

397
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,760
let's get these two kids out of here

398
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,400
dig a grave and bury them properly.

399
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,380
They also stayed with the tomb owner

400
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,930
for a thousand years.

401
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,820
She should have a good rest.

402
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,050
I agree.

403
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,030
Mr. Hu and the others are so pitiful.

404
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,080
They're just kids.

405
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,290
You were buried alive for the irrelevant.

406
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,840
Give them a break.

407
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,670
And bury them.

408
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,000
The old people always say that when the earth is buried,

409
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,700
let's find the exit first.

410
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,060
Yingzi, aren't you scared?

411
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,920
Not really.

412
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Where are the bats?

413
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,120
I didn't raise them.

414
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,050
How would I know?

415
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,730
Managed to escape

416
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,520
through the vent.

417
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,860
Fat Bro,

418
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,680
bats mostly lie in the daytime and come at night.

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,350
Why would they fly out during the day?

420
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
He isn't raised by me.

421
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,290
I don't know.

422
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,060
What did I step on?

423
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,830
Don't be afraid. Let's go.

424
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,160
This is the exit

425
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,240
the exit marked on the map.

426
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,660
Did it collapse on purpose?

427
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,220
Hu, are you sure it's this place?

428
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
It must be here.

429
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,360
Now that's great,

430
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,820
we don't have to find other excuses.

431
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,210
The same result.

432
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,940
We'll have to go home and battle

433
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,820
with the red-haired monster.

434
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,790
Since we can't escape,

435
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,950
we should make up our mind to return.

436
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,440
If this drags on,

437
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,250
even if I can't starve to death,

438
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,240
I'll have no energy to fight.

439
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,990
Don't mention "hungry" anymore.

440
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,270
Now I'm even hungrier,

441
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,390
when you fight with

442
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,640
when they fought, I was thinking

443
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,520
If I can't leave today,

444
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,670
he didn't even have a full meal before he died.

445
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,440
Pang, we now have guns.

446
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,560
After we leave,

447
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,360
I'll ask my father to treat you with the best venison

448
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
and drink the best spirit.

449
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
You're such a good friend, girl!

450
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,500
We're going to be your friend.

451
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,460
Fatty, I told you in advance

452
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,060
our goal is to get out of here

453
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,840
we don't have to kill the red hairy monster

454
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,680
to death.

455
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,440
I'll try to deal with it later.

456
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,720
You two try to open the lid

457
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,120
open the coffin lid as soon as possible.

458
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,440
-OK.
-OK.

459
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,670
Hu, this thing works.

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,080
Brother Hu,

461
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,170
that red-haired monster seems

462
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,190
we didn't hit the door.

463
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,170
When did that happen?

464
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,350
Where do you think it is now?

465
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,520
How should I know?

466
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,200
Let me throw a grenade first.

467
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,820
No way.

468
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,500
If it's not here,

469
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,160
just throw the grenade

470
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,410
led it here, right?

471
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,050
What should we do now?

472
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,540
I think we should go ahead.

473
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,350
We have guns in our hands.

474
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,070
Alright.

475
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,200
Call him!

476
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,850
Run!

477
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,920
I'll blow you up!

478
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,920
Old Hu!

479
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,780
Where's Fatty?

480
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,250
He was behind us just now.

481
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,590
It seems I won't be able to get out today.

482
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,550
No, I won't.

483
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,540
Great!

484
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,930
This way.

485
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,150
- Old Hu.
-Hurry up.

486
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,770
Give me the ax.

487
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,660
Leave now.

488
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,700
Come.

489
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,200
Now you two go and open the door.

490
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,630
Come on, hurry up.

491
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,650
Let's go, Yingzi!

492
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,160
Fatty!

493
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,800
Give me your gun.

494
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,080
Be careful.

495
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,640
Alright.

496
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,240
Fatty, move!

497
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,840
Hurry up, Fatty.

498
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,040
I can't open it.

499
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,650
The hand grenade. Blow it up.

500
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,840
It's gone.

501
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,180
Brother Fat,

502
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,100
sister. You're my real sister.

503
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
Go away.

504
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,590
I'm running out of bullets.

505
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,300
Back off!

506
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,660
Darn you

507
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,340
It must have rung.

508
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,280
One.

509
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,990
Two.

510
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,830
Three.

511
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,060
Four.

512
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,980
Five.

513
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,380
Six!

514
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,400
Three is supposed to ring! Where is six?

515
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,350
Lao Hu, the gate is blown open!

516
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,960
Run!

517
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,940
And move on.

518
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,750
Peering through a gap,

519
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,040
to see more clearly.

520
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,080
My bravery

521
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,880
with my courage

522
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:40,880
be together.

523
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,910
In my heart,

524
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,830
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

525
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,670
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

526
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,020

527
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,670
But doesn't care

528
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,560
the result.

529
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,670
Trapped in the present

530
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,160
stuck in the present

531
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,520
down the unknown river

532
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,140
down the river,

533
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,600
the greater the desire,

534
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,110
the more you demand.

535
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,700
With full stomach,

536
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
they kept their mouths shut.

♪ Fate promised ♪

538
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,090
You'll change your mind.

539
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,540
Giving me sweet words

540
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,120
but lying to me.

541
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,620
You'd climb to Heaven...

542
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,170
And hides again.

543
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,510
Looking young.

544
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,470
And grey overnight.

545
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,360
Down the river

546
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,100
overnight, my hair turns grey.
