With my eyes,

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,640
to light a lamp.

7
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,720
We are still alive.

8
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Ah, distance.

9
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,420
They've been.

10
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,140
Fatty.

11
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,240
The white clouds in the sky and the snow on the ground

12
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
It melted.

13
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Old Hu,

14
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,120
are we dead or alive?

15
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,160
They are not dead.

16
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,100
I woke up from a dream.

17
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,520
I didn't feel any fear or desert.

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,300
Where is this?

19
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,600
How would I know?

20
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,720
Old Hu,

21
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,080
we are not dead.

22
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,460
Fatty, don't cry.

23
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Fatty, don't cry.

you're alive.

46
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,660
Brother Hu,

47
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,820
we thought you'd never come back.

48
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Xiao Chu, what happened to your

49
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,380
that happened?

50
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,800
What do you mean?

51
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
You asked us to bring Ye Yixin

52
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
with water

53
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,860
leaving the underground river

54
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,620
we came here for Anli Man.

55
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,880
So I'm here to wait for you.

56
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,580
That's right.

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
We didn't expect you to be alive.

58
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,020
When the black sand storm hit,

59
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,260
we had no choice to withdraw.

60
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,540
Where's Xiao Ye?

61
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,740
Ye Ye drank some water.

62
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,260
You feel much better now.

63
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,740
She... There she is.

64
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,980
Yes, there she is.

65
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,200
East wind is beating the war drums.

66
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,460
-Who's afraid of whom in the world now?
-For professor.

67
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,960
Professor. Professor.

68
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,640
So many celebrities.

69
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,790
- Look at the present.
-The professor.

70
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,750
Professor.

71
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,400
-What's wrong?
-The professor.

72
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,320
Professor.

73
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,160
Miss Yang.

74
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,700
Little Ye,

75
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,220
old Hu,

76
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
what happened?

77
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,320
Is there any water?

78
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,300
I'll look for it.

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,180
Professor. Professor.

80
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,040
It's fine.

81
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Hu, the water is out.

82
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,620
Everything is in the sand storm.

83
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,640
Old Hu!

84
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,580
Old Hu!

85
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,120
Can you hear me?

86
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,480
What happened?

87
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,880
The water is out.

88
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Alright.

89
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
Professor, what's wrong?

90
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,560
Black sand storm has changed the way of the desert.

91
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,120
Even the camels have got lost, right?

92
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,420
Grandpa.

93
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,040
You have to find a way

94
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
or else this group

95
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,760
let's head to the west.

96
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,180
There's an oil field in the west.

97
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,080
Might be able to survive.

98
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,960
But they can't ride camels anymore.

99
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,780
They're really tired of it.

100
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,920
Alright.

101
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Old Hu,

102
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,460
how many days have we been gone?

103
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,520
Just a few days.

104
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,980
Within a few days?

105
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,540
We're going. We'll go out soon.

106
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,320
Stop lying to me

107
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,060
I know we won't get out of here.

108
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,400
Every day,

109
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,440
It's the desert when I close my eyes.

110
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,220
It's still the desert when I close my eyes.

111
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,540
I can't go any further.

112
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,540
I can't hold on, Hu.

113
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,580
Revolutionary young man.

114
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,820
Keep it up.

115
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,880
You'll win if you persist.

116
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,060
I can't go on anymore.

117
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,900
Old Hu,

118
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,520
I can't leave this place.

119
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,900
You have to leave this place!

120
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,200
When the revolution is victorious,

121
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,460
when your revolution is won.

122
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Come on.

123
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,220
Come on.

124
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
Come on.

125
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,820
I...

126
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,160
What happened, Fatty?

127
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,440
What's up

128
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,020
- Brother Wang!
- Fatty!

129
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
- Brother Wang!
-Fat Boy!

130
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Wake up!

131
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,520
Fatty, wake up. Wake up.

132
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,220
Old Hu,

133
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't.

134
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,240
I can't walk any further.

135
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,320
Or walk out of here.

136
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,820
If I keep going like this,

137
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,900
even if I don't die, I'll be dried up in the sun.

138
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,940
Wake up.

139
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,660
Darn you

140
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
stand up!

141
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,600
Stand up!

142
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
What happened to him?

143
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,680
Nothing. Let's go.

144
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,260
In the end,

145
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm still the cause of everyone's troubles.

146
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,340
That I've brought you

147
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,740
not to mention the involvement,

148
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,000
we're all the same.

149
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm different from you.

150
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
What's the difference?

151
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,660
Just because you are American,

152
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,660
I'm a member of the Zagorma Clan.

153
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,860
At this point,

154
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,480
you still have energy to joke around?

155
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,520
I'm not joking around.

156
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
My mother

157
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,820
she's a descendant of the Zagorma clan.

158
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,000
That our ancestors

159
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,540
wanted to explore the secret of the ghost cave.

160
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
But I am cursed.

161
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,640
Because of the curse,

162
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,700
his descendants

163
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
couldn't live beyond 50 years.

164
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,500
This is why

165
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,760
I insist on finding

166
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,260
what caused the ancient city,

167
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,160
In order to solve the curse,

168
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,300
to save my mother,

169
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,940
and to save me in the future.

170
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,500
You knew that from the beginning.

171
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,260
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

172
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

173
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,420
So,

174
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,680
fire ladybugs can't hurt you.

175
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,620
It might be.

176
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,340
I don't know.

177
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,100
See that?

178
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,300
This is the mark

179
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,700
of Zagorama clan.

180
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,680
My mother also has one.

181
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
Hu Bayi

182
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,820
hu Bayi

183
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,460
hu, look at the white camel.

184
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,300
White camel is the Holy Thing?

185
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,540
White camel is a holy thing?

186
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
It can appear in the desert

187
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,040
which proves the curse is over.

188
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,440
God has taken back

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,420
the desert

190
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,460
follow it!

191
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,400
-The armed forces greet.
-Hurry.

192
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,840
We can find water by following the white camel.

193
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
Get on the camel!

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,560
Come on, Sadipeng.

195
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,080
This is amazing.

196
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,940
Thank you for your blessing.

197
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,120
Look, the camels!

198

200
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,960
don't drink it.

201
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,080
- Fatty, don't drink it.
-Don't drink.

202
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,320
Don't drink.

There's no rush.

206
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,560
Get the bucket.

207
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
It's too bitter.
- Old Hu.

208
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,520
You can drink it after it melts.

209
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,540
-The professor.
- Professor. Professor.

210
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,060
Professor, you have to wait.

211
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,960
-Wait a second, Professor.
-This water...

212
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,180
- Hold on.
- It'll have to be a while before you drink it.

213
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,580
Thank the white camels!

214
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,060

I will always remember this kindness.

220
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
It's time to drink.

221
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,540

222
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,240

223
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,520
-The professor. Professor.
-Stop him.

224
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,440
Come on, slowly. Slowly.

225
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,880
Hu, I don't want to move

226
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
want to move now.

227
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,040
Grasp the revolution and promote production.

228
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,160

229
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,160
It's not really a mirage, is it?

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,540
We are here!

- Hey!

The gun.

233
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,920
You should've thrown it away. How can we steal it?

234
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
We are here.

all this feels like a dream.

243
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,040
I'm here!

244
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,360
That's right.

These things

246
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,700

To anyone.

248
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,300
They will think

249
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,820
that this is a fantasy.

250
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,760
We are here...

We are here.

We are here.

It's here.

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,660
We're saved!

00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,700
-Here. -We stay here.
- Right here.

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,840
We're here.

the evidence of the archaeological process in the Xinjiang desert.

Oh, the lampstand, the emerald, the gold...

266
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,120
Why didn't I take them?

267
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,800
Sir, be gentle. This is an antique.

268
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,760
Antique?

269
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,700
What?

270
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,160
Master Kim,

271
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,860
you didn't see the treasures

272
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,520
Inside the tomb?

273
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,980
Oh, a golden mountain.

274
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,020
What is that?

275
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,500
I can't shake the image

276
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,780
I can't shake it off.

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,840
Let me tell you, the lampstand

what's the old saying?

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,440
Sediment?

280
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,900
Is definitely the result of precipitation.

281
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,060
Look at the thick taro

282
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,180

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,120
What should I tell you?

I heard you.

What did I say?

298
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,120
Taro.

299
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,940
Who talked with you about taro?

300
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,020

303
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,330
I asked what you brought back.

304
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,580
The archaeology team is all there.

305
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,760
What can I bring back?

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,900

He will be investigated.

316
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
Why is there an investigation?

317
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,210
Two professors

318
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,650
one is sacrificed and the other is crazy.

00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,730
It's not right.

336
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,980
-What's with the burning pain?
-Hold on. Hold on.

337
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,370
What's wrong? I didn't apply strength again.

338
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Take a look. Why does it hurt?

339
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,900
Where?

340
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,880
This way.

Calm down.

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,600
I don't know.

347
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,650
It's like a pattern.

348
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,840
Let me take another look.

349
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,300

You're here?

353
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,450
What?

354
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,020
Why are you here?

He's not here.

374
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,530
You didn't come for me,

Oh,

I came here

378
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,440
because I wanted to

379
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,970

380

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,570
Contacted the hospital

383
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,570
to bring Professor Chen back to the US for treatment

384
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
I don't think you Americans

385
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,730
are not that rich.

386
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,180
Look, it's all cash.

387
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,720
What about that?

388
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,580
Forget about it.

389
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,240
He will still be paid.

390
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,660
You agreed to it.

391
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,200
But, Hu,

392
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,760
well

393
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,050
I want you to promise me one thing.

394
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,600
What's that?

395
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,770
As elders for both of us,

396
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
and we're in the same trade.

397
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,580
My grandfather decided to give up

398
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,090
because he was a Mojin captain

399
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,050
It greatly damages the yin virtues.

400
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,860
Even the tough guy is,

401
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,580
there's bound to be accidents.

402
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,360
I hope you can stop

403
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,890
stop here.

404
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,020
Don't involve yourself in the future.

405
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,620
If there's an opportunity in the future,

406
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,340
you came to America with Fatty.

407
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,560
I'll make the arrangements for you.

408
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,480
I don't care about that.

409
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,860
I thought you rich people

410
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,900
you have too much money to spend.

411
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,610
Old Hu,

412
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,450
I'm serious.

413
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,480
Please hear me out

414
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,880
I Hu Bayi

415
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,770
as a person of principle

416
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,820
those ancient tombs that have been discovered and protected

417
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,660
those tombs.

418
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,620
However,

419
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,140
you need to know that

420
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,960
besides those,

421
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,130
there are many graves and ruins

422
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,940
In the deep woods.

423
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,400
Those places

424
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,700
those who don't know

425
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,960
will never find them.

426
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,530
If you were not to end these fights,

427
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,320
Is not right.

428
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
And the other for those rare treasures.

429
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,460
We'll have no chance

430
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,600
to see the light of day again.

431
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,680
And the other is

432
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,720
the changes and erosion of the natural environment

433
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,930
will pose a great threat

434
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,100
those undiscovered tombs.

435
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,260
I saw it with my eyes.

436
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,180
And hurt in my heart.

437
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,130
- I mean...
- Come on. - Stop it.

438
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,420
I was being kind.

439
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,320
But I always have to meet you, the most cunning man in the world.

440
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't argue with you.

441
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,320
You should know that

442
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,600
our great leader Chairman Mao

443
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,170
he taught us that

444
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,560
everything has two sides.

445
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,320
Good things can be turned into bad things.

446
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,220
Something bad can be turned into something good.

447
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,100
That's dialectical materialism.

448
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,570
And I firmly

449
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,460
based on this theory.

450
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,900
I didn't expect you to have backbone.

451
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
You really impressed me a lot.

452
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,360
I'll take back what I just said.

453
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,690
I guess you won't be willing

454
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,300
I guess you won't take them anymore.

455
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,320
Miss Yang?

456
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,480
No, Miss Yang.

457
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,160
I meant that

458
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,680
since you're so sincere about it,

459
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,450
I have to accept that.

460
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,170
What do you think?

461
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,000
How about this?

462
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,330
You lend me the money?

463
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,890
And calculate the interest rate

464
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,220
at the Bank of China's interest rate?

465
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,060
Thank you.

466
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,300
Thank you for Fatty.

467
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,180
I should be the one to thank you.

468
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,530
And Fatty.

469
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,370
Really...

470
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,610
She really just leaves like that?

471
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,530
I want to say that

472
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,920
professor Chen is going with you?

473
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,490
That's right

474
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
and I need to contact the hospital

475
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,640
to bring Professor Chen back for treatment

476
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,420
oh

477
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,610
oh, right.

478
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,420
You and Fatty are fine, right?

479
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,490
Of course.

480
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,210
We're strong.

481
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,020
They're fine.

482
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,920
That's good.

483
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,250
I'm off.

484
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,580
We might not meet

485
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,000
see each other again.

486
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,580
Oh.

487
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:50,840
Take care.

488
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,220
See you around

489
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,640
see you around

490
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,300
you can pick up the phone now.

491
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:09,890
Thanks.

492
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:24,930
Hey.

493
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,560
Hello, Father?

494
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,240
I'm going home tomorrow.

495
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,600
Yes, it is.

496
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,920
Everything is fine.

497
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,520
Going forward,

498
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,800
peering through a gap,

499
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,800
to see more clearly.

500
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,880
My bravery

501
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,160
with my courage

502
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,000
be together.

503
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,560
In my heart,

504
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,820
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

505
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,880
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

506
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,800
Fate only beckons.

507
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
But doesn't care

508
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
the result.

509
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,560
Trapped in the present

510
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,440
stuck in the present

511
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,360
down the unknown river

512
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,480
down the river,

513
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
the greater the desire,

514
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,560
the more you demand.

515
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
With full stomach,

516
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,360
they kept their mouths shut.

517
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
♪ Fate promised ♪

518
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,440
You'll change your mind.

519
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,400
Giving me sweet words

520
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,480
but lying to me.

521
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,400
You'd climb to Heaven...

522
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,080
And hides again.

523
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,400
Looking young.

524
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,760
And grey overnight.

525
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,350
Down the river

526
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,090
overnight, my hair turns grey.
