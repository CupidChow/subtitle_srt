Comrades!

5
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,400
Just wait for the news of my victory.

6
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,560
- Come.
- Come.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,340
Come on, Hu.

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,430
Give me your hand.

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:19,900
Be careful

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,150
a little bit.

11
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,130
- Put it in.
- Put it!

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,360
Put it in! Put!

13
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,380
Put it in.

14
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,130
Play it again!

15
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,060
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

16
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,080
Put it down.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,410
Slowly.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,220
Why is it dangling?

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,240
Keep dangling. Add more water.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,420
Are you sure about this?

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,120
I am sure that...

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,940
Release him!

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,980
Play it?

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,180
Ms. Yang, what's happening down here?

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
No signal.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,060
Is this the end?

27
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,940
Come on, slowly.

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,680
Come on.

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,100
Slowly.

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,260
Hu,

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,180
have you found any?

32
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,760
What's down there? Is it deep?

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,020
-Yes.
-Did you find something?

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
All of you, stop!

35
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
That's the nonsense!

36
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,740
What's going on?

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,480
Let's go out and talk about it.

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,440
In short,

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,660
that's basically

40
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,780
pretty much like that.

41
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,460
But it's not dangerous.

42
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,380
I...

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,680
Nothing bad happened to me.

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,060
So what do you think now?

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,760
Is there a tomb down there?

46
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm also a little uncertain.

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,900
And you can't see it.

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,220
Then what you told us just now

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,240
was not written in your book.

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,180
It's a lie.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,960
Is it the book

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
sixteen-character Feng Shui Magic Book you told me about?

53
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,860
Exactly.

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,840
Is that the book was handed down from our ancestors

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,660
I'm talking about

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,720
It's the Scroll of Heaven

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
scroll of Heavenly?

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
I followed the stars in the sky

59
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,020
we're in a land

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,400
blessed by a good star.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,180
That is to say, in this kind of place,

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
there must be tombs

63
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,380
there must be a tomb.

64
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,600
However

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,060
although there are water in the tomb,

66
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,020
so it was really

67
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,720
but this is too close.

68
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,160
So, I'm really not sure about it.

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,520
Maybe there's only

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,160
was just an escape

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,120
professor Chen, have you studied this before

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
like this before?

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,840
We study the Western Region culture.

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,840
Now that we have met,

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
we should go down and explore.

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,420
Even if it's for future excavation,

77
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,640
for the further excavation.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Right, Professor?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
I agree with Professor Hao.

80
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,800
If it wasn't for brother An Liman's leadership,

81
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to find this place...

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,020
For many years.

83
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,200
Since we've found it,

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,060
why don't we go down there

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,140
to check it out.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,220
Right.

87
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,540
Fine. Since that's the case,

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,520
I suggest that we take a break

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,980
we take a rest here.

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,820
It must be a long journey.

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's rest early and refresh ourselves.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
Let's go down there tomorrow

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
alright.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
Let's have a good rest today.

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Hu, Mr. Wang,

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,960
this is the vegetable soup

97
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,740
that Miss Yang prepared for us.

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,100
You two haven't had it yet.

99
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,140
Thanks. Thanks.

100
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,000
-Thank you.
-Have it while it's still warm.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Thank you.

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
-Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Miss Yang.
-Thank you.

103
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,580
You're welcome. Drink up.

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,100
-Give a grip on this one.
-Hey.

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,160
Make it strong.

106
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,040
-Slowly.
- Hey!

107
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,700
It's raining.

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,540
Come on.

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,560
Watch out.

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,420
Slowly.

111
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Be careful!

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,540
Uncle.

113
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,380
Would you like to go downstairs and take a look?

114
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,380
Your things

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,040
I don't understand.

116
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,340
I'd better go see my camel.

117
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Chu Jian.

118
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,900
How is it? Did we find it out?

119
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,600
Put it down.

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,820
Hu, come here.

121
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,140
Listen to me,

122
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,940
the people in ancient times would take live animals

123
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,740
to the sacrifice room and slaughtered them.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Then

125
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,220
they immediately paste the freshly peeled animal skins

126
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,000
to the crevice of the stone gate

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,620
to insulate the water vapor

128
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,540
and the items inside

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,820
and they can be preserved in a better way.

130
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,200
It seems that

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,860
no one has been here

132
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,060
In many years.

133
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,820
Slow down. Look how stupid you are.

134
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,080
How can you handle

135
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,100
what will you do?

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Come on, give me your hand.

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
We've checked everywhere.

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,100
There are no traps.

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Step on it properly.

140
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,080
Such a secluded place.

141
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,600
We can only find wise people.

142
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,660
You can't find her if you don't know.

143
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,580
Didn't we also bump into each other?

144
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,280
Fatty, come here.

145
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,320
Okay, I'm coming

146
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,100
professor Chen

147
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,340
then let's

148
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,780
the skins,

149
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,260
be careful not to break the skins.

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,820
Don't worry.

151
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,380
The leaflet, spread the moisture-proof cloth.

152
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,180
Alright.

153
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,460
Come on, slowly.

154
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,920
Stuff it under the bottom.

155
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,420
Take it easy.

156
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,380
One, two, go together.

157
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,300
Miss Yang,

158
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,740
go back first.

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
Now we put on the gas masks.

160
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,980
After that,

161
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,520
stand on both sides of the door.

162
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,260
- Got it.
- OK.

163
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,980
OK.

164
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,780
Here you are.

165
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,800
Come on, everybody shimmer to both sides.

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
One. Two.

167
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,120
Old Hu,

168
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,620
Isn't it ghosts?

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,040
How come it's ghostly?

170
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,580
Don't be afraid.

171
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,280
That's what they used in the past.

172
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,100
It used white phosphorus.

173
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,280
White phosphorus has a very low ignition point.

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,620
Will ignite spontaneously in air.

175
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,300
And then turn on the fuel light.

176
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,460
This is an ordinary tactic.

177
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,980
I'm not scared.

178
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,140
I just think it's too cruel.

179
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
Aren't you scared?

180
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,280
Her voice has changed.

181
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,620
Am I scared?

182
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,160
I was worried about everyone.

183
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,100
Isn't this a tomb?

184
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,300
Where is the coffin?

185
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,720
Are you all right?

186
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,760
Are you alright?

187
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,980
I'm alright

188
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,520
professor Chen

189
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,800
these should be

190
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,940
slaves buried alive

191
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,320
or prisoners or something

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,480
It seems that

193
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,200
a tomb.

194
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
It should be

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,840
a place of worship.

196
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,120
The customs of most small states in the Western Regions

197
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,300
be the same in essentials while differing in minor points

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,660
they will tie the criminals who break the law

199
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,040
In the desert to die of thirst.

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,420
After the bodies are completely dry,

201
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,720
put them here.

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,560
And then the blood of the slaughtered animals

203
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,860
on these mummies.

204
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
This is so miserable.

205
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Luckily, we're born in a new society.

206
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,080
The evil old society

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,860
Is so barbaric.

208
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,600
Fascist.

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,740
This was very common

210
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,460
In a slave society.

211
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,180
It's Sam.

212
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,860
Hey!

213
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,420
Give me the magnifying glass.

214
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,040
It's coming.

215
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,640
Miss, here you are.

216
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
I smacked it around just now.

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,440
These are

218
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
but these mummies,

219
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,220
except these mummies.

220
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,480
Not even a broken jar.

221
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,540
There isn't even a broken jar.

222
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,140
What are you thinking about?

223
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,940
I don't have any.

224
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,120
We're helping the archaeology team.

225
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,480
I want to see more things

226
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
to see more things?

227
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I have to believe it.

228
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,040
If the book

229
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
In the book?

230
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,640
There's really a tomb.

231
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,660
I'm surprised too.

232
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
According to the book,

233
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,380
like the one about Daji last night,

234
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,240
there must be a big tomb

235
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,660
It can't be

236
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,100
where the worship hall

237
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,320
we both really had bad luck.

238
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,800
You will never see the coffin

239
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
the coffin won't be visible.

240
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,380
Is there another mechanism?

241
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,840
What are you talking about?

242
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,140
Nothing.

243
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I believe that

244
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,140
he couldn't be wrong.

245
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,280
But in the tomb,

246
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,800
where is the coffin?

247
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,460
There must be one in the tomb chamber.

248
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,060
It's just probably not here.

249
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,560
If it's not here,

250
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,440
I have to try the water first.

251
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,620
Don't give up. Let's look for it.

252
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,200
Maybe there's something

253
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,660
that we haven't found yet.

254
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,260
Ancient people really are so idle.

255
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,340
And preventing people from worshipping them in a tomb.

256
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,460
To keep it that close.

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,500
The grandchild wants to come to worship.

258
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,480
But still can't find them.

259
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,740
I mean, every scene

260
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,120
all the details.

261
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Enough, don't bother.

262
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
Just let me say a few words.

263
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm so annoyed.

264
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,080
What's the matter?

265
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm fine. It's all right.

266
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,020
Are you alright?

267
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,600
It's fine, go ahead with your business.

268
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,900
That's good.

269
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,500
- Being patriotic.
- Hey.

270
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,740
Look at these.

271
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,620
This kind of shape and craft

272
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,260
are characterized by

273
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,680
and the times they're from.

274
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
That's right, Miss.

275
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,140
Take the notes.

276
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,180
- Hey.
-Hey.

277
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,080
Professor Chen

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,340
come on

279
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,500
Is it like a lid?

280
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,260
It could be.

281
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,240
Maybe the tomb is down there.

282
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,900
Don't jump to any conclusion.

283
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,480
Hu, you don't have to go in the water anymore.

284
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,180
Come on, help!
- Hey!

285
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,780
It's a ring.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
This could pull it apart

287
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,320
come on, move.

288
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,320
Come on, let's four.

289
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,280
One, two, three.

290
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,780
One, two,

291
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,300
hold on, hold on.

292
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,980
Alright.

293
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,820
Try again.

294
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,880
Try again.

295
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,600
Come on. Try it again.

296
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,620
- One, two, three.
- Three.

297
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,320
Be careful.

298
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,580
Turn around.

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay, put it there.

300
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Sir, there's really a layer down here.

301
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Look at this.

302
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,380
What's down there?

303
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,480
Can't see clearly

304
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,220
well, let's move it over there.

305
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,540
-Come on. One, two, three.
- Three.

306
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,500
One, two, three!

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,020
Sa, get the ladder.

308
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,100
Hey!

309
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,380
Don't worry.

310
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,840
Go down and take a look.

311
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm not worried.

312
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm just curious about the bottom.

313
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
And worried about the top.

314
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,560
What are you talking about?

315
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,380
Nothing.

316
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,820
Give me the koumiss of yours.

317
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,880
Not much.

318
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,280
Hu, you're really a genius at archaeology.

319
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,040
If you said there's a tomb down there,

320
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,440
Is there a tomb?

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,640
You're familiar with tombs.

322
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,500
-So Hu.
-The professor Chen

323
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,820
let's go down and take a look.

324
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,980
Fatty and I will go first.

325
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,720
We'll go down one by one.

326
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
Don't follow him too closely.

327
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,900
CAUTION

328
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,140
- Come on.
- Come on.

329
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,180
- Come on.
- Come on.

330
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,080
-Slowly.
- Hold it tight.

331
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,800
Slowly.

332
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,320
Slowly.

333
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,640
I will do it.

334
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,900
Take it easy.

335
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,760
Why are you here first?

336
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,880
Professor Hao,

337
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
slow down! Be careful!

338
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,200
Slowly!

339
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,020
Professor,

340
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,720
look at the tombs.

341
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,560
It's strange.

342
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,160
It seems to be a tomb form

343
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,660
that has long been lost.

344
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,060
Why did this guy

345
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,300
as a crazy person?

346
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,440
Come down and check this coffin.

347
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,060
I always think

348
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,180
hao is an antique.

349
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,840
He's like a child.

350
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,480
Specious and nondescript.

351
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,560
Look at that crazy man!

352
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,280
Luckily, there's no booby trap here.

353
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,760
Hu, you're incredible.

354
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,260
How come there is a tomb?

355
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,360
These four squares.

356
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
This is strange.

357
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,400
Slowly.

358
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,020
Teacher, come and have a look.

359
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,000
That's amazing.

360
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,080
-Slowly.
-Hey!

361
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,100
Hu's coffin is so big.

362
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,600
There must be some treasure inside.

363
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,040
These murals are magnificent.

364
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,720
Don't get any ideas!

365
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,840
I know

366
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,960
professor Chen is here

367
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,200
and I can't take anything

368
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,760
but I always learn something new.

369
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,140
Look at the mural.

370
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,900
Restrain yourself.

371
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,500
OK, OK.

372
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,280
What is recorded in this painting

373
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,560
related to Jingjie Ancient City?

374
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,860
This

375
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,540
this must be Prince Gumo's tomb.

376
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,620
This way.

377
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,840
What do you think of this tomb?

378
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,700
This must be the first one.

379
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,440
Any noble tomb

380
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,600
are more luxurious than

381
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,800
the tomb of General in Black Wind.

382
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,620
Great minds think alike

383
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,560
gumo was a small state

384
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,660
among the 36 states in the ancient West Region.

385
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,080
It's also a great dependent state.

386
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,580
They're oppressed a lot.

387
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,640
They offered huge treasures

388
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
to Queen Jingjie every year

389
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,500
and sheep and slaves.

390
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,900
The painters of these murals

391
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,660
has great skills.

392
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,400
It's gorgeous and vivid.

393
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,380
Even without the notes,

394
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,420
the mural is clear and vivid.

395
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,300
Through the mural,

396
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,220
through the mural

397
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
about the events and people in the painting.

398
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,300
This is Prince Gumo.

399
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,880
To meet the Queen.

400
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,340
He wants to reduce the taxes of his subjects.

401
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,760
The Queen refused to see him.

402
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,560
Prince Gumo

403
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,660
the embodiment of the sun god of war.

404
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,340
He sneaked into the Demon State alone

405
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,260
and wanted to kill the Queen of Jinjie.

406
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,520
Then I found

407
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,200
a shocking secret.

408
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,520
This painting is really strange.

409
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,700
Prince Gumo is snooping around the corner.

410
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,220
The other paintings in front

411
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,660
the queen wore a veil in the front paintings.

412
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
And in this painting

413
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,300
the Marvelous Queen is just a silhouette.

414
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,920
Raise the veil with one hand

415
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,800
there's someone like her

416
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,080
like a slave or something.

417
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,900
Became blurred

418
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,700
as before.

419
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
The queen

420
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,060
Is a banshee.

421
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,340
A banshee?

422
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,920
That's interesting. Tell me your thoughts.

423
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
This mural is the most difficult

424
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,980
of all the murals to understand.

425
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,220
Of the queen in the mural

426
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,960
she lifted the veil in front of her face

427
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
the person opposite becomes a dotted line.

428
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,000
She might be a slave,

429
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
or an assassin.

430
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,780
Is an enemy that the Queen wants to get rid of.

431
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,060
Miss Yang,

432
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,900
you mean that

433
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,200
the woman in the painting

434
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,040
disappeared for her look

435
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,000
and then he disappeared.

436
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,080
Yes

437
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,560
so you decided that

438
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,260
the queen is a banshee.

439
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,040
I think the queen in the painting

440
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,480
took one look at the person opposite

441
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,680
and he disappeared.

442
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,360
A living person loses its head

443
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,620
for glancing at someone

444
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,800
and then disappeared.

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,320
This isn't too...

446
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,780
Spread fallacies to deceive people

447
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I mean, it's

448
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,740
It's really incredible.

449
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,260
This is hard for ordinary people to understand.

450
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,040
It's just my guess.

451
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,440
But my guess

452
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,640
was not groundless.

453
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,140
My father liked to read a book

454
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,880
a book called Records of the Western Regions of Tang Dynasty,

455
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,040
It was written by Xuanzang, a famous monk in the Tang Dynasty.

456
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,640
I have read it several times.

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
There are many legends

458
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,100
about the ancient Western Regions.

459
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,560
One of them

460
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,380
about the legend of the queen of the desert.

461
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,520
I was very impressed.

462
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,860
Ms. Yang, please tell us about it.

463
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,340
Yeah, tell us about it!

464
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,160
Deep in the desert, there is a city.

465
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
There is a people

466
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,620
It was a people from the underground.

467
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,340
They rule

468
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,940
all the small states around it.

469
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,780
Hundreds of years later,

470
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,880
the throne passed to the last queen.

471
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,040
It's said that the queen's eyes

472
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,500
Is the gateway to the underworld.

473
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,100
Once she takes one look at her enemy,

474
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,000
she would

475
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,580
without a trace.

476
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,600
No one knows

477
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,020
no one knows.

478
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,780
Isn't that dead?

479
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,720
And their bones are still there.

480
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,480
They just disappear.

481
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,620
I guess the story

482
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,440
will have

483
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,120
a more magical ending.

484
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,300
The queen ruled with coercion

485
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,280
she wanted all the people in the neighboring countries

486
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,020
to worship her

487
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,420
like the True God.

488
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,200
All those who resisted will be killed.

489
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,120
Maybe her action

490
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,260
angered the gods.

491
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,980
After suffering for a few years,

492
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,220
and eventually died of a strange disease.

493
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,000
Once she died, the slaves

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,060
and the neighboring countries oppressed by the queen

495
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,220
form a coalition

496
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,200
to wipe out Queen Jinzhan's city.

497
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,380
The coalition forces are going to destroy

498
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,320
the queen's tomb.

499
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,680
At this time, the world changes color.

500
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,360
The terrible sands will swallow up

501
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,980
even the imperial city.

502
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,680
The queen's tomb

503
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
and the countless treasures she'd plundered

504
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,700
buried under the sands.

505
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,740
After hundreds of years,

506
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,280
some travelers passing by

507
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,340
who take anything at will

508
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,860
will trigger a desert storm.

509
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,200
When the clouds and mist arise, the road gets lost.

510
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,960
The man with the queen's treasure

511
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,600
can never leave the desert.

512
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,100
But according to legend,

513
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,260
the mysterious capital city,

514
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,420
the evil queen.

515
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,260
The time and background and so on.

516
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,840
It's not recorded in books.

517
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,380
The murals in the tomb

518
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,700
and records in books

519
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,360
and these ancient legends were added to it.

520
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,400
There are many similarities

521
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,840
between the two.

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,900
I don't think it's a legend.

523
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,100
It must be

524
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,480
what really happened.

525
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,900
Well

526
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,500
the later murals

527
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,800
In the later murals

528
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
the prince's assassination

529
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,080
failed.

530
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,240
After he returned to China, he continued his plan

531
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
how to get rid of the queen.

532
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,560
Then he met

533
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,480
from a faraway country.

534
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,640
The diviner asked Prince

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,060
to hide a special chronic poison

536
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,580
Into the golden lamb

537
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,500
and gave it to the queen.

538
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,920
As expected, not long after,

539
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,540
the news that the queen died suddenly came.

540
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
But the prince

541
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,320
passed away prematurely

542
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,300
passed away prematurely.

543
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,580
He and his beloved wife

544
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,660
will be buried together.

545
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,740
The soothsayer designed

546
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,880
designed a tomb for him,

547
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,900
and bury them under the altar

548
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,900
my understanding of Professor Chen?

549
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,940
Great! Your analysis is perfect

550
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,080
the girl who took the picture speaks colloquially

551
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,700
-My father is the same as Professor Chen
-Learning?

552
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,660
I have been studying for my whole life.
-all my life.

553
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,800
The cultures from the Western Regions,

554
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,280
especially the essence culture.

555
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,200
I've learned a lot since childhood.

556
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,240
I agree with the professor.

557
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,920
That the queens in these paintings

558
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,180
Is the Queen of Perfection.

559
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,320
The murals that followed

560
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,320
confirmed our speculation

561
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,060
teacher, what's wrong?

562
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,680
Nothing.

563
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,860
I just remembered a lot of memories

564
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,340
many things about her father.

565
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,620
Sorry about that.

566
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,880
Uncle Chen,

567
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,180
If everything goes smoothly,

568
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,380
find the Jingjue Town

569
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,040
my father's soul in heaven

570
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
will also rest in peace.

571
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,860
Professor.

572
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,700
Take care of yourself. Don't get excited.

573
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,220
We have gained a lot this time.

574
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,760
I've learned more about

575
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,540
of a substantive

576
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,720
a breakthrough in the future,

577
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,500
I believe that we will definitely

578
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,540
find the Jingjue Town.

579
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,960
-Yes. -Yes.
-Sure.

580
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,120
That's right.

581
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,200
It's full of passion.

582
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,780
But everyone,

583
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,240
I'd like to ask you a question.

584
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,080
Since the legendary

585
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,820
was a banshee,

586
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,340
will we still need

587
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,560
look for her tomb?

588
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,380
That's right.

589
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,840
If she's a banshee,

590
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,420
let's look for her tomb.

591
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,840
That will be a sitting duck.

592
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,820
These are just legends.

593
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,040
With our inferences,

594
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,840
Isn't necessarily the truth.

595
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,200
Miss Yang, you just said that

596
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,540
that's how archaeology works.

597
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,020
Ancient legends, historical records,

598
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,140
unearthed relic

599
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,660
and scholars speculated that

600
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,860
the more information we have, the richer it is.

601
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,280
The closer we will be

602
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,340
the truth of history.

603
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
We archaeologists...

604
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,120
Use scientific methods

605
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,420
to find answers to

606
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,260
to those enigma?

607
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,040
You're right Professor Chen

608
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,700
scientific.

609
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,840
As a

610
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,340
materialist atheist,

611
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,020
this is something that

612
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,460
Is so advanced today,

613
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,680
It's hard to believe that

614
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
her Majesty was so smart

615
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,760
and this guy just disappeared.

616
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
That's unscientific.

617
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,140
It's very unscientific.

618
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,220
There is a special phenomenon

619
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,940
In the American state of Kansas.

620
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,280
And Pathology Research Center

621
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,960
had a strange patient

622
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,200
In the hospital.

623
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
A 12-year-old boy.

624
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,480
He has superpower since childhood.

625
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,060
If he stares at an object

626
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,120
object less than 5 cm in diameter,

627
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
will disappear,

628
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,920
as if it evaporates in the air.

629
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,700
Look at this.

630
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,780
I said there were aliens.

631
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,860
Aren't they aliens?

632
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,000
Prof., the aliens are in USA.
-Let Miss Yang finish first.

633
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,360
No one actually said that

634
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,800
the little boy was an alien.

635
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,100
But his neighbor

636
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,460
took him as an alien

637
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,140
his parents were also deeply disturbed.

638
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,440
Later, scientists studied

639
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
the boy's brain waves

640
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,180
are different from ordinary people.

641
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,360
His cerebral nerve and optic nerve

642
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,640
can produce the energy to carry things.

643
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,100
With such a superpower,

644
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
that's one part

645
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
one in three billion.

646
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
Do you mean that

647
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
the queen

648
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,560
has such a superpower.

649
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Then a researcher

650
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,140
came up with an idea

651
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,740
to make a magnetic helmet

652
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,920
a magnetic helmet for a boy

653
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,100
on his head.

654
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,580
One year later,

655
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,240
he lost his superpower.

656
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,600
This is amazing.
-Did you see that, Hu?

657
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,980
So this can cure it.

658
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,040
It's mainly because of the queen.

659
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,640
She's late.

660
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,240
Stop causing trouble.

661
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,660
How can we confirm

662
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,840
the queen in this mural

663
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,940
Is the legendary

664
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,080
the Perfect Queen

665
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
I can be sure

666
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,820
Is the special clothing

667
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,080
of the essence,

668
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,500
and fancy building decorations.

669
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,460
These are strong evidence.

670
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,920
Look at the last few murals.

671
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,100
These exquisite murals

672
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,280
It's really a treasure of our national culture.

673
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,680
Very valuable

674
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,460
this is priceless.

675
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,920
Belongs to the country,

676
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,200
the nation,

677
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
and all mankind.

678
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,940
Is it necessary to say so much?

679
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,160
Everyone.

680
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,300
I said we didn't have to

681
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,060
recall the past in graves

682
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,320
and imagine the future.

683
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,480
That's right.

684
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
I think

685
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,580
let's open this stone coffin first.

686
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,480
Since we're here,

687
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,660
I can also help.

688
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,220
Absolutely not.

689
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,320
Prince Gumo and his wife are buried together

690
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,600
In the same coffin.

691
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,060
This kind of tomb with the same coffin

692
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,260
It's rare and a national treasure.

693
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,080
We don't have the conditions to open the coffin now.

694
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,340
Once it is opened,

695
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,200
the sealed coffin and the funerary items inside

696
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,820
and the funerary objects inside

697
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,820
professor Hao,

698
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,420
later, you take the students

699
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,580
and take notes.

700
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,600
I'll write a report back and submit it

701
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,140
and submit it to our superior for evaluation.

702
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,320
To apply for excavation.

703
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,620
Or

704
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,820
to protect them.

705
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,440
These are precious

706
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,220
of ancient civilization.

707
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,160
Professor Chen, we're already here

708
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,800
It's a piece of cake

709
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,740
certainly not.

710
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,100
Absolutely not.

711
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,400
Absolutely not.

712
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,220
What awareness do you have, Wang?

713
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,940
Can a relic like this be

714
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,460
be opened easily?

715
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
We'll listen to the experts.

716
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,640
We have to listen to the experts.

717
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
Hey, hey!

718
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,400
Shirley

719
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,660
what's the matter?

720
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,800
The notebook

721
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,460
don't you want to see

722
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,940
the desert engulfed the capital

723
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,600
the city and its army together.

724
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,760
The Zagorama Valley.

725
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,820
This is Jinjie Ancient City?

726
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,040
Jinjie Ancient City?

727
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
It's not far away from us.

728
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,820
It's not far away.

729
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,780
Great!

730
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,660
Professor

731
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,080
professor Chen, I'm coming down

732
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,080
you scared us to death

733
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
you scared me.

734
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,980
When I came down to check it,

735
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,100
and there was no one there.

736
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,300
I didn't expect there's another level down here.

737
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,160
Didn't you say you wouldn't come down?

738
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,740
I was worried about you.

739
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,540
Who asked you to come down?

740
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,420
Didn't I ask you to

741
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,620
to keep an eye on the old man?

742
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,140
No, I wanted to...

743
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,200
The old man is asleep.

744
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,900
I'm fine.

745
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,940
That's why I'm here

746
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,680
professor Chen

747
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,000
In that case,

748
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,080
we'll go up first.

749
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,980
Staying here won't be of much help.

750
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,060
You can call us

751
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,100
please call us at any time.

752
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay. You guys rest up first.

753
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's hurry up

754
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,760
and make notes.

755
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,940
-Let's begin. -OK.
-OK.

756
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,520
Ye Ye,

757
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,320
copy this.

758
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,620
-Here it.
- Give it to me.

759
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,500
Come on.

760
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,040
Fatty.

761
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,620
Don't mind me. Go and see the old man.

762
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,100
He can't run away.

763
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,320
Did you ask the old man

764
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,380
making something wrong?

765
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,760
The old man is so unpredictable.

766
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,680
And went forward,

767
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,060
peering through a gap,

768
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,350
to see more clearly.

769
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,390
My bravery

770
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,190
with my courage

771
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:26,190
be together.

772
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:34,220
In my heart,

773
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,140
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

774
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,980
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

775
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,330
Fate only beckons.

776
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,980
But doesn't care

777
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,870
the result.

778
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,980
Trapped in the present

779
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,470
stuck in the present

780
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,830
down the unknown river

781
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,450
down the river,

782
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,910
the greater the desire,

783
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,420
the more you demand.

784
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,010
With full stomach,

785
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,010
they kept their mouths shut.

786
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,820
♪ Fate promised ♪

787
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,400
You'll change your mind.

788
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,850
Giving me sweet words

789
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,430
but lying to me.

790
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,930
You'd climb to Heaven...

791
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,480
And hides again.

792
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,820
Looking young.

793
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,780
And grey overnight.

794
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,670
Down the river

795
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,410
overnight, my hair turns grey.
