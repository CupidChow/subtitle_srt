00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,850
Comrade Hu,

5
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,600
since the ancients relied on

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,560
based on mountains, waters, the moon, the stars

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,850
all the time.

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,730
We need to find those tombs

9
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,540
along the ancient Silk Road,

10
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,150
using the Star Feng Shui technique

11
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,160
Is the simplest and most effective way.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Professor Chen,

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
you know this business.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,170
Thank God

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,840
to send us such a talented person like you.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,940
Professor, you are too kind.

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,220
It's called fate.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,220
Let's talk about science instead of God.

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,950
Great!

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,800
Everyone

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,640
I announce that

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,520
comrade Hu.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,400
What's your name?

24
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,630
My name is Hu Bayi

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,120
alright.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,880
I announce that

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,600
hu Bayi, we will

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,320
from now on, you will officially

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,000
you'll officially join our archaeological team.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
Congratulations.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,650
Thanks.

32
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,770
Sorry.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,100
Sorry, Comrade Hu.

34
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,560
We intellectuals

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,170
are all ignorant.

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,090
Did you become a fool squatting in the kiln during the Cultural Revolution?

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,920
He can't speak.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,600
Don't take it to heart.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,580
-It's fine. It's fine.
-Don't take it to heart.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,420
Professor Hao, you're too kind.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
Good for you, Hu.

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,420
You have achieved amazing success.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,610
That's all I've got.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,680
He is talking nonsense in a serious manner.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,330
It is technical.

46
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,960
Hu, this is

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,680
let me make an introduction.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,220
These three are my students.

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,110
Come with us.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,880
He studied archaeology.

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,360
Nice to meet you.
- But as a hobby,

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,780
studying aliens.

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,690
Brother Hu,

54
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,480
are you interested in aliens?

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,060
Alien?

56
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,920
Yes, the aliens.

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,410
Thank God.

58
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,010
Enough.

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,040
Who is this?

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
I'm Chu Jian.

61
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,230
I'm good at climbing mountains.

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,950
Also,

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
your hair is awesome!

64
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,050
Thanks.

65
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,410
They are just recruited.

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,730
This Ye Yixin

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
she is one of the rare women

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,880
In our team.

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Archaeology has always been my dream.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,610
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hu.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Nice to meet you.

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,220
-Nice to meet you.

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,900
Mr. Hu is so learned.

74
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,810
Let me make the introduction.

75
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
This is Miss Yang,

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,600
the sponsor of our activity.

77
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,470
She will go with us.

78
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,010
She may be a girl,

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,820
she is a well-known

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,750
for the National Geographic Magazine.

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,450
= What's up? = Hello, how are you?

82
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,370
Mr. Hu, let's just speak Chinese.

83
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,480
You can just call me Shirley Yang.

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,470
The relics?

85
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,720
Did Mr. Wang come with Mr. Hu?

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
I wonder what Mr. Wang is capable of.

87
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,850
This trip to the desert is very important.

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
Our team doesn't need

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,680
people without special skills.

90
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,810
It's dangerous in the desert.

91
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,860
My friend is a good shooter,

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
what's the desert?

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,290
I destroyed bandits in Xinjiang.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,990
I killed all the bandits

95
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,430
to kill the bandits.

96
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,920
I even killed the bandits myself.

97
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,760
These are the spoils of war.

98
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,760
Xinjiang suppressed bandits before and after the founding of the state.

99
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,920
When was Mr. Wang born?

100
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,190
When was he born?

101
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,240
I joined the army a long time ago.
-Little Wang. -Wang,

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,740
-I'll tell you what, I...
- Comrade Wang...

103
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,920
Can I have a look at the jade?

104
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,120
No problem

105
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,890
have a look.

106
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,330
Don't break it.

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
Patriotic!

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,390
Take everyone out to get ready.

109
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,480
Alright.

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,030
-Let's get ready outside.
-OK.

111
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,720
Come on.

112
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,760
Alright.

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,680
Let Wang go together then.

114
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,460
Comrade Wang,

115
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,020
we believe in your ability.

116
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,070
The operation

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
the total salary of 10,000 USD per person will be

118
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,460
If we find the exquisite ancient city in the desert,

119
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,280
and double the amount.

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,490
What do you think?

121
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,870
I found it.

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
Just us $20,000 each.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,340
Yes

124
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,290
the Ancient City of Wisdom.

125
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,120
We will discuss the details when we have time.

126
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,650
What about

127
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,410
what do you think?

128
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,420
Alright, please stop here.

129
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,500
We won't see you off then.

130
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,410
Please go back and prepare for it.

131
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,460
I will inform you of the departure time.

132
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,960
Alright.

133
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,420
Little Chu,

134
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,260
send Hu back home.

135
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,860
Well

136
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,420
- Alright.
- See you.

137
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,100
See you then.

138
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,660
That jade is carved with Ghost Cave Script.

139
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,920
These are the script used by the Ghost Cave Clan.

140
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
These people

141
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,920
It was a minority from the ancient Western Region.

142
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,840
It is now extinct.

143
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,820
What exactly

144
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,390
on the jade is.

145
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,150
Needs further research.

146
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,200
I think the jade

147
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,710
might be related to the secrets of Ancient City.

148
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,720
But I am not sure yet.

149
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,710
Only when we find the notebook

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,210
could we have the answer.

151
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,630
I hope so.

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,680
Let's study the route.

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,980
Alright.

154
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,310
Boss.

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Two bowls of tea, please.

156
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,920
Come on.

157
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,530
He didn't even give me any water.

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm very thirsty.

159
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,440
Old Hu,

160
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,360
how much do you think I can make her with the jade?

161
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,720
If we find the ancient town,

162
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
20,000 U.S. dollars for each.

163
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,240
That's beautiful.

164
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,040
I've never heard of that ancient city.

165
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,600
And she's not stupid.

166
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,760
If it was easy to find him,

167
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,640
If it is easy to find it?

168
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,450
You mean we can't find the ancient city,

169
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
don't count on it

170
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,800
professor Chen is of his age

171
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,830
the second largest mobile desert in the world?

172
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,870
These intellectuals

173
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,560
your body wouldn't be able to stand

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
the severe test in the desert.

175
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,130
I lied about the probability of finding it on purpose.

176
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,650
They might fail to

177
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,270
If they want to come back,

178
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,450
It won't be our fault, will it?

179
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,050
That means we can travel around

180
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,780
10,000 dollars each.

181
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,430
Are you secretly happy?

182
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,060
Boss.

183
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,820
Come on, one more bowl.

184
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,360
Here it comes.

185
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,420
Want it?

186
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,930
No.

187
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,590
"Nine, don't!"

188
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,100
No.

189
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,880
10.

190
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,700
He loves the country.

191
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,680
Two.

192
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,270
Here comes the mentor.

193
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,840
-You want five?
-The professor...

194
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,180
Are you playing poker?

195
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's play,

196
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,370
comrade Hu,

197
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,120
I need to talk to you.

198
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,750
Alright.

199
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,700
Go on, go on.

200
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,170
Have a seat.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
I... I'll play the first part.

202
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Same here.

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,610
Three nine with one Q.

204
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,640
-Hey. -You...
- Do you want to...?

205
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Three K and a nine.

206
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,340
It's finished.

207
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Hey, do you know how to play?

208
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,340
You're playing three with one now.

209
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,620
It's just a card.

210
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,190
No, no. He's stupid. He knew it.

211
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,790
Ye Hua, give me a hand.

212
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,990
I need to go to the toilet.

213
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,170
- It's over. - Stop.

214
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,610
-It stinks.
-I'll do it. -I will.

215
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,180
That the Kunlun glacier

216
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,630
why didn't you tell us that you were going to take a route?

217
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
We have been discussing about it.

218
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,690
What's up

219
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,690
do you have smoke?

220
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,880
Yes, there is.

221
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,880
Old Hu,

222
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,440
what exactly is going on?

223
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,320
Please tell me

224
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,340
professor Chen said we'll be diverted

225
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,210
he asked us to follow them to the Kunlun Glacier.

226
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,040
Kunlun Glacier?

227
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,950
It was so cold there.

228
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
What did you say then?

229
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,810
I won't go.

230
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,360
Old Hu,

231
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,600
In fact, I think

232
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
It doesn't matter.

233
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,960
We can go to one more place

234
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
and ask her to pay more, right?

235
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,450
It can't be for nothing.

236
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,730
I told you I wouldn't go.

237
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,270
What's up

238
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,570
I served in the army there.

239
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,460
I know how dangerous it is.

240
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,070
70 years.

241
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,980
I had just joined the army.

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,810
The army sent us to the Tibetan Plateau

243
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,600
the Kunlun Mountain Pass.

244
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,860
The whole division has been transformed into an engineering unit.

245
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,370
Strange things happened back then.

246
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,930
I don't want to think about them until now.

247
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,560
Or I don't dare to think about them.

248
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,100
Because until today,

249
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,280
until today.

250
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,080
One day, I was delivering supplies

251
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,110
my comrades in arms and I went to deliver supplies.

252
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,490
The car was in good condition when we set off.

253
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,100
But there was an accident on the way.

254
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,110
-Lan. Drive slowly.
-Hey.

255
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,610
Nothing, monitor.

256
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,890
Today is going well.

257
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,460
I'll probably be there before dark.

258
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,920
Monitor.

259
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
What is it?

260
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,920
Can you see it clearly?

261
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
I can't see clearly.

262
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,240
It seems like a blue light.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,400
How can there be live insects in a world of ice?

264
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,520
Monitor.

265
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,210
What's this?

266
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,520
I don't know.

267
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,410
They don't look like fireflies.

268
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,770
Wait for me.

269
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,960
Monitor.

270
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,900
It looks nice, right?

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,700
Let's go back

272
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,880
and show them to your comrades.

273
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,580
What happened?

274
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,670
I don't know.

275
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,990
Try lighting the fire.

276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,320
Wait, wait, hold on.

277
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,460
-Little Luan!
-Hey!

278
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,230
The high pressure tubing collapsed.

279
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,410
That's impossible.

280
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,200
I checked before leaving.

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,280
There's a military station ahead.

282
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,450
I'll go there to ask for help.

283
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,140
You stay here.

284
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,100
Keep the supplies safe.

285
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,600
Alright.

286
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,960
Put on your overcoat, don't freeze.

287
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Don't worry, Class Rep.

288
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,690
What on earth is that blue thing?

289
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,700
No idea.

290
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,580
It's like a ladybug.

291
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,480
But no one could make it clear.

292
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,690
At dawn, I brought the troops back from the military station

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
but I will never forget

294
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,490
will never be forgotten in my life.

295
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,350
Little Luan.

296
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,100
Little Luan.

297
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,700
Little Luan.

298
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,120
Little Luan.

299
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,430
And burned to death.

300
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,530
The conclusion of the army is that

301
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,490
that during the mission,

302
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,820
we encountered some criminals.

303
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,850
She confirmed the martyr

304
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,140
the martyr

305
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,680
but I thought that

306
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,560
his death must be related to the ladybug.

307
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,870
What happened after that

308
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,720
has proved my point.

309
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,330
You encountered that stuff again later.

310
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Mr. Hu and Mr. Wang.

311
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,250
Can you come to my place?

312
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,660
I need to talk to you.

313
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,080
The Americans eavesdrop on us.

314
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,260
Come on.

315
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,420
Come in.

316
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,910
Have a seat.

317
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,460
Come on.

318
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,720
Sit down.

319
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,110
Mr. Hu,

320
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,860
Is this the bug you saw?

321
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,500
(Fire ladybug)

322
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,950
Hu, is that it?

323
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,430
Yes, that's it.

324
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,550
This bug is called

325
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,240
the Beat on Fire.

326
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,020
Which is translated into Chinese as Fire Ladybug.

327
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,920
Now it's only found on the records

328
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,900
and archaeologists' records.

329
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,850
These are just scattered information.

330
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,260
For many people,

331
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
for many people.

332
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,130
Mr. Hu,

333
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,420
have you actually seen a fire ladybug?

334
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,680
That's right.

335
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,400
Hu,

336
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,020
can you tell us

337
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
your experience back then?

338
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,200
That year, our squad

339
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,730
were ordered to carry out a top-secret mission.

340
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
The Kunlun glacier was deep.

341
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,790
But there was an accident on the way.

342
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,850
One of our comrade surnamed Zhou

343
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,300
slipped and fell into the glacier.

344
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,300
- Xiao Zhou.
- Xiao Zhou. - Zhou.

345
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,300
- Little Zhou!
- Zhou.

346
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,760
Xiao Zhou.

347
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,930
Zhou.

348
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,480
Be careful

349
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,730
watching the burning of living

350
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,370
Is too cruel.

351
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,290
Several young soldiers

352
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,540
they opened fire unconsciously.

353
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,630
Countless fire ladybugs

354
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
turned into blue fireballs and rushed towards us.

355
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
We had to run and shoot.

356
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,720
And we triggered the avalanche.

357
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,270
Run now.

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,450
When I woke up,

359
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,620
I was already lying in the military hospital.

360
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,520
But all my comrades in arms

361
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,720
I don't understand

362
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,240
why you diverted to go there?

363
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Didn't we agree to go to the desert?

364
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,930
We said we were going to find the Ancient City of Excelsior.

365
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,780
That's right.

366
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,040
You Americans like to change around.

367
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,180
Comrade Hu.

368
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,680
Here is the thing.

369
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,320
The avalanche back then

370
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,800
was caused by an earthquake of not high level,

371
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,840
It's not because

372
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,140
I saw it in an internal file.

373
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,330
And it was also confirmed by the State Geological Bureau.

374
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,680
The earthquake also caused a crack

375
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,320
along the east foot of the Kunlun Glacier.

376
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,560
So, does this have anything to do

377
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
with our search for Ancient City?

378
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,890
Several years ago, a Sino-foreign joint inspection team

379
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,320
an expedition to Xinjiang

380
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,500
the team leader was an old friend of mine.

381
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,610
Is obsessed with Western culture.

382
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,550
But on their way to

383
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,110
In the desert in search of the ancient city of Jingjue

384
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,540
I don't know why I changed my route

385
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,010
to the Kunlun Glacier.

386
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,510
And then disappeared.

387
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,680
And no one returned.

388
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,680
How can we know

389
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
they might have disappeared.

390
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,770
The last distress signal

391
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,810
came from the east foot of the Kunlun Glacier.

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,050
So we analyze that

393
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,430
their missing is related to the crack

394
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,350
cracked by the east foot of the Kunlun Glacier.

395
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,180
What are we looking for through it?

396
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,500
A notebook.

397
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,400
The diary of Mr. Walter,

398
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,350
at the beginning of this century.

399
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,170
He recorded in the diary

400
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,720
how they found

401
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,380
find the Ancient City?

402
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,250
Will help us

403
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,620
to go to the desert and find the Ancient City

404
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,350
to you.

405
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,510
I'm not just going to the glacier

406
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,460
not only to find information,

407
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,610
because I want to complete my father's journey.

408
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,560
I want to find out why they went to the Kunlun Glacier.

409
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,620
And find out the secret of Jingjie Ancient City.

410
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,640
Your father was the leader of the inspection team.

411
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,540
This is a rare chance.

412
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,140
If we can find the ancient city,

413
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,970
and complete our archaeological research.

414
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,680
Many historical mysteries will be opened.

415
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,670
It will turn a new page for the study of the culture of the Western Regions.

416
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,760
I understand this.

417
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
You're doing it for your family.

418
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,550
And the other for your scientific research.

419
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,310
Then this matter really has nothing to do with us.

420
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,880
However,

421
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,520
I can't say no to this.

422
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,800
As you said,

423
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,090
It's indeed dangerous.

424
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,470
Right, Hu?

425
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,160
How about this?

426
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,210
Give me some more money.

427
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,280
Five thousand.

428
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,850
What about

429
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,190
In that case,

430
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,250
please get off at the next stop.

431
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,510
I know that it's dangerous

432
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
and this really has nothing

433
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,550
has nothing to do with you.

434
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,870
I'll go with you.

435
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,370
Didn't you say you weren't going?

436
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,620
Why changed your mind again?

437
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,480
What were your thoughts?

438
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,270
I heard that

439
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,160
It makes me realize one thing.

440
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,720
I thought after all these years,

441
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,190
the pain and struggle of my comrades

442
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,070
I can now face them.

443
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,270
But the result didn't work.

444
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,540
Old Hu,

445
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,910
the happiest thing

446
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,650
If you stay alive.

447
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,710
I know all the reasons.

448
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,760
But I feel sorry for them.

449
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,260
Each of them

450
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,070
had an absolute reason to live.

451
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,660
But I'm the last survivor.

452
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,170
Many of my comrades in arms

453
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,580
bought this with their lives.

454
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,770
But now I don't even have the courage

455
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,840
to visit them now.

456
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,950
I can't do it.

457
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,080
So I think I should go.

458
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,970
I know.

459
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,750
Alright.

460
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
Let's go if you want.

461
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,390
But Fatty, listen to me.

462
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,150
This has nothing to do with you.

463
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,120
You should stay here.

464
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,920
What does this mean?

465
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,900
Nothing. It's too dangerous.

466
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,190
I shouldn't drag you into this.

467
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,230
You are looking down upon me.

468
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,000
Certainly not.

469
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,900
I know you're not afraid of anything.

470
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,210
But I still can't take you there.

471
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,090
Cut the crap!

472
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,310
We've come here.

473
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,810
No matter what, we have to be together.

474
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,850
You know what, Mr. Hu?

475
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,240
When you enlisted in the army in 1970,

476
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
you know what I'm most afraid of?

477
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,800
I'm only afraid that you'll

478
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,880
If you were going to fight,

479
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,010
we can never see each other again.

480
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,100
We lost touch in the intervening years.

481
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,030
I can't stay in the Niuxin Mountain anymore.

482
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,210
In 1979,

483
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,160
you are going to the front.

484
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,240
I didn't say anything in the letter, did I?

485
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,560
I don't have nothing to say.

486
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm full of words.

487
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,690
I don't know what to say.

488
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,390
I'm afraid to bring bad luck out of it.

489
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm afraid you won't come back.

490
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,160
You don't know

491
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,950
I was really happy

492
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,160
that you were chased back by the troops.

493
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm as happy as your father.

494
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,800
Fatty.

495
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,560
Old Hu,

496
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,700
chairman Mao said that

497
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,980
It's enjoyable to fight against heaven and earth.

498
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,850
What's a little Kunlun glacier to me?

499
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,640
Hu Bayi, you know what

500
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,160
you want to leave me? No way!

501
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,560
Fatty.

502
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,290
You have less money

503
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,000
professor Chen, be careful

504
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
-I'll leave first
-I will wait for your triumphant return.

505
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,300
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Be careful.

506
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,130
Be careful on the way.

507
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,320
- Be safe.
-OK, OK.

508
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,860
Thank you.

509
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,740
- Complete the task.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

510
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,410
See you later.

511
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,330
We are leaving.

512
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,620
Take care of yourself and come back early.

513
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,490
Everyone follow me.

514
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,200
Hey, Big Brother.

515
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,170
Let's take a break.

516
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,700
Have a rest here, everyone.

517
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,970
Comrade Ga Wa.

518
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,700
Do you think

519
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,720
how far is it from the ice cave

520
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,280
the ice cave we're looking for?

521
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,580
Professor, please stop giving me an hard time.

522
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,980
Three hours ago,

523
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,850
was already beyond our patrol range.

524
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,530
But our instructor said

525
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,160
the road we are taking

526
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,710
were forged by our predecessors

527
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,280
to build the secret base.

528
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,400
It's useless now.

529
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,160
Ga Wa,

530
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,000
what are you talking about?

531
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,440
You can't talk about a secret base.

532
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,610
Tall Comrade, don't worry.

533
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,880
It won't be ridiculous.

534
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,380
I won't.

535
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,080
It's not a secret

536
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,930
professor Chen is a good guy

537
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
so, you are saying that

538
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,840
you don't know

539
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,640
whether that cave even exists, right?

540
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,850
Don't talk about me.

541
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Big is a veteran.

542
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,830
He didn't even know

543
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,440
he might not have come to that far place.

544
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,430
We've been following Brother Hu.

545
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,180
Serve the People

546
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,030
this was your comrade's belonging.

547
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,680
Watch your feet.

548
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,520
Come.

549
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,730
Look at this.

550
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,050
And went forward,

551
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,860
peering through a gap,

552
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,150
to see more clearly.

553
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,190
My bravery

554
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,990
with my courage

555
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:53,990
be together.

556
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:02,020
In my heart,

557
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,940
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

558
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,780
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

559
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,130
Fate only beckons.

560
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,780
But doesn't care

561
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,670
the result.

562
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,780
Trapped in the present

563
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,270
stuck in the present

564
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,630
down the unknown river

565
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,250
down the river,

566
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,710
the greater the desire,

567
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,220
the more you demand.

568
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,810
With full stomach,

569
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,810
they kept their mouths shut.

570
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,620
♪ Fate promised ♪

571
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,200
You'll change your mind.

572
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,650
Giving me sweet words

573
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,230
but lying to me.

574
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,730
You'd climb to Heaven...

575
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,280
And hides again.

576
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,620
Looking young.

577
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,580
And grey overnight.

578
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,470
Down the river

579
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,210
overnight, my hair turns grey.
