4
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,420
You shouldn't

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,040
to satisfy a gentleman.

6
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,840
You can say whatever you want.

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,880
We are safe if he doesn't run.

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
This is the most important thing.

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,700
Enough.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,700
He has a lot of faults.

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,080
But this can be called

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,100
the living map of the desert,

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,560
Is definitely not empty.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,980
As you saw this time,

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,180
we can't live in the desert without him.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,960
Be more polite to others.

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,820
Alright, got it.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,740
Back to business.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,500
You heard what the experts said

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,520
what the experts said, right?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,180
They are

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,340
don't touch anything

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,600
am I right?

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,520
Exactly.

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,420
What?

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,800
Why are we here then?

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,140
If you think so,

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,180
when they come out,

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,080
tell them

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
let's turn around.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm willing to take $10,000 from her.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,360
I've always told you

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
to go back.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,060
Do you really...

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,560
Of course, yes.

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,460
But listen to me, Fatty.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I think

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
they will keep moving forward.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
Why?

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,740
Look at their state.

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
They just found Prince Gumo's tomb.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
He's a member of Jinjie State.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
And already so excited.

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,740
Do you think they'll go back?

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,720
It's your fault.

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,060
Just showing off?

47
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,620
If you find a tomb like this in the future,

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
don't just write it down.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
We can do it ourselves later.

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,620
Virtue.

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,260
But to be honest,

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
I heard they said that

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,080
It's mysterious.

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,500
I want to take a look at the

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,540
to see what secrets

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,860
In this ancient city

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,040
are you not interested at all?

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
Not me at all.

59
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,580
Didn't you hear she's a female enchantress?

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,100
What if it's Vixen?

61
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,380
Besides, if we find the Ancient City,

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,040
If we find the Ancient City.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,380
Right.

64
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,440
Maybe I'll be interested first.

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
Seriously,

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
the foreign girl said herself that

67
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,940
when this Jingjie Ancient City was buried,

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,640
It was filled with treasures inside.

69
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,680
He said those who take things won't leave.

70
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,520
That she can't leave with anything is an objective fact.

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,940
You can't leave. That's feudal superstition.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,180
Darn you

73
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,560
here, here, and here.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,780
And here.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
Patriotic!

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Hey!

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,360
Stick it tightly.

78
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,160
We'll come again next time.

79
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
Alright, Miss Mo.

80
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,400
Miss Mo, give it to me.

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,460
Here, professor.

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,080
Thank you, old man.

83
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,160
You're welcome.

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
Thank you, Uncle Wen.

85
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,920
It tastes good.

86
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,920
Gumo Kingdom

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Is a relatively powerful country

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
they're really powerful.

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,620
The tomb of Prince Gumo

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,260
that we found today

91
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,640
Is of extremely high archaeological value.

92
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,680
For the study of

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,100
for the study of that period of history

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,560
are of great significance.

95
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,460
Comrade Hu,

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,120
thanks to you,

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,460
we know that there's

98
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,040
there's a worship hall.

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,800
Below the main hall,

100
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,360
to find this.

101
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Incredible Tomb of the Prince.

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Professor Chen

103
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,100
we should thank him

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,340
we should thank

105
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,480
mr. An Liman

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,600
his care keeps us alive.

107
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,540
We can also have unexpected rewards.

108
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes, thank you, brother.

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Thank you for your hard work. Thanks.

110
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,540
After drinking horse milk wine,

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,780
that we're brothers.

112
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,720
Don't mention it.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,260
-I'm your friend.
-A friend.

114
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,520
A friend.

115
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,960
Team Leader Hu!

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,100
Let's strike while the iron is hot.

117
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,860
We'll depart tomorrow morning.

118
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,720
That's right.

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
According to our previous research,

120
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,020
gumo State and Jingjie State

121
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,560
are not far apart.

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
The mural we found

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
and this notebook

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,700
all the best evidence

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,820
of our research.

126
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,740
We should build on this victory and go forward.

127
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,120
-Right.
-Yes, Miss.

128
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,980
What's up

129
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,980
do you still want to go forward?

130
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,540
Right.

131
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,220
It's too dangerous. We need to die.

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,060
It's the windy season.

133
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,000
Honey.

134
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,240
You can't joke about this.

135
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,100
We've gone through a lot

136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,460
and almost find the Jingjie Ancient City.

137
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,520
We must not give up.

138
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,300
-Yeah. Please help us.
-Yeah. We must not give up.

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,260
Don't talk to each other.

140
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,220
Stop talking.

141
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,800
Have you told me about

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,460
about the ancient city.

143
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
I have heard of it before,

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,460
but no one has ever seen one.

145
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,760
Right now,

146
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,840
has reached the depths of the Black Desert.

147
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,780
There's no way out if we go further.

148
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,720
Drinking water is

149
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
a very big problem.

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
You are right.

151
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,560
You can see that

152
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,340
we lost some water bags

153
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,220
and buckets.

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,020
If we go any further,

155
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,960
we can carry

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,640
much less water than before.

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,620
So we can't go forward blindly.

158
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,000
We won't proceed blindly.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,880
The notebook says

160
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,360
the expedition team

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,180
heading in the direction of Zigden River.

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,060
We reached the Zagorama Valley first,

163
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,520
they finally found the Jingjie Ancient City.

164
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,080
And they found

165
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,420
jingjie Ancient Town,

166
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,400
many stone tombs were found.

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,660
They planned to excavate

168
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,680
on their way back.

169
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
That's why I drew

170
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
a very detailed route map.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,520
But we don't know

172
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,620
whether the scale

173
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,080
Is accurate?

174
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,020
Mr. Water is a well-known explorer

175
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,840
drawing is such basic work,

176
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,300
the deviation should be small.

177
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,840
If so,

178
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,440
we're really close

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,820
to the Ancient City.

180
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,620
Honey, look!

181
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I know.

182
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,660
Mount Zagorama is found

183
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,340
we'll find Zagorama Mountain.

184
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,860
But to be honest,

185
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
how long and far

186
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,100
how long and how far we'll go.

187
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
I am not sure.

188
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,320
Although I can't locate it exactly,

189
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,420
but the general direction

190
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,320
I can't be wrong.

191
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,980
What did I say?

192
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,060
Look at that.

193
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,360
High.

194
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,920
Shine your flashlight.

195
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Right now,

196
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,500
right now it's here,

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,940
yes, it is.

198
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,460
We should follow this route.

199
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,200
Come on.

200
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,840
Chu Jian.

201
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Hey.

202
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
Is the water ready?

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
Don't worry.

204
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,420
I've packed everything I can.

205
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,100
Alright.

206
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,840
No problem.

207
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,720
- Fatty!
- Hey! - What?

208
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,080
How's the packing going?

209
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,300
We're almost ready to go.

210
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,980
They're ready. Look.

211
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,480
- Hu.
-Ah!

212
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,300
Don't go!

213
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Let him pray.

214
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,940
This well is really

215
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,500
a sacred well.

216
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,340
Once nurtured Gulmo State.

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
And saved Anliman later,

218
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
and saved us now.

219
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,100
This may be

220
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,680
It is all due to fate

221
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,000
professor Chen

222
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,860
you are a scientist.

223
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,420
Believe in that?

224
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,240
That's not superstition,

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,660
we pray for

226
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,300
In his heart.

227
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
That the rivers underground

228
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,580
would never run dry.

229
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,300
I pray that it can protect this land.

230
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
And pray that it would save

231
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,840
people like us

232
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,920
to explore the mysteries of the Western Regions,

233
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
professor Chen, you are not only a scientist,

234
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,520
you are also a poet

235
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,520
old Man.

236
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,100
This black desert

237
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,260
have you been here before?

238
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,380
This is the hell in the desert.

239
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Few people have come here.

240
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,600
I came here just once.

241
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,860
Isn't this this time?

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,980
If it weren't for your cadre

243
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,260
and the white camel that God loves

244
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,080
I won't come even if I die.

245
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,840
When I was in the army,

246
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,220
when I was in the army.

247
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,960
Is to dig under the roots of shuttle grass

248
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,680
of haloxylon ammodendron in this desert.

249
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
To 35 meters below,

250
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,820
we can find wet sand and salty water.

251
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,760
Dig another

252
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,200
more than one meter deep.

253
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
Covered it with plastic sheet.

254
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,460
When the wet sand touches the plastic cloth,

255
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,020
will condense into water droplets.

256
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,100
Evaporated by sunlight,

257
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,300
and treated,

258
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,660
It won't take long

259
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,240
to get a small amount of fresh water.

260
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,500
It's not enough,

261
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,120
It can save lives.

262
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,660
I believe you can do it in this way too.

263
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,180
That's right.

264
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
But if we go further,

265
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
and the shuttle grass will be gone.

266
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,320
Nothing will be left.

267
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,980
If we end up in a place

268
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,620
when we don't even have shuttle grass,

269
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,060
we won't go any further.

270
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,480
Alright.

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,700
Hu, I told you

272
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,700
god will definitely love you.

273
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,700
The wind has been blowing all day.

274
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,460
When will it stop?

275
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,360
This is what the wind season is like.

276
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,780
The Black Desert is a terrible place

277
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,160
It's not quicksand that traps people.

278
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,140
Or the ant

279
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,580
In the future.

280
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,620
And it's not a black sand storm.

281
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,500
It's a legend.

282
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,360
Deep in the desert,

283
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,940
In the desert.

284
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,100
When people enter it,

285
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,720
they would see the lakes and rivers

286
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,200
beautiful beasts.

287
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,960
But not until they

288
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,980
I'm thirsty and exhausted.

289
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,240
They can't even walk.

290
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,040
Because those are

291
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,680
set by the devil

292
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,820
to lure people to die there.

293
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,680
He is talking about

294
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,160
the mirage in the desert.

295
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,100
It's very easy to confuse

296
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,460
It's very easy to be confused.

297
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,560
What's dehydration?

298
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,780
Two-thirds of the human body is water.

299
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,840
But when it loses 5%,

300
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,380
It causes dehydration.

301
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,420
In a word,

302
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,640
without water in the desert,

303
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
they'll lose their way.

304
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,680
We need to go behind the dune

305
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,480
to deal with something.

306
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,880
Hold on.

307
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,300
Take this.

308
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,560
And he's peeing now.

309
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
Shouldn't you keep it?

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Hold your mouth.

311
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,960
This is the old man's idea to save water.

312
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,760
So you are not thirsty?

313
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,280
Hubby.

314
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,600
Is there any koumiss left?

315
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,380
Have a sip to relieve your fatigue.

316
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,260
There aren't many.

317
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,520
We're both friends.

318
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,440
Give me a sip.

319
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,560
This item

320
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,900
save your life.

321
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,580
You can't just take it and drink it.

322
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,320
In the future, don't think about them.

323
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,460
This old man...

324
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,840
He's stingy!

325
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,020
Enough, have some water.

326
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,100
Get back to your work.

327
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,260
You know what?

328
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,360
In a few days,

329
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,400
If we can't find water,

330
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,380
our water supply

331
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,960
will decrease the amount of drinking water.

332
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,660
Everyone will become dehydrated.

333
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,400
You'll be the first one.

334
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,520
Why?

335
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,460
Because you are fat. Why?

336
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't try to scare me.

337
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,580
I really didn't scare you.

338
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,420
Why didn't the old man

339
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,840
would never go further.

340
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
Further forward,

341
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,420
and there'd be no fresh water.

342
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,340
There may be underground rivers,

343
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,800
we can't dig it.

344
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,320
Help

345
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,100
help

346
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
It's bad! Fatty's in trouble!

347
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
-Somebody!
-Hurry!

348
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,040
Go!

349
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,400
Hurry! Help!

350
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,200
Help

351
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
help. Help.

352
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,640
-Help!
-Don't move. Follow the footprints.

353
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,600
Help Ye Ye! Hurry!

354
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,320
-Come, give it to me.
- Help me.

355
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,760
- Come.
-Don't let go.

356
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,440
Don't be scared.

357
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,940
- Fatty, take me.
- Come.

358
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,780
Ye, don't be afraid.

359
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,640
Are you alright?

360
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,280
- It's all right.
-Hurry.

361
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,860
Leave that place quickly.

362
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,040
Go, hold it.

363
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,280
Come on, hurry up.

364
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,480
Hurry up, Hu!

365
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,420
Hurry up!

366
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,140
Fatty!

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,480
No need to say it clearly.

368
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,040
I can set up a sign

369
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
I will put up a sign

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,160
and let the people who come in the future know

371
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,140
quicksand is there.

372
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,520
All right, Fatty.

373
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,200
Then...

374
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,740
I also have great consciousness now.

375
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,240
I really didn't mean that.

376
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
What do you mean?

377
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,160
Think about it.

378
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,260
We didn't force much

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,740
to save Ye He just now.

380
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,480
Not really.

381
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,820
If I fall,

382
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,900
I'm turning over myself!

383
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,200
Be serious and think about it.

384
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,600
Is that what happens when there's quicksand?

385
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,680
I've never thought of that.

386
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,740
It's fine now.

387
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,740
Ye Ye,

388
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,900
both of you, tell me.

389
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,980
What happened just now?

390
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,560
As soon as we got behind the dune,

391
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,220
she just missed us.

392
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,480
Then all of a sudden,

393
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,920
her whole body gave way.

394
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,060
So I grabbed her

395
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,660
and call you over immediately.

396
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,240
The quicksand eats people quickly

397
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,020
and strong suction.

398
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,520
Your strength alone

399
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,500
with your strength alone.

400
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,380
And you will be trapped as well.

401
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,520
Hu is right.

402
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
If it's quicksand,

403
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,220
you won't be able to stay there.

404
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,840
Right.

405
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,880
It makes sense.

406
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,320
When Little Ye

407
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,820
was halfway there,

408
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,100
the game stopped.

409
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
It's stopped?

410
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,640
It seemed

411
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,420
felt like I stepped on a rock.

412
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,280
And I collapsed.

413
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,300
I keep sinking

414
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,800
sinking all the time.

415
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,540
Are you sure it's stone?

416
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,020
How can there be stones

417
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,260
under the desert?

418
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,240
Miss Yang,

419
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,360
you said that

420
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,340
british men used to

421
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,480
on this road,

422
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
on this road.

423
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,060
Yes

424
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,240
don't just stand there, go and take a look.

425
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,580
-You stay here.
-Hurry up.

426
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,720
- Come on.
-Let's go take a look.

427
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,480
Come on.

428
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Old Hu,

429
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,800
we got it.

430
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,820
Come on.

431
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
Watch out.

432
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,680
I also got something here.

433
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
This is made of explosives.

434
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,460
- Dynamite?
- Explosives?

435
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
Come on.

436
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,020
Come on.

437
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,240
It's coming out.

438
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
My shovel is showing.

439
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,720
Shovel.

440
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,360
Give it to me.

441
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,780
Here you go.

442
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,580
What an explosive device!

443
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,660
And it's definitely an expert

444
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,000
the power of the explosion

445
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,020
to the outside,

446
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,800
so the gravel is outside

447
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,300
there won't be any damage inside.

448
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,820
Small precise directional blasting.

449
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,460
Also...

450
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,220
And what?

451
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,280
This is no ordinary explosive.

452
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,660
It's military-type TNT.

453
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,360
That's impossible.

454
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,800
The PLA men are also involved in the revolt.

455
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,720
Cut the crap!

456
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,000
Professor Chen

457
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,380
Is it possible that

458
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,580
a stone tomb?

459
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,120
If there is a tomb,

460
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,400
such a big cave,

461
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,860
must have been stolen.

462
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,500
Clean out the bottom of the cave first.

463
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,080
And we can go down and have a look.

464
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,300
Why don't you take a break?

465
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I'll take it.

466
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,080
Come on.

467
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,740
Come on.

468
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Be careful who stones in the sand

469
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,400
don't be hurt.

470
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,340
Come on.

471
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,360
Hu, take a look at this.

472
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,140
Professor.

473
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,000
It's fine.

474
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,820
Soviet goods.

475
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,740
I played this for a few days when I was in the army.

476
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,420
Those tomb robbers were Soviet.

477
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
They are only themselves to blame.

478
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,380
And such a valuable tomb

479
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,540
has been ruined.

480
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,520
Miss Mo.

481
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,800
We are going to

482
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,860
rescue excavation.

483
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,860
Alright.

484
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,420
What kind of tomb is this?

485
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,180
Nothing.

486
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,620
If you are a tomb robber,

487
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,540
will you leave something

488
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,680
to those who come later?

489
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm going to pour it anyway.

490
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,340
What are you doing?

491
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,620
I bumped my head.

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,760
Be careful with that.

493
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,960
Professor Chen

494
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,620
ah

495
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,860
what kind of tomb is this?

496
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
From the structure of the chamber

497
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,720
the material and craft

498
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
and craft

499
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,720
this is a typical

500
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,460
stone tomb from the Wei and Jin Dynasties.

501
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,500
And it's a tomb for a family.

502
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,260
It should be

503
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,340
are buried in the desert.

504
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,980
It may be because

505
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,600
that the heavy sand storm a few days ago

506
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,840
and exposed part of the stone tomb.

507
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,620
It seems that these tomb robbers

508
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,220
did come prepared.

509
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,280
Or he wouldn't have arrived in such a hurry.

510
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
We're late.

511
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,980
That means

512
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,500
these tombs were robbed not long ago?

513
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,200
Yes. Definitely.

514
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,420
Professor, there is a mummified body.

515
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,360
This belongs to a young woman.

516
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,580
These tomb robbers are so hateful.

517
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,120
To get rich,

518
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
he's willing to do

519
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
no matter how shameful it is

520
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,240
professor Chen

521
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,060
what will they do

522
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,080
the mummies?

523
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,400
What else can I do? I need to make a fortune.

524
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,560
In the Xinjiang desert,

525
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,740
the only valuable things

526
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,700
except cultural relics and treasures,

527
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,100
are mummies.

528
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,780
And this kind of mummies

529
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,540
has gained popularity

530
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,460
overseas in recent years.

531
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,120
This kind of mummies

532
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,240
there are different kinds of mummies?

533
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,700
From all over the world,

534
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,980
there are several kinds of mummies.

535
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,340
They have been kept in coffins

536
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,800
In a coffin to form mummies.

537
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,340
As ancient Egypt did,

538
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,780
mummies processed

539
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,360
using a special preservative technique.

540
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,840
The mummies in Xinjiang

541
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,760
was completely destroyed

542
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,600
naturally formed in a special environment

543
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,840
naturally formed under a special environment.

544
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,760
Is a little old.

545
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,740
It must be very valuable.

546
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,220
That museums overseas

547
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,540
and exhibition centers

548
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
and other collectors

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,260
buy it with high prices.

550
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,420
- Being patriotic.
- Old Hu.

551
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,380
Pay attention here.

552
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,120
It seems that the notes of the British

553
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,440
really reliable.

554
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
Based on the current route,

555
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,680
after this joint tomb,

556
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,960
you'll really be close to Jingjie Ancient City.

557
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,320
Little Ye.

558
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,020
Do you feel better now?

559
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,780
I'm better now.

560
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,700
So these foreigners

561
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,440
to throw away these mummies

562
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
they will have enough to eat and drink for the rest of their lives.

563
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,260
We might have encountered

564
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,520
on the way.

565
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,420
You know what, Fatty?

566
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,500
These tomb robbers are so despicable.

567
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,040
-See how they blew up.
-Small Hu.

568
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,600
Professor.

569
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,160
What's the matter?

570
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,600
I came here

571
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
to tell you about it.

572
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,560
From the traces of the technique,

573
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
It's likely that

574
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,260
was probably stolen

575
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,640
for no more than ten days

576
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,320
ah

577
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,240
so you mean...

578
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,820
No, I mean...

579
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,660
He thinks that they are

580
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,920
they're probably looking for the Ancient City.

581
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,780
And they're already ahead of us.

582
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,920
So we must hurry up and go ahead.

583
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
If they make it to

584
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,440
reach the Ancient City of Jingjie first,

585
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,400
who knows,

586
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,720
he might do something bad again?

587
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,740
Well

588
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,680
I agree with Professor Chen.

589
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,520
We must speed up the process

590
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,140
do they have explosives?

591
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,760
They might also have guns.

592
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,320
If so,

593
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,880
It must be a shopping spree.

594
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,500
We must dare to unite with anyone

595
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
that destroy our cultural heritage

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,540
destroying our cultural heritage.

597
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
And I won't be able to beat them

598
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,400
It's the spirit.

599
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,160
No matter what,

600
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,060
let's set off as soon as possible.

601
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,960
What's your opinion, Comrade Hu?

602
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,620
In that case,

603
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,620
let's put everyone to bed.

604
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,420
There are still four hours

605
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,620
we still have four hours to dawn.

606
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,620
Let's start in four hours

607
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,420
In four hours.

608
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
Alright.

609
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,420
But we have to pay attention to safety on the way.

610
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,440
Talented people like you are

611
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,800
If any of you are in danger,

612
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,360
I won't be able to take the responsibility.

613
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,560
We are resting now.

614
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,080
They didn't even touch a gun before.

615
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
They talk with confidence.

616
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,260
Lower your voice.

617
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,160
I don't think

618
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,680
It's useless to talk to them too much.

619
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,120
You'd better hope that those tomb robbers

620
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,500
steal the mummies and go back.

621
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
If not, we'd really be in trouble.

622
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,020
Grandpa.

623
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,580
You led

624
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,500
you entered the desert

625
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,560
with a bunch of foreigners, right?

626
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
I have no idea what you're talking about.

627
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,900
They came here

628
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,060
the Ancient City, right?

629
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,800
The tomb last night

630
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,080
was done by a group of foreigners.

631
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,700
They are a group.

632
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,880
They're all bad guys.

633
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,200
God will punish them.

634
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,820
If they're bad guys, please tell me

635
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,780
the equipment they have brought.

636
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,260
We need to prepare in advance.

637
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,260
Did they bring guns?

638
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,760
I have asked Mr. An Liman.

639
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,760
The foreigners have guns.

640
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
Will we run into them?

641
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,720
Maybe it's best not to.

642
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,600
Let's be clever anyway.

643
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,220
Ye Ye, what's wrong

644
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,040
what's up

645
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,880
are you alright?

646
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,620
I'm fine. I just have no strength.

647
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,820
Are you sick?

648
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,540
Do tell me if you feel sick.

649
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,900
It's really nothing.

650
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,940
I guess I just didn't rest enough.

651
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,900
I'll be fine in a while.

652
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,300
Don't force yourself if you don't feel well.

653
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,520
If you need water, come to me. I have it here.

654
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,940
Got it.

655
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,180
About Dong Yunxi.

656
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't want them to worry about me.

657
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,160
Okay, I can't talk about it now.

658
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,880
If you're serious,

659
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,160
I can't keep it a secret.

660
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Don't worry.

661
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,320
I told you

662
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,360
what did I tell you before?

663
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,120
In this Jingjie Ancient City,

664
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,260
there's definitely treasure!

665
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,360
How many foreigners

666
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,260
keep an eye on this place.

667
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,020
The British

668
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,460
now here comes the Soviet

669
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,400
and carrying a gun.

670
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,740
This means

671
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,120
this place must have a lot of treasures.

672
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,860
Don't forget that

673
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,380
there's an American ahead.

674
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,180
Hu, we are talking.

675
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,560
Can you put your feelings in your heart?

676
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,000
Seriously?

677
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Hu,

678
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,740
- Why did you stop?
-I'll go check it out.

679
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,000
What's the matter, uncle?

680
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,920
The traces of Zi Du Dark River?

681
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,280
The traces of Zidan River.

682
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,060
Go further.

683
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,920
I won't be able to see any traces.

684
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,380
By then,

685
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,140
at that time.

686
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
We're close to

687
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,640
to the Ancient City.

688
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,080
Even if there's no trace,

689
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,120
we still have the compass

690
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,900
and the route map on the notebook.

691
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,720
It should be within reach.

692
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,460
Anyway, I have to move forward.

693
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,820
There must have been a hidden river in Jinjie State

694
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,360
there must have been an underground river

695
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,300
or water

696
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,220
even if the ground has dried up,

697
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,560
the groundwater may not be dried up.

698
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,620
And there must be some clues.

699
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,700
Don't be anxious.

700
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,520
I was just asking.

701
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,920
We've been walking for so long.

702
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,880
We should be able to see

703
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,620
-This is Mount Zaglama!
- Uncle Wen.

704
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,200
Please.

705
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,460
Let's walk forward.

706
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,640
We might see the magic mountain.

707
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,400
OK. Thank you, Uncle Wen.

708
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,500
We've traveled so fast today.

709
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,540
Have a rest.

710
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,620
Hubby.

711
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,220
We can take a break here.

712
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,240
Alright?

713
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,520
And rest for a while.

714
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,320
How is Ye Ye? Is he better?

715
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,300
I am fine. Don't worry.

716
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,720
If you still feel sick,

717
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,640
call me at any time.

718
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm going to see the professor.

719
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
Alright.

720
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,840
Hu,

721
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,400
ah

722
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,440
come here.

723
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,740
Have a seat

724
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,380
professor Chen, how are you?

725
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,860
Do you feel better now?

726
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,140
Yeah, I'm fine.

727
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
The sun is too hot.

728
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,520
Let's rest a little more.

729
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,300
Have some water.

730
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,360
We'll leave after you rest.

731
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,420
Leave me alone.

732
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm fine with this. I'll leave whenever I want.

733
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,040
Well

734
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,460
according to your experience of many years,

735
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,220
we know that many foreigners

736
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,260
to rob tombs?

737
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,400
And went forward,

738
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,780
peering through a gap,

739
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,070
to see more clearly.

740
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,110
My bravery

741
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,910
with my courage

742
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:04,910
be together.

743
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:12,940
In my heart,

744
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,860
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

745
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,700
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

746
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,050

747
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,700
But doesn't care

748
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,590
the result.

749
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,700
Trapped in the present

750
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,190
stuck in the present

751
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,550
down the unknown river

752
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,170
down the river,

753
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,630
the greater the desire,

754
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,140
the more you demand.

755
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,730
With full stomach,

756
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,730
they kept their mouths shut.

757

♪ Fate promised ♪

758
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,120
You'll change your mind.

759
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,570
Giving me sweet words

760
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,150
but lying to me.

761
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,650
You'd climb to Heaven...

762
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,200
And hides again.

763
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,540
Looking young.

764
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,500
