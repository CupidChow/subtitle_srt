3
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,740
(Episode 19)

4
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,230
It should be the legendary

5
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,600
It's called Corpse Sweet Taro.

6
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,070
It's said that when it blooms,

7
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,250
and it's very dangerous.

8
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,980
I didn't expect that

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,100
there is such a thing in this world.

10
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,440
Taro with Corpse Scent.

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,940
That's still a taro.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,890
Legend has it that

13
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,830
grows in the tombs.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,670
It not only keeps the corpse

15
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,690
the corpse not to rot,

16
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,100
and the corpses give off fragrance.

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,720
It's very precious.

18
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,560
Having these two items

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,580
to serve Her Majesty here.

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,580
That's amazing.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,760
Hu, we've come this far,

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
we'll be close to death.

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,500
We must go up and take a look.

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,940
We can't go there.

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,380
Never let it go easily.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,820
Legend has it that

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,360
with a demon soul in it.

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,640
Once it grows into a full-grown monster,

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,500
any living person must not approach it again.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,300
It's too dangerous.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,040
Have you noticed?

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,620
There are Ghost Cave characters on this stone beam too.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,160
What?

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,100
(Ghost Cave Script)

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
I think these texts

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,760
must have something to do

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,840
to the ghost cave.

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,040
It must contain

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,060
extremely important information.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,100
- That's right.
-I want to go up and copy it.

41
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,280
Professor, I want to go up there too.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Alright.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,980
Don't go near it.

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,080
Just write it down.

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,220
Rest assured, Professor.

46
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,140
CAUTION

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,820
alright.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,920
Be careful.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,380
Be careful.

50
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,120
-Don't get too close.
-Okay.

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,180
Is it the same as in your dream?

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,660
Exactly the same.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,240
Why is this?

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,300
What is the relationship between me and here?

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,640
I must make it clear.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I must go and see

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
the coffin of the Flawless Queen.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
This is our last chance.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Calm down.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,220
I understand your feelings.

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,800
Relax.

62
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,160
When Chu Jian is back,

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,460
I'll go up with you.

64
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,420
-Thank you, Hu. -You're welcome.
-What?

65
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,120
You two are really keeping something from me.

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,760
Little Chu and Sa, come back!

67
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,460
Those two.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
What are you two doing?

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,820
Stay away from that stupid taro!

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,260
Little Chu, come here, you two.

71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,340
Hurry!

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,380
Something's wrong.

73
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,360
Hu, what happened?

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,140
I don't know.

75
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,660
I feel something is wrong.

76
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,500
Something's wrong?

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,140
When you can't say it clearly, it's just feeling.

78
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,840
I can't.

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,100
We must send them down.

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,780
Old Hu, come back!

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,740
Little Hu!

82
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,660
Fatty!

83
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,640
I told you not to let them get close.

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,940
- Why didn't you listen? - What?
-What to do?

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Old Hu,

86
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,460
why did you two come along?

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,620
Sam.

88
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,820
Sam.

89
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,620
What's wrong with him?

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
How come he suddenly

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,780
they're the best.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,400
You two take care of Professor.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,280
I'll take a look.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,800
I asked you to take care of Professor.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
Why are you following us?

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Who knows what kind of things

97
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
on them?

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm worried to let you stay up there alone.

99
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,280
In addition,

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
It's hard for you to carry Sati Peng.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,200
We'll carry it together.

102
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
In case anything happens again.

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,720
Fatty.

104
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,480
Hu, don't mind. We need to save them first.

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,080
What about

106
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,240
there's no pulse.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
How are we going to explain to his family?

108
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,920
His family will be tortured to death

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,140
to death.

110
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,280
Dead people can't be revived.

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,340
She is alive! She's alive!

112
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,820
Sam!

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
We didn't have a pulse.

114
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,500
Look at this!

115
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
The flowers are blooming.

116
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,080
I really want to see

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,320
how she looks exactly.

118
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,180
Old Hu,

119
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,060
don't be scared.

120
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,860
You want to see it, right?

121
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,080
That's good.

122
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,640
I want to see

123
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,960
what monster she is.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Worst case scenario,

125
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,720
I can grant her permission and let her die once more.

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,460
Yes, take it.

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,540
Yes, hold it.

128
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,480
Fatty and I will go upstairs.

129
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
If anything happens to the coffin,

130
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
I'll inform you at any time.

131
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,620
Why are you here?

132
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,640
Aren't you afraid of heights?

133
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,040
What? I can't hear you?

134
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,530
Hu Bayi

135
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,290
old Hu,

136
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,840
hu Bayi

137
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,740
what are you doing? Come down there

138
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,120
hu Bayi

139
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,320
old Hu, come down

140
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,340
come back quickly Hu Bayi

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,640
hu, come down quickly

142
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,940
hu Bayi

143
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,400
are you out of your mind?

144
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,100
You couldn't hear no matter how I shout.

145
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,520
What on earth did I just now?

146
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,540
You scared us to death just now.

147
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,220
Walk to the middle of the stone beams.

148
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,060
It's as if you were sleepwalking.

149
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,620
You brandished the engineering shovel

150
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,860
and repeatedly.

151
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,940
Was gesticulating.

152
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,040
Agonizing over there.

153
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
You know what?

154
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,200
I wouldn't have beaten you

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
I was going to beat you up this morning.

156
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,200
Didn't you tell me you had tinnitus?

157
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Can you hope for my good?

158
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
Fatty.

159
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,580
Thanks to your fear of heights.

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,280
Hu, are you losing your mind?

161
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,160
I see.

162
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,780
This darn Amorphophallus.

163
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,080
It can make people hallucinate

164
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,580
to produce hallucinations.

165
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,040
On the stone beams,

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,300
Is its controlling Fan State.

167
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,580
Once they step on the stone bridge,

168
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,940
they will hallucinate.

169
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,720
Little Sa and Little CHU...

170
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
It's just because of this.

171
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,900
I must give it some color.

172
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,700
Is this the botanical garden?

173
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,200
So many strange flowers

174
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,880
and strange flowers.

175
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It's higanbana.

176
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,880
It is said that

177
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
these flowers only bloom at the junction of Yin and Yang,

178
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,120
It represents a bad omen.

179
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,300
That's why they are also called "Flowers on the Path to the Dead."

180
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,340
I can't. I have to get Sa back.

181
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,400
You can't go with Hu.

182
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,120
Saturn.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,920
How can it spread so quickly?

184
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,760
Hurry up and run!

185
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,200
It'll be too late if you don't run.

186
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Okay, it's my turn. I'll do it.

187
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,180
- Fatty, you have the lobules on your back.
-Hey.

188
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,020
Professor.

189
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,580
No. The front is all higanbana.

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
The way back is blocked.

191
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,120
Hurry up. This way.

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,980
This way. Hurry up.

193
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,760
This way.

194
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,060
Hurry up, Fatty! This way!

195
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,480
Hurry!

196
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,340
The broken flowers are catching up.

197
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,860
What to do?

198
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,020
Fatty, dynamite!

199
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,000
Hurry up!

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,860
Open your mouth and cover your ears.

201
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,120
Hu, are you all right?

202
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
Are you all right?

203
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't hear you.

204
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,940
Are... Are you alright?

205
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,160
The explosives might be too much,

206
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,180
little Ye is awake.

207
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,920
Ye Ye,

208
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,660
- Have some water.
-The Ye!

209
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,720
Professor Chen!

210
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,400
Professor Chen

211
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,380
there's a landslide!

212
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,360
Run!

213
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,440
Come on, go.

214
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,100
Hurry up!

215
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,940
Hurry up, Little Ye.

216
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,940
Ye Ye!

217
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,420
Professor Chen

218
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,220
be careful

219
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,460
fatty!

220
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,960
Everybody, don't stop!

221
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,000
We have to leave quickly.

222
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,840
So be it.

223
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,520
I can't run anymore.

224
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,520
Old Hu,

225
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,640
are we dead or alive?

226
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,900
I think it's about enough

227
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,040
for me to be alive or dead.

228
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,780
Even if he is still alive for now,

229
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,480
even if I'm still alive for now.

230
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,880
Then it's on the way to death.

231
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,740
Miss Yang,

232
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,520
before I leave.

233
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,860
Hu and I get to the God of Death

234
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,780
when it comes to

235
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,980
you are going to see God.

236
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,620
You have a long way to go.

237
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,620
Take care.

238
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,080
Look at the situation.

239
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,280
Can you stop making a scene?

240
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
I think it has stopped.

241
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,300
Ah

242
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,300
they have stopped.

243
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,000
They really stopped, Hu.

244
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,620
The disaster survived. We'll have good fortune.

245
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,840
It's early to say.

246
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,800
I mean, we're just

247
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
temporarily alive.

248
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,060
What do you mean?

249
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,040
And won't be buried.

250
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,780
He will never get out of here.

251
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,780
But I don't know if this place is breathable.

252
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,180
Without air here,

253
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,420
we won't hold out

254
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,240
hold out for a couple of hours at most.

255
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,240
I also lost my bag.

256
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,340
I have nothing left.

257
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,720
The explosives were also gone.

258
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,760
This is the last water.

259
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,220
I think

260
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,780
there's no other way

261
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,600
we can't count on the outsiders anymore.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,040
That old man An Liman

263
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,260
he must have tripped over himself.

264
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,540
Hu, we still have the engineering shovel.

265
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,360
Let's dig our way out!

266
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,420
Save your breath.

267
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,060
How long will it take?

268
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,300
Where can we start?

269
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,960
Even if we have water,

270
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,700
and no oxygen,

271
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,720
It's a waste.

272
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,060
In that case,

273
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,040
then don't think about anything.

274
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,160
And drink the water first.

275
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,060
Ye Ye, have some water.

276
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Have some water.

277
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,520
Professor, have some water.

278
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Take this.

279
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,380
Drink it when you're thirsty.

280
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,160
You first.

281
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,880
I'm not thirsty. Drink first.

282
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,300
Take it easy.

283
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,460
We have few people.

284
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,320
No one is stealing your wine.

285
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
Drink slowly.

286
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
If we all die here,

287
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,880
It's all my fault.

288
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,960
If I hadn't insisted on coming here,

289
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,300
I wouldn't have caused so many troubles

290
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,580
and involved so many people.

291
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
I really don't

292
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,180
enough.

293
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,080
You can't put it like this.

294
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,740
There's an old Chinese saying:

295
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,660
Let man die for wealth and birds die for food.

296
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,760
Fatty and I

297
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
we have ourselves to blame.

298
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,020
If it weren't for covetousness,

299
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,340
you wouldn't have sold

300
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,540
we don't have to do this

301
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,660
and Professor Chen

302
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,520
they are after their own business

303
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,100
If you don't sponsor them,

304
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,140
they will come up with a way sooner or later

305
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,440
to find the marvelous ancient city.

306
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,400
Why are you crying?

307
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,560
You know what?

308
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm the one who should be crying.

309
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,580
If I had known that

310
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,620
this was so difficult,

311
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,280
I should have asked you for more.

312
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,460
That's right. You need to pay more.

313
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,220
Why are you laughing again?

314
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,920
You know what?

315
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,140
Don't laugh and cry.

316
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,680
We are serious.

317
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,000
Actually, I'm not thirsty.

318
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,560
The ghost cave we saw

319
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,020
just like in your dream, right?

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,260
That's right.

321
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,240
The only thing you didn't see clearly

322
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,060
that huge thing above the coffin

323
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,120
It's called corpse fragrant konjac.

324
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,760
Old Hu,

325
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,740
what are you talking about?

326
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,860
She said her father came to her in a dream.

327
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,400
And it was exactly like

328
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
as like as two peas

329
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
that's why she wanted to see it.

330
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,700
The Brilliant Queen

331
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,880
and I...

332
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,320
And you were confused.

333
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Miss Yang, that's not right.

334
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,500
Didn't your father

335
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,240
was buried under the Kunlun glacier.

336
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,420
How did he give you this place in your dream?

337
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,850
Has he ever been here?

338
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,800
Actually, when I saw

339
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,220
when I saw

340
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,860
I also thought about that.

341
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,880
You still believe in loitering dreams?

342
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,540
That's all feudal superstition.

343
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,960
But why would I

344
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,780
saw me in the dream?

345
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,600
Places that I've never

346
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,700
that I've never been to before?

347
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,500
They were so clear.

348
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,980
I don't know why.

349
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,360
There's some...

350
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,340
It's like a dim voice

351
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,400
calling for me.

352
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,860
Leading me here.

353
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,940
She might

354
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,860
you were the Queen in your previous life.

355
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,100
You were visiting the places you'd visited before.

356
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
It's windy.

357
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,360
We should be able to pass by.

358
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
Fatty, take them with you.

359
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,280
Got it.

360
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,440
Ye Xie, the youngest,

361
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,760
be careful!

362
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,320
Professor, watch out.

363
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Be careful

364
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,100
where is this again?

365
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,920
Don't make any noise.

366
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,720
There's something over there.

367
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,800
Old Hu.

368
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,980
Two Zongzi.

369
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,020
What zongzi?

370
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
Your face is fossilized.

371
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,340
It seems

372
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,740
must be over 1,000 years old.

373
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,620
It looks like a tomb.

374
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,940
I thought there was a way out.

375
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,980
This closed

376
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,940
he started from one topic

377
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,320
to another.

378
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,380
Come on. Light the candles.

379
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,120
You two are tomb robbers.

380
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,620
What are you talking about?

381
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
Are you too tired?

382
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,620
Didn't I tell you before?

383
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,300
As a hobby,

384
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,280
as a hobby.

385
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,940
But we're definitely not tomb robbers.

386
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,780
You can't wrong us for nothing.

387
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,820
Fatty and I

388
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,380
the roots are good and the seedlings are popular.

389
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
And that includes Fatty.

390
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,440
He's a model worker

391
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,200
he's the annual model worker.

392
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,160
And holding the red flag.

393
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,080
What do you mean?

394
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,880
My mum is.

395
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm in the Youth Commando Team.

396
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,720
Are cultivated by the Party and the people.

397
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,460
Right?

398
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,660
Hu, the stone box

399
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,860
looks very special.

400
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,420
What could it hold there?

401
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,900
Look at the situation,

402
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,820
are you two

403
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,780
play this trick?

404
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,680
We are seeking truth from facts.

405
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,660
That's right.

406
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,120
We set the plate and hang up gold,

407
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,100
the hexagrams are ringing in the Hai Zi.

408
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,760
Catching and kicking the pole.

409
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,220
Make the best of them.

410
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,000
He won't win.

411
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,740
Well, what's going on here?

412
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,100
What are you talking about?

413
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,660
What's wrong with him?

414
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,160
There's no Yuanliang.

415
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,320
Move wood from the mountain and burn fire at the foot of the mountain.

416
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,920
May I ask the chief Yuanliang,

417
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,780
where did he get the mountain armour?

418
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,540
How many hills can you disassemble?

419
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,140
A river with scenery on both sides.

420
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,980
We all move firewood on the mountain and burn the fire under the mountain.

421
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,660
Partridge divides mountain paper, kite solution Qiu door

422
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,280
have entered the main hall many times.

423
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,460
Can't find the Dragon Tower?

424
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,260
What's wrong with you two?

425
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,700
Or me?

426
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,640
Let's not frighten them.

427
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You still refuse to admit it?

428
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,360
You know what?

429
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,440
These lines of poem

430
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,760
are the texts

431
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,160
In our elementary school.

432
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Unexpectedly,

433
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
the elementary school textbooks in the United States

434
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,460
have similar

435
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,140
have similar approaches but equally satisfactory results.

436
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,360
Why don't I remember learning that?

437
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,220
Hu, if we

438
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,520
get out of here alive,

439
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,160
I hope that we can have a serious

440
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,120
and have a serious talk.

441
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
But the premise is that

442
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,960
we need to get out of here alive.

443
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,800
What on earth

444
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,000
talked about just now?

445
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,780
These are all the lip codes of fighting back.

446
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,320
But the code to rob a tomb.

447
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,500
Others can't understand them.

448
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,560
Then how could she understand?

449
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,940
She's also in this industry.

450
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,980
I can't be sure

451
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,120
but these jargon

452
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,100
have been lost since 1949.

453
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,080
If it weren't for our ancestors

454
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,620
I wouldn't understand anyone who was in this industry.

455
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,700
Let's say their ancestor

456
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,360
could she be her father?

457
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,820
It's possible.

458
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,860
But she does know a lot.

459
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,900
So I didn't dare to continue to talk with her

460
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,440
what did I tell you?

461
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,540
I couldn't believe her from the beginning.

462
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,720
You know what?

463
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,960
Look at the situation now.

464
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,100
We can't be more polite.

465
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,000
Tie her up and ask her for answers.

466
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,340
We must die for the truth.

467
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,900
Enough, please.

468
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,160
Find an exit quickly.

469
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,240
Or it's all nonsense.

470
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,040
Hu, there is no exit inside.

471
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,100
The road there

472
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,140
has been blocked.

473
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,820
We can only see

474
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,960
If there is any chance

475
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,780
In this stone chest?

476
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,440
I remember Mount Zaghama mentioned

477
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,980
written in the Book of Western Regions of Tang Dynasty,

478
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,080
It's said that there are two Sages buried there.

479
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,840
Could it be these two?

480
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,360
But the...

481
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
This tomb is so crude.

482
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,860
It's not suitable for the status of a saint.

483
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,060
Judging from the mural,

484
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,720
this is not the Tomb of the Late Saint.

485
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,540
The child next to him

486
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,980
must be the son of the Late Saint,

487
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,040
or his disciple.

488
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,500
He should be called Prophet.

489
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
The old man next to him

490
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,740
must be his servant

491
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,540
look at this.

492
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,720
There are a dozen drawings carved

493
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,780
carved on the stone case,

494
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,600
and the concubines

495
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,420
It's like an ancient prophecy.

496
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,360
The composition is simple.

497
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,680
The features of the symbols are obvious.

498
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,100
I think I can read it.

499
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,300
If you can tell

500
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,700
Is there a passage in here?

501
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,980
No, I don't.

502
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,860
But I don't think

503
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,880
this prophet is not very accurate either.

504
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,760
It says that

505
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,840
he died,

506
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,400
no one has ever

507
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
In this place.

508
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,580
Until four people

509
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,480
rushed into the path

510
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,500
and opened the stone box.

511
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,660
Four of them?

512
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,640
Yes

513
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,020
this is not right.

514
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,040
We have five people.

515
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,260
This prophet can't count

516
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,020
could it be that Professor Chen is crazy

517
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,260
he won't tell us about it?

518
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,700
If the Prophet was not a liar,

519
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,220
then

520
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,260
the four of us don't mean us.

521
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,220
Of course, there's another possibility.

522
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,120
What is that?

523
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
One of us

524
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,720
Is really bad.

525
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,240
And went forward,

526
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,520
peering through a gap,

527
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,520
to see more clearly.

528
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
My bravery

529
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,880
with my courage

530
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,720
be together.

531
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,280
In my heart,

532
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,540
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

533
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,600

But doesn't care

536
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,000
the result.

537
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,280
Trapped in the present

00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,160
stuck in the present

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,080
down the unknown river

down the river,

the greater the desire,

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
With full stomach,

544
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,080
they kept their mouths shut.

Giving me sweet words

but lying to me.

549
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,120
You'd climb to Heaven...

550
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,800
And hides again.

551
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,120
Looking young.

552
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,480
And grey overnight.

553
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,070
Down the river

554
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,810
overnight, my hair turns grey.
