That was close. Thanks to

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,540
being patriotic.

6
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,180
- Professor. Professor.
- Professor?

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,700
Patriotic!

8
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,580
Little Ye.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,100
Miss. Miss. Miss.

10
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Miss Mo, wake up. Miss MO.

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,780
Miss Mo. Ms Mo.

12
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,680
-Mr. Mo.
- Chu Jian.

13
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,960
-Mr.
-Chu Jian. -Yes.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,460
Professor. Professor.

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,480
Miss Mo, please wake up.

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Chu Jian, calm down.

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,180
Get out of here.

18
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,340
Hu, don't move!

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Don't move.

20
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,960
Put your head away slowly.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,940
I hope you can't beat me into a trap.

22
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,140
Look who is taking pictures.

23
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,340
My colleague at the Geography Magazine told me

24
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,620
there's a kind of snake in the desert that is afraid of bright light.

25
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,640
Sir, the camels are fine now.

26
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,260
It's all right.

27
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,580
I don't know how

28
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,200
It just moved forward.

29
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,660
Forget about the reason.

30
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,940
We have to get out of here quickly.

31
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,000
Get on the camels.

32
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,780
And get out of here as soon as possible.

33
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,880
Leader Hu has passed the mountain pass.

34
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,880
Keep walking.

35
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,520
Stay as far away from here as possible.

36
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,760
Professor.

37
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,140
- Being patriotic?
-Brother Hu.

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,380
Brother Hu

39
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,640
professor Chen is awake

40
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,020
he loves the country

41
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
hubby.

42
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,380
Please stop.

43
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,560
Come on.

44
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,120
Come on

45
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
professor Chen

46
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,260
hu,

47
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm going to see Aiguo.

48
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,460
Please let me see him one more time.

49
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,940
Please let me see him one more time, Hu.

50
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Please wait here.

51
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
Alright

52
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,820
take good care of Professor Chen

53
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,540
come with me

54
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,640
I wanted to make Professor Hao

55
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,340
as decent as possible.

56
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,160
First, respect

57
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,820
and to make Professor Chen

58
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,100
to calm down

59
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,220
professor. Slowly.

60
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,400
Professor. Slow down. Professor.

61
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,300
Patriotic.

62
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,240
We're teacher and student,

63
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,080
but we're actually more like father and son.

64
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,260
We studied the culture of the Western Regions together

65
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,480
for more than 20 years.

66
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm about to see the Jingjue Ancient City.

67
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,740
But you leave like this.

68
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
In the world, except for you,

69
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,940
can understand me like you

70
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,440
understand my feelings

71
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,380
to the culture of the Western Regions.

72
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,720
I don't know what to do

73
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,980
there's no one

74
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,140
to say these things.

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,860
What's up

76
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,720
nothing.

77
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,880
He reminds me of his comrade-in-arms.

78
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
Uncle Chen.

79
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,920
Professor.

80
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm sorry for your loss, Professor.

81
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,200
Professor.

82
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,740
The day comes.

83
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,480
The day has come.

84
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,080
This is the spot.

85
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,420
Right.

86
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,260
We found it!

87
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,340
Patriotic?

88
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,420
Look at that!

89
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,820
This is Jingjie Ancient City.

90
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Little Hu.

91
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,880
Professor.

92
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Go on.

93
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,980
Being patriotic is my lifelong pursuit

94
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,200
Is to study the culture of the Western Regions.

95
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,220
Can we just bury him here

96
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,900
and let him guard this

97
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,860
this mysterious ancient city forever.

98
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,520
If...

99
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,320
If he is patriotic and knowledgeable,

100
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,960
she'd be pleased.

101
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,320
Alright. You're the boss.

102
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
Patriotic.

103
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,680
Slow down.

104
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,640
Come.

105
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,180
Patriotic!

106
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,900
Have a good rest.

107
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
You worked hard all the way.

108
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,580
We'll leave you in Jingjie Ancient City

109
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,180
you should guard it for us,

110
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,660
protect it for the archaeologists.

111
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,000
Professor Chen

112
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,740
the dead are gone.

113
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,700
We have to move on as soon as possible.

114
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,780
We have to hurry to the ancient city

115
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,740
to look for water.

116
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,460
Otherwise Ye Ye is in trouble.

117
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,940
I know.

118
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,280
It is more important to save Shen.

119
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,060
Let's set off quickly then.

120
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,720
Let's get ready to go.

121
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,680
Grandpa.

122
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,220
We're ready to go.

123
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,380
Grandpa, we're leaving.

124
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,320
What's up

125
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,520
In front of us is the Quintessence Ancient City.

126
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,380
72 bows to you.

127
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,380
But the last thing you need is this.

128
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,120
You can go now.

129
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,980
What do you mean?

130
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,380
I can't go in.

131
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,140
Why not?

132
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,880
No, there's something new.

133
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,940
Grandpa.

134
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
What happened?

135
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,100
That his companion died in the desert

136
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,600
It's a bad omen.

137
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,660
Your companion

138
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,540
was killed by the angel of the devil.

139
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,160
This is an even more ominous sign.

140
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,680
This proves a legend.

141
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
What legend?

142
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Or messengers of the devil?

143
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
Those black-headed snakes

144
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,660
are the devil's messengers.

145
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,400
This is the place

146
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
the abandoned place.

147
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,740
Old man,

148
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,340
cut the crap.

149
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,780
Are you scared again?

150
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,020
I am not discussing with you.

151
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,640
So you mean that

152
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,940
Is determined not to move forward.

153
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,580
Really?

154
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,900
Team Leader Hu.

155
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,140
Say whatever you want.

156
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,320
This is a place

157
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,980
abandoned by God.

158
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,100
Even if you kill me,

159
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,420
I won't go there either.

160
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,660
My camels won't go there either.

161
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,120
Old Hu,

162
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,840
can I have two dirty words?

163
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,580
Calm down!

164
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,720
Fatty.

165
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,440
Swearing doesn't solve your problem.

166
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,800
Come on.

167
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,280
Now it's not the time to compete.

168
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,160
Ye Ye has been having a fever.

169
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,600
We must enter the city.

170
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,940
How about this?

171
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,600
Both of you go in.

172
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
I'll stay and watch the old man.

173
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
If he escapes with the camels,

174
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,440
no matter how much we gain,

175
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,580
that's nonsense.

176
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,000
We still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,060
You can't stay.

178
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,660
You need to come with us!

179
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Fatty!

180
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,640
We need you to

181
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,800
am I that important?

182
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,020
Don't worry about Anliman.

183
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,480
He has not been paid yet.

184
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,920
I won't give him any money

185
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,480
If he dares to run off.

186
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,040
High!

187
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,400
Miss Yang.

188
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,500
We've found the Quintessence Ancient City.

189
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,880
Hu and I

190
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,620
don't worry.

191
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,040
I'll pay you well.

192
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,660
No wonder you're a Wall Street tycoon.

193
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,660
Ye Ye, in the capital city,

194
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,880
come on, take the medicine.

195
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,680
I have some water.

196
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,620
Hubby.

197
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,980
Please tell me.

198
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,720
Those who tell lies

199
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,120
those who lie and break faith.

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,220
That's why

201
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,340
will turn his money into sand.

202
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,140
And his salt

203
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,280
Into sand too.

204
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
And finally I starved to death,

205
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
like dying in the Black Desert.

206
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,900
To go to the hot desert hell

207
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,700
and suffer 1,800 kinds of torture.

208
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,280
That's it.

209
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,880
Alright.

210
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,180
Since you're determined not to move forward,

211
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,960
I won't force you.

212
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Let's go in there.

213
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,460
But you have to promise me

214
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,180
you'll wait for us here.

215
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,060
What about

216
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
alright.

217
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,560
We are brothers.

218
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,420
I trust you.

219
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
Ye Ye can surely do it.

220
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,960
- Old Hu. - We can do this.
-I can do it.

221
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,900
We're here.

222
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,680
Jingjie Ancient Town is not far from here.

223
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,600
Let's march on foot!

224
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
We'll travel light.

225
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
Bring the things in water

226
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,000
guns and ammunition.

227
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,540
Besides, I'm afraid Ye Ye will have to carry them.

228
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,220
Don't worry.

229
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,460
We are here.

230
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,900
Pack your things and let's go.

231
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,640
Come on.

232
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
What a surprise.

233
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,300
After 2,000 years,

234
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,400
the ruins of the ancient city

235
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
and we found them.

236
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,460
That's right.

237
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
It is surprising that

238
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,720
In less than a month

239
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,640
20,000 dollars.

240
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,400
Hopefully, after you're in there,

241
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,520
when you're inside.

242
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,440
Old Hu,

243
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,800
look at this.

244
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Except for sand

245
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,320
there's only gravel

246
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,420
nothing is in one piece.

247
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,160
According to legend,

248
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,120
the city was destroyed in the war.

249
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,340
The Allied Forces attacked the Imperial City,

250
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,620
when the battle was almost over,

251
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,820
the black sand storm completely destroyed the ancient city,

252
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,100
flooded the ancient city,

253
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,420
were submerged in the sand.

254
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,080
Until the 19th century,

255
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,160
which is caused by

256
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,580
the surface of the pit.

257
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,140
Then there must be a lot of mummies down there.

258
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,100
Maybe there are treasures.

259
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
The corpses have been buried in the sand,

260
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,920
for thousands of years.

261
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,540
If you dig hard, you're sure to find it

262
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,740
maybe we can find a black snake too.

263
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,260
Forget about snakes.

264
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,200
It's so scary.

265
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,380
In my life.

266
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,640
You mean there is

267
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,500
on its head

268
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,340
cut in two.

269
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,660
Can hurt people?

270
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,840
This black boa is indeed very strange.

271
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,700
I wonder if there are any such snakes

272
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,500
everyone, be careful.

273
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,440
Miss Yang,

274
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,260
have you seen this kind of snake?

275
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,260
No, I haven't.

276
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,800
Messenger of the desert.

277
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,640
Messenger of the devil.

278
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,100
What did you say

279
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,820
uncle An Liman said

280
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,880
this kind of black snake is the devil's messenger,

281
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,380
you're right.

282
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,480
Those are all over there.

283
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,360
Whether you're the devil's messenger or not,

284
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,360
we must be vigilant.

285
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,840
-Sam!
-Hey.

286
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,820
Catch up.

287
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,680
Don't get separated.

288
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,920
Fatty.

289
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,360
You stare to the left, I'll look to the right.

290
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,100
Alright.

291
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,240
I had the same dream again these days.

292
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,560
I dreamed of a big dark cave.

293
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,480
There was a big coffin hanging at the cave.

294
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,400
The English

295
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,060
didn't mention the strange snake.

296
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,480
No.

297
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,660
Only that

298
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,120
to enter the Ancient Town of Jingjie,

299
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
there will be nothing left there.

300
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,360
We don't know

301
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,860
and don't know what happened

302
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,180
and my father.

303
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Fatty.

304
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,380
Don't drink too much.

305
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,660
Control it.

306
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,640
Old Hu,

307
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,100
do you know what

308
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
want to eat now?

309
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,480
What?

310
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,920
Cantaloupe.

311
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,000
Grapes with horse milk.

312
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,600
Of course I will.

313
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,560
I wish I had a watermelon.

314
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,040
I can't. I'm thirsty.

315
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,240
We need to find the underground river later.

316
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
I have to go and take a shower.

317
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,120
I heard that the Queen of the Delicacy was very extravagant.

318
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,360
The watermelon she ate

319
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,680
must have been in

320
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,700
the cool underground river.

321
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,020
The river was iced over.

322
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,860
That's beautiful.

323
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,340
The watermelon is still preserved.

324
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,820
It must be fossilized, right?

325
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,580
Getting serious again?

326
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,120
The two of us are just imagining

327
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,920
you're right.

328
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,880
Daydream.

329
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,500
Don't be so strict.

330
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,280
Quench your thirst with hope.

331
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,240
Right.

332
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,720
Chu Jian.

333
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,500
Put me down.

334
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
It's okay, I can do it.

335
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,200
Just let me go on my own.

336
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,660
Ye Ye is awake.

337
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,180
Come.

338
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,060
Slowly.

339
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,460
Be careful.

340
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,320
It's not that hot.

341
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,620
How do you feel?

342
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
Much better, Hu.

343
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,120
I can persist.

344
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,140
Don't worry about me.

345
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm not thirsty.

346
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,340
Come on, have some.

347
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Do you feel any better?

348
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,100
Much better, Miss Yang.

349
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,580
But where

350
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,980
what are we now?

351
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,780
We're already

352
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,940
at Jingjie Ancient City now.

353
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,080
Hold on for a while.

354
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,060
We'll get water soon.

355
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,960
Alright.

356
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,920
We should leave right away.

357
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,740
- Fatty.
- Hey!

358
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,140
-You can take the back.
-Hey.

359
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,800
No, I'm fine.

360
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,940
I'm much better now.

361
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,440
Come.

362
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,100
I can walk around and try.

363
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,800
I can't be a burden to everyone.

364
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,940
Ye Ye,

365
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,040
you're so strong.

366
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,800
Alright.

367
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
We'll try walking then.

368
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,420
If you can't find it,

369
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,240
don't try to hold on.

370
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,100
Tell me at any time.

371
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,740
Ye Ye couldn't walk. Tell me.

372
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,660
Let me carry you on my back.

373
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,720
Come on.

374
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,740
Thanks.

375
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,940
Come on

376
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,220
professor Chen

377
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,820
If there is an underground river

378
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,940
where can we find the entrance?

379
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,520
That's right, Hu.

380
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,060
That's good of you.

381
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,760
Let's find the shrine first.

382
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,940
Many shrines in the western region

383
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,280
underground palaces.

384
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,420
There must be underground water in underground palaces.

385
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,020
It's impossible to find

386
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,680
In this deserted place?

387
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,320
Shrine?

388
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,140
Is usually in the middle of the city.

389
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,920
Let's go to the opposite of the stone pagoda.

390
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,920
Come on.

391
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Come on.

392
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,220
Mr. Hu, with this situation,

393
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,380
the shrine is probably buried underground.

394
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,480
It's hard to find.

395
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,460
As long as the shrine exists,

396
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,160
we'll surely find it.

397
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,540
Hold on a little longer.

398
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,260
Hu, what happened?

399
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Nothing.

400
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,720
Hu, what happened?

401
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,300
Look at that.

402
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,740
On the top of the stone pagoda,

403
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,120
does it look like an eye?

404
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,180
Which part?

405
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't you see that? It's like eyes.

406
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,860
You don't see that?

407
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,220
He's not.

408
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,020
It's not that.

409
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,060
Little Hu,

410
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,680
you're worried.

411
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
We can all understand.

412
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,280
Although Marxist philosophy says

413
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,400
that things are universally connected,

414
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,400
but the connection is only possible

415
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,380
- Professor Chen
-Old Hu.

416
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,500
You've worked so hard on your way here.

417
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,080
You should take a good rest.

418
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
Miss Yang,

419
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,120
didn't you say that the Queen of Jinjie Country

420
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,900
would disappear

421
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,920
whoever she sees?

422
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,700
So I think the eyes

423
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,680
means a lot

424
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,520
to Jingjie State.

425
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,960
Many connections are made.

426
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,680
Where are you going, Hu?

427
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,460
Hurry! Come and see this!

428
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,240
Come on.

429
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,420
Amazing.

430
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Look at this.

431
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,660
Mount Zagorama.

432
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,160
This black mountain range

433
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,420
like a black dragon in the desert

434
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,040
In ancient times, the emperors

435
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,700
would do their best

436
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,220
they prepare a mausoleum for themselves

437
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,360
for their centenary.

438
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,580
If there is indeed an underground water vein

439
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,400
under the ancient city,

440
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,300
It echoes

441
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,020
echo each other at a distance

442
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,920
and formed a silent movement.

443
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,060
I think the brilliant queen

444
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,240
must be a remarkable woman

445
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,000
with great talents.

446
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,780
She must know that

447
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,520
the black dragon is a symbol of ill omen.

448
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,380
We'll mobilize our manpower

449
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,920
to cut it up halfway

450
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,180
and make it stay here forever

451
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,400
guarding this mausoleum.

452
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,600
And this city

453
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,220
becomes the best cave.

454
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,660
This is the tomb of the Flawless Queen.

455
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,080
Oh my goodness.

456
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,120
It's mysterious.

457
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,340
Little Wang.

458
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,020
Fatty!

459
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,200
Brother Wang,

460
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,400
what's so hard?

461
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,340
It hurts.

462
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,240
Can you stand under your feet?

463
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,500
Can you just say something nice?

464
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,160
Look at this.

465
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,020
There are steps here.

466
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,680
Hurry!

467
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Professor Chen

468
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,660
could this be

469
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,960
of the ancient town?

470
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,680
I think it was

471
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,280
professor Chen

472
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,200
this is a shrine?

473
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,620
This should be

474
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,560
the entrance of the divine temple.

475
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,080
What are you waiting for?

476
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,940
Fatty, be careful.

477
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,860
Come on, Hu.

478
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,720
Fatty!

479
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,920
Fatty!

480
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,800
My goodness!

481
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,640
Fatty!

482
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,640
Fatty!

483
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,740
Hey!

484
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,260
Come down.

485
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,320
Hurry up. Don't just stand there.

486
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
Be careful.

487
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,920
Hu,

488
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,540
we really found it.

489
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,740
Watch your feet.

490
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
How are you? Are you alright?

491
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,840
I'm alright.

492
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,140
It's the mission of archaeologists

493
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,780
It's the mission of archaeologists.

494
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,820
Come on

495
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
professor Chen, be careful

496
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,080
please take it easy

497
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,300
alright.

498
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,120
And went forward,

499
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,500
peering through a gap,

500
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,790
to see more clearly.

501
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,830
My bravery

502
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,630
with my courage

503
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,630
be together.

504
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:44,660
In my heart,

505
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,580
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

506
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,420
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

507
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,770
Fate only beckons.

508
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,420
But doesn't care

509
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,310
the result.

510
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,420
Trapped in the present

511
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,910
stuck in the present

512
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,270
down the unknown river

513
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,890
down the river,

514
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,350
the greater the desire,

515
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,860
the more you demand.

516
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,450
With full stomach,

517
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,450
they kept their mouths shut.

518
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,260
♪ Fate promised ♪

519
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,840
You'll change your mind.

520
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,290
Giving me sweet words

521
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,870
but lying to me.

522
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,370
You'd climb to Heaven...

523
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,920
And hides again.

524
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,260
Looking young.

525
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,220
And grey overnight.

526
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,110
Down the river

527
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,850
overnight, my hair turns grey.
