Thanks.

Hurry up. There are fewer people now.

6
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,800
Come on, you're really enthusiastic.

7
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,950
If you love your job,

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,900
to love what you do. To be loyal.

9
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,710
Are you with the archaeological team?

10
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,870
Yes

and cross the snow field.

You don't feel tired

14
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,610
you don't feel tired?

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,320
Not really.

16
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,880
His new life is about to begin.

17
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,370
He's mad.

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,050
The truck is too insensitive.

19
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,080
Right.

20
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,190
If it was because of it,

21
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,680
uncle Fat, I can't even

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,590
I'll pull it out.

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,920
Sorry to disappoint you.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,180
Stop scolding me.

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,650
I'll really turn around and beat you up.

Our donkey cart won't outrun them.

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,420
They'll follow behind us

28

calling her brother always.

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,060
And now she even scolds her brother.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,650
But she's acting like a personal person.

31
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,160
What do you mean by that?

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
We are accountant now.

33
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,140
Great!

34
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,120
Return the favor.

- August 1.
-Auntie Swallow. -All right.

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,850
I brought them back.

38
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,560
- I miss them so much! - Mother!
-Mrs. Ge.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
Come on.

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
- We miss you too. - Come on.
- We haven't seen each other in years.

- It's good.
- All right, all right.

Brother Fatty.

You two

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,480
why don't you come back for so many years?

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,830
Now she's back.

52
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,550
He's back.

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,570
There are more here.

54
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,530
This is a child?

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,160
Yes, call him uncle.

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,690
-Hello, uncle.
-Hello, uncle.

57
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,800
Good afternoon.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,460
- Come on.
You're so grown up.

59
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,370
Eat candy.

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,440
Follow it.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,280
Me too.

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,040
Come and have some candy.

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
-I want some, too.
-Thank you, Uncle.

64
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,240
-Thank you, uncle.
-Take it. -Hold it.

65
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,240
Thank you.

-You're welcome. -Come on.

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,100
Here's more.

68
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,760
Eat something sweet.

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,460
Come on, eat sugar.

70
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,980

71
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,430
secretary?

72
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,320
Old secretary.

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,760
Chairman Mao's son is back.

74
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,330
They are back.

75
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,280
How is Chairman Mao doing?

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,440
Yes. He's doing fine.

77
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,170
Right.

78
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,210
He lies in the memorial every day.

79
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,300
Who misses him?

80
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
Can go in and visit him.

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,660
All right.

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,100
Old secretary, here is the thing.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
Comrade Xiao Ping and the others

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,420
reforming and opening up.

85
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,500
What?

86
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,780
Reform and opening-up

87
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,270
you know what?

88
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,570
In 1973,

89
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,530
I was shocked by the blasting.

90
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,790
I can't hear it. I'm always confused.

91
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,680
-Come in. -Let's go.
-Come on. Come.

92
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,640
Come in. Come.

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,880
Come on.

94
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,140
Yanzi, where's your man?

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,680
Where are the young people in our village?

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Blessed...
Was employed by the archaeological team.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,870
Archaeological team?

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,720
What's that?

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,730
It's the government archaeology team.

100
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,240
I lived in Tangshan city in 1976

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
This place belongs to the earthquake zone.

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,650
After that, the whole Niuxin Mountain cracked.

103
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,570
And then I found a huge tomb

104
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,090
that looked like a palace.

105
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,560
That guy has an old nose.

106
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,120
This has alarmed the government.

107
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,680
The archaeology team came right after.

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,000
They hired laborers from the surrounding villages

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
from the neighboring villages.

110
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,700
You give her food and drink.

111
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,050
He pays you 3 Yuan a day.

112
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,280
Bayi was on the way

113
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,700
the truck that gets in the way of Fat Bro's high-pitched speech

114
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,920
that's the archaeological team.

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't stand there.

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,360
Go in.

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,390
-Okay.
-Let's go.

118
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,220
- Come on.
- Food will be ready soon.

119
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,960
Let's go into the room.

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,170
Don't just stand there. Let's go.

121
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,030
Come here.

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,640
Come on.

123
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,340
What's this?

124
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,920
Come on, fatty.

125
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,950
-What's this?
-Come and give me a hand.

126
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,530
Come on.

127
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,100
Let me have a look.

128
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,850
Slow down.

129
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,330
What is this?

130
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,050
This is a television.

131
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,010
-The television.
-The TV.

132
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,560
What?

133
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,280
We can release players.

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes, you can. Where is it?

135
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,310
Television

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,120
television

137
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,020
-Right.
- The old secretary.

138
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,760
Someone might be able to

139
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,800
who can talk to you

140
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,310
so that I can understand the situation in the Central Government.

141
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,450
What?

142
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,490
I haven't got electricity yet.

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,920
You two kids...

144
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,670
We don't have to bring anything since we're back.

145
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,830
Secretary.

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
We should

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,950
I haven't been back for so many years.

148
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,070
I should treat you as my son.

149
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,500
Come on and sit on the kang.

150
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,370
Alright, come on.

151
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,420
-Let's go. Go out to play.
- Come on.

152
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,370
-Okay. Go play outside.
- Get on the bed.

153
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,130
- Go out and play.
- Go out and play.

154
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:05,430
Come on.

155
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,140
- Come on.
- Take off your shoes and get on the bed. - Go on.

156
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,850
They can appear on the TV.

157
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,050
I don't know, I haven't seen it.

158
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,370
Here are the cold dishes.

159
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,600
Eat first.

160
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,790
The hot food will be served soon.

161
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,450
Alright.

162
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,430
Come on.

163
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,620
Why are you two here at this time?

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,290
And bought so many things?

165
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,920
I guess I earned a lot.

166
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,060
Not really.

167
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,820
We both just think that

168
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,960
our life is much better than before.

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,340
We cannot support each other now.

170
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,530
We just want to come back

171
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,850
to lead us to get rich together.

172
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,830
That's right.

173
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,000
Alright.

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Old Secretary.

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,630
I remember you have many vegetables in your backyard.

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,140
Why are you asking this?

177
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,790
I told you just now.

178
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,690
Our country has opened up and reformed.

179
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Now, everyone has friends in Beijing.

180
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,290
We had a friend in Beijing,

181
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,240
he was willing to take these

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,550
these old things and objects.

183
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,670
What's the use of my jars?

184
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,950
They are nothing more than pickles in your place.

185
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,710
But to others, they are works of art.

186
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,750
Look at that old secretary.

187
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
This old thing is nothing.

188
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you know how much it's worth in Beijing?

189
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,220
How much?

190
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,140
Several hundred.

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,220
What?

192
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,050
We would have to buy

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,390
that's why

194
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,840
we came here for this.

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,790
I was thinking

196
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,500
to sell all these pots and pans

197
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,860
to Beijing to sell them.

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,310
After we sell the money,

199
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,440
we'll split it in half with the villagers.

200
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,450
Really?

201
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,480
We're

202
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,350
now that we know each other,

203
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,680
how do you know me?

204
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,360
You two are too late.

205
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,490
The archaeology team came last month.

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,560
And every family has given them food stamps.

207
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,920
Saying that they would all be handed over to the state

208
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,290
to be handed in

209
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,960
In the nearby villages

210
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,640
we've handed in everything.

211
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,690
Your spirit is high.

212
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,360
The State.

213
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,030
What?

214
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,680
He said you have high consciousness and that you are good.

215
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,960
Here comes the hot dishes.

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,080
Stewed chicken and mushroom.

217
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,260
What are you two doing?

218
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,560
Eat.

219
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,430
Eat. Eat.

220
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,660
What are you two doing?

221
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,450
Hurry up and use your chopsticks.

222
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,510
Come on.

223
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,970
I want to drink.

224
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,620
Drink?

225
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,040
Come on. Let's drink first.

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,860
Come on. Okay.

227
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,720
- Come.
- Old Branch Secretary.

228
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,150
Old Hu!

229
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,020
(Fu)

230
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,440
Old Hu.

231
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,930
Why did you come here

232
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,300
why are you here?

233
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,520
We haven't succeeded yet.

234
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,110
We still need to work hard.

235
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,730
You can't be discouraged and commit suicide.

236
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,610
Can you commit suicide with all this water?

237
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,540
I'm here to figure out

238
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,820
about our next move.

239
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,060
What else can we do?

240
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,530
Both of us are really blind this time.

241
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,440
People from this faraway land

242
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,910
have been emptied by the archaeological team.

243
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,280
You know what?

244
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,410
We don't even have enough money to cover our journey back.

245
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,920
Fatty.

246
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,980
Do you still remember

247
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,180
told us about the fortress of Guandong Army?

248
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
That's right.

249
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,610
We still need to go back then.

250
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,920
And then you left when you joined the army.

251
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,330
And we dropped it.

252
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,110
Why are you mentioning it?

253
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
I am thinking that

254
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,930
little Devils must have left

255
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,410
back then.

256
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,140
I've asked my old branch secretary.

257
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,580
The archaeology team didn't know about this.

258
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,240
Even if they did,

259
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,320
they have nothing to do with this.

260
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,480
Hu, what do you mean?

261
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,560
No one has ever found that place before.

262
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,030
We're already in this situation.

263
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,110
If we don't take a chance,

264
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,780
- Got it. - Understood.

265
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,600
Old Hu,

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
I heard that in the village

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,970
a group of people went to find the fortress.

268
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,120
But they never came out after they got into Savage Gulch.

269
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,430
Of course. I'm not talking about us.

270
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,400
I mean if.

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,110
What if?

272
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,050
Be serious.

273
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,550
The savage in the ditch looks very cute.

274
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,730
Be serious.

275
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,700
This is not a wild man.

276
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm busy with my sister.

277
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,080
Mr. Hu, Brother Pang,

278
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,930
I'm Yingzi.

279
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,080
From the Oroqen clan.

280
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,850
Your old branch secretary is worried about you.

281
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,260
So he told me to protect you.

282
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,570
Protect us?

283
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,810
You're just a child.

284
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,230
What's wrong with her?

285
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
You think you can't

286
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,060
leave this forest.

287
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,430
What's more,

288
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,850
no man, either.

289
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,420
Don't you think this old branch secretary is getting old?

290
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,770
We sent her to protect us.

291
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,940
She'll be more trouble.

292
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,950
Cut the crap.

293
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,500
You've taken the wrong way. This way.

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,770
Mr. Hu, I remember that

295
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,230
when we were educated youths,

296
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,520
she was as tall as my legs.

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,790
So she's grown up.

298
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,970
That child of Second Uncle

299
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,100
you two, hurry up.

300
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,520
Fatty, go fetch a kettle of water.

301
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,010
Hurry up.

302
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,140
Hurry up!

303
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,310
Alright.

304
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,360
Make a fire. Don't just stand there.

305
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,120
This way.

306
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,640
Tie the horse there!

307
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,380
-Go. -Go. Come on.

308
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,470
My company commander looks like a soldier

309
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,690
he's like a soldier all the way.

310
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,250
We're men.

311
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,140
This little girl

312
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,560
these days.

313
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,890
But I tell you what,

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,350
I don't think this girl is simple.

315
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,670
We arrived at the Savage Valley smoothly

316
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,010
thanks to her.

317
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,180
Shit!

318
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,950
Maybe Savage Ditch isn't that scary.

319
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,260
Furthermore,

320
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,250
Is there a Japanese stronghold?

321
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,100
Who knows?

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,780
Maybe the people in his village

323
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,020
he must have spread the rumor.

324
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,880
Shut up, get out of here.

325
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,510
Take this for me. I'll remove it.

326
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,700
Be careful.

327
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,200
Don't worry.

328
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,920
It's tied.

329
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,150
It's tied.

330
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,740
And fetch firewood,

331
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,560
alright.

332
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
What?

333
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,770
Hu, Hu! Help!

334
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,330
Come on, Yingzi!

335
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,030
Help

336
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,510
hu, help me!

337
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,360
Fatty!

338
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,790
That's great.

339
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,490
Is embarrassing?

340
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,420
Put on your belt now.

341
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,820
Knife.

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,280
And the bowl.

343
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,070
Here it comes.

344
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,820
Don't burn. Slow down.

345
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,970
It's good.

346
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,890
Eat first. It will be ready soon.

347
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,280
Yingzi, it tastes so good.

348
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,350
Come here.

349
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,650
Where are we going to find

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,690
where are we supposed to find

351
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,870
the Japanese stronghold.

352
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,440
I don't know.

353
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,800
You came by yourself.

354
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,780
As the old branch secretary instructed me,

355
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,830
I will just do it.

356
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,340
Why is this place called Savage Gulch?

357
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,800
Are there really savage people?

358
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,690
This Savage Ditch used to be called Pengyue Ditch,

359
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
It was a graveyard for nobles of Jin Kingdom.

360
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,160
Later, the Mongolian army

361
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
destroyed the golden soldiers.

362
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,760
The corpses of their soldiers

363
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,620
were thrown into this ditch.

364
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
Dead Man's Ditch?

365
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,010
Later, when wild people appeared,

366
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,570
It was called Savages Ditch.

367
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,830
Have you ever seen savages?

368
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,790
No, I only heard it from my father.

369
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,520
Those who saw the savages

370
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,460
are gone.

371
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,400
Enjoy the dinner.

372
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,700
I'll fetch some firewood.

373
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,370
Miss, I'll go with you.

374
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,320
I will protect you.

375
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,470
You're not as good as a dog.

376
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,740
Turn it around.

377
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,640
What are the words?

378
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,710
Around.

379
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,900
I didn't take the initiative to play up to her.

380
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,790
But she even scolded me

381
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
she really pissed me off.

382
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,260
What are you thinking?

383
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,560
Fatty.

384
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,470
Do you know why this place was called

385
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,110
why it was called Pengyue Valley?

386
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't know.

387
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,710
What does that mean?

388
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,550
When the moon

389
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,060
to the top of the valley,

390
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,850
when you look up from here,

391
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,100
when you look up from here.

392
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,290
Look at these.

393
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,460
And the tallest mountains on both sides.

394
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,280
Are like two huge arms

395
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,160
reaching out to the moon.

396
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,320
Why those nobles of Jin State in Liao Dynasty

397
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,940
why were they buried here?

398
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,210
To absorb the pure energy of the universe.

399
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,330
With this kind of feng shui, there must be a tomb.

400
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,120
Old Hu,

401
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,330
In your family's ancestral book.

402
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,660
Look at the terrain.

403
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,550
It's steady and powerful. It can swallow mountains and rivers.

404
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,680
The grasslands are in the west,

405
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,000
the Great Xing'an Mountains are at the north.

406
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,600
Let me put it this way.

407
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,280
The prairie of Outer Mongolia

408
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,000
feel like the vast sea.

409
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And Pengyue Ditch

410
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Is like a great river which flows into the sea.

411
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,440
This kind of geomantic omen

412
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,940
an emperor isn't worthy

413
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
but a prince or a general

414
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,030
more than sufficient

415
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,630
old Hu,

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,690
yingzi is in trouble. Hurry!

417
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,770
You shot Yingzi?

418
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,490
-What's wrong?
-Brother Hu.

419
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,050
You scared me.

420
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,610
I saw a shed

421
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,580
over there,

422
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,730
so I went in and took a look.

423
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,950
But all they found were dead.

424
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,070
It was black and rotten.

425
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,240
At first, I thought he was a wild man

426
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,150
so I fired one shot.

427
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,550
Whose body was it in the end?

428
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,460
Whose body it was.

429
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,980
Don't be scared. Let's go check it out.

430
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,580
Great.

431
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,760
So you're afraid of dead.

432
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,410
I'm not.

433
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,160
Yingzi,

434
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,030
I didn't expect that.

435
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,730
Just some bones.

436
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,370
- Fat, what's wrong?
-It's alright.

437
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,450
Don't worry.

438
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,190
Who is that?

439
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,290
Dead, how dare you provoke me?

440
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,660
Fatty, give me the knife.

441
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,830
Old Hu,

442
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,980
let me take a look at it.

443
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,440
Japanese saber

444
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,980
(Army Hand Disc)

445
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,360
Old Hu,

446
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,720
why don't I think we're in the shelter

447
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,120
not on the same side?

448
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,620
Whether we're a group or not?

449
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,210
Some people in this group are Japanese.

450
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,540
(Military DVD)
Those outside are tomb robbers.

451
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,840
It's written here.

452
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,740
You can read Japanese characters too?

453
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,200
That's for sure.

454
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,650
The Japanese are all the descendants of Chinese.

455
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,150
These writing systems are all Chinese.

456
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,860
It's half a look and half a guess.

457
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,180
Blow it.

458
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,420
Tell me what is written on it.

459
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,250
Read this.

460
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,810
He writes in his notebook

461
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,560
these Japanese

462
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,410
mILITARY DISC
I originally came here for the fort.

463
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,010
The Japanese fort. Look at the fort.

464
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,450
And wanted to unite with the Guandong Army inside.

465
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,440
But in the end,

466
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,670
their guide is dead.

467
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,210
They're just hanging there...

468
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,990
For a few years

469
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,560
later, a group of grave robbers came

470
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,220
watch this.

471
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,660
(Army CD)

472
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,580
They must be tomb robbers.

473
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,880
The robbers told them

474
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,710
you have surrendered.

475
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,110
These Japanese got angry

476
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,470
and killed them all.

477
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,000
In the end,

478
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,920
(Army CD)
Broken jade.

479
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,530
Yummy!

480
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,910
Yeah.

481
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,090
Should be laparotomy.

482
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,890
Does it mean that the savages in the forest

483
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,500
are the Japanese.

484
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,750
It's possible.

485
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,720
Look, it's written here.

486
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,330
It appears in the year 33 of Showa.

487
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,510
After all those years wandering in the woods,

488
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,060
after wandering in the woods for so many years?

489
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,840
He wanted to go out,

490
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,490
the wood is huge. Can he go out?

491
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,880
We should leave.

492
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,180
This is so creepy.

493
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,690
Come on.

494
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,010
According to the notebook,

495
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,360
are tomb robbers.

496
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,250
If my judgment is right,

497
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,060
this is the tomb.

498
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,890
Here?

499
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,300
Where?

500
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,220
Lao Hu had an engineering shovel

501
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,830
luo Yang shovel,

502
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,630
there must be a burglary hole nearby

503
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,920
yingzi, give me the flashlight.

504
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,230
Let's go.

505
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,070
Give it to me.

506
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,170
Slow down, Fatty.

507
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:26,910
What's that

508
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,960
I don't know.

509
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,450
Fatty, don't move!

510
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,580
Hurry up. I'll go down and have a look.

511
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,880
Give me a hand.

512
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,040
Slow down.

513
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,440
What's up

514
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,000
come on.

515
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,500
Slow down.

516
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,790
What happened?

517
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,160
They dug up

518
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,740
top of Tianbao Dragon Fire Glaze Glaze.

519
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,860
What's the top?

520
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,310
The roof of Tianbao Dragon Fire Colored Glaze Glaze

521
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,300
these were used as anti-theft techniques

522
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,680
for some aristocratic tombs in the Northern Song Dynasty.

523
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,460
Their burial chambers are all hollow.

524
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,240
And put a layer of glazed tiles on the top.

525
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,810
On the tiles were bags of Western Region Fire Dragon Oil

526
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,880
and glazed tiles.

527
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,920
And then sealed them with earth.

528
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,660
But since the tile is so thin

529
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,560
as long as external force enters it,

530
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,550
the roof will break if it touches it,

531
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,330
and Western Region Fire Dragon Oil touched upon the air.

532
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,640
All the bones and funerary objects in the tomb chamber

533
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,270
will be burned.

534
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,510
Perish together

535
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,160
luckily you didn't fight too hard just now.

536
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,370
If you used more strength,

537
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,740
we're in flames right now.

538
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,060
My goodness.

539
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,150
I think the tomb robbers

540
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,490
they must have dug a side cave nearby.

541
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,620
Where's Yingzi?

542
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,780
She was here just now.

543
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,320
Brother Hu,

544
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,330
yingzi,

545
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,670
brother Hu.

546
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,390
Fat Brother Hu.

547
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,560
Yingzi.

548
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,830
Yingzi, are you down there?

549
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,980
Hu, I'm down there.

550
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,940
Are you alright?

551
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,110
I'm fine. I sprained my ankle.

552
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,590
And I can't climb it.

553
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,550
Fatty.

554
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,930
Is this the side tunnel they dug?

555
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,990
Bring the stuff here.

556
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,010
Don't forget the rope.

557
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,610
Alright.

558
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,390
And went forward,

559
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,390
peering through a gap,

560
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,050
to see more clearly.

561
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,960
My bravery

562
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,220
with my courage

563
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:55,190
be together.

564
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:02,040
In my heart,

565
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,250
♫ Composed of some secrets ♫

566
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,200
♪ You never mention it to anyone ♪

567
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,320
Fate only beckons.

568
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,260
But doesn't care

569
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,620
the result.

570
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,820
Trapped in the present

571
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,350
stuck in the present

572
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,940
down the unknown river

573
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,980
down the river,

574
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,800
the greater the desire,

575
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,020
the more you demand.

576
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,610
With full stomach,

577
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,080
they kept their mouths shut.

578
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,890
♪ Fate has promised ♪

579
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,340
Will change.

580
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,790
She poured out her love words

581
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,350
but lying to me.

582
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,130
You'd climb to Heaven...

583
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,180
And hides again.

584
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,720
Looking young.

585
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,700
And grey overnight.

586
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,830
Down the river

587
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,720
overnight, my hair turns grey.
