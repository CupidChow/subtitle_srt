00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:19,292
I've been dispatched here to be
your new police officer, Daigo Agawa.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,833
And this is my wife, Yuki,
and my daughter, Mashiro.

00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:27,792
The officer and his family
are formally members of the village!

Gin Goto.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,708
[Keisuke] The head of the Goto family

12
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,667
and me
and my brother Yosuke's grandmother.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,458
[Keisuke] Are you saying
we were abusing her or something?

14
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,958
[police chief] Stay away from the Gotos.

15
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,625
You're better off
not getting involved with the Gotos.

16
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,542
The Goto family has always been
at the root of every problem.

17
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,208
[Sumire]
They're definitely hiding something.

18

I know about your past.

19
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,958
[Tsubasa] Mashiro, let's die together.

27
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,792
[Taichi]
One of the rules of Kuge Village is

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,875
"Don't get involved with the Gotos."

29
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,708
You broke it.

By someone in Kuge Village.

33
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,792
[Munechika] The votive festival of Kuge.

34
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,833
Human sacrifices
were once made to the gods.

35
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,583
There's a child somewhere in the village
who'll be eaten

36
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,917
on the day of the festival.

37
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,000
A child?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,042
My baby is alive. He's still alive.

39
00:01:56,042 --> 00:02:00,625
[Kanako yells] Gin Goto took my baby!

40
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,750
[Munechika] You and your family
should leave the village.

41
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,208
At this rate,

42
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,917
you'll end up like Mr. Kano.

43
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,292

44
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,792

I don't trust anyone in this village.

- I'll kill you.
- Have you lost your mind?

46
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,250
It's them, not me.

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,917
[Nakamura] It's the laughing sickness.

48
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,667
It's him.

49
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,000
[Daigo]
The man who the Gotos call "That Man."

50
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,042
[Keisuke] Look after this one until then.

51
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,625
Prepare him to be offered to That Man.

52
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,875
Do they look human to you?

53
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,625
[Gin]
Humans are just walking slabs of meat.

54
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,417
The only people I consider human
are you all sitting in front of me.

55
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,833
You feel the same way, don't you?

56
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,833
I see you as a human being, nothing else.

57
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,167
Keisuke!

58
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,833
How can you keep victimizing the children?

59
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,583
Are you going to protect her
with your own life?

60
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,583
I believe... in Mom.

61
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,125
[Munechika] It's a curse.

62
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,833

68
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,292
I have to do it.

69
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:25,583
[Daigo] I have someone
who's helping me look for them.

70
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,292
He just found it.

71
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,083
[Daigo] I'll head there now.

72
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,875
All things considered,
why don't we follow Agawa's lead?

73
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:37,542
[Kanemaru] He may solve this case,
once and for all.

180
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,833
Let's prioritize securing Agawa.

181
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,792
- Okay.
- Gotcha.

182
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,875
Everyone, please don't do
anything reckless.

183
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,042
You heard him. Get to it.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,375
Okay. Let's go.

185
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,292
I just hope they'll make it in time.

186
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,083
Something has been bothering me.

187
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,500
What? [deep exhale]

188
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,417
Tell me...

189
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,458
did you pull some strings
to make Agawa go berserk on purpose?

190
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,583
No way.

191
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,625
That's your imagination talking.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,042

Excuse me? [wheezing chuckle]

196
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,917
What am I plotting? [chuckling]

197
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:09,042
There's only one thing we want.

199
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,375
[Kanemaru] Isn't that right?

200
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,208
Mr. Mayor?

201
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:28,000
I never imagined
someone like you turning up here.

202
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,708
[Keisuke] What are you doing?

203
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,333
I'm going to talk to Yosuke in private.

204
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:52,792
Get lost.

205
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,250
I'll only ask this once.

206
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,625
Are you the one who told the Officer
where the cells are?

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,125
It wasn't me.

208
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,833
I already told Iwao.

209
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,167
I haven't seen the Officer
since I killed that bear.

210
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,542
Then what were you doing
with that livestock?

211
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,542
I heard you were trying
to take it out of the cell.

[sighs]

213
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,875
In the Goto family,
betrayal is the worst crime of all.

214

You know that, right?

215
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,125
Answer me, Yosuke.

216
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,750

Where we used to go, just you and me.

227

Tell me, what happened to the kids?

Where are they?

Tell me! Where are...

230

Never mind. You just do as you're told.

[Kiyoshi] Mr. Kano and I really hit it off
at the votive festival three years ago.

00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,792
Back then,

244
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,667
we in the Goto family got along...

[Aragaki] We've reached the place
where the kids were being held.

[Kanemaru] Yeah?

250
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,125
[Kikuta] I found a handgun.

251
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,875
I think it might be Mr. Agawa's.

252

Uh...

253
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,458
[Kikuta] He's fired four shots.

Oh, well.
Come back to the station for now.

[Aragaki] Right.

to stamp out the Goto family.

Sure, go ahead.

Did you know?

As I thought, they're in Kuge Village.

[Kiyoshi] It gets reception
even out in the mountains. Pretty useful.

301

Mr. Kano provided it.

Said he'd borrowed it from someone.

you'll run away again.

361
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,833
[Kuroe] I won't run away!

Young lady Kuroe is back.

363

364
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,708
- [family member 1] Don't run away again.

You did well to return.

370
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,833
[Kuroe] Sorry, Grandma.

371
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,167
[Sadamu] You haven't done anything wrong.

372
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,083
I know.

373
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,583
I won't choose a man based on looks again.

374
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,708
Well said.

375
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,417
It's all that asshole's fault.

There are...

Not you.

382

[Ryuji] The guy who says "asshole"
is the real asshole.

392
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,083
- What about Tomo?
- [family member 7] Forget about it.

393
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,750
[Sadamu] Huh?

394
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,000
You said you got rid of him.

395
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,167
What did you mean by that?

396
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,583
What happens to him
is none of your concern.

397
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,750
Want me to make you
forget about everything?

398
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,333
Huh? Come on.

Oh, Sadamu. You're back.

401

It's been a while.

402
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,875
I heard you're the head of the family now.

403
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,958
- [Keisuke] Yeah.
- Congratulations.

[Sadamu] Man, am I busy.

420

Sorry for making you remember
that unpleasant stuff.

434

Let's forget all about it...

435
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,458
and live a peaceful life.

436
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,417
We can't do that.

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,375
Then why did you leave those two behind
and run away with me?

440
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,250
I ran away so I could get revenge.

441
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,333
Let alone the village and the Goto family...

442
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:58,208

From now on, you will live as my daughter.

00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,458
[Munechika] Yeah.

541
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,792
This is the place.

542
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,542
This is where they performed the ritual.

543
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:15,708
This space itself is the object of worship
of the Kurunokami Shrine.

544
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,542
The inner sanctum.

545
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,042
You're telling me
they worshiped the place...

546
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,208
where they killed children?

547
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,583
[Munechika] That's right.

548
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,625
But...

549
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:37,125
it all began out of starvation
leaving them no choice...

550
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,167
There was a family who began to steal
the bodies from the ritual.

551
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,750
They stole them...

552
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,375
and ate them.

553
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,333
[Munechika] Well...

554
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,750
I don't know what really happened.

555
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:07,917
Mr. Agawa.

556
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,958
I know...

557
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,250
where the children are now.

558
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,083
Huh?

559
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:26,208
I've been secretly asked
to tell you where they are.

560
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,750
By whom?

561
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,208
Well...

562
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Are you okay, Yuki? Are you hurt?

563
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,000
[soft exhale] I'm okay.

564
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,375
[soft chuckle]

565
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,375
Marrying a police officer brings you
nothing but trouble, huh?

566
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,000
[Sendo chuckles softly]

567
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,250
My husband is a police officer too.

568
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,792
We're three years in.

569
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:13,542
We had a quarrel the other day... [chuckles]

570
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,125
...and I threw a cactus at him!

571
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,542
- [both chuckle]
- [engine revving]

572
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,750
[tires screech]

573
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,750
[tires screeching]

574
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,208
[♪ tense ominous music playing]

575
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,333
[family member whoops]

576
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,500
- [family member] That was an accident!
- [cracks]

577
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,083
[coughs]

578
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:00,875
Hey, you alive?

579
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:06,042
[grunting weakly, breathing heavily]

580
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,917
[whistles] Hey.

581
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:17,542
[whistling]

582
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:28,292
- [whistling continues]
- [indistinct chatter]

583
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,292
[whistling continues]

584
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:46,542
[♪ closing theme music playing]
