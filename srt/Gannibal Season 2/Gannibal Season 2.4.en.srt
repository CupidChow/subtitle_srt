1
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,542
Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,042
- Hey, watch out!
- Let's see. This way, I think.

3
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,250
It's this way, isn't it?

4
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:34,792
Huh? What? This isn't right.
Huh? Which way is it?

5
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:36,792
This is it.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,417
Looks like I'm too late.

7
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,042
Don't worry.

8
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,125
I'll save you no matter what.

9
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,583
You came alone?

10
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

11
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,458
Let's get this over with already.

12
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,375
Fine.

13
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,250
Now hand over Yosuke.

14
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,333
I'll give you back your wife and daughter.

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,125
You're not lying, right?

16
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,208
No.

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,000
We'll release our hostages
on the count of three.

18
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,417
Okay?

19
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,542
One…

20
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,292
Two…

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
- Three.
- Wait.

22
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,542
Let me ask one thing.

23
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,167
Yosuke.

24
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,375
How did you get caught?

25
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,167
With your skill, killing all the cops
should have been easy.

26
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,250
So how did they catch you all
and rescue the kids?

27
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,958
This guy can't shoot anyone.

28
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,375
You shut up.

29
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Well?

30
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,292
Answer me, Yosuke.

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,625
How did you get caught?

32
00:03:56,042 --> 00:04:00,083
Ai Goto and the kid
who escaped being eaten.

33
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,250
Where are they?

34
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,958
I've already told you.

35
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,042
I was called here.

36
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,167
I don't know anything.

37
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,833
Next time, it'll be you.

38
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:29,542
I really don't know. Please don't do it.

39
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,667
You don't know?

40
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,167
Then die.

41
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,542
Oh! Wait, I know! I know!

42
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,625
Tell me!

43
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,417
- I know!
- Where? Tell me!

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,125
- I know.
- Tell me!

45
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,167
- I know. I know! I--
- You don't know, after all.

46
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
I'm tired of this. Die!

47
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:45,792
Stop!

48
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,417
What the hell, guys?

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,042
That's where you were?

50
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,958
Something happened in Kuge Village, right?

51
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,167
To Keisuke and the others.

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,083
No need to tell someone
who's about to die.

53
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,542
You damn livestock!

54
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,125
I--

55
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
Don't talk.

56
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,125
I--

57
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,167
I told you not to talk.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,583
Hey.

59
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,958
You betrayed us!

60
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,083
No!

61
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,083
I want what's best for everyone!

62
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:44,542
I just don't want anyone to die.

63
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,208
This is wrong. It's all wrong!

64
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,167
Those kids aren't livestock!

65
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,458
They're just clueless, innocent kids!

66
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,708
The same goes for those two.

67
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,375
They've got nothing to do with this!

68
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,083
Come on, Brother. It's enough.

69
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,250
Let's just stop all of this.

70
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,667
Shut up, Yosuke.

71
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,083
You're the one who's wrong!

72
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,625
Keisuke.

73
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,375
You're the one
who revealed the kids' location!

74
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,500
Shut up, Officer!

75
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,667
Huh?

76
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,333
It was his dad who betrayed us.

77
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,292
Anyway, Keisuke dealt with him.

78
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,292
That can't be true.

79
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,250
Brother!

80
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah.

81
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,292
It's true.

82
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
I killed our dad.

83
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,042
What now, Keisuke?

84
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,708
You want to deal
with your little brother yourself too?

85
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,500
First things first.

86
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,708
We don't need these two anymore.

87
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,292
Hey! Don't even think about it, prick!

88
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,208
Do whatever you want with him.

89
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,250
That's what we're going to do!

90
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't kill anyone else.

91
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,875
You've really done it now, Keisuke.

92
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,208
You protected the lives of livestock
rather than the Goto family!

93
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,292
You're a traitor, just like your dad.

94
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,042
We already have an heir.

95
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
We'll raise them right.

96
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,500
You can die reassured.

97
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,333
Stop it, Iwao!

98
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,958
- Stop it, please!
- That's enough, Iwao.

99
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,083
Iwao!

100
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,292
Officer!

101
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,042
Yuki. Run.

102
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,917
This way. Quickly, quickly! Run!

103
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,625
Stop it, Brother!

104
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,542
Out of the way, Yosuke.

105
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,625
I finally threw you.

106
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,417
Whose side are you on?

107
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,583
You're the one
who told me where the kids were!

108
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,083
Weren't you going to put an end to it all?

109
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,458
What the hell do you want?

110
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,417
I don't know.

111
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,083
Huh?

112
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,583
I don't know… what I should do anymore.

113
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,750
Mashiro, run!

114
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,458
Wait. Stop!

115
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:50,208
Let… Let go. Let go! Let… Let go!

116
00:14:55,583 --> 00:15:00,375
Let go! Let go of Mashiro!

117
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,542
Mom.

118
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,833
Stop!

119
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,667
If Mashiro dies, it's your fault!

120
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,542
Now go, hurry!

121
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:35,208
Hey. Keep it together! Hey!

122
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,333
Mashiro… hang in there.

123
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,333
I'll be right there…

124
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,208
Mashiro…

125
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,542
I had faith that you would come, Utada.

126
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,542
I'll stick with you until the end.

127
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,000
So, you're Ai Goto.

128
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,833
- Yes.
- I see.

129
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,458
With you on our side,

130
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,250
we might still be able to stop
the Goto family's festival.

131
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,167
Please tell me.

132
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,083
What is going on with the Goto family?

133
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,708
I'll tell you in the car.

134
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,917
We should leave right away.

135
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,583
It's okay.

136
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,000
You wait here.

137
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,375
I promise I'll be back.

138
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,208
<i> Kill him.</i>

139
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,792
<i>Kill him.</i>

140
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,875
<i>Kill him.</i>

141
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,125
<i>Kill him.</i>

142
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,458
<i>Kill him.</i>

143
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,875
<i>Kill him.</i>

144
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,833
<i>Kill him.</i>

145
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

146
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,708
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

147
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,917
The one the Goto family calls "That Man"…

148
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:14,042
is a corruption of the word <i>"Arahito."</i>

149
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,292
<i>"Arahito." </i>A god incarnate?

150
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,375
That's right.

151
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,792
It means
a god that is incarnated in human form.

152
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:35,083
Its existence has been passed down
in the lore of Kuge Village

153
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,667
since more than 700 years ago.

154
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:43,458
Even today,
they worship it as an absolute god.

155
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,625
No.

156
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,542
That's not a god, it's just…

157
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,167
a little child.

158
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,583
Its body may grow old,

159
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,667
but it still has…

160
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,292
the soul of a child.

161
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
We must hurry.

162
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,333
We have to get there before the festival.

163
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,458
He killed Iwao.

164
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,417
Officer!

165
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,000
- Well?
- They're gone.

166
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,917
Where did Keisuke and Yosuke go?

167
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,917
Maybe the Officer kidnapped them?

168
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:03,875
You're wrong!

169
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,250
Sadamu. You're alive?

170
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,708
Yosuke betrayed us.

171
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,292
Almost got me killed.

172
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,292
What are you saying? Yosuke?

173
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,500
Damn!

174
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,417
And here we are!

175
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,417
All our soldiers are dead,

176
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,958
and the Officer
and the main household brothers are gone.

177
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,167
Even a monkey
could figure out what happened.

178
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,542
So, Keisuke betrayed us too?

179
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,167
To think you would be betrayed by Keisuke.

180
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:43,375
- Wh-What? W-Wait, it's me! Let me go!
- I'll kill you… Kill you…

181
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,750
Kill… Kill… Kill… Kill…

182
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,792
How are you still alive in this condition?

183
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,417
Mr. Priest.

184
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,667
You don't have to do everything yourself.

185
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll help you.

186
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,333
It's okay, Toki.

187
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,833
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

188
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,000
It's fine.

189
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,208
Oh…

190
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,667
Are you awake?

191
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,292
This is the main hall of the shrine.

192
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,625
No one will find you here.

193
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,500
I tended to your wounds.

194
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,875
I used to study to be a doctor.

195
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,042
Here's a painkiller. Please take it.

196
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,500
I'll bring you some ice. Please wait here.

197
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,375
Well?

198
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,667
Yuki may have suffered
a cerebral contusion.

199
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,083
She should be taken to a hospital quickly.

200
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,417
But… I can't leave this place.

201
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,375
Yosuke, take Agawa's wife
and leave the village.

202
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,000
What are you going to do, Brother?

203
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,917
I've got my work cut out for me.

204
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,917
Are you going to kill the Officer?

205
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,583
Like you killed Dad?

206
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,083
I didn't want to kill him.

207
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,667
Even someone like him was still our dad.

208
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,458
Then…

209
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,750
why?

210
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:53,292
Why do you try to handle
everything yourself?

211
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,667
Can't you tell me…

212
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:02,667
at least tell me what you're thinking?

213
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,625
I'm not like you.

214
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,833
You didn't leave anyone to die.

215
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,250
But I…

216
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:20,542
I've left many kids to die until now.

217
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,042
I might as well have killed them myself.

218
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,250
Brother…

219
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,167
I'll take care of the rest…

220
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,500
of our family.

221
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,750
Let's go.

222
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:34,875
Mr. Agawa.

223
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,875
I'm going to take Yuki to the hospital.

224
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:39,792
Please wait here.

225
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,042
Please…

226
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,958
save Yuki.

227
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,542
If it weren't for you…

228
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,542
If it weren't for you,
no one would have died.

229
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,500
You see, at the time,

230
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,958
I really didn't want to die in vain.

231
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,167
- So--
- Brace yourself.

232
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,583
I thought I'd take at least
one of those damn Goto people with me,

233
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,958
so I went out to fight.

234
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,583
But they swarmed me like a pack of hyenas.

235
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,000
Someone whacked me from behind.

236
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,500
When I woke up…

237
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,917
Well, it was already over.

238
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,583
How awful.

239
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,583
They're such cowards.

240
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,417
But you know…

241
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,292
looking at the dead bodies
of the men all around me,

242
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,667
I realized something.

243
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:52,375
The Goto family is only human, after all.

244
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,458
Yeah.

245
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,417
Why was I so afraid of them before?

246
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,167
That's right.

247
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,458
If we set our minds to it,
we can take the Goto family easily.

248
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,667
I heard gunshots from the west just now.

249
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,958
Ha! I wonder who died this time.

250
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,875
Now Sabu can rest in peace.

251
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:13,958
Sabu…

252
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,333
Nothing beats
the sound of dying Gotos, right?

253
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,417
- For sure.
- True.

254
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Serves them right.

255
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:24,250
I'm glad
you made it back alive, Kunitoshi.

256
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,208
Jin, it must have been terrible.

257
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:29,542
- Damn.
- Have a drink.

258
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:33,250
If they think they can
boss us around forever, they're wrong.

259
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:36,917
Just a little longer.

260
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,042
Soon the Goto family will fall.

261
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:48,167
They should just keep dying
until they're all gone.

262
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,250
Yeah.

263
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,792
That's right. That's right.

264
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,125
You're right.

265
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,292
I'm trembling with excitement.

266
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,375
If the old hag were still alive,

267
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,667
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

268
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:18,125
How did Sabu face his death?

269
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,375
Sendo!

270
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,625
You're being reckless.

271
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,833
I told you not to come here.

272
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,292
Sorry.

273
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:41,917
I couldn't do anything.

274
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,708
The enemy is out of control.

275
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,667
Have you heard about the situation?

276
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,375
The Goto family ran amok
and killed several police officers.

277
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,083
Even Kikuta…

278
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,208
What about Kanemaru and Aragaki?

279
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,458
We can't reach them.

280
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,375
So, perhaps…

281
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,583
No…

282
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,833
The people from headquarters are here.

283
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,667
Sir.

284
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,125
I'm Tanaka
from the Morobe police department.

285
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,083
Allow me to report on the situation…

286
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:48,042
We are currently searching
for Sergeant Agawa and the hostages.

287
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:52,500
But we may encounter armed members
of the Goto family in the village,

288
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,167
- and require a large-scale operation--
- The search is off.

289
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,667
You're all reassigned
to logistical support.

290
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,583
- But sir--
- I've requested an SAT.

291
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,958
Once they arrive,
we'll capture Kuge Village by force.

292
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,042
Wait a moment.

293
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,792
If we can arrest
Keisuke Goto and the ringleaders,

294
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,708
we should be able
to neutralize the family.

295
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,083
Arrest them?

296
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,167
How?

297
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,667
I'm here because you failed to do that.

298
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,583
On the night of the festival,

299
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,000
the Goto family will gather
for their ritual.

300
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,958
If we just find out where…

301
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,042
Ritual?

302
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,458
We need to know

303
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,208
where they're going to sacrifice
the children.

304
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,708
Sympathy for your own, huh?

305
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,250
What?

306
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,333
I heard you were born in the village.

307
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,250
That's why you handle them
with kid gloves.

308
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,500
You're wrong! I was only--

309
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,458
Anyway, if there's no new information,
then there's no change in plan.

310
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,125
Many of our colleagues have been killed.

311
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,708
We won't hold back.

312
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,167
Excuse me.

313
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:54,583
Someone calling herself a Goto is here.

314
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:05,458
Ms. Ai Goto, isn't it?

315
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,667
I'll tell you everything I can.

316
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:35,625
So please… spare Keisuke and Yosuke.

317
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,000
Give me that!

318
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,750
Give it to me.

319
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,167
Hey.

320
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,375
You're not old enough.

321
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,833
Hey, Brother.
Let me borrow it.

322
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,250
Will you scram already?

323
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,167
Give it to me.

324
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,583
Shut up.

325
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,375
Give it to me.

326
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,667
Give it to me.

327
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,250
Okay.

328
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:52,333
So, you have to hold here, okay?

329
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:58,875
Then you hold like this,
and look here when you shoot.

330
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:05,417
Then you shoulder it,
look where you're going to shoot…

331
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,708
and then you shoot.

332
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,250
Keisuke.

333
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,208
There is someone I want you to meet.

334
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,625
Come.

335
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,917
The symbol of the Goto Family,
That Man.

336
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,125
The god of Kuge Village.

337
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,333
Are you scared?

338
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:00,833
Of course.

339
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,167
Take this.

340
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,625
Spread them out over there.

341
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,750
Mom.

342
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:18,292
It is the Goto family's role…
to protect this god.

343
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,208
Do you understand, Keisuke?

344
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:16,833
Why?

345
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,083
Why did you help me?

346
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,833
I hate you.

347
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,417
But…

348
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:39,167
I don't want to sacrifice any more kids…

349
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,583
including your daughter.

350
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:47,708
Is Mashiro…

351
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:49,875
Yeah.

352
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,583
She's still alive.

353
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,083
What did you say?

354
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,542
Where is Mashiro…

355
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:06,875
Calm down.

356
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,958
There's still time
before the festival begins.

357
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,917
That Man won't eat anyone until then.

358
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,500
What the hell?

359
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,250
How can you be sure of that?

360
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,542
Those are the rules of the festival.

361
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:33,750
This makes no sense.

362
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,917
What rules?

363
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,000
What is that old geezer?

364
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,625
Why does he eat people?

365
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:48,208
Why do you and the villagers
just accept it?

366
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,875
Indeed.

367
00:42:56,375 --> 00:43:03,250
It must seem monstrous to an outsider.

368
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,292
Going back to the beginning,
it used to make some kind of sense.

369
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:19,333
But the weight of the years has warped it.

370
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,542
Who the hell are you?

371
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,083
This is my grandfather, Masamune Kamiyama.

372
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,875
It's been a long time, Keisuke.

373
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,542
That child, you see…

374
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:45,583
is not That Man,
the symbol of the Goto family.

375
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:53,458
Nor is it the villagers' god incarnate.

376
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,750
<i> It is just…</i>

377
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:04,500
<i>a lone, pitiful human.</i>

378
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,125
<i>It was over 70 years ago.</i>

379
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:49,375
The Goto family ruled Kuge Village,
just like now,

380
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:52,875
no, even more.

381
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:58,375
The villagers lived in constant torment.

382
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,875
In the village,

383
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:07,667
Gin did everything she could…

384
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:13,250
to free the oppressed villagers.

385
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:16,625
Gin Goto did that?

386
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:23,250
She was not the Gin…

387
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,792
that you know.

388
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,750
<i>She was a fine woman.</i>

389
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:59,708
<i>Beautiful enough to drive anyone mad.</i>
