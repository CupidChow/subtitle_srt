1
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:08,125
It was over 70 years ago.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:14,750
The Goto family ruled Kuge Village,
just like now.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,667
The villagers lived in constant torment.

4
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:32,250
<i>Gin did everything she could</i>

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,125
<i>to free the oppressed villagers.</i>

6
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,542
<i> The year is 1949.</i>

7
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,958
<i>This village knew neither the war…</i>
<i>nor its aftermath.</i>

8
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,375
<i>There were no food provisions left</i>
<i>in any of the houses.</i>

9
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:40,208
<i>Everyone… has begun to fear that family.</i>

10
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>Kinji Goto…</i>

11
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:51,583
<i>Ever since he became head of the family,</i>
<i>everything has gone wrong.</i>

12
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,958
<i>The village is on a slow and steady path</i>
<i>toward destruction.</i>

13
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,958
Over here, over here.
Nice work.

14
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,167
That's food, all of it.

15
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,917
Unbelievable.

16
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,625
And there are people
in the village who are starving to death.

17
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,667
This family is special,
after all.

18
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,458
What is it? Are you scared, Masamune?

19
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,250
Don't worry. This village will get better.

20
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,417
I'll see to that.

21
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,167
This way, please.

22
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,708
Go ahead.

23
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,000
My father, Sada,

24
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:33,750
expressed his gratitude to you many times
before he passed away.

25
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,917
We in the Goto family…

26
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,833
owe a lot to you, Chief Priest Yoshimune.

27
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,917
I wish I could have attended
Mr. Sada's funeral.

28
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,750
My father… requested that
the funeral be for the Goto family only.

29
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,917
Hmm… Really?

30
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,833
What do you mean?

31
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,917
I thought Sada had laughing sickness?

32
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,417
Why didn't you investigate
the cause of the disease?

33
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:17,500
Don't tell me
the Goto family actually eats people?

34
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,833
Father.

35
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:33,917
When it became known that high-quality
Japanese cypresses grew on Goto lands,

36
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,667
you became our go-between
with the government, right?

37
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,208
I did.

38
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,333
Thanks to that, the Goto family prospered.

39
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,167
I haven't forgotten
that debt of gratitude.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,083
I would prefer not to use violence.

41
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,792
You mean you "can't" use violence.

42
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,167
If you put your hands on me,
the villagers will storm this place.

43
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,917
Not even you lot will get away unscathed.

44
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,833
Listen, Kinji.

45
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,792
You can't win over the village
just by stealing the land.

46
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,708
I'm on your side.

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,917
At this rate,
Kuge Village will be divided.

48
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,500
That's why I'm offering to mediate
between your family and the village.

49
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:24,917
Kinji.

50
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:30,708
If you want to rule Kuge Village,
you need to play your cards better.

51
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,458
You're a real scoundrel.

52
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,208
Fair enough. Lend me a hand.

53
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,792
No, you can't do that.

54
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,917
Hey, runt.

55
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,417
Don't be so full of yourself.

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,875
It was you villagers
who started this fight.

57
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,833
Without even knowing
about the "Kashihabe."

58
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,708
"Kashihabe"?

59
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,750
Hey!

60
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,542
It was a mistake to bring him along.

61
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,417
Kinji…

62
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,833
please forgive us.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,583
Enough. Stop bowing.

64
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,458
Michigoro.

65
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,833
Fetch all the meat we have.

66
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,500
Prepare a feast for Yoshimune and his son.

67
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,958
Right.

68
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,833
Hey.

69
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,000
Please wait.

70
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,083
You help out too.

71
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,542
Okay.

72
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,000
Someone tattled to the priest?

73
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,333
So typical of this village.

74
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,125
The countryside is so boring.

75
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,083
Kinji.

76
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,833
I heard you beat up another villager.

77
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:37,833
You say that the Goto family…

78
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,667
eats people?

79
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,708
In that case…

80
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,875
I'll eat up…

81
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,708
all of Kuge Village.

82
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,958
Devour!

83
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,125
Every last scrap.

84
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,083
"Laughing sickness"? Bah!

85
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,667
I was the one who killed Father.

86
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,333
Isn't that obvious?

87
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,250
That is Gin Goto.

88
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,917
She's lost her sanity.

89
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,875
Let's go.

90
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,625
What are you doing?

91
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
You'll catch a cold.

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're hurt.

93
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,625
I'll go get my father right away.

94
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,708
Wait…

95
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,125
It's not your father
I want to talk to, but you.

96
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't want anyone else to hear this.

97
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,375
I only want you to hear this.

98
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:04,583
This place is only known
to the Chief Priests of Kurunokami Shrine.

99
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,417
No one will hear us here.

100
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,500
Then, it's like our own secret place.

101
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,292
Did Kinji beat you?

102
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,292
He does this all the time.

103
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,542
He wants my body…

104
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,458
No… isn't he your brother?

105
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:52,625
No one in that house
thinks of me as family.

106
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,458
Do you know
what they call me in Kuge Village?

107
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:10,917
"Whore."

108
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,917
"Slut."

109
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,542
"Illegitimate child."

110
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,792
There's no place for me in this village.

111
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,625
I can't complain.

112
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,708
That's not true.

113
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:34,708
No matter who you are,
that treatment is unacceptable.

114
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,333
You are a fine young woman.

115
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,417
Thank you.

116
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,292
No one has ever said that to me before.

117
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,792
I want to know more about you.

118
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,458
You can tell me anything.

119
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,917
Then, listen and learn.

120
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,250
Everything about me.

121
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,125
Thanks for the ride.

122
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,292
I was going into town anyway.

123
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,917
Don't worry about it.

124
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,833
The villagers are full of vigor again.

125
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,833
Disgusting livestock.

126
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,750
- Say, Yoshimune.
- Huh?

127
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,792
Do you know the biggest difference
between me and them?

128
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,083
Unlike me,
they can't do anything by themselves.

129
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,917
If everything goes smoothly,
they're all right.

130
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,042
If they're in trouble,
all they can do is cling to you.

131
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,292
Cowards.

132
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,125
Hey, pull over.

133
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,292
Yes, sir.

134
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,833
By the way, Yoshimune.

135
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,333
- Have you slept with Gin yet? Hmm?
- Huh?

136
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,542
<i>That woman is poison.</i>

137
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,000
<i>Lust is all she knows.</i>

138
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,500
<i>Even though she's a mere girl</i>
<i>who's not even of age yet,</i>

139
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:45,708
<i>she has already seduced</i>
<i>plenty of men before coming here.</i>

140
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,667
She must get it from her mother.

141
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:56,125
Because of that,
the villagers think her blood is tainted,

142
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,458
and they hate her.

143
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,583
They beat her
and threw rocks at her.

144
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,333
It must have been a living hell.

145
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,625
Gin…

146
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,000
will probably never forgive this village.

147
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,417
Take care not to get eaten.

148
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,208
See you around.

149
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:02,833
My mother was used by men
of Kuge Village to sate their lust.

150
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:10,500
They said she was possessed by a demon
who seduced men just by existing.

151
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,083
Huh?

152
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,625
As for me…

153
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't know who my father is.

154
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,625
I'm not blood-related
to anyone in the Goto family.

155
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,417
Do you get it?

156
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,792
Masamune, I am…

157
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,917
madness itself, born from this village.

158
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,500
I'm not supposed to exist.

159
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,792
You're wrong.

160
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,000
You are a wonderful person.

161
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
It's the world that is wrong.

162
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,417
I will change this village.

163
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,875
I'll make it a peaceful village…

164
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,500
where you can live.

165
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:29,500
One day,
we'll change this village together.

166
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:23,667
From then on, we met in secret
whenever we had the chance,

167
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:31,750
to make passionate love to each other.

168
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,958
Sumire.

169
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,958
Sorry to keep you waiting.

170
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,417
Oh…

171
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,958
Where did Sumire go?

172
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:03,042
She said she wasn't hungry
and went back to her room.

173
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,958
Oh, dear.

174
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,625
She is so spoiled.

175
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,250
I never get to eat this kind of food.

176
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,833
It's to celebrate the pregnancy.

177
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,542
Don't be so unpleasant.

178
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,667
How can you celebrate at a time like this?

179
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,458
I'll have some. Don't want to waste it.

180
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,042
- Hey, Kuroe!
- Huh?

181
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,458
- What are you doing?
- What's the matter?

182
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,792
Hold it.

183
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,958
Why are you grabbing my arm? It hurts.

184
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,417
Where are you going?

185
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,125
- That hurts.
- Tell me, and I'll let go.

186
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,875
Where are you going?

187
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,750
To the bathroom.

188
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,625
What?

189
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,542
You don't trust me, is that it?

190
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,000
I hate this.

191
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,917
What's with that girl?

192
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:13,708
I WANT A ROCKET LAUNCHER

193
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:26,750
That's the first time
I've seen you smile.

194
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:34,667
Hey, do you know
the origin of those weather dolls?

195
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:45,375
Their roots go back to a Chinese story
called <i>saoqing niang.</i>

196
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,042
Here in Japan,
the dolls are bald-headed monks,

197
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,333
but they were originally girls.

198
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,083
How does the story go?

199
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:04,375
There was a village
that was flooded by an unending rain.

200
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,000
When they sacrificed a young girl
to the gods, the rain stopped.

201
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:15,542
You know, the usual!

202
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,000
Come to think of it…

203
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,917
these weather dolls,
they hang in nooses.

204
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:41,250
How come it's always women
who are the victims in these stories?

205
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,875
Sacrificed by the disgusting men.

206
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,375
You…

207
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,708
have beautiful eyes.

208
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,083
I envy you.

209
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,625
I feel like I can trust you.

210
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:32,958
Hey…

211
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,583
why don't we run away together?

212
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,750
What?

213
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,583
I'm sick of living
like a prisoner of the Goto family.

214
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,417
I want to break free.

215
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,875
Right now,

216
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,750
the main household is in turmoil,
and there's no one around.

217
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,583
Now is our only chance to escape.

218
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,000
Let's leave this horrible village behind.

219
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,667
It's over for us Gotos anyway.

220
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,083
We'll be caught in the crossfire
and die if we stay here.

221
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,208
But… I'm sorry.

222
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,333
- Oh!
- What?

223
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:35,750
A mosquito. Wait a second. Don't move.

224
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,417
Sumire collapsed!

225
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,208
The bride of the main household fainted
all of a sudden!

226
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,458
- Sumire has collapsed!
- Come on. Sumire?

227
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,792
This is bad!
Her eyes have rolled back!

228
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,458
It's an emergency!

229
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,875
- What happened, Kuroe?
- I don't know! She just fell over!

230
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,500
Sumire is unconscious! What happened?

231
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:23,917
Hey, calm down now. What do we do?

232
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,333
What do we do? What do we do?

233
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:31,125
Someone! Someone come quick!
Don't touch her. Don't touch her.

234
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,375
I did it, you idiot!

235
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:39,708
She looked like
she actually trusted me too.

236
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,667
You see that, assholes?

237
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,292
Go to hell, dickweeds!

238
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't mess with me, shitheads!

239
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,500
But word of mine and Gin's relationship

240
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,917
soon spread throughout the village.

241
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,083
My father and Kinji separated us. Yep.

242
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,625
But I yearned to see her again.

243
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:35,208
We promised to meet
on the day of the votive festival,

244
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:39,458
and then we took our chance to escape.

245
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:53,833
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

246
00:28:53,917 --> 00:29:00,917
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

247
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,333
Hurray!

248
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,917
I've missed you, Gin.

249
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,208
Me too.

250
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,125
You're so beautiful, Gin.

251
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,708
Shouldn't you go back?

252
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,333
You're the priest's son.

253
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,500
It's okay.

254
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,000
It looks lovely from a distance.

255
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,708
But I hate this festival.

256
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,583
I can't accept
that they used to sacrifice people.

257
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,833
I agree.

258
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,167
I've always hated this festival.

259
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,625
You know…

260
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,458
there's something
I've got to tell you, Masamune.

261
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,167
I'm pregnant.

262
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,458
Huh?

263
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,667
I'm not sure if it's your child.

264
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:14,417
I don't care. It is my child.

265
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,500
It's our child, Gin.

266
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,500
I'll take responsibility and raise it.

267
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,125
I don't have to abort it?

268
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,125
You can't do that.

269
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,208
We're going to change this village,
aren't we?

270
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,917
We'll make a new world.

271
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:44,292
You and me, and the baby.

272
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,125
Hey, where are you, Junior?

273
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,375
- We're all waiting for you.
- This village is insane.

274
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,125
We're the only sane ones,

275
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,958
so only we can fix it.

276
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,667
They'll find us. Let's go.

277
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,958
Hey, Junior!

278
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,417
Where has he gone?

279
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,542
Hey…

280
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:21,708
where has he wandered off to
on an important day like this?

281
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,500
- Did you find him?
- No.

282
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,208
Yoshimune.

283
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:29,208
Masamune has really lost his mind.

284
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,583
Her spell has driven him mad.

285
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:40,500
Maybe we should just kill Gin Goto.

286
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,250
Hey, let's do this!

287
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,208
Let's get started!

288
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,792
All right!

289
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:10,875
Do you remember
what I told you about the demon?

290
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,333
You mean about your mother?

291
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,375
Yes.

292
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,875
My mother…

293
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,000
She was sacrificed to Kurunokami.

294
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,333
No. I can't believe it.

295
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,708
They had poor crops
several years in a row.

296
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:44,167
Or maybe they just wanted
to get rid of the village whore

297
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,542
because she got pregnant.

298
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:02,125
This village is full of cowards.

299
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:09,042
They're weak, and so they're constantly
searching for someone to look down upon.

300
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,250
This village… should just die out.

301
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,708
That can't happen.

302
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,792
That would be a waste.

303
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:36,042
You can take Yoshimune's place,

304
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,417
and I can take Kinji's place.

305
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,042
Then we can make a new village.

306
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,042
For the sake of our child.

307
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,417
I…

308
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:01,792
We have to… make a place for it to live.

309
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,625
You're right.

310
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:18,958
The world where our children will grow up
must be free from fetters and strife.

311
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:25,667
You and I will make a world…
as white as a blank page.

312
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:38,250
I've decided… on our child's name.

313
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,917
"Shirogane."

314
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,083
I want our child to live
in a pure, white world,

315
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,083
and to be as strong as you, Gin.

316
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,208
"Shirogane."

317
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,042
It's a good name, isn't it?

318
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,750
Hey, Junior!

319
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,208
There you are.

320
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,958
Gosh, am I glad we found you.

321
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:43,458
Come, come. Everyone is waiting.
Let's go back.

322
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,167
It's getting chilly.

323
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,917
Oh, could you hold this and wait a minute?

324
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,750
What are you doing?

325
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,333
It's not your fault, Junior.
Don't feel guilty.

326
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,083
What are you saying?

327
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,333
She is with child.

328
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,000
Mine and Gin's child!

329
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,792
You should have told me sooner.
I've got to get rid of that.

330
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:29,000
- Stop! Stop!
- Junior! Junior! Junior!

331
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,083
Stop it! Stop it!

332
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,750
We have to do it, Junior!

333
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:39,333
This is wrong. You're under a spell.

334
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,583
What's the matter?

335
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,542
Stop!

336
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,875
It would mean
the blood of the Chief Priest

337
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,208
is mixing with the blood of a whore.

338
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:54,792
Stop… Stop it!

339
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:58,292
No good! Junior!

340
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,708
Stop!

341
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:08,667
Junior! Junior!

342
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,167
It's kill or be killed, Junior!

343
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:56,042
No… you have to run.

344
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,833
I'm not running.

345
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,417
I'm going to live in this village.

346
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,167
I will raise the child I carry…

347
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:25,208
right here in this village.

348
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,083
Junior! Junior!
Where are you? Junior!

349
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:32,583
Junior! He's here!
Junior is here!

350
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,375
Hey! Kuma! Kuma!

351
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,125
- Junior!
- He's dead.

352
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,583
- D-Dead! He's dead!
- Hey… Kuma… Wake up…

353
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,458
- Hey, Kuma!
- He's dead!

354
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,625
Please, listen.

355
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,500
It was me.

356
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,792
I was the one who killed Kuma.

357
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,833
Gin didn't do anything.

358
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,000
Stop it, Masamune.

359
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,208
I killed him.

360
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:27,833
Gin.

361
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:44,958
I've never felt so good in my life!

362
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,208
I love it!

363
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:52,875
- Shut up!
- What is wrong with you?

364
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,417
- Stop it!
- Junior!

365
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,792
Kill her!

366
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,500
- You bitch!
- Stop! Make them stop!

367
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:05,208
Die, you whore!

368
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:08,583
I feel alive
for the first time in my life!

369
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,875
Gin!

370
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,000
I feel it radiating deep within me!

371
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,458
Stop it, already!

372
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,250
You're insane!
What are you doing, slut?

373
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,708
Stop it! Gin!

374
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,375
Stop! Gin!

375
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,708
Hold it, everyone!

376
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,458
What good will it do to kill that woman?

377
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,667
Father.

378
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,458
That's right. Everyone, calm down!

379
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:38,250
You shouldn't kill her.

380
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,542
You should sacrifice her to Kurunokami.

381
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,458
Just like her mother, it is her destiny.

382
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:50,542
Maybe Kurunokami desires that child

383
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,500
in order to save the village.

384
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,250
- He's right. Yeah.
- That's right.

385
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,583
What are you talking about?

386
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,458
You're not going to help her?

387
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,500
You'll kill her after all?

388
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,833
You're wrong, Junior!

389
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:13,750
Sacrificing to Kurunokami
is a truly sacred act!

390
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,875
It's the forbidden forest!

391
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:21,917
She will stay in the forest without food

392
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,375
until she finally dies of starvation,

393
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:29,833
as Kurunokami did 700 years ago.

394
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,083
What are you talking about, hag?

395
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,917
Come to think of it,

396
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,833
it was you who decided
to sacrifice her mother too.

397
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,500
Wasn't it, Yoshimune?

398
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:42,833
- That can't be true, Father.
- Hey! Let's sacrifice her.

399
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:45,167
Stop it.

400
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,750
No! Stop! Don't do it!

401
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:53,250
Stop… Stop! Stop!

402
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,833
Lift her up!

403
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,833
Stop… Stop it!

404
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:02,042
- Let's go, people!
- Go, go!

405
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:06,708
This isn't right! Stop it!

406
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:12,708
Father! This is wrong, Father!

407
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:18,708
You're all wrong! Stop it!

408
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,750
Gin! Gin!

409
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:31,125
I won't die!

410
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,583
I'll make all of Kuge Village mine!

411
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,125
I'll kill you all!

412
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,792
It's my turn to devour you!

413
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,458
Who are you?

414
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:32,375
No one, for now.

415
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,125
Are you the Kashihabe?

416
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,875
You are the Kashihabe, aren't you?
The ones who eat people.
