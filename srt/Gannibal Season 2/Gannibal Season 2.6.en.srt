1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,125
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,417
If it's this cold,
a lot of people will die this winter.

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,457
If a blizzard comes,
we can't pick any more food.

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,542
We should hurry.

5
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:33,500
To think we have to go this deep
in search of food.

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:49,375
I heard Muraguchi's youngest daughter
was sold to a merchant in Sakai.

7
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,500
Her husband must be over 60 already.

8
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,125
I feel bad for the poor girl.

9
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,958
In this situation, they had no choice.

10
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,625
Hey.

11
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,875
What's that kid doing?

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,458
Hey.

13
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,375
It could be an evil spirit.

14
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,125
Leave it alone.

15
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,082
It's all right.

16
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,375
It's a child.

17
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,125
Hey, boy.

18
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:05,208
What are you doing
this deep in the woods?

19
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:11,417
What's the matter? Can't you talk?

20
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,292
Thank you.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,541
Sorry, I can't offer anything else.

22
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,417
I know it's not much.

23
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,417
Here.

24
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,541
Help!

25
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,332
- Shige.
- Shige. Hey!

26
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,083
What happened to you, Shige?

27
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:43,417
It's Sho...
It's Shohachi.

28
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,000
What happened to Shohachi?

29
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,458
He was attacked.

30
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,042
What?

31
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,667
Was it a bear?

32
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,417
No.

33
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,750
A human.

34
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,500
It was Gin.

35
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,667
I'm sure of it.

36
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,207
That was Gin!

37
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,875
Why did this have to happen?

38
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,042
We're just trying our best...

39
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,875
to survive.

40
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:28,375
I thought it was supposed to be over
once we sacrificed her to Kurunokami.

41
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:35,749
What's wrong with this village? Huh?

42
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,458
Are we cursed?

43
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:45,542
<i>♪ Hushabye, sleep ♪</i>

44
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>♪ How cute is the baby
who has fallen asleep ♪</i>

45
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,792
<i>♪ The baby who is awake and cries ♪</i>

46
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:10,292
<i>♪ How hateful his face looks ♪</i>

47
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,250
<i>♪ Hushabye ♪</i>

48
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,333
<i>♪ Hushabye ♪</i>

49
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,000
<i>♪ Hushabye ♪</i>

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,750
<i>♪ Hushabye ♪</i>

51
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,250
<i>♪ Hushabye ♪</i>

52
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,542
We will devour them.

53
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,208
Shirogane.

54
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:14,458
Gin Goto survived in the forest
by eating people.

55
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,458
And...

56
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,583
her newborn child was with her.

57
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,666
She lived in the forest,

58
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,333
where there was no food
or anything, for years.

59
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:34,125
After a while,
the villagers began to search for Gin.

60
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:42,208
They had all gone mad
with hunger and cold.

61
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,749
Gin!

62
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,666
<i>They were all out to kill Gin.</i>

63
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:52,458
<i>Their persistence was ghastly to behold.</i>

64
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,417
Gin!

65
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,541
We're going to kill you, Gin!

66
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,166
Hey, Gin!

67
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,166
Stay on your toes, everyone.

68
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,417
Gin!

69
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,875
Gin!

70
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,249
<i>But no matter how much we searched,</i>

71
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,125
<i>Gin was nowhere to be found.</i>

72
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,874
Why did this have to happen?

73
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,208
We've scoured the whole mountain.

74
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,125
Where is she?

75
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,958
We abandoned her on the snowy mountain.

76
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,417
She can't have survived alone.

77
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,999
What if someone in the village
is helping her?

78
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,291
Hey. Let's stop this.

79
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,083
Killing and getting killed. It's enough.

80
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,041
Let the police handle the rest.

81
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,167
We can't do that, Yoshimune.

82
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,500
This is village business.
Keep your mouth shut.

83
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,374
Yeah, shut up.

84
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,458
Haruko.

85
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,042
Haruko.

86
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,666
What's wrong with her?

87
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,457
- What is it?
- What's the matter?

88
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,000
I... I don't think she's breathing.

89
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,207
- No.
- It can't be. Why?

90
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,707
Someone...

91
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,416
Someone take a look at her!

92
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:10,874
- Calm down. Calm down, Akiko.
- Why? Why Haruko?

93
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,874
-  Why?
-  Calm down.

94
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,041
-  Someone help her!
-  Calm down.

95
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:21,457
-  Why won't anyone help her?
-  Calm down.

96
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,958
Calm down.

97
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,042
No! No!

98
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,083
Looks like we're running out of time.

99
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,333
There's no food left in the village.

100
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,208
Yes, there is!

101
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,792
And not just food.

102
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,167
There are some people
who have saved up a lot of money as well.

103
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,750
Take it all...

104
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,541
from the Goto family!

105
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,832
A lot of people are starving to death.

106
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,625
You should show some restraint, Kinji.

107
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,042
You've lost weight, Yoshimune.

108
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,833
Now is the time
to make them indebted to you.

109
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,707
You can save this village--

110
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't give a damn.

111
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,417
Sort it out yourselves.

112
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,167
The village will perish.

113
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,292
Yoshimune.

114
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,958
Have you forgotten about the Kashihabe?

115
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,208
The Kashihabe.

116
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,624
Surely you remember their tribe.

117
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,292
It was during a great famine
in the Edo Period.

118
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,374
They stole children
who had been sacrificed to Kurunokami

119
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,750
and ate them to survive.

120
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,041
<i>Soon,
the laughing sickness began to spread</i>

121
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,250
<i>among the Kashihabe
who had eaten human flesh.</i>

122
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,541
When the villagers found out
about the cannibalism,

123
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,875
they banished the Kashihabe
from the village.

124
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,458
At the time...

125
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:46,500
the only family that stood up
for the Kashihabe was the Goto family.

126
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,292
Because of that, we were ostracized.

127
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:57,458
They took our fields from us
and forced us into the barrens.

128
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,042
For generations, and generations...

129
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,625
...and generations!

130
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,208
This village is rotten to the core.

131
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,333
But still...

132
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,500
Isn't it funny, Yoshimune?

133
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,000
Even after sacrificing Gin to Kurunokami,

134
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,250
the crops continue to fail.

135
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,583
And besides...

136
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,958
there's still food left.

137
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,750
Even if everything else is gone...

138
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,500
...you can just eat people.

139
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,750
Kinji.

140
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,208
Stop searching for Gin.

141
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,000
She has killed several villagers.

142
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,958
At this rate,
the villagers and the Goto family

143
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,042
will start killing each other.

144
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,708
Why do you think I'd search for Gin?

145
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,833
Because you're in love with her.

146
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,625
Gin!

147
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,958
Where are you?

148
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,625
Gin!

149
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,874
Hey. What are you doing?
Go look for her already!

150
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,582
Kinji.

151
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,832
-  What?
-  He's doing it again.

152
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,667
Kinji. This isn't working.
We should give up.

153
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,833
What the hell are you saying?

154
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,916
Come to your senses.

155
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,917
Gin must be dead already.

156
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,791
Gin is...

157
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,291
Gin is...

158
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,749
Katsuyoshi!

159
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,499
Gin is mine!

160
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,708
Kinji.

161
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,667
Kinji! You're going too far!

162
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,541
This land...

163
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,625
The food...

164
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,916
Kinji!

165
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,958
Every last grain of rice!

166
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,750
I won't let anyone have them!

167
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,625
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,208
I'm sorry.

169
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,500
It hurts!

170
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,625
Gin.

171
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,875
<i>Then, it's like our own secret place.</i>

172
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,957
<i>I'm on your side,
even if no one else is.</i>

173
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,375
<i>Listen and learn.</i>

174
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,833
<i>Everything about me.</i>

175
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,042
Gin...

176
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,542
Gin!

177
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,208
Where have you gone, Gin?

178
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,250
Gin, I miss you.

179
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,541
Gin.

180
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,874
Masamune.

181
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,958
What?

182
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,417
Gin?

183
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,708
It's really you, isn't it?

184
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,792
You really are beautiful, Gin.

185
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,207
It's been a long time.

186
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,250
Who is that child?

187
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,208
Is that Shirogane?

188
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,542
It is Shirogane, right?

189
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,625
Mine and your child.

190
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,167
Our child.

191
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,625
Shirogane.

192
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,375
Shirogane.

193
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,292
You're back.

194
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,499
You're back, Gin!

195
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,708
I have...

196
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,125
a favor to ask of you.

197
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:48,958
Kurunokami Shrine

198
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,041
It's Yoshimune.

199
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,125
He's here.

200
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,875
It's pointless to say anything, Yoshimune.

201
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,333
W-We've already made up our minds.

202
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,875
To survive...

203
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,291
we will take from the Goto family.

204
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,292
-  That's right.
-  We have to survive.

205
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:21,083
Even so, you have to restrain yourselves.

206
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,000
If you steal from them now,
then the village is truly doomed.

207
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,042
Now is the time to be patient.

208
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,708
I know Kinji's personality very well.

209
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,416
When we have been driven to our wit's end
and beg him for aid,

210
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,999
he will propose a compromise--

211
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,625
That's enough, Father.

212
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,167
Patience, patience...

213
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,207
That's what you always say,

214
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,333
but you're just putting off
dealing with problems.

215
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,958
Over there, you cozy up to Kinji,

216
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,583
and over here,
you put on airs for the villagers.

217
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,667
But...

218
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,749
have you ever actually saved
even a single person as a result?

219
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,833
What are you saying?

220
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,417
I know this village better than anyone.

221
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,583
You were the one
who said to sacrifice Gin to the gods.

222
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,667
You're just running away!

223
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,208
Can you look everyone in the eye
and say that you were right?

224
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,583
That's right.

225
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,667
Because you could never make up your mind,

226
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,417
the situation has only gotten worse.

227
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

228
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,958
There will be killing!

229
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,917
You'll die too.

230
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,500
You must be patient now
if you want to survive.

231
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,917
You can still turn back now.

232
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,375
It's too late.

233
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,332
Junior. We caught her.

234
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,499
The girl from the Goto family.

235
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,999
She waltzed into the midwife's place,
saying she was having a baby.

236
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,791
Bastards!

237
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,999
Hold still.

238
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,332
Masamune.

239
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,167
Do you understand what you're doing?

240
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,167
Now we'll really be at war
with the Goto family.

241
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,792
That's right. It's war.

242
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,375
Everyone! Fight!

243
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:28,916
Yeah!

244
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,541
Yeah, let's do it!

245
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,125
Junior is right.

246
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,542
Your role is over, Father.

247
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,624
My time starts today.

248
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,332
-  No more running!
-  Yeah!

249
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,749
If we run, all we can do
is starve and wait for death.

250
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,291
Yeah, that's right!

251
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,124
Let's go, people!

252
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,291
Let's steal what we need to survive!

253
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:01,124
To the Goto household!

254
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,207
Let's go!

255
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,792
We'll take over the village.

256
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,583
First, you will oust your father

257
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,458
<i>and assume the position of Chief Priest.</i>

258
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,917
<i>Then you will win
the hearts of the villagers</i>

259
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,417
<i>and unite them to destroy the Goto family.</i>

260
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,208
I can't do that.

261
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,167
You're the only one who can.

262
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,417
The only one I trust...

263
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,250
is you, Masamune.

264
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,667
We made a promise here, didn't we?

265
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:56,542
We said we were going to make
a new world for ourselves.

266
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:04,792
Yeah.

267
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,750
Yeah. I know.

268
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,792
You're right.

269
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
You're right.

270
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,125
You're right.

271
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,625
We'll make a world
where the weak can survive.

272
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,167
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

273
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,916
It seems they'll be here soon.

274
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:49,041
Don't worry.
The men will take care of it.

275
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,750
Damned livestock.

276
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,000
They really came.

277
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:03,167
The villagers have gone mad
from starvation.

278
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,708
They're so simple.

279
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,333
We'll confront them.

280
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,125
Please, wait.

281
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,292
There are so many of them.

282
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,667
Maybe we were the ones
who underestimated them, Kinji.

283
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:18,708
What are you saying?

284
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,582
Are you telling me to surrender?

285
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,166
- No, no...
- Huh?

286
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,291
Kinji, please calm down.

287
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:28,792
Even the Goto family doesn't have enough
to share with others!

288
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,417
Hey.

289
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,666
- K-Kinji.
- What?

290
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,917
Your little sister has been taken hostage!

291
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,750
Kinji.

292
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,582
I think we should find
a point of compromise--

293
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,541
-  Hey.
- Huh?

294
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,666
Kinji!

295
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,917
Why should I...

296
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,625
do that...

297
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,916
for the people who have oppressed
the Goto family for so long?

298
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,167
This is a fight to decide
who gets to live on.

299
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,042
We'll beat the fear of the Goto family
into their brains.

300
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,125
Are you prepared?

301
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,417
Yes.

302
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,082
Here's what food we can spare.

303
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,917
Let his little sister go and then leave.

304
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,333
You don't want to die, do you?

305
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,082
Get the rice.

306
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,582
Yeah, carry the rice.

307
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,917
We'll carry the rice first.

308
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,666
It's rice.

309
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,207
Now we won't have to starve.

310
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,916
It's rice. Oh, it's rice.

311
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,499
Oh! We can eat rice.

312
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,125
You think we're even now?

313
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,957
You won't have to starve
for a while, right?

314
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,375
- Right?
- This won't do.

315
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,833
No, this won't do.

316
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,500
This won't do, will it?

317
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,958
Are we going to be satisfied with this?

318
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,458
Junior? What's wrong?

319
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,583
We've won.

320
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,167
Now--

321
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,416
What?

322
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,667
-  Huh? What happened?
-  Hey.

323
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,041
Who did that?

324
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,666
We did nothing...

325
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,500
Kill the woman.

326
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,208
Hey! Kill the woman!

327
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,166
Kill the woman!

328
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,916
Kill her!

329
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,792
What are you doing?

330
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,750
Take that!

331
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,916
Everyone, fight! Let's go!

332
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,957
Kill them all!

333
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,417
Kinji! Aim for Kinji!

334
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,499
I don't want to die.

335
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,124
- What the hell are you talking about?
-  Fight.

336
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,250
We must win.

337
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,207
If we don't win,
our deaths will be for nothing.

338
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:02,542
Do it!

339
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,374
You want to feed your children, right?

340
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,416
Junior is right.

341
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,917
- We have to win.
-  Kill them!

342
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,582
- Kinji!
-  Kill them!

343
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,082
Kill Kinji!

344
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,000
How many of you can still move?

345
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,625
Surrender, Kinji!

346
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,667
Don't be stupid.

347
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,583
Come on already.

348
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:21,792
We'll keep killing
until the very last man.

349
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,999
Then die!

350
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,541
What the hell? What's happe--

351
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,166
What?

352
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,792
What? What...

353
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,333
What?

354
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,292
The men will die to become our food.

355
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,042
The women...

356
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:10,000
Plant.

357
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,500
Plant your seeds in them.

358
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,708
Plant and plant and plant some more.

359
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,625
Then devour all.

360
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,792
When the seeds grow...

361
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,083
<i>the ones you call the Goto family...</i>

362
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,583
will be our children.

363
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,083
Gin...

364
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,292
<i>Who are you?</i>

365
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,833
No one.

366
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,458
For now.

367
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,667
Are you the Kashihabe?

368
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,958
You are the Kashihabe, aren't you?

369
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,583
The ones who eat people.

370
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,750
How funny.

371
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,958
The Kashihabe will eat me.

372
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,750
Tell me.

373
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:00,292
Don't you want revenge
against the village?

374
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,125
Those scumbags live comfortably
in the village.

375
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:11,333
Will you keep living
in the forest like this?

376
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,250
So...

377
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,500
why don't we work together?

378
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,417
Doesn't sound so bad, does it?

379
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,792
I see...

380
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,500
I see.

381
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,458
This was all your doing.

382
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,000
What a woman.

383
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,750
I can't let anyone have it.

384
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,625
Gin...

385
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:37,250
and this house.

386
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,958
You're still saying that, fool?

387
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,125
Die!

388
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:28,792
Is that...

389
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,833
my child?

390
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:34,375
Who knows?

391
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,042
He might be a Goto child,
or a child of the shrine.

392
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,791
He could even be
a child of the Kashihabe.

393
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,167
It doesn't matter.

394
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,750
He was born
from the lust of Kuge Village.

395
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,792
And he is only mine.

396
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,374
We worked so hard to build this up.

397
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,292
Now it's all being taken away.

398
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,625
What a wretched family.

399
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,125
I admit defeat, Gin.

400
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,750
But...

401
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,917
our bond will not end.

402
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,292
I love you, Gin.

403
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,750
You're right.

404
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,417
You will live on inside me.

405
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,375
In our eyes...

406
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,708
you look like meat.

407
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,250
It's Masamune.

408
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,041
Junior is back, everyone.

409
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:44,458
Junior has come back alone.

410
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,500
Masamune.

411
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,875
Wait!

412
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,750
Kinji Goto, the man you despised,
is dead.

413
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,375
I killed him with my own hands.

414
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,542
Kinji...

415
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:22,000
From this day forward,
we are the new Goto family.

416
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,667
We're not like Kinji's Goto family.

417
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,083
We will do things differently.

418
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:34,708
We will build a new relationship
between the Goto family and Kuge Village.

419
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,208
I...

420
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:43,292
and the new Chief Priest
of Kurunokami Shrine, together.

421
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,833
Gin.

422
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,292
Isn't that right?

423
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,583
You're right.

424
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,792
That's right, everyone.

425
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,125
Today, Kuge Village has changed.

426
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,583
Now we will all be saved.

427
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,624
What's Junior saying?

428
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,417
What is he saying?

429
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,750
So...

430
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,500
who is the one who can save you now?

431
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,583
It's rice.

432
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,625
Rice!

433
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,250
It's not Kurunokami who can save you.

434
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,875
It's me.

435
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:39,917
Do you not call your savior your god
around here?

436
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,458
If you want to be saved, then sacrifice.

437
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:51,625
Just as people did
during the votive festival long ago.

438
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,667
Not dolls, but people.

439
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,250
To your new god.

440
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:05,750
If you do that...

441
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,667
you won't have to starve anymore.

442
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:15,875
Ridiculous.

443
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:20,542
Of all the things to say,
you demand human sacrifice?

444
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,375
Inconceivable.

445
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,750
Who will heed those words?

446
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:48,292
The festival you hold so dear
has now returned to its original form.

447
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,250
You will have nothing else to do
with the Goto family.

448
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,875
That is the rule of Kuge Village.

449
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,708
How could you promise
to keep giving them food?

450
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,250
What's the problem?

451
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,625
There are plenty of things to eat.

452
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,000
This child will still only eat human meat.

453
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:39,917
Shirogane has the laughing sickness.

454
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,208
He won't last much longer.

455
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,042
After making it this far...

456
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,875
Why?

457
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,875
700 years ago...

458
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:16,917
there was one person
who survived the laughing sickness.

459
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:21,500
The person who overcame the disease

460
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,708
grew taller than six and a half <i>shaku...</i>

461
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,958
and wavered between frenzy and stupor.

462
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:36,125
It is said that his rampaging form
was like that of a god itself.

463
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,792
The people were terrified.

464
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,833
This is what they called that man.

465
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:50,667
"Arahito."

466
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,582
<i>Since then,</i>

467
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:57,167
Gin and I cared for Shirogane in secret,

468
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:05,083
in the inner sanctum of the shrine.

469
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:11,874
He always sits there,

470
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:15,375
perfectly still,

471
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:20,749
waiting for the final ritual
of the festival

472
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:25,458
to begin.

473
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,750
I am quite sure...

474
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:34,207
that he is there,
in the place where he grew up--

475
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,625
Mashiro is there, isn't she?

476
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,624
It's the place
where I treated your wounds.

477
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,083
Officer.

478
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,125
I've been listening to your story.

479
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,292
But I don't get it at all.

480
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,333
Mr. Agawa.

481
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:57,500
You guys.

482
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,125
How long are you going to keep this up?

483
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,375
Hey.

484
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,125
Officer!

485
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,583
Wait.

486
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:42,958
Yosuke?

487
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,208
Kuroe?
What are you doing out here?

488
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:50,958
What am I...

489
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,083
Yosuke. Where are you going?

490
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,375
What's that?

491
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,416
Huh?

492
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,750
That.

493
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,917
Oh, uh, it's nothing.

494
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,625
It's a person.

495
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,250
Who is it?

496
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,833
The new officer's wife.

497
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,500
I'm taking her to the hospital.

498
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,333
Don't interfere.

499
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:54,000
She's bleeding from her ears.

500
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,625
What?

501
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,916
Not good.

502
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:06,083
I've got to hurry.

503
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,833
Hey, you.

504
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,875
You really did betray the Goto family.

505
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,125
You're just like me.

506
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,542
It's now or never.

507
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,458
Let me get in the car.

508
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,582
Wait, Officer.

509
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,957
Stay away from me.

510
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,332
I can't trust you.

511
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,333
This is a problem I have to deal with.

512
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,583
Shut up.

513
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,083
Hey, Officer.

514
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,250
Right from the start,

515
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:25,417
I should have chosen which lives to take
and which lives to protect.

516
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,042
Not wanting anyone to die was too naive.

517
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:35,458
I'll do it.

518
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,917
I'll kill That Man.

519
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,375
I have to end this curse for good.

520
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,458
Hey.

521
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,042
If you get in my way...

522
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,833
I'll kill you too.

523
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,124
<i>In order to neutralize the Goto family,</i>

524
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,207
<i>the objective of this mission is to arrest</i>

525
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,666
the chief suspects
Keisuke Goto, Iwao Goto,

526
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:46,000
and the huge man they call "That Man."

527
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:50,500
We will first infiltrate Kuge Village
by crossing the bridge,

528
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,124
and head for the location
known as "the altar,"

529
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,542
which Ai Goto informed us about.

530
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,167
Listen up.

531
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:11,125
If you encounter any resistance,
you are permitted to fire at will.

532
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:12,958
It's time.

533
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,708
Commencing operation!

534
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,457
N2, taking position.

535
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,124
First group is Sasaki's squad.

536
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,458
Second group is Miyake's squad.

537
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,666
Third group is Oba's squad.

538
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,542
Fourth group is Itagaki's squad.

539
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,958
Sasaki's squad will take
the armored vehicle.

540
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:30,458
Miyake's squad is 3714.

541
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,332
Oba's squad is 1052.

542
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,957
Itagaki's squad is 9043.

543
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,582
Kuge Village

544
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:58,667
What?

545
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,667
It's fallen off.

546
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,250
Move it out of the way.

547
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,042
Huh?

548
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,750
Come on.

549
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:13,750
Go already.

550
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:42,625
Hurry up.

551
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,542
Just a little longer, and I'll be free.

552
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,999
I figured you were going
to try to leave the village.

553
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,083
Sa-Sadamu?

554
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:44,375
