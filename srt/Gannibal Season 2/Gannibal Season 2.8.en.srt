1
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,833
What's with these people?

2
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,750
Stop it.

3
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,917
Stop it.

4
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,667
Stop it!

5
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,708
The old hag has gone completely crazy.

6
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,042
The laughing sickness is awful.

7
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,167
Yeah.

8
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:17,583
Anyway, is it about time to kill her?

9
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,417
This plan has no leader or boss.

10
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,292
This is the consensus of the residents
of Kuge Village.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,583
If any one of us snitches,

12
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,875
we'll all be judged
by the laws of the outside.

13
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,333
In a way, we're all comrades…

14
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:03,917
…and all hostages.

15
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,250
What about Sabu and the others?

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,625
Don't worry. We're keeping an eye on them.

17
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,667
Sabu and Jin are too close
to the Goto family.

18
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,792
They're not our people.

19
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:20,000
Well said.

20
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:25,042
We haven't told the priest, Masamune,
about this either.

21
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,708
We're not going to obey
anyone's orders anymore.

22
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:41,042
Takeru, it's your turn.

23
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,875
Right.

24
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,292
We've finished placing the bait.

25
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,167
The bears will catch the smell
soon enough.

26
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,708
Now, we are all accomplices.

27
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,417
What is it?

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,792
Should we really be doing
this kind of thing?

29
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,375
You're worried about that now?

30
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,458
Let's go.

31
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,833
Shirogane.

32
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,667
Do I taste good?

33
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,458
Is it good?

34
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,875
Eat.

35
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,625
Eat.

36
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,542
Do you like it?

37
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,833
Mom.

38
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:29,917
Live.

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,417
You must live.

40
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,208
Oh, how incredible!

41
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,042
You have overcome the disease

42
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,375
and become a true god.

43
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:52,667
And now you conduct your own last rites.

44
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,875
Well done, Shirogane.

45
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,167
Huh?

46
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,292
This is our god?

47
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,750
There's no way this thing is a god.

48
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,875
It's just some old geezer
who happened to survive this long!

49
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,292
How long are you going to stay brainwashed
by the old hag?

50
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,042
There is no god!

51
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,583
Look.

52
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,375
There's nothing in this world…

53
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,375
but flesh and blood.

54
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,875
I knew it!

55
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,750
He is the embodiment of the Kashihabe.

56
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,708
What are you looking at?

57
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,583
Come on, eat. Huh?

58
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,250
We Gotos bury our dead
by eating them, right?

59
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,792
-Stop. Stop! Okay?
-Here. Here, eat.

60
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,583
Officer! Officer, don't!

61
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,917
Stop. Stop it!

62
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,292
Take your daughter and run.

63
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,500
In this situation?

64
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,875
You finally got her back, right?

65
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,375
Hey! Go already. Go!

66
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,458
Iwao! Iwao!

67
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:11,333
Stop! Stay away! Stay away!

68
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,208
Iwao, stop it!

69
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,625
Keisuke.

70
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,042
This must be some mistake, right?

71
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,292
I…

72
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,167
I lived only to protect you, didn't I?

73
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,750
I…

74
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,625
I have always…

75
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,417
This isn't what you promised.

76
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,583
I don't want to shoot you either.

77
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,833
But you did shoot!

78
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,958
What a racket.
Who's there?

79
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,417
No freaking way.

80
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,167
We're in!

81
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,667
It hurts, Keisuke.

82
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,083
I've always been your personal soldier.

83
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,625
I only cared about you.

84
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,667
Keisuke. What are you doing?

85
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
Keisuke, stop.

86
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,042
-Stop it. Shut up!
-Keisuke, stop this.

87
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,875
Not because Grandma Gin told me to.

88
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,875
Protecting you was the only part of me…

89
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,250
Iwao?

90
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,083
The part of me…

91
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,875
Yuki
Calling

92
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,833
Hello, Yuki? Is that you?

93
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,417
Are you okay, Yuki?

94
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,333
Is this Mr. Agawa?

95
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,042
Huh?

96
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,458
It's Sendo.

97
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm with Yuki at the Kibi Medical Center.

98
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,250
Sendo, is Yuki all right?

99
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,583
She's stabilized slightly now.

100
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,917
But we can't say anything for sure
in this state.

101
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,708
I see.

102
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,458
Um…

103
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:06,417
I'm still not up to speed
on the situation.

104
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,000
Is Mashiro okay?

105
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:14,917
She's here.

106
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,875
She's safe.

107
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:18,875
What a relief.

108
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,750
Mr. Agawa.

109
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,375
In that case,
you should come to the hospital quickly.

110
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,667
Together with Mashiro.

111
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,292
Please be at Yuki's side.

112
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,083
Okay, I'll head there right away.

113
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,458
Mashiro.

114
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,083
Let's go see Mom, okay?

115
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,417
Are you okay?

116
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,000
Officer, have you seen Tomoki?
Did Tomoki pass by here?

117
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,750
Please, calm down a little.

118
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,875
What happened?

119
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,417
The villagers have gone
to the Goto residence…

120
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,917
I think Tomoki followed his dad…

121
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,708
The Goto residence?

122
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,625
His dad brought a can of gasoline
and went with the villagers,

123
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
saying they were going to wipe out
the Goto family.

124
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,125
But if Tomoki goes
to such a dangerous place…

125
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,875
Officer, please help my child!

126
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,250
It's true! Please, believe me!

127
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,500
No way…

128
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,708
Why would they…

129
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,458
We've lived our lives
bound to this village,

130
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,667
unable to stand up to the Goto family.

131
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,083
But… everyone has finally
had enough of it.

132
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,083
Mashiro.

133
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,042
What do we do?

134
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,042
What's the right thing to do?

135
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,500
Are you worried about Tomoki?

136
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,625
Go to where Mom is and wait there.

137
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,250
I'll put an end to all of this.

138
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,625
Please, take Mashiro to the police.

139
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,167
Please.

140
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,458
Understood.

141
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,875
Mrs. Agawa.

142
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,708
Mrs. Agawa. Mrs. Agawa.

143
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,333
Mrs. Agawa. Mrs. Agawa.
Doctor, it's an emergency.

144
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,750
Mrs. Agawa. Mrs. Agawa,
can you hear me? Mrs. Agawa.

145
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,917
Starting CPR.

146
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,417
Mrs. Agawa, can you hear me? Mrs. Agawa.

147
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
-Prepare…
-Okay.

148
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,333
Clear.

149
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,125
-Still no pulse.
-Again.

150
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,250
Okay.

151
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,542
Okay.

152
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,625
It's ready.

153
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,250
Okay. Still no pulse.

154
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,375
Stay away!

155
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,333
Hey, pull yourself together, Iwao.

156
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,167
Iwao! Calm down!

157
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:36,375
We are entering
Kuge Village from the east. Over.

158
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,125
This is Okayama HQ. Copy that.

159
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,208
Okayama HQ to Hiruzen.
What is your current position? Over.

160
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,708
This is Hiruzen.

161
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:47,083
Passing through the Morobe mountains
and entering Kuge Village airspace. Over.

162
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,667
This is Okayama HQ. Copy that.

163
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,750
Urgent.
This is Hiruzen to Okayama HQ.

164
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,500
Urgent. This is Okayama HQ.
Go ahead, Hiruzen.

165
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,542
Large fire confirmed in Kuge Village.

166
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,917
High risk of spreading.

167
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:03,000
Requesting firefighters immediately. Over.

168
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,750
Copy that.
Firefighters have been notified.

169
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,208
Urgent. Go ahead, Kibitsu.

170
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,417
Multiple residents confirmed
near the site of the fire.

171
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,750
Requesting additional rescue team.

172
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,708
This village…

173
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:21,792
is cursed.

174
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,750
…intense fire has been reported.

175
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,708
Multiple casualties confirmed
near Goto household.

176
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,417
Dad.

177
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,958
Open this door! Now!

178
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,667
Open the door!

179
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,625
Open it!

180
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,125
-Open it!
-Open the door!

181
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,042
Close it!

182
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,667
Scum.

183
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,750
Why? Why are you doing this?

184
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,042
Why?

185
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,542
Open!

186
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,750
Open it!

187
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,875
Open it!

188
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,792
Everyone! This way!

189
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:49,125
Breathe out. Uttanasana.

190
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:56,667
-Wait!
-Pile up the spines, one by one.

191
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,875
Release your Prana.

192
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,917
Big sis. Big sis. Big sis.
Can you hear me?

193
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,917
Big sis! Listen to me! Big sis!

194
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,250
Big sis, can't you hear me?

195
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:23,875
We're not gonna let you guys take us down!

196
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,750
Huh? What?

197
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

198
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Huh?

199
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,583
Huh?

200
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,458
We'll kill you all.

201
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,417
It won't end until we've wiped you out.

202
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,917
Is that you, Takeru?

203
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,458
What the hell are you wearing?

204
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,167
Looks good, right?

205
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,250
I figured it would be memorable.

206
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,417
Huh?

207
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,583
You know, my daughter…

208
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,500
is in first year of junior high school
in the afterlife.

209
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,833
What are you talking about?

210
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,833
The daughter you bastards ate!

211
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:46,042
Takeru. I'm s-sorry.

212
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,625
I'm not doing this because I want to…

213
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,417
When you see her, give her a message.

214
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,750
I…

215
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,042
was shining so beautifully.

216
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,583
Let's go.

217
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,167
-Let's go!
-Stop it!

218
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:28,208
-Tomoki? Tomoki? Tomoki, is it you?
-Stop. Don't kill them.

219
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,625
What are you doing here?

220
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,292
Go! Go home!

221
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,833
Come on, go home. I said go home!

222
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,417
Stop it! Eiji is my friend!

223
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:43,750
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
-Do you hear me? Go home!

224
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:48,583
-Go home! Go home!
-Stop it. Stop it!

225
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,417
Iwao.

226
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,792
Keisuke.

227
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,333
Keisuke.

228
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,833
Keisuke…

229
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,042
Screw you!

230
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,000
Die, bastard!

231
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,208
Sumire, hold your breath for a bit.

232
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,208
Hey, this way.

233
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,083
Watch your step.

234
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,917
Die!

235
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,583
-Go home! I said go home!
-Eiji is my friend!

236
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,458
You can't watch this.

237
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,583
-Go home, Tomoki.
-No!

238
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,042
-Go home!
-Stop it!

239
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,250
Go home!

240
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,750
-Stop it!
-Go home!

241
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,958
Tomoki, come here.

242
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,250
Come here. Come here.

243
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,292
Ojas…

244
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,292
Don't interfere!

245
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,208
Freeze!

246
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,125
You look so cool, Officer.

247
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,958
Huh?

248
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,667
If the government takes control of us,

249
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,375
how do they differ from the Goto family?

250
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:19,750
Kuge Village will just be
under someone else's control.

251
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,667
You guys can't do it.

252
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,333
You can't break this cycle.

253
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,167
You don't know that.

254
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:13,542
That's why…

255
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,792
we just have to keep thinking.

256
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,292
Why couldn't you have faith
in the next generation?

257
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,958
Those kids…

258
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,708
they're just living their lives.

259
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,167
They don't care about Kuge Village
or the Goto family.

260
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:07,250
Don't tie them down with new hatred.

261
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What's that face for, Iwao?

262
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,625
It's enough. You can stop.

263
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,833
Keisuke.

264
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,250
At last!

265
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:57,875
The Kashihabe is dead!

266
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,292
Wonderful!

267
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,417
G-Gin.

268
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,083
Gin.

269
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,167
Gin…

270
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:18,208
My life was great!

271
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,167
Shut up already, old man.

272
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,833
We have to clean up the mess
your generation left behind.

273
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,542
What are you mad about?

274
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,458
Gin?

275
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,292
Gin.

276
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,833
Oh, don't be angry. Okay? G-Gin.

277
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,833
Oh.

278
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,917
Gin.

279
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:53,500
I'll always be w-with you
from now on. Hmm?

280
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,167
Oh, not this one.

281
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,500
Gin?

282
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,833
Gin.

283
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,208
Come on, laugh, Gin!

284
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,625
Laugh…

285
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,875
Look at me.

286
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,042
Kuge Village is going to need your help.

287
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,083
Please.

288
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,167
Keisuke.

289
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,250
This is the police!

290
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,375
Don't move!

291
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,333
Don't resist!

292
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,917
-Freeze!
-We'll all surrender.

293
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:55,333
We must show our children
how we live with our sins.

294
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,167
Iwazaki's squad has found

295
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,917
the head of the Goto family
and his accomplices.

296
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,917
Location 0.7 miles north-northwest
of Kurunokami Shrine.

297
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,083
This is for the best.

298
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:10,958
This is…

299
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,167
Okayama Prefectural Police

300
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,500
I've got to say…

301
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:56,667
that Sergeant Agawa is one hell of a guy.

302
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:03,208
He actually pulled this off
all by himself?

303
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:05,708
Yes.

304
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,125
The last kind of person
the police organization needs.

305
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,458
It's been about 17 years.

306
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,958
You remembered.

307
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:40,667
Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,667
Is that true?

309
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,667
Yes.

310
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,292
Keisuke!

311
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:03,250
-Wait a second.
-Hey, you. Wait a second.

312
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,958
Wait!

313
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,208
Fifth floor.

314
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,375
Sendo.

315
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,542
Mr. Agawa.

316
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,375
-Where's Yuki?
-This way.

317
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,792
She has a visitor.

318
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,125
A family member? Go ahead.

319
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,792
Yuki.

320
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,000
Daigo.

321
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:18,917
Mashiro, I'm sorry.

322
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,125
You took your time.

323
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,250
I'm sorry, Yuki.

324
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm so glad you're alive.

325
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,417
I want to eat some melon.

326
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,000
Daigo, go buy a melon.

327
00:43:58,417 --> 00:43:59,667
A melon?

328
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:04,333
Impossible. I can't move anymore.

329
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:07,333
Mashiro, you want to eat melon too, right?

330
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,583
See, Mashiro wants some too.

331
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:12,042
I said I can't move.

332
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,667
Oh? Daigo?

333
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:19,583
Mr. Agawa?

334
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:20,708
Daigo?

335
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:22,750
Mr. Agawa?

336
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,208
Excuse me! A man just passed out!

337
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,167
-What? Okay.
-Hurry!

338
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,250
-Daigo!
-Over here.

339
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,417
-What happened? What happened?
-Quickly.

340
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,792
-Are you okay?
-Mr. Agawa?

341
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,042
-Can you hear me?
-Mr. Agawa.

342
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,333
Yeah, wrap it on.

343
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,667
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Agawa?

344
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,458
-Daigo!
-I'm going to squeeze your arm a little.

345
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,083
Hang on a moment.

346
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,667
He's just sleeping.

347
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,667
-What?
-Was he tired?

348
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,375
-I'll take this off.
-Yeah, he's okay.

349
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,542
-He's just sleeping?
-Yeah.

350
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,250
-Do we put him in a bed?
-Is he okay?

351
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:04,167
Police suspect that most of the villagers

352
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,583
were complicit in the murder of Gin Goto

353
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:10,875
and are continuing their investigation.

354
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,750
Yes, the whole village was in on it.

355
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,583
They were also sacrificing
unregistered children

356
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:20,667
to a person they referred to as That Man.

357
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,958
This is an unprecedented,
horrific incident.

358
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:26,417
Today on Tell Me, Armadillo,

359
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,125
we'll take a closer look
at the Goto family…

360
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,542
-I'm in that village now.
-Hey, have you heard of this?

361
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,542
…as well as the village's history.

362
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,292
-Oh, the village from the TV.
-I am in Kuge Village.

363
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,292
Today, we're going to interview
the residents of Kuge Village.

365
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,958
-Yes.
-Oh, wow.

366
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,458
-This is freaky. Wait, wait…
-Hey, wait a second.

367
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,500
-This is too scary.
-What? Oh, snap. Damn.

368
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,792
-Look. It says "human meat."
-"Human meat."

369
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,625
-It's for real. It's for real.
-This is crazy. What the hell?

370
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,000
Seriously, what happened here?

371
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,333
Ugh, that's so scary.

372
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,083
-Wow, what is this?
-It's like a horror movie.

373
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:02,375
-People keep coming here.
-We just came to hear your story.

374
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:05,333
-That Man is coming!
-Are you okay, ma'am?

375
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,542
You came from Tokyo?
Then go back to Tokyo.

376
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,083
Cannibal!

377
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:23,625
-He's here!
-That Man is here!

378
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,875
-Run away!
-It's the cannibal!

379
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,542
Joining us now
is the journalist Manabu Utada,

380
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,333
who is an expert

381
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:35,625
on the strange, unknown customs
of Kuge Village and the Goto family.

382
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,833
We're glad to have you here.

383
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,125
Thank you.

384
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,375
Mr. Utada, have you met

385
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,292
the prime suspect, Keisuke Goto?

386
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:48,333
-No, I haven't met him, but I've heard…
-Coming.

387
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:50,917
-That's the exact amount. Thank you.
-Thank you.

388
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,750
…and played a vital role
in uniting the clan.

389
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:57,625
-Kyosuke.
-It was he who instructed…

390
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,833
the surviving men of the Goto family
to surrender.

391
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,167
Let's have some pizza.

392
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,875
Their testimony
is gradually shedding light

393
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,833
-on the truth behind the incident.
-Okay.

394
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,875
Why has Keisuke Goto been so willing

395
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,083
to cooperate with the investigation?

396
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,250
I think he is trying

397
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,250
to shoulder the blame
for the Goto family's crimes

398
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,958
and receive proper punishment.

399
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Here.

400
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:29,583
Thanks.

401
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,042
Let's eat.

402
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:37,792
We're all wondering how the trial will go,
and how the judge will assess the case.

403
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:42,417
It's hard to believe the rumors
that the villagers willingly sacrificed

404
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,583
their children to the Goto family.

405
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,833
How could something like that happen?

406
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:50,042
Back when Gin Goto was head of the family,

407
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,125
the Gotos assumed
a position of absolute power in--

408
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:08,167
The family then took over

409
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,750
this culture of ritual sacrifice,
which is…

410
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,000
It's okay.

411
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,917
What a terrifying custom.

412
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,250
It's surprising that such a culture
still remains to this day,

413
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,917
but how did the Goto family…

414
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:54,750
How are you holding up?

415
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,250
What?

416
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,458
Don't ask dumb questions.

417
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,375
Can't you see?

418
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:13,375
Sumire… is doing well.

419
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,042
The baby will be born soon.

420
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,125
She said it's a girl.

421
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,250
A girl, huh?

422
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,667
I can't even imagine it.

423
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,208
When Mashiro was born…

424
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:52,208
I had no idea what to do either.

425
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:55,375
Don't compare me to you.

426
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:01,042
We're totally different, right?

427
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,792
Yeah.

428
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,375
Yosuke…

429
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,417
is leaving the village.

430
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:34,750
I see.

431
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,042
Maybe that's for the best.

432
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,375
He doesn't have to carry this weight.

433
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,250
Right.

434
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,875
We, the Goto family…

435
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,083
committed terrible crimes.

436
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,417
For a long time.

437
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:09,083
As head of the family,
I must face the consequences.

438
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,417
Consequences, huh?

439
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,958
I agree, your crimes were serious.

440
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,917
But…

441
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,167
if I had been in your place…

442
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,500
I think I would have done the same.

443
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,583
When you get out one day…

444
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,500
embrace your child without shame.

445
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,000
One day…

446
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:49,250
It feels refreshing to think
I'll never have to see your face again.

447
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:57,750
Same here.

448
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,667
Agawa.

449
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:12,125
No trespassing

450
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:19,208
Cannibal village

451
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,500
Morobe Police Department
Kuge Village Substation

452
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,417
Here to mock us again?

453
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:44,292
Don't you dare upload
any videos of the village.

454
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,333
What?

455
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:52,083
Or do you feel sorry for us?

456
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:56,750
We don't want your pity or your money.

457
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,292
Just leave us alone.

458
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,917
Goodbye.

459
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:05,083
-Oh, no, no, no. You've got it all wrong.
-Hey…

460
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,125
That's not why I'm here.

461
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,042
Kuge Village Substation

462
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:14,042
Do you have business with the substation?

463
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,125
Yes.

464
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

465
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,667
But we don't have
a stationed officer in this village.

466
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:24,958
We just have this substation, that's all.

467
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:29,625
If you need help,
go to Yata Village nearby.

468
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:30,792
Oh, no.

469
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:35,000
I'm… the new officer.

470
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,042
What?

471
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,042
Oh, I'm so sorry.

472
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,292
No, not at all.

473
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,375
Oh, I'm Sayama.

474
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,125
Nice to meet you.

475
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:50,875
I'm Kanako Yamaguchi.

476
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:05,375
It's so nice and quiet here.

477
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:11,750
That's what it looks like to first-timers.

478
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,292
Not many people live here.

479
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:23,042
Oh…

480
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:24,917
I'm sorry.

481
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,333
Hey, Shin.

482
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:33,500
Dumbass, cannibal, shameful

483
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,917
Be careful.

484
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,667
Up we go!

485
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,208
It looks like
someone is living in that house.

486
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,875
It's that man's house.

487
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,333
That man?

488
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:03,875
Yeah.

489
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,750
He lives there with his family,
three of them.

490
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,667
-Hey, look.
-Yeah. What?

491
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,708
-This.
-Oh, what is that?

492
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,208
Maybe I should say hello.

493
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,208
Save it for later.

494
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,625
If you bring some wine,

495
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,667
-they'll welcome you.
-Mom!

496
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,750
Oh?

497
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,625
What does he do?

498
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,667
Well…

499
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,917
-…you'll see when you meet him.
-Orange juice.

500
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,292
-Orange juice? And Daigo?
-Mom!

501
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,417
-I'll take orange juice too.
-Okay.

502
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,667
Orange juice for three.

503
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,667
Is this enough?

504
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:48,917
