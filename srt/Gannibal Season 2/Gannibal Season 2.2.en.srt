[Sabu] Hey, Jin.

00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,333
The timing is important.
Don't overthink it.

[villager 3] Come on, it's starting.

12
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:38,458
Uh, the day of the festival
has come without problems,

13
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,500
uh, this year too.

14
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,875
I am grateful to you all.

How time flies.

16
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,958
It's already been 10 years
since I lost my son.

Oh, m-my grandchild
has also grown up nicely.

19
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:19,125
I've got a serious disease,

20
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,625
and soon I'll depart for the afterlife.

21
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:26,042
I can't wait to go there.

22
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:31,375
I can feel this way

that everyone has helped

24
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:43,208
to keep the votive festival
of Kuge Village alive for 700 years.

26

From now on,

27
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:54,458
my grandson Munechika
will conduct the rituals.

28

Have you seen Keisuke?

33

Now that you mention it, no.

Where has he gone?

May the blessings of the ever-present,

Did I do a good job?

[Munechika]
The votive festival of Kuge Village

00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:31,417

You came.

I missed you.

66
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,542
Abort the baby.

67
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,542
Never talk to me again. Got it?

68
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,667
Are you serious?

69
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,958
Yeah.

70
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,208
If you won't abort it...

71
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,417
I'll kill it here and now.

Why not...

79
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,667
just abandon this village and run?

80
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,292
You, me, and our baby...

81
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,875

And I don't want to drag you into this.

So, please do as I say.

[Keisuke] What are you doing here?

Someone saw Sumire at the substation.

90

I thought it was strange,
so I had someone tail her.

91
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,625
That was some fine melodrama
you showed us.

92
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,375
Wow.

93
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,208

That's the next head of the family.

It sure is. But...

97
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:26,375
just now, you said some strange things
about abandoning the village

98

- and aborting the baby, didn't you?

What did you mean by aborting it?

Don't get the wrong idea.

104
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,083
Mixing her blood with the Goto family
is a problem.

We've got a history
with her father, Kano, after all.

that they have permits for.

We've confirmed it.

178
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,625
[Aragaki] The second floor seems clear.

179
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,500
Seven branch households left.

180
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,500
I must say...

181
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,583
for such a depopulating village,
there sure are a lot of Gotos. [chuckles]

182
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,375
They're like
a little village of their own.

183
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,583
[Iwao]
We were born here and we will die here.

184
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,875
I guess our numbers increase
because we don't leave.

185
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,333
[Kanemaru] "Don't leave"? [groans]

186
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,292
Or "can't leave"? [scoffs]

187
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,917
Those who try get dragged back right away.

188
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,375
Hey, Mr. Sunglasses.

189
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,583
What the hell do you know
about the Goto family? Dumbass.

190
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,250
[chuckles]

191
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,750
[♪ uneasy music playing]

192
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,583
[Kanemaru] There's... something fishy here.

193
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,542
[Kanemaru laughs]

194
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,333
You look like
you don't want us to go prying in there.

195
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,083
[Kanemaru laughing]

196
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,083
Let's see...

197
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,167
[grunts]

198
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,583
[Kanemaru] Heave-ho.

199
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,042
[soft exhale]

200
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,583
[tapping]

201
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,667
[Iwao] Hey.

202
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,625
Not there.

203
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,750
Over here.

204
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,542
[door slides open]

205
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,125
[door thuds]

206
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,708
[Makoto] Shit!

207
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,625
[yells] Let me go!

208
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:14,542
[Keisuke] Hey, calm down.
They won't find anything.

209
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,333
[heavy breathing]

210
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,833
Wait. Will you just listen to me already?

211
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,833
[both panting]

212
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,125
- Hold on.
- [yells]

213
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:28,292
You. Have you forgotten what Grandma Gin
told us when we were kids?

214
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:33,250
Our grandfather
set an example by fighting.

215
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,333
[Keisuke tuts]

216
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,125
The times have changed.

217
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,542
No, they haven't!

218
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,000
You are always so soft.

219
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,250
Hold it.

220
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,042
If you make a move now, it'll only lead to
Goto family members getting hurt.

221
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,417
- Just do as I say!
- [yells]

222
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:53,458
Hey! What are you doing?

223
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,167
[Makoto] Shut the hell up!

224
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,667
- [grunts] Keisuke.
- What?

225
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,708
You're hiding something, aren't you?

226
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,083
I don't trust you.

227
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,833
[sighs]

228
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,458
[deep breath]

229
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,542
[Keisuke] Dammit.

230
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,208
Hey.

231
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,333
Hey!

232
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,042
Wait.

233
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,458
[elder] 70 years ago,

234
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,417
there was a big fight...

235
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,542
between the Goto family and Kuge Village.

236
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,167
They say the Goto family fought bravely...

237
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:57,750
driving the villagers away,
and making the family even stronger.

238
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,250
It's in our blood.

239
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,042
As long as our bloodline continues,
this family will never die.

240
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:15,958
No matter what happens,
the Goto family will never die.

241
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:23,458
Take a good look at us.

242
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:30,375
This family lives on, from past to future...

243
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,500
into eternity.

244
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,292
[Iwao] You look disappointed.

245
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,458
Were you looking for something?

246
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,708
Why were you hiding this room?

247
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:16,417
[Iwao] Long ago,
this room was used as a torture room.

248
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,708
We're ashamed of it.

249
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,417
[Kanemaru scoffs]

250
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:25,292
[Kanemaru sucks teeth] "Long ago," huh?

251
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,917
Is it just me... [sniffing]

252
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,167
...or does it smell faintly
of feces and urine in here? [grunts]

253
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:48,875
I'm kidding.

254
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,208
Don't look so grim. [laughing]

255
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,875
[Kanemaru shouts] Okay!
There's nothing here! Let's move on!

256
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,583
There we go. Heave-ho.

257
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,917
[family member] He didn't even blink.

258
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,917
[Ryuji] What's wrong with him?

259
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,708
Have you seen the Officer?

260
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,792
[family member] No.

261
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,375
[Iwao inhales deeply]

262
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,542
[Iwao] It's strange that he's not here.

263
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,417
[Ryuji] You're right...

264
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,000
What's up with that?

265
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,500
Isn't it possible that their real goal...

266
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,917
is to keep us here and stall for time?

267
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,417
Oh...

268
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,167
[indistinct clamoring]

269
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,708
- [officer] Hey, where are you going?
- [Ryuji] Out of the way, idiot!

270
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,583
You want to die, asshole?

271
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,083
You got a death wish, punk?

272
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,167
[family member]
Get the hell out of the way!

273
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,792
[Ryuji] I'll kill you, you bitch!

274
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,833
[clamoring continues]

275

[Daigo grunts]

277
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,458
[Munechika] Mr. Agawa.

278
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,208
I know...

279
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,708
where the children are now.

280
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,417
I've been secretly asked to tell you
where they are.

281
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,292
[Daigo] By whom?

282
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,958
Well...

283
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,458
by Keisuke.

284
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,208
[Munechika]
He asked me to save the children.

285
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,958
Keisuke said that?

286
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,167
[Munechika] Yes.

287
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,792
He also wants you...

288
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,417
to put an end to this festival.

289
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,000
Where are the children?

290
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,125
[Munechika] They are at...

291
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:33,500
Jin's place, at the peak of Mt. Kuge.

292

293
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,167
These birds are so noisy.

294
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,167
Maybe I'll fry and eat you.

295
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,958
You guys are quiet.

296
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,625
[captor] You've been trained well.

Kuni, don't think
about anything unnecessary.

299
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,125
Okay.

300
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,208
The peace of the village depends on us.

It's still too early for the pickup.

305

Move.

320
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,250
Practicing for the festival?

321
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,917
I'm afraid
I can't let anyone leave this place.

322
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't think you can walk around
our property like you own the place!

323
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000

to kill a person?

You don't look like people to us.

327

"Only the Goto family are people."

328
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,583

329

00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:51,958
Did he say a "spare"? What did he mean?

536
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,167
That's right.

537
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,333
We prepared a spare kid

538
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:59,542
to use for the festival,
in case things went wrong.

539
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,375
Hey. Explain yourself, Makoto.

540
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:07,583
We must make sure
the Officer takes full responsibility.

541
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,042
[Makoto] You can get up now, Momoko.

542
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,458
- [family member 1] Okay, one, two, three.
- [family member 2] Okay.

543
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,667
[family member 1] There we go.

544
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,625
[family member 3] There we go.

545
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,917
[soft breathing]

546
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:36,875
[muffled soft gasp]

547
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,292
[muffled grunting]

548
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,208
[grunting continues]

549
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,375
Take her out.

550
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,500
[Yuki] Mashiro...

551
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,000
[muffled whimpering]

552
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,625
[indistinct chatter]

553
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:51,583
[Yuki] Mashiro! [muffled grunt]

554
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,458
[rapid gunshots]

555
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:10,083
[Kakako breathing heavily, whimpering]

556
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,458
[clattering]

557
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,167
[Kanako gasps]

558
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,708
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

559
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:51,000
[♪ music swells]

560
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,208

561
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,000
