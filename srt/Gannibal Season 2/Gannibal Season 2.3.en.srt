1
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,542
Ki-Kikuta! What's going on outside?
Kikuta! Kikuta!

2
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,042
<i> Kikuta!</i>
<i>What's going on outside, Kikuta?</i>

3
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:38,542
<i>- Kikuta! Hey, Kikuta! Respond, Kikuta!</i>

4
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,667
Prioritize protecting the kids!

5
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,708
- I'll cover you!
- Got it.

6
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,958
Run!

7
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,542
Hey, Agawa! What are you doing? Hey!

8
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,375
- Open up! Hey!
- Agawa!

9
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,292
Agawa!

10
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,208
Agawa!

11
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,208
It tastes like blood.

12
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,833
If they're crazy,
then I'll just have to go crazy too.

13
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:58,625
Quickly!

14
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,458
You made one hell of a mess.

15
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,833
No, you bastards did.

16
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,708
Wow!

17
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
No…

18
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
Don't move!

19
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,958
Don't you care what happens to the kid?

20
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,875
What are you doing, Officer?

21
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,125
Show yourself now!

22
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,292
Hey!

23
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,750
I said show yourself!

24
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,250
What happened to the chief?

25
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,625
Huh?

26
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,792
I don't care, idiot!

27
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:34,875
- Come out!
- Come out here, dammit!

28
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,333
Come out from there!

29
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,458
Screw it. If you don't come out,
I'll kill the kid!

30
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,458
<i>Yosuke, I know you can hear me.</i>

31
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,083
<i>Shoot the Officer from there.</i>

32
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,708
<i>What are you waiting for? Shoot already.</i>

33
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,042
Ow!

34
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,500
What are you doing, Yosuke?

35
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,917
Ah, dammit!

36
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,708
Keisuke…

37
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,167
Stay here for now.

38
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,125
What?

39
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,083
What are you going to do?

40
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll protect your lives,
no matter what.

41
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,375
Okay?

42
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,583
Come on.

43
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,583
This is my wife.

44
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,208
She's pregnant.

45
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,583
Look after her.

46
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,375
Understood.

47
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,167
How are things out front?

48
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,625
Did you kill a lot of them?

49
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,500
- Did they?
- I wonder how it's going.

50
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,625
Please.

51
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,750
Now, now.

52
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
- Come, come.
- There, there.

53
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,292
Take a seat.

54
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,583
What did you do?

55
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,500
You… can't escape now.

56
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,958
How are you?

57
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,167
This is great news.

58
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,583
- Oh, yes. Great news.
- That's right.

59
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,250
How wonderful.

60
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,833
The Goto family lives on.

61
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,125
Congratulations.

62
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,167
Go on, go on, go on.

63
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,875
Go on, go on, go on.

64
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,833
- I'm going to be sore.
- Yeah.

65
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,417
One, two, three.

66
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,042
There it goes!

67
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,708
I've been waiting for this! A barbecue!

68
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,333
Barbecue! Barbecue!

69
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:44,458
Come on, let's go.
Burn them all.

70
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,708
Here, disinfectant.
Use it, use it.

71
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,333
Here, disinfectant. Use it, use it.

72
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,167
Honey…

73
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,958
Honey, why?

74
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,375
Go to hell.

75
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,875
Don't cry. Be proud.

76
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,375
We killed even more of the cops.

77
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,500
As long as the bloodline continues,
this family will never die.

78
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,292
Right, Keisuke?

79
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,833
Hey, Officer!
How many people have you killed?

80
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,625
- Look at all this!
- Shut up, asshole!

81
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,292
Don't make me beat you, scumbag!

82
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,375
Are you out of your mind?

83
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,125
- Get in!
- Huh?

84
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,292
- Are you all right?
- That hurts!

85
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,250
We can't get a hold of the team
we sent to the Goto residence.

86
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,000
They may have been wiped out.

87
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,875
A whole SWAT team?

88
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,667
Hold still.

89
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,792
It's possible.

90
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,208
If you think these people
are normal humans, you're wrong.

91
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,917
Are you listening?

92
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,250
Arrest me too!

93
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,625
Ow!

94
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,708
Stop!

95
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,583
- Hey, don't move!
- Put the gun down and stop.

96
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,708
- Hey, Yosuke!
- Put it down!

97
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,583
You shut the hell up,
you bastard!

98
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,375
Do you understand what you've done, huh?

99
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,375
- Piece of shit!
- Do you understand?

100
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,625
I shot them.

101
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,083
I shot… everyone.

102
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,958
You're wrong.

103
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,000
I… betrayed everyone.

104
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,250
No.

105
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,125
You saved them all.

106
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,000
Yosuke…

107
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,292
I'm not going to cuff you.

108
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,833
Come with me.

109
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,667
Who told you the kids' location?

110
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,125
You really love it, don't you?

111
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,917
Huh?

112
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,458
You love it! The killing.

113
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,292
You're repeating
what happened 70 years ago.

114
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,500
Why do you have this?

115
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,042
Didn't you ever wonder?

116
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:56,125
How could Gin Goto, the youngest daughter,
become head of the Goto family?

117
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,917
Because her older brother died.

118
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,125
Hey, it happened right after the war.

119
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,667
What's it got to do with you?

120
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,333
That's right, it was right after the war.
People died all the time, didn't they?

121
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,667
Who are you?

122
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:35,875
I'm… the grandson of Gin's brother,
Kinji Goto.

123
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,333
I'm no fake family head like Gin.

124
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,458
I'm the one who should've become
head of the Goto family.

125
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,125
Do you realize what you're saying?

126
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,833
What you need to realize is who Gin Goto

127
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:13,667
and the old geezer
you call "That Man" really are,

128
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,667
and how the Goto family
came to be what it is today!

129
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:41,917
Shut up.

130
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,958
Hell no.

131
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,083
I'm going to tell you everything I know.

132
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:00,792
Hey, how are things over there?

133
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,167
<i>Can't anyone pick up?</i>

134
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,917
Can you hear me?

135
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,958
<i>Who is this?</i>

136
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,500
I'm the Officer, you idiot.

137
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,708
<i> We've lost contact</i>
<i>with the officers that went your way.</i>

138
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,875
<i>What happened to them?</i>

139
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,375
We're in the exact same situation here.

140
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,125
We've taken your friends into custody.

141
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,833
Don't you mean you killed them?

142
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:45,208
Hey… why don't we stop this now?

143
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,917
<i>What's the point in fighting anymore?</i>

144
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,750
<i>Just come and surrender.</i>

145
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,333
Makoto, let me talk.

146
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,500
Asshole!

147
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,542
<i>Thinking about the point</i>
<i>is why you guys are weak.</i>

148
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,750
You're the one who should surrender.

149
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:26,417
What did you say?

150
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:36,458
Your wife and daughter's lives…
are in our hands.

151
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,292
Hey!

152
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,750
Daigo! Daigo! Daigo!

153
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:09,208
<i> Shut the hell up!</i>
<i>We'll kill your daughter!</i>

154
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,417
Call.

155
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,083
Hey, Officer.

156
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,917
<i>Let me make sure</i>
<i>Yuki and Mashiro are safe immediately.</i>

157
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,083
And what about
the Goto family members over there?

158
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:41,542
I don't give a damn.
Let me check if they're safe already.

159
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,333
Otherwise, I'll kill this guy on the spot.

160
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,500
Who the hell are you talking about?

161
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,750
Your dear little brother.

162
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,583
I'm saying I'll kill him.

163
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,833
You really are a demon. You're insane.

164
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:01,917
Shut up.

165
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:06,792
Let me check if they're safe.
I'll kill him right now!

166
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,917
<i>Put them on the line.</i>

167
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
<i>I'll kill him!</i>

168
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,167
Daigo…

169
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,375
Please come here quickly,
whatever it takes.

170
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,042
I'm sorry, Yuki.

171
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,667
I dragged you into this.
Is Mashiro there with you?

172
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,625
Yeah.

173
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,333
Hang tight. I'll be right there.

174
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:57,542
And then I'll kill every last one
of the bastards who hurt you.

175
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,208
Huh?

176
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,875
Hey, Officer.

177
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,958
You're crazy.

178
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,875
Do you even understand what you're saying?

179
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,750
If you kill any more of us now,
there will be hell to pay.

180
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:31,875
Quit your yapping. I'll exchange this guy
for my wife and daughter, okay?

181
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,583
<i> Hey, Officer!</i>

182
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,417
It all started when Gin Goto died.

183
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,000
And it won't end
until I've killed all of them.

184
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,125
Agawa!

185
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:49,333
- Hey, Agawa!
- What are you doing, Agawa? Open the door!

186
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:52,583
Hey! Answer me! Officer!

187
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,667
- Agawa! What are you doing?
- Shut up. Just wait a minute.

188
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,917
What are you thinking? Agawa!

189
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,708
Stop it! Agawa! Aga…

190
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,042
Agawa! Hey! Hey, Agawa!

191
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:16,083
Agawa! Hey! Agawa!

192
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,042
- Agawa!
- Hey! Hey!

193
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,250
Shit. There's no telling what he'll do.

194
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,500
Can you hear me?

195
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:37,917
Officer. Do you understand
the position you're in?

196
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,792
<i>Shut up and decide</i>
<i>where we're going to do this.</i>

197
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,917
The tunnel at the edge of Kuge Village.

198
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,792
Come alone.

199
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,583
Don't run away.

200
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,292
What you said… is it the truth?

201
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:25,833
Yeah,
now go and let the others know.

202
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,958
Or the Goto family will fall apart.

203
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,542
There's no point in fighting anymore.

204
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,542
In that case…

205
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,958
I can't let you tell anyone else.

206
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,333
Were you listening?

207
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,292
That old hag deceived you all!

208
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,208
We know our history well.

209
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,792
Idiot.

210
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,208
You're completely brainwashed.

211
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,417
You can all die.

212
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,083
I'm putting my life on the line
for the Goto family.

213
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,333
How about you?

214
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,375
I don't want anyone to die.

215
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,583
That's all.

216
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,625
Don't be naive.

217
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,500
The Goto family lives on

218
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,583
because a lot of people
have sacrificed their lives.

219
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,500
Am I wrong?

220
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,958
Take them to the car.

221
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,000
What are you still standing here for?
Take them away already.

222
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,375
- Stand up! Come on!
- Don't touch Mashiro!

223
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,250
What did we… What did we ever do to you?

224
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,583
We've got nothing against you.

225
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:12,000
But if it weren't for that man,
we'd still be living in peace right now.

226
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,583
No one would have had to die.

227
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,000
That's right. It's their fault.

228
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,750
I want revenge, Keisuke.

229
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,833
- Hey.
- Wait…

230
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:26,917
Our people died.

231
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,292
- Ryu!
- Hey.

232
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,417
What are you doing?

233
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,708
If I don't kill this woman,
the dead won't find peace!

234
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,667
Then you should kill them
in front of the Officer.

235
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,542
His daughter will be enough.

236
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,917
- What are you doing?
- Ryuji!

237
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,375
- Hey, put the gun down!
- Calm down!

238
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,375
What happens to Yosuke if you kill her?

239
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,792
Calm down! Ryu!

240
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,500
What's the matter, Keisuke?

241
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,875
Surely it wasn't you
who told the cops where the kids were?

242
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,667
Things turned out this way
because you were too soft!

243
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:59,542
This woman… this kid,
they're nothing but livestock.

244
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:23,583
That's enough!

245
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,375
What are you doing, man?

246
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,083
Do you realize what you're doing?

247
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,458
What happened to the cops?

248
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,458
Did you find the traitor?

249
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,083
Calm down.

250
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,208
Calm down.

251
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,292
Huh?

252
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,000
Huh?

253
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,333
Dead.

254
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,958
This is our only clue.

255
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:18,208
But… there's definitely a traitor.

256
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,458
Well, well, well.
What now, Keisuke?

257
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,583
Now there's no one
who can prove your innocence.

258
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,750
Keisuke.

259
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,375
There's no sense
fighting amongst ourselves.

260
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,625
Someone's trying to sow discord
within the Goto like poison.

261
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,667
Yeah.

262
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,750
Keisuke.

263
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,583
You know what to do.

264
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,417
Stop it! Stop, let me go!
Don't touch Mashiro!

265
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:38,125
Mashiro! Run away!
Run away, Mashiro! Mashiro! Run!

266
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,125
Mashiro, run away!

267
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:10,083
Keisuke.

268
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,375
Do you know what this is?

269
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:29,833
It's livestock.

270
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:36,458
So… you're the traitor.

271
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:43,875
That's right.

272
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,042
I was the one who contacted Kano,

273
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,333
and the one
who revealed the kids' location.

274
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,875
It was I who set everything in motion…

275
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,708
not Keisuke.

276
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,500
You see… I always hated all of this.

277
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,417
This family…

278
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,375
That old hag…

279
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:27,833
I see.

280
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,000
Then die.

281
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:22,875
People back then…
they looked kind of… sharp.

282
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,208
What are you talking about?

283
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:30,250
Keisuke… with your looks,
you could be an actor.

284
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:37,458
Those people in the movie…

285
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,625
I wonder how old they are today.

286
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,083
They must all be dead by now.

287
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,042
Yeah… I suppose so…

288
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,917
Oh, that's right!

289
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,250
I bought you some shoes today, Keisuke.

290
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,833
I got a pair for Yosuke too. Wait, huh?

291
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,083
Which was which again?
Let's see, this is--

292
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,833
Oh, it's fine. You don't have to open it.

293
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:07,750
Aw, don't be embarrassed. Here.

294
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:21,667
The booze tastes good today.

295
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,125
Grow up quickly, Keisuke.

296
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,958
Your old man…
is finally the mayor of the village.

297
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,792
Things are still a bit chaotic right now,

298
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,667
but I'm going to make some changes
around here.

299
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:56,375
And if I can't do it…

300
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,333
then one day…

301
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,417
you will do it.

302
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,917
Why didn't you run away?

303
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,250
Why…?

304
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,083
You did well.

305
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,875
Yeah.

306
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,833
What are you waiting for?

307
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,042
Clean up that garbage already.

308
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:37,917
Wait, Brother! Give me that!

309
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,500
- Wait, Brother! Brother!
- Hey! Be careful!

310
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,792
- Brother!
- No way!

311
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,958
- Wait, Brother! Let me have that!
- You'll hurt yourself.

312
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,708
- Come back here!
- Okay! Let's go.

313
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,583
You have to go home
and do your homework.

314
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,250
- What?
- Over there!

315
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,125
- Oh! There are a lot up there too!
- Whoa! So many spiders!

316
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,208
Yuck!

317
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:01,417
- Sorry about that.
- No problem…

318
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,292
- Stop!
- Stop it! I won't give it back!

319
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,583
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey!

320
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:07,000
- Take that!
- Wow! Take that!

321
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,750
And that! And that!

322
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:23,250
It's still there! Over there too!

323
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,792
We have to go back.
Can you hear me?

324
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,083
Over here. Okay!

325
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:05,000
Most of the young ones have survived.

326
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,167
The Goto family can still fight.

327
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,667
Do you think
any of this would have happened

328
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,208
if Grandma Gin was still alive?

329
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,750
I don't want to see you acting weak.

330
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,625
Thanks.

331
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,292
I'm a soldier of the main household.

332
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:11,500
I'll do anything to keep you alive.

333
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,125
Iwao, are you really fine with that?

334
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,625
Keisuke…

335
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,375
All people have their parts to play.

336
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:44,458
I'm fine with playing mine in this life.

337
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,250
Well…

338
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,458
I do think there's something more
between us than that though.

339
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,000
What's that supposed to mean?

340
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:13,667
Leave the troublesome stuff to me.

341
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,833
You focus on leading the family.

342
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,917
Got it?

343
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,500
Yeah.

344
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,167
Also, I'd like some eggs
and red pickled ginger.

345
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,167
Okay.

346
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,667
1,300 yen.

347
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:10,625
Sorry the toilet is so dirty.

348
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,625
Here's your change.

349
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,208
Your change.

350
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,125
Oh, thank you.

351
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,917
Okay, thank you.

352
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,667
That was… a member of the Goto family.

353
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,875
What?

354
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,250
Something might have happened to Keisuke.

355
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,833
Oh… I'm still alive?

356
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:56,125
I'm glad you woke up.

357
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:00,917
Is that you, Munechika?

358
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:20,667
The drums are beating out there…
so what are you doing here?

359
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,958
The Goto family and the police
have clashed.

360
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,708
It seems some villagers have died.

361
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,625
I see.

362
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,167
Looks like…

363
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:48,375
I won't get to die in peace just yet.

364
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:34,750
<i> And so, Kuge Village goes on,</i>

365
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:39,875
<i>forever and ever.</i>

366
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,167
How can you go this far?

367
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,292
Hmm?

368
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,417
You frighten me.

369
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Don't you care…
what happens to other people?

370
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,875
Do you?

371
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,042
Come.

372
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:13,583
Daigo…

373
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:48,417
Time to settle the grudge
between the Goto family and you.

374
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,708
I'll end it all.
