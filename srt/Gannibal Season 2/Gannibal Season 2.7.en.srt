1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:05,000
…will accept you the way you are.

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,875
May 23, 2010
Wakana

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:10,292
Now bring your arms
and go into Adho Mukha Svanasana.

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,250
Keep taking deep breaths.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,167
Place your right foot between your hands

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,167
and push strongly with both feet
against the ground to stand up.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,875
Virabhadrasana 2.

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,500
Take a deep breath.

9
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,833
Breathe out and let go
of all your worries.

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,875
Breathe in and plant your feet firmly,

11
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,417
spreading your arms wide like wings.

12
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,333
Virabhadrasana.

13
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:50,625
This year's festival was so much fun.

14
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,083
They goofed around too much.

15
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,125
The significance of the votive festival
is being lost.

16
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,458
Ouch, that hurts, Kuniko.

17
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:03,417
Sorry.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,958
It's not just any festival.
It has to be done properly.

19
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:13,917
I wonder what will happen
now that Masamune has retired.

20
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,917
Munechika is still young,
after all.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,417
Did you hear what people were saying, Dad?

22
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,917
About what?

23
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,167
Apparently…

24
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,750
the Goto family is finished.

25
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,917
Takeru!

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,917
The young ones speak nonsense.

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,083
Don't listen to that crap.

28
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,625
But what if it's true?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,042
I might be able to take my kid back.

30
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,250
You fool!

31
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:58,958
You think that'll bring
your wife back? Huh?

32
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:03,167
You know it'll never happen!

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,333
Your kid is dead, you damn idiot.

34
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,875
Please stop it, dear.

35
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,375
Apologize to your father.

36
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,375
Don't do that again.

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,417
You should go to sleep too, dear.

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,333
Every year…

39
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:45,417
when this day comes,
I can't help but think about it.

40
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,625
Takeru.

41
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,875
The most important thing
is to go on living.

42
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,000
I know that.

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,250
But…

44
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,625
if only my child
hadn't been stolen from me…

45
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,208
Your child wasn't stolen.

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
We sacrificed it.

47
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,500
That's why
we could go on living to this day.

48
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,542
The people of the village help us out.

49
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,167
We must be grateful for that.

50
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,750
Mom, is that true?

51
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,167
She was that woman's child, after all.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,917
We didn't think she'd ever amount to much.

53
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,792
We did it all for your sake.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Takeru.

55
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
This village won't change.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,500
But if we can go on living in peace,
what's the problem?

57
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,042
Got it? Then go to sleep.

58
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,625
If she had been alive today…

59
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:35,708
she'd be in junior high school about now.

60
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,417
Thank you, Mom.

61
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,333
Dad.

62
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,958
I'm going to change this village.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,917
Hey, Iwao!
What happened?

64
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,667
Didn't he get shot in the head?

65
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,583
-Hey, Iwao. What's wrong?
-Where's Keisuke?

66
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,292
-Keisuke!
-Hey,

67
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,958
you shouldn't move.

68
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,792
Where is Keisuke?

69
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,000
-Iwao…
-Keisuke.

70
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,667
Are you okay?

71
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,667
Where is Keisuke?

72
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,917
Iwao. Iwao!

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,708
Keisuke isn't here. He ran away!

74
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,500
What are you saying?
He would never run away!

75
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,125
It's true!

76
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,167
He was the traitor!

77
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,292
It's Keisuke's fault
that this happened to you!

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,125
Keisuke can't be the traitor!

79
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:49,125
I know. I know exactly where he went.

80
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,875
-Iwao! Are you okay?
-Hey, what's wrong?

81
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,167
You shouldn't move.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,667
-Stop! Stop!
-Iwao!

83
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,458
-Hey!
-H-Hey! After him!

84
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,875
What the hell? What's up with him?

85
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,167
Open your eyes, Officer.

86
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,667
Here. Eat it.

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,542
This is what you were looking for, right?

88
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,333
You and Kano…

89
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,208
were right.

90
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,125
We eat people…

91
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, are you okay? Hey!

92
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,333
Are you okay?

93
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,542
Yeah.

94
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,625
I figured you were going
to try to leave the village.

95
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,292
You traitor.

96
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,500
Where is Keisuke? Huh?

97
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,792
Answer me, Yosuke.

98
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,958
Asshole.

99
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:54,917
You people in the main household
grow up spoiled.

100
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,583
That's why you get these weird ideas
in your heads. Right?

101
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,250
Am I wrong? Huh?

102
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,500
There we go. Hey.

103
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,583
Whoa, watch it, watch it, watch it.

104
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,500
Hey, you're going to fall. Huh? There!

105
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,917
Don't worry.

106
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,958
I'll send your brother after you.

107
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,333
You can live happily together in hell.

108
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,208
This village is the real hell.

109
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,625
Oh?

110
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,125
Sadamu!

111
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,083
-Sadamu!
-Kuroe?

112
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,333
What are you doing here?

113
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,250
He kidnapped me
and forced me to drive.

114
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,167
I was so scared being with that traitor.

115
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,167
What are you talking about?
You asked me for a ride--

116
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,583
Shut up! Sadamu.

117
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,875
Thank you. You saved me.

118
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,167
Hey, don't touch me.

119
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,250
Calm down a little.

120
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,167
You know…

121
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,875
a long time ago…

122
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,083
you almost raped me, remember?

123
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,042
Huh?

124
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:21,875
To tell you the truth…

125
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,583
at that time…

126
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,750
I was really turned on.

127
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,667
I still regret…

128
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,750
that I rejected you.

129
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Since then…

130
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,958
normal sex hasn't been enough
to satisfy me.

131
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,208
So what?

132
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,875
Finish what you started.

133
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,750
I won't…

134
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,375
run away.

135
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,792
Kuroe.

136
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,792
What are you trying to do?

137
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,125
I have always…

138
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,292
been insensitive to pain.

139
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,958
I don't really understand how people feel
when they cry and say it hurts.

140
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,208
Well?

141
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,042
You feel anything?

142
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,250
There.

143
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,042
You always let a little kindness
get to your head!

144
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,583
I'll beat some sense into you. Okay?

145
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,667
That turns you on, right?

146
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,500
Are you that happy?

147
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,792
Of course I am.

148
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,833
Soon… I'll be free.

149
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,208
Do you know what paraquat is?

150
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,583
It's an old herbicide

151
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,417
that isn't used anymore
because it's too dangerous.

152
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I coated my blade with it.

153
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:47,083
I've always known
that you can't feel pain.

154
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,292
Die.

155
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,708
Die, scum!

156
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,208
You and that asshole…they're all the same!

157
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,708
How dare you treat women that way?
You've got some nerve!

158
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,500
The age of dicks is over.

159
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:35,917
Shithead.

160
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:02,042
Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here!

161
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey! Hey! Over here! Hey!

162
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,083
We're safe.

163
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,208
Kuroe, we made it.

164
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,708
Kuroe?

165
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,250
Hey, Kuroe!

166
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,333
Found one wounded woman in the car.

167
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,000
Requesting a rescue team urgently.

168
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,042
Urgent.
Yosuke Goto secured.

169
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,667
One wounded found.

170
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
Please…

171
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,083
make it through.

172
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,292
Keisuke!

173
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,458
Where is he? Keisuke! Keisuke!

174
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,417
What the hell is he doing?

175
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,667
Where is he?

176
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,042
No! Not that way!

177
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,000
What's going on?

178
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,833
What a racket out there.

179
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,042
Keisuke!

180
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,208
Keisuke!

181
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,917
Iwao?

182
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,292
Keisuke! Keisuke!

183
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,917
Keisuke!

184
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,250
Keisuke!

185
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,667
Keisuke! Keisuke, Keisuke, Keisuke!

186
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,000
Where are you hiding?

187
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,750
Come back to us!

188
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,042
Keisuke!

189
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,500
What are you talking about?
Keisuke isn't here!

190
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,917
Liar.

191
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,500
You've been meeting him in secret!

192
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,917
You manipulated him, didn't you? Huh?

193
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,917
Let him go!

194
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,917
Huh?

195
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,125
-Please, stop acting stupid.
-Go home already!

196
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,167
Don't think you'll always get your way!

197
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,458
That's right! Get out of here!

198
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,458
Yeah, get lost!

199
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,625
What will you do if I kill him?

200
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:54,708
Let him go!

201
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,542
I-I'll show you where Keisuke is.

202
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
So, please…

203
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,500
J-Just…

204
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:12,333
don't kill my grandson.

205
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,375
I don't want… any more killing.

206
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,583
Show me the way.

207
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,542
Currently crossing the Kuge Bridge

208
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,708
and heading north-northeast.

209
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,125
The Goto family altar
is deep within Kuge Village.

210
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,458
We may not make it in time for the ritual.

211
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,083
There's only one way in or out.

212
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,875
Reschedule entry time?

213
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,250
Movement

214
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,167
There should be a path
through the forest around here.

215
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,333
If you go through here,

216
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,083
you should be able to get there without
passing through the Goto residence.

217
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,167
The Goto family altar

218
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,833
There should be a forest path
to the northwest. Go through there.

219
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,458
Roger.

220
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,500
Get out.

221
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,333
Yosuke?

222
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,875
I knew it.

223
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,042
It's you, Yosuke.

224
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,458
Mom?

225
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,625
I'm sorry.

226
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,708
I put you through so much.

227
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,333
I understand.

228
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,292
You didn't have a choice.

229
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:30,208
But… I never thought I'd see you again.

230
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,250
Yosuke…

231
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,333
You're all grown up.

232
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,333
Mom.

233
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,042
My brother…

234
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,708
is planning to die.

235
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,792
Listen.

236
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,042
You're up against a monster
who wiped out a whole squad.

237
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,625
If you're attacked, respond immediately.

238
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,958
If you hesitate, you will die.

239
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:29,958
It's through here.

240
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,375
Are you okay?

241
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,458
Yeah.

242
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,583
One suspect spotted at destination.

243
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,250
Neutralize them.

244
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,333
Freeze!

245
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,750
One old woman. No one else.

246
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,792
They may be hiding nearby.

247
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,833
-Search.
-Roger.

248
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,625
Oh, dear. Some crazy stuff going on.

249
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,958
-Please don't move.
-What?

250
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,542
Don't move!

251
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,083
I'm sorry. I can't hear so well.

252
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,125
Where did you come from?

253
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,625
Did you see the bats?

254
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,333
There are a lot of bats here.

255
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,792
My son Taichi got arrested by the police.

256
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,208
Do you know where he is?

257
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:56,083
If you do, there's something
I want you to give him.

258
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,375
Also…

259
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,542
did you see the falcon?

260
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,625
Whatever.
Just stay here.

261
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,292
We're putting you under our protection.

262
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,583
Oh, okay. I understand.

263
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,208
H-Hey, you!

264
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,417
What happened?
Commander, respond.

265
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,708
Respond!

266
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,667
Bhujangasana
Cobra Pose

267
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,708
Pull your chest up toward the sky

268
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,458
and keep taking deep breaths.

269
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,792
Your body and mind connect.

270
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,250
We're human too.

271
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,292
Not trash…

272
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,500
Not bugs…

273
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,625
Not livestock.

274
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:21,625
We're just humans, living modestly.

275
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,583
And yet…

276
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,958
the Goto family…

277
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:34,458
They make fools out of us.

278
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:44,458
They trample over us
like random weeds that grow anywhere.

279
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,167
We're human!

280
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,500
We'll teach them that!

281
00:33:56,042 --> 00:34:00,667
That's right!

282
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,375
Kuni…

283
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,792
I don't want to.

284
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:12,708
If we do that…
we'll be killed just like Sabu.

285
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:20,042
No, you'll all be killed. Got it?

286
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,083
Stop being such a coward!

287
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,917
Hey, stand up.
Stand up, dammit! Stand up!

288
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,250
A-Are you…Takeru?

289
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,917
My resolve is firm.

290
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,292
Let's do it.

291
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,542
Don't touch Mashiro!

292
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,458
Out of the way, Mashiro.

293
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,125
Mashiro, move!

294
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,000
Please, get away from there.

295
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,542
That man… is trying to eat you.

296
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:58,917
Keisuke, shoot!

297
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,250
Shirogane.

298
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,125
What's wrong with eating people?

299
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,583
Eating and being eaten.

300
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,417
It's the curse of staying alive.

301
00:37:56,292 --> 00:38:00,208
Nothing more and nothing less.
It's just how it must be.

302
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:04,042
That's what this festival is for, Keisuke.

303
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,375
God is here, before your eyes.

304
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,500
Don't worry.

305
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,958
These are just slabs of meat.

306
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:41,500
Can you kill a god
as you would kill yourself?

307
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,625
Continue.

308
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,042
Continue without thinking about anything.

309
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,375
Keisuke!
What are you doing?

310
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,667
Shoot, Keisuke!

311
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,750
Weren't you going to put an end to it?

312
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,042
Shut up, Officer.
You don't have to tell me.

313
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,167
Shirogane!

314
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,292
Keisuke.

315
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:19,667
What…

316
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,542
What did you just do?

317
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,125
-Keisuke! You bastard!
-Keisuke! Keisuke!

318
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,708
Mashiro.

319
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,042
…ve.

320
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,167
Live…

321
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:13,958
Live.

322
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,125
Live… live…

323
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:55,917
Mashiro.

324
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,833
Mashiro?

325
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:01,458
Yeah. That's her name.

326
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:10,583
I hope that she will live strong and pure,
with a pure white heart.

327
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:15,167
You took forever to get here…

328
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,167
Right? So, I came up with it on my own.

329
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,500
Mashiro.

330
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,250
Hey, Mashiro. He's calling you.

331
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,750
Hey, Daigo.

332
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,667
You're a father now.

333
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,458
Yeah.

334
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,583
-Look, it's your daddy.
-Mashiro.

335
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:52,833
-He's finally here.
-Mashiro.

336
00:44:55,667 --> 00:45:00,792
-Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! I'm sorry.
-Oh! Hey, you made her cry.

337
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:05,083
-Aww. There, there. It's okay.
-There, there. There, there.

338
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:08,125
-Okay.
-You're okay.

339
00:45:55,833 --> 00:46:01,167
I'll make a world where you can live.

340
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,667
Okay, Shirogane?

341
