1
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,624
That was my favorite
when I was a kid.

2
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:49,692
Get ready.

3
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,275
I’m gonna eat your banana now!

4
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,536
Oh, yes!

5
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,181
Ah, yes!

6
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,414
Ah, yes!

7
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:17,942
Oh, Bruce!

8
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,402
So good!

9
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,017
Who’s Bruce?

10
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,257
The name of my penis.

11
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:25,541
Why Bruce?

12
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:27,979
Bruce. Bruce Banner.

13
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,841
Because when he gets worked up,

14
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:31,305
he grows hard.

15
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:32,454
Like the Hulk!

16
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:34,284
Good thing he doesn’t turn

17
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,602
green.

18
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:49,565
Wait, wait, wait.

19
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:50,907
Huh?

20
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,611
Okay.

21
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,711
Oh, yes!

22
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,933
Oh, yes!

23
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,648
Oh, yes!

24
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,199
- Yeah!
- Oh, yes!

25
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,659
Oh, yes!

26
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,829
Oh, yes!

27
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,015
Oh, yes!

28
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,564
Oh, yes!

29
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,463
Oh, yes!

30
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,633
Oh, yes!

31
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,262
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

32
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,639
Oh, yeah!

33
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,812
Oh, yes!

34
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,236
- Yeah.
- Yes.

35
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,342
Oh, yes!

36
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,433
Oh, yes!

37
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,897
Oh, yes!

38
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:57,194
Thank goodness.

39
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,023
So you like it rough, huh?

40
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:02,130
Yup!

41
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:22,705
Hey!

42
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,476
Who are you imagining this time?

43
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,248
I'm having sex with
VMX stars, Dad.

44
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:31,669
Really?

45
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,466
You don’t know, Dad?

46
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,479
I’ve been using your
VMX subscription.

47
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,608
Uh…

48
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:43,575
how many rounds?

49
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,287
Just two.

50
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,766
I can’t go all out.

51
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:48,189
You know why.

52
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Susan, right?

53
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,094
She really makes you feel guilty.

54
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,923
She’ll guilt-trip you even more.

55
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,247
And you two are getting married.

56
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,435
I don’t know, Dad.

57
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,878
Every time I’m with Susan,

58
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,729
I just want to,

59
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,076
you know, make love with her.

60
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,078
Her lips—they’re great to kiss.

61
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,837
Her neck—it’s nice to…

62
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,214
smell.

63
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,067
- And her…
- Whoops!

64
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:16,777
- Okay! Okay!
- Brrrr!

65
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,753
Stop it. Stop it, son.

66
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:19,821
Easy, easy. I get it.

67
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:20,846
I already understand.

68
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:21,972
You're still on about it.

69
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,352
But she said everything should
wait until after the wedding,

70
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,295
that we should save
it for the honeymoon.

71
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,215
So all my fantasies,
I keep them in my dreams.

72
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:32,890
Then hurry it up already.

73
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,333
Why is your wedding

74
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:35,865
still set for next year?

75
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,149
I want a grandchild already.

76
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,440
And I want to enjoy that

77
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:40,801
VMX subscription on my own.

78
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,675
Dad, remember?

79
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:46,431
I need to graduate from law first
before Susan and I get married.

80
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,869
You’ll pass. I’m sure.

81
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,084
You’ve been doing that for years,
repeating it again and again.

82
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,677
Actually, you’ve practically
memorized the law.

83
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,543
Ah, uh…

84
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,175
I just don’t want to prioritize—

85
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:00,388
over my goals.

86
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,473
Son…

87
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,358
not that I’m pushing you.

88
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,134
That’s called,

89
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,355
“mani-feasting.”

90
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:09,914
Uh, Dad,

91
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
maybe you mean…

92
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:12,482
manifesting?

93
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,599
Mani-feasting.

94
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:17,350
Because you’re feasting on
all the clits you see on VMX.

95
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:20,841
Wow, Dad.

96
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,158
You’re a comedian now?

97
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:23,252
Gen-Z level!

98
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:24,609
You unbelievable kid.

99
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,258
You took so long to graduate,
I became a Gen-Z.

100
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,616
When are you really graduating?

101
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,952
I want a grandchild already.

102
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,293
Good thing Susan’s doing well.

103
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,020
All rise.

104
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,299
Let's stand.

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,433
the honorable judge

106
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,139
Judge Lapuz, presiding.

107
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,660
Be seated.

108
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:54,904
Take a seat.

109
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,545
Read the verdict.

110
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:03,461
This court has determined,

111
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:07,240
that the accused, Mr. Rogelio Alfaro,

112
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:08,964
also known as Boy Kindat,

113
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:10,884
is guilty

114
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,557
of selling minors.

115
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,450
He is hereby sentenced,

116
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:19,883
to ten years of
imprisonment per victim.

117
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,886
This court is adjourned.

118
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:24,744
We’ll fight this.

119
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:25,846
Just trust me.

120
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:26,931
We’ll fight, okay?

121
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,507
You shameless lawyer.

122
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,636
You’ll pay for this.

123
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,193
Let’s go.

124
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,512
Sorry, love.

125
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,371
Kiss me.

126
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,143
I got stuck in traffic.

127
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,920
Someone was crossing.

128
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,071
A motorcycle hit him.

129
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,646
That’s why it got traffic.

130
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,439
You said you were close?

131
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,548
Yeah,

132
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:11,089
but I was the one who got hit.

133
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,824
Don’t get mad now.

134
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,438
It’ll ruin our celebration.

135
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,996
Wait,

136
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,057
is it a double celebration?

137
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,919
Are you graduating for good?

138
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,786
Uh, what was your case again?

139
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,817
Anti-trafficking.

140
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,533
That’s tough.

141
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,243
You really are an
amazing lawyer.

142
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,560
That’s why you
graduated before me.

143
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:39,597
Daddy always reminds me of that
at the end of every school year.

144
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:41,694
He always says,

145
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:43,575
he wished we graduated together.

146
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:46,628
You know what?

147
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,844
I’m actually impressed whenever
your dad asks you things.

148
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,230
If you already graduated?

149
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,340
Even that second year of
yours when you didn’t graduate?

150
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,116
He really thought I got pregnant.

151
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,552
Dad was so excited that time.

152
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,138
Why was that the first
reason you thought of?

153
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,308
You know, my mom almost kicked
me out because she said I was sinful?

154
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,519
At least now, you won’t think
of any diversionary tactic—

155
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:10,045
I’m still not graduating.

156
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
Huh?

157
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,722
But Dean gave me a makeup test.

158
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,946
Maybe you can help me review.

159
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,408
I really want to, love, but…

160
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,994
I’m still handling a case.

161
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
But fine,

162
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,539
I’ll find time tonight.

163
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,207
Um...

164
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,229
No need, love.
You’ll just lose sleep.

165
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,670
I’ll ask Jim instead.

166
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,222
You're always sticking up
for that Jim's monkey business, huh?

167
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,677
You know how that guy is.

168
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,846
- But okay,
- No, he's good.

169
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,855
if you think he can help you,

170
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,932
that’s fine.

171
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,875
What matters is you
graduate this year.

172
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,440
Hmmm, no.

173
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,067
I don't want to get daddy's
hopes up again.

174
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,486
Whatever the test result is,

175
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,363
I’ll be the one to tell him.

176
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,572
Order!

177
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you ordering?

178
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,283
I object!

179
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,288
Ah, uh…

180
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,706
same as always.

181
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,542
But can you give
us some wine first?

182
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,162
Just to ease the stress.

183
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,844
Careful, love.

184
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,601
So it’s really just
for stress, huh?

185
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,019
Seems like it worked.

186
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
You’re too much.

187
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,309
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Careful, love. Careful.

188
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,669
- Hey!
- Good evening, Uncle.

189
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,839
Looks like he’s had a lot, huh?

190
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,031
He had two wines.

191
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,131
Oh really?

192
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,574
Just two glasses then?

193
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,446
Two bottles.

194
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,453
He barely even ate.

195
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,117
Wait,

196
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,184
are you celebrating?

197
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,839
Is that right, son?

198
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:54,358
Yes.

199
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,417
Yes.

200
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,352
Huh. You’re celebrating?

201
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,297
Meaning you have
something to celebrate?

202
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,823
At last! My son!

203
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,096
Dad…

204
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,224
we’re getting married

205
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,664
by the end of the month.

206
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,537
- Wooh!
- Really?

207
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,498
You’re getting married?

208
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,193
And I’m finally
getting a grandchild?

209
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,453
Congratulations!

210
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,068
Congratulations!

211
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,821
Congratulations! At last!

212
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,965
Ah, uh…

213
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,033
- Uncle, I’ll go ahead.
- Oh, okay.

214
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:29,302
Wait, just call me
Daddy instead.

215
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:29,953
- Daddy it is.
- Daddy Red.

216
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,638
- Sorry, Daddy Red.
- Yes, Daddy.

217
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,663
Uhmm, Love.

218
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,071
I’ll just call you later, okay?

219
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,709
- Bye, I love you.
- Okay, love.

220
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,635
Come on. Let’s go.
Geez...

221
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,092
I thought I’d pass out.

222
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,256
Come on.

223
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:46,472
My son.

224
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,007
At last! Wooh!
Finally, something!

225
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,812
Love…

226
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,523
your sketchbook,

227
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:00,633
you left it in the car.

228
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,777
Susan.

229
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,533
Oops.

230
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,285
It fell.

231
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,497
Let me get it for you.

232
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,623
Okay.

233
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,952
Oh, yes.

234
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,918
Oh, yes.

235
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,503
Oh, yes.

236
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,849
Hey!

237
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,688
- Dad.
- Seriously?

238
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,012
Who’s that? VMX?

239
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:34,116
Ah, no.

240
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,141
Uh, Susan.

241
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,650
Really, huh? Susan?

242
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,165
Susan’s calling.

243
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,530
Mhmm.

244
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,962
Woah! Wait!

245
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,064
- If you come closer, I might snip that.
- Hey, hey, hey.

246
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,254
Sorry, Dad. Sorry.

247
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,501
The sausage downstairs might get burned.

248
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,140
Good morning, Love!

249
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,852
Love, your sketchbook—
you left it in the car last night.

250
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,405
Yeah. Uh, about last night.

251
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,730
- Uhhm.
- Also about

252
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,215
why I called.

253
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,737
Sorry, Love, if I got surprised
that our wedding got moved earlier.

254
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,073
But Love, I’m fine with it.

255
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,867
I actually want it so that
when we finally get married,

256
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,584
I can give you the
virginity I’ve kept safe.

257
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:28,933
You mean,

258
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,040
we’re finally doing
what I told Dad?

259
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,249
Yes.

260
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,543
That’s why I already
set an appointment

261
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:36,403
for our wedding venue.

262
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,273
- When?
- Today!

263
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,431
- Today?
- Yes, today!

264
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:41,479
Right now?

265
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:42,513
What?

266
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,635
Echo?

267
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,845
I said today!

268
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,473
That’s why I’m waking you up.
Come on, love!

269
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,296
I’m going there
now to pick you up.

270
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:05,344
Yes, love?

271
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,036
- I’m going to shower now.
- Good!

272
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:08,431
I’ve been here for a while.

273
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:09,459
And if you think

274
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:12,324
I won’t be mad at you for being late
just because you called me "love,"

275
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,791
you’re wrong!

276
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,293
Jim! Jim! Uh…

277
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:17,653
Is our appointment today?

278
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:20,779
You set this yourself.
You messaged me last night!

279
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:23,773
Bro. It’s rare that I
give a free law tutorial.

280
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,262
I’m only doing this
because you’re my friend.

281
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,639
So, do you even
want to graduate?

282
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,849
Of course, but…

283
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,226
Bro, don’t get mad, okay.

284
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,189
Can we just do
the tutorial online?

285
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,357
- What?
- Hi, ma’am sir!

286
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,061
- Here are your complimentary drinks!
- Hi!

287
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:42,630
Thank you so much!

288
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,156
- Thank you.
- Enjoy!

289
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,106
Hi, ma’am, sir.
Good afternoon.

290
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,174
- Hi, good afternoon.
- Sorry, I’m late.

291
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,831
- Hello.
- Sir.

292
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,447
Sir! Sir.

293
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,835
- Love.
- Sir.

294
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,295
Good afternoon, sir.

295
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:00,667
Good afternoon!

296
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,465
Ma’am, here you go.

297
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,512
So, we actually have a lot of
choices for the wedding venue.

298
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,097
Our wedding isn’t that big.

299
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,433
A small space will be enough.

300
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,602
Let me just talk to my fiancé.

301
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,852
Okay, sure ma’am.

302
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,063
Ah, here ma’am,

303
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:18,922
- I’ll just leave this here.
- Ah, thank you.

304
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:20,607
Uh. Sir.

305
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,530
I’ll leave this with you, sir!

306
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:24,969
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

307
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:30,717
Love, I feel like a garden
setup would look nice for our wedding?

308
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,662
If you disagree
with an argument…

309
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,080
What will you shout?

310
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,291
I object!

311
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:36,757
Huh?

312
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,075
- Correct!
- Yes!

313
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,711
Love!

314
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:42,006
Why don’t you like a garden?

315
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,129
Huh?

316
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:44,294
What garden?

317
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,758
Wait.

318
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,388
I don’t think you’re talking to me?

319
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:51,972
Hey, Edd!

320
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,281
Sorry.

321
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:54,358
Ask me later.

322
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,541
- What?
- Not you.

323
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:01,674
Then who are you talking to?

324
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:03,543
Is that a girl?

325
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,580
Huh? No.

326
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,710
It’s Jim.

327
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:08,969
Oh.

328
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,951
Jim. Say hi to Susan.

329
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,500
Hi, Susan!

330
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,122
Long time!

331
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,082
I’m just having Jim review me
for the makeup test.

332
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,584
Edd!

333
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,045
I know your make-up
test is important to you.

334
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,755
It is for me, too.

335
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,301
But this wedding preparation
is also important to me.

336
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,804
Even if I know you only used
this as a reason for Daddy Red,

337
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,348
so he’d stop bugging
you about graduating.

338
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,359
But please.

339
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,103
I just need a
little cooperation.

340
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,063
That’s all I’m asking.

341
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,523
I’m sorry, Love.

342
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,483
It won’t happen again,

343
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:45,942
I promise.

344
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,324
Do you want us to talk
about the honeymoon, too?

345
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,824
Yeah.

346
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,578
What color do you
want me to wear?

347
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,705
- Red or black?
- Red.

348
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,248
Black sounds better.

349
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,541
- Jim!
- Jim!

350
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,714
Love.

351
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,800
What motif should we
pick for the wedding?

352
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,135
Old rose, or burgundy?

353
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,394
What’s the difference between
a subpoena and a summons?

354
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,900
What are you doing here, Dad?

355
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,903
I’m talking to Bruce,
maybe he needs coaching.

356
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,685
Are you two making a baby soon?

357
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,549
Bruce?

358
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,262
Bruce, rise and shine.

359
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,764
Hey. Hey, wake up!

360
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Wake up!

361
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:05,939
Wake up!

362
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,632
Shit!

363
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,261
Let’s see if you won't
wake up with porn videos.

364
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,748
Here we go.

365
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,084
Okay. Here we go.

366
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,433
Come on, Bruce.

367
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:28,766
I believe in you.

368
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,051
Yeah.

369
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:36,808
Jen looks amazing, wow.

370
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:39,910
Come on, Bruce.

371
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,267
Are you having
problems with intimacy?

372
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,877
Or do you want to make
your love life more exciting?

373
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,396
Well.

374
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,232
This is the answer
to your problems.

375
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,734
Livin, Libido, Loca.

376
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,402
Live into your desires.

377
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,272
If it’s anything related to sex,

378
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,157
we got it all for you.

379
00:26:57,872 --> 00:26:58,997
Like this.

380
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,342
You can even use
this in your ass.

381
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,789
Livin, Libido, Loca.

382
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,659
Where sex is life!

383
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:10,351
Jim?

384
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,934
That bastard.

385
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,695
Alright, here we go, Bruce.

386
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,013
You got this, come on.

387
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,224
Rise and shine!

388
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,769
Here we go, Bruce.

389
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,270
Go on.

390
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,522
Come on, Bruce.

391
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,316
Come on?

392
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,982
You're taking forever to
react to these videos, huh?

393
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,202
Bruce, seriously.

394
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,122
I’m finally going to
introduce you to Susan.

395
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,416
Now that the wedding is near?

396
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,098
- Hi, Love!
- Love.

397
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:03,832
Love, uh, you called?

398
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,638
What are you talking about?

399
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,978
I always call every morning.

400
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,854
But actually,

401
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,649
I wanted to invite
you to go shopping.

402
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,485
Today?

403
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,112
Why?

404
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,744
I can’t today, Love.

405
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,412
I’m not feeling well.

406
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:29,754
- I’m so stuffed up.
- Why?

407
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:33,865
What are you feeling?

408
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,798
Weak.

409
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,883
Oh really?

410
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,927
Okay, I’ll go by myself, Love.

411
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,846
Get well soon, okay?

412
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:45,457
I hope so.

413
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,243
Do you have findings now, Doc?

414
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,869
We do.

415
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:07,830
Wow, at last.

416
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,901
You’ve checked me ten times already.

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,377
We just want to make sure, Edd.

418
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,921
Have a seat.

419
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,632
Thank you, Doc.

420
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,969
Edd, don’t be shocked, okay?

421
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,847
You have erectile dysfunction.

422
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,410
What, Doc?

423
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,310
I don’t get it.

424
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:31,662
That’s how it is, Edd.

425
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,814
You won’t really
understand it right away.

426
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,025
But even at your age,

427
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,903
you can still have
erectile dysfunction.

428
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,570
No, Doc.

429
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:43,723
It’s the erection…
distemper that I don’t get.

430
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,635
- Erectile dysfunction.
- "Dysfunction."

431
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,162
It’s not erection distemper.

432
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,467
- Well, here’s the thing.
- Okay.

433
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,958
I’ll explain it to you.

434
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,197
Okay?

435
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:56,103
Erectile dysfunction

436
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,340
is the inability to
keep things firm

437
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,523
or to stay fully ready

438
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,465
down there on your penis,

439
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:08,237
which you need to
have for proper intimacy.

440
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,934
Wait, wait, Doc.

441
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,768
You mean,

442
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,521
I won’t be able to
get hard anymore?

443
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:15,897
Bruce won’t

444
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,191
stand up?

445
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,027
His name is Bruce?

446
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,738
Well, I’m sorry, Edd.

447
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:23,995
You’re right.

448
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,188
Bruce will remain soft.

449
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,002
How did I get this erection shit?

450
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,254
You know, Edd,

451
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,073
this usually happens
to older men.

452
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,635
In your case, this
is psychological.

453
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,888
It could be fear of intimacy

454
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,975
or fear of having sex.

455
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,562
It could also be due to
depression or general anxiety.

456
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,190
In short, it’s stress.

457
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,775
Let me ask you, Edd.

458
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:02,945
Have you been stressed lately?

459
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,446
Very much, Doc.

460
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,991
I’ve been thinking about a lot.

461
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,492
All at once.

462
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,659
Anyway,

463
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,995
there’s medication for that.

464
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,956
And you just need
three weeks of therapy.

465
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:18,627
Just make sure you take
all the meds I prescribe.

466
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,003
What?

467
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,254
Three weeks?

468
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:22,964
No way!

469
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,509
I'm getting married by
the end of the month.

470
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,137
Susan and I have been
waiting for our honeymoon.

471
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,055
Then this happens?

472
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Oh no.

473
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:34,368
I suggest you move
your wedding date first.

474
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,062
We need to finish the
three-week therapy.

475
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,607
And so Bruce can regain energy.

476
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,909
Can we maybe…

477
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,369
Uhmm.

478
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,288
Have another look?

479
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,876
- We’re looking at Bruce again?
- Yes.

480
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,961
Yes, in the ass?

481
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,880
Alright, I have findings now.

482
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,591
I’m really excited
for our wedding, Love.

483
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,011
And I’m sure nothing
can stop it, even lightning.

484
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
Oh, wait.

485
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,682
How are you?
What did they say your illness is?

486
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,059
I heard earlier
something wouldn’t get…

487
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:17,084
Goosebumps.

488
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,980
I can't get goosebumps.

489
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:21,565
Ah.

490
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,776
What’s the medicine for that?

491
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,527
Ah, uh…

492
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,321
I need to shave my hair first.

493
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:29,225
It’ll be fine when
it grows back.

494
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,242
Ah, love. How’s
our video coverage?

495
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:35,932
Ah, Love. I talked to
The Very Nice Print already.

496
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,249
They’re okay with our date,
but they’re a bit pricey.

497
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,297
But Love, it’s worth the price.

498
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:42,377
Because they said

499
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:45,880
they’re even better than the
ones who cover celebrity weddings.

500
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,855
That’s why they’re
called The Very Nice Print.

501
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,677
Yeah.

502
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,887
Oh right, Love.

503
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,144
About the venue.

504
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,932
What? What?

505
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,477
I want the venue
we visited before.

506
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,688
Ahh.

507
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,799
Alright, Love.
Ah, I’ll head out for a bit.

508
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Why?

509
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,366
Ah, Jim and I have
a review session.

510
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,660
- Yeah. Take care.
- Ahh, okay.

511
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:14,684
- Love you.
- I love you.

512
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,994
- I’ll call you later.
- Take care.

513
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,372
Take care, Edd.

514
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,663
So, you’re the one who said
‘mine’ to the goat’s eyelashes.

515
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,807
This is good, just 250,
and you’ll definitely enjoy.

516
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,559
Really?

517
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,293
No free taste?

518
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:42,065
There is.

519
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:44,670
Free taste, huh.

520
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,719
I like it!

521
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,197
Oh, shit!

522
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,375
This feels so good!

523
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:38,302
Oh, shit!

524
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,246
Oh, shit!

525
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,165
Shit!

526
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Shit!

527
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,542
Yes!

528
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,092
Here’s your free taste.

529
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,238
Oh, shit!

530
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Oh, shit!

531
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,710
Deeper!

532
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,493
Shit!

533
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,577
Go deeper!

534
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,023
Oh, shit!

535
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:24,889
Oh, shit!

536
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,165
Oh, shit!

537
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,377
Oh, shit!

538
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,503
Yes!

539
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,046
Yes!

540
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:44,976
Shit!

541
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,063
Oh, shit!

542
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:50,982
Oh, shit!

543
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:56,572
Oh, shit!

544
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Shit!

545
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,132
Deeper!

546
00:36:07,246 --> 00:36:09,375
Oh, shit!

547
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,378
Oh, shit!

548
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,798
Yes!

549
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,026
Oh, yes!

550
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,051
Jim!

551
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,219
Bro!

552
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,306
Bro, it’s true.

553
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,766
I watched your ad when I was…

554
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,394
Why didn’t you tell me?

555
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,423
I was embarrassed, bro.

556
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,757
You might think something weird.

557
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,336
Ma’am, are you okay?

558
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:37,943
Here,

559
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:38,988
one thousand.

560
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:42,114
- Keep the change.
- Oh, nice.

561
00:36:42,706 --> 00:36:43,707
Give it here.

562
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:44,732
There.

563
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:45,963
There.

564
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:47,739
Thank you.

565
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:48,882
Yes.

566
00:36:52,892 --> 00:36:54,268
Relax, bro.

567
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:56,431
Don't worry, I won't judge you.

568
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,384
I know what kind
of person you are.

569
00:36:58,669 --> 00:36:59,669
Businessman?

570
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,643
No,

571
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:03,092
pervert.

572
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:04,665
Wow, bro.

573
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:07,861
You really know me.

574
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:11,444
But seriously,

575
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,807
how did this happen?

576
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,345
I stopped being a lawyer, bro.

577
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:20,394
I wasn’t happy.

578
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,397
Then I thought,

579
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:23,899
I’ll just do business.

580
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:25,483
Something

581
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,985
that’s really in my heart,
what I truly know.

582
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,595
Like this— you already know

583
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:31,215
this is something I like.

584
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,783
- Wow.
- Wait.

585
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:34,910
Why did you even come here?

586
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I have a problem.

587
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,668
I can’t get hard anymore.

588
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,465
Oh my.

589
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,263
Just imagine,

590
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,709
Bruce is dead.

591
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:58,560
Like Frankenstein,

592
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:04,022
we’ll bring him back
to life with electricity.

593
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:06,774
Here we go.

594
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:08,652
We’ll charge it now.

595
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,840
Get ready,
this is the strongest charge.

596
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:16,409
Okay.

597
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:17,994
Three.

598
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:19,954
Two.

599
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:21,873
One.

600
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:26,962
Here we go.

601
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:29,298
It’s working.

602
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,587
Shit, why is it smoking? Wait, wait.

603
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:38,556
Hold on.

604
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,058
Don’t panic.

605
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,275
Shit.

606
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,451
Ouch.

607
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,036
You okay now?

608
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:04,666
How’s Bruce?

609
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:20,849
The wedding is near.

610
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:22,726
But he’s still like this.

611
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,438
I think I need to tell Susan.

612
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:27,855
Nothing is working

613
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,232
with what we’re doing.

614
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,292
Why don’t we just review
for your makeup test?

615
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,740
The wedding is
more important to me.

616
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,074
Susan.

617
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,160
Not that graduation.

618
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:43,005
It’s just Dad who
wanted that for me.

619
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:44,121
What I want

620
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,289
is fine arts.

621
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:46,708
I’m an artist.

622
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,961
I understand you, bro.

623
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,088
You know,

624
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,753
you actually have a point.

625
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,970
If the modern way isn’t working,

626
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,349
why don’t we try the
old school method?

627
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:15,694
I want to back out, Jim.

628
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:20,657
I feel something different
about this Tata Islaw.

629
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:23,346
Me too.

630
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:25,934
What if you finally get hard,

631
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:27,499
but it grow horns instead?

632
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,487
This place really feels like
it has something strange.

633
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,704
Let’s just go. Let’s leave.

634
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:34,705
Let’s go, let’s go.

635
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,091
- Are you here for treatment?
- No, no.

636
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:38,133
We’re healthy.

637
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,186
And we only eat
fresh food. Right?

638
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:41,713
- Yes, yes.
- Dad.

639
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,948
Do we have more patients?

640
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,557
Anyone to rub with oil?

641
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:46,592
We're done, dear.

642
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:48,094
You have no one left to rub.

643
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,134
You know what, bro.

644
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:52,265
There’s nothing to lose
if we try the treatment.

645
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:54,434
I heard Tata Islaw
is really good.

646
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,517
Of course. Right, dear?

647
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,960
Of course, Dad.

648
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,063
I thought we were healthy?

649
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:01,065
Fresh food only.

650
00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:03,026
This is fresh, bro.

651
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:04,694
Fresh, huh?

652
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:10,938
- What?
- I think I stepped on…

653
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,191
a dwarf’s house
having a birthday party,

654
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:14,434
that’s why it hurts.

655
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:17,765
- Go on, get treated.
- Oh, gosh.

656
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,499
- Come here.
- Go on,

657
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,001
- Let Tata Islaw treat you.
- No! No!

658
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,015
I got you.

659
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,541
- Come on, come on.
- Go ahead.

660
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,273
- We're healthy, right?
- Get inside!

661
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:26,966
No, don’t leave me.

662
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:28,284
- I got you.
- Stop.

663
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,922
It hurts.

664
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:35,017
It hurts.

665
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:50,698
Calm down, son.

666
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:53,034
What can I do for you?

667
00:41:55,995 --> 00:41:57,705
- The, uh—
- You don’t need to be shy.

668
00:41:58,247 --> 00:41:59,727
I’ve treated many
kinds of conditions.

669
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,585
I have long
experience in healing.

670
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,336
And most of all…

671
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,173
I take my work seriously.

672
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:08,758
That’s good to hear.

673
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:14,097
I can't get a boner.

674
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,311
Alright, I’ll leave now.

675
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:23,580
Oh. No, wait, sorry, son.

676
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:26,285
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

677
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,442
Ah, forgive me.

678
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:29,155
Can I see it?

679
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:30,947
Oh no.
I’d rather not.

680
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,382
I really need to see it,

681
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:33,825
so we can find out

682
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:36,118
if there is any dark
element that may be

683
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,662
the source of your problem.

684
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:39,535
Go on. Show it.

685
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:41,714
- Bring it out.
- Is that so?

686
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:44,751
Alright.

687
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:56,055
I respect elders but...

688
00:42:57,765 --> 00:42:59,726
Screw you!
I’m going home!

689
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:02,949
Oh, oh. Sorry, sorry.

690
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,416
I couldn’t help myself.

691
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:08,985
Because you actually
don’t need to show me that.

692
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:10,695
You get fooled so easily.

693
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,155
Sorry.

694
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,657
I just found it funny.

695
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:16,951
Go straight on me.

696
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:18,911
Can you help me?

697
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:20,079
Of course.

698
00:43:21,456 --> 00:43:22,457
Here?

699
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,334
- Is this the part that hurts?
- No, no, no, here.

700
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:26,835
- Where?
- I’ll point it out,

701
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,320
Where’s the, uh…

702
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,174
- This one?
- Oil? Don’t you have oil there, so…

703
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:34,052
Okay, wait a bit.
My oil is right here.

704
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:39,098
- Here it is.
- Wait, wait.

705
00:43:39,277 --> 00:43:40,324
Is this safe?

706
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:41,893
- Of course.
- You sure?

707
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:46,229
- Okay.
- Right?

708
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:48,608
Ah, that hurts.

709
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:52,779
Why on the neck?
Do you want me to just teach you?

710
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,449
- Uhmm, are you okay?
- I’ll show you how.

711
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:10,463
Did you also step
on a dwarf’s house?

712
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,673
Huh? Why do you think that?

713
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:14,634
It’s really swollen.

714
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,561
What are you checking?

715
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:40,177
I’ll put it in.

716
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:48,871
I know a quick method.

717
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:50,288
And effective.

718
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:52,583
- To fix that.
- Okay.

719
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:54,919
At my age.

720
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:56,754
I’m 68.

721
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:58,633
Turning 69.

722
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:00,993
And my, uh, manhood
doesn’t rise anymore.

723
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,260
But because of this,

724
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,404
My manhood

725
00:47:06,472 --> 00:47:08,014
became very hard.

726
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:09,015
This…

727
00:47:09,183 --> 00:47:10,518
is the wood of…

728
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:11,953
boner!

729
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:14,355
And how is that going
to make my penis hard?

730
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,250
You just insert this wooden
boner up your ass.

731
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:19,609
No! You’re not
putting that in my ass!

732
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,696
Oh, there’s another
way if you want?

733
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,990
Really?

734
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:26,826
- What is it?
- Suck it!

735
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,327
No! I don’t want to!

736
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:30,312
- It’s easy! Just suck it!
- I don’t want to!

737
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:31,705
- Suck it!
- No!

738
00:47:31,706 --> 00:47:32,914
- Suck it!
- I said no!

739
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:34,517
- Suck it!
- No!

740
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:35,918
Suck it!

741
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,425
I’m not putting
that in my mouth!

742
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:44,034
- I’ll put this in your mouth.
- No! No!

743
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,176
It’s easy!

744
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:47,138
- It'll be very fast.
- That’s disgusting!

745
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,519
So, what? You like that?

746
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:55,562
Damn you!

747
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:57,527
I’m about to cum.

748
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:59,482
Say my name, say
my name! I like it!

749
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:00,618
There, you like that?

750
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:01,776
Jim!

751
00:48:02,945 --> 00:48:04,238
Jim!

752
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:06,406
Wait.

753
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:07,950
Why does your
voice sound so deep?

754
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:09,159
That’s not me!

755
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:10,184
Jim, Jim.

756
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:11,619
What are you doing?

757
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:12,872
Jim, let’s go. Let’s go!

758
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,999
- Jim, Jim, Jim.
- Dad!

759
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Dad!

760
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:19,878
What did they do to my daughter?

761
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:20,903
- [unintelligible]
- Hey!

762
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:23,883
- Dad, what did they do to you?
- What did they do to you?

763
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,056
Damn this life!

764
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:36,604
Miss, miss! Don’t do that!

765
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:37,897
- Hey!
- Let go!

766
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:39,481
Don’t interfere!

767
00:48:39,523 --> 00:48:40,565
My life is useless!
I’m all alone!

768
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:42,903
- You don’t understand!
- Give me the gun!

769
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,464
Don’t! Don’t! Don’t waste your life!

770
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:49,213
- Give it to me!
- You don’t know what I’m feeling.

771
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:55,483
You have a heart,
but you can’t feel anything!

772
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,999
I have a penis!

773
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:00,544
But I can't get a boner.

774
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:02,087
- There!
- Right?

775
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:04,256
- That’s it!
- Yeah! There!

776
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:05,481
- That’s right!
- That’s right!

777
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:06,841
Give me a hug!

778
00:49:08,928 --> 00:49:10,304
Thank you!

779
00:49:11,764 --> 00:49:12,764
You know,

780
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:16,727
it’s been a long time since

781
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:19,688
a man cared for me like this.

782
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,233
It’s okay.

783
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:23,525
Just…

784
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:24,860
don’t do that again.

785
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:28,113
You know…

786
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:29,865
I’m Mariposa, by the way.

787
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:31,199
Okay.

788
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,450
You,

789
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:33,536
what’s your name?

790
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:35,787
Call me Edd.

791
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,842
Sorry, sorry. I have to leave.

792
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:51,970
I’ll take this, okay?

793
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:57,809
Your wallet.

794
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:09,708
Thank you, bro.

795
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:11,322
Take care, take care.

796
00:50:18,622 --> 00:50:19,622
Hey, Love.

797
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,250
Heart-shaped cake.

798
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:35,525
Sorry.

799
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:36,598
Please,

800
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:38,225
don’t be mad anymore.

801
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:39,977
Don’t be mad?

802
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:45,065
Edd, my eyes are turning
white waiting for you here.

803
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:48,360
And why are your clothes dirty?

804
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:51,405
Why are you full of mud?

805
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,575
Sorry, Love. I just…

806
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:56,494
saved someone.

807
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,206
Saved?

808
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,500
Who did you save?

809
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:05,794
Maybe you saved her
because she’s sexy?

810
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:07,546
Pretty?

811
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:08,935
Big boobs?

812
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:10,305
Huh? No.

813
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,635
It was a… goat!

814
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:14,345
I saved a goat.

815
00:51:14,845 --> 00:51:15,930
It fell into a, uh,

816
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,389
fell into a…

817
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:19,266
cliff!

818
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:21,310
It was muddy.

819
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:22,477
Poor thing.

820
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:26,899
Edd, I’ve been waiting for you.

821
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:29,652
I’ve been calling you,
you’re not answering.

822
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,445
Not even a text!

823
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:34,240
But Jim— you’re
always with Jim.

824
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:36,200
Why don’t you two get married?

825
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:39,911
Do you even want to marry me?

826
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:41,413
Yes, yes, Love.

827
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:45,626
We’ll go back to the bakeshop, Love.

828
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:49,629
Love, love!

829
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:52,383
Wait, wait, wait!

830
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:01,162
There, just turn right.

831
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:03,936
Good thing we’re
getting catering here too.

832
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:05,997
I thought you
didn’t like it here.

833
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,690
Yeah, turns out
it’s really good.

834
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:10,150
That's why I made
arrangements for the food, Love.

835
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,653
I’m sure you’ll be
happy with me here.

836
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:14,363
I want to make it up to you.

837
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:16,073
Alright, let’s see.

838
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,872
Where can I park?

839
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:26,875
Uhm…

840
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:29,712
there, there on the left side.

841
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:31,213
Yeah, it’s far.

842
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,341
So you won’t get stressed,

843
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,844
I'll park the car,
and you go inside.

844
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:38,108
Why?

845
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:39,593
Have you seen your wallet?

846
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,308
Do you have your license?

847
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:43,975
I don’t.

848
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:45,920
I can’t remember
where I left it.

849
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:47,884
But it’s just around the corner.

850
00:52:48,314 --> 00:52:50,482
I don't think I'll be charged
for Republic Act 143...

851
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:54,653
- Republic Act 4136, Section 19.
- Yeah.

852
00:52:54,678 --> 00:52:57,972
You are not allowed to drive
a vehicle without a license.

853
00:52:58,157 --> 00:52:59,157
I know that.

854
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,826
You just beat me to it.

855
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:03,494
You know what?

856
00:53:04,038 --> 00:53:05,664
You go ahead inside.

857
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,207
Talk to them first.

858
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,960
I’ll just park the car.

859
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:11,836
Okay.

860
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:13,129
Hurry, okay?

861
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:14,298
I’m excited.

862
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,218
I’m sure you're gonna
be happy with everything.

863
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:20,846
I’ll be absolved from
all of my sins to you.

864
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:38,238
Sir Edd!

865
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,698
Good thing you came back.

866
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,033
Yes, yes.

867
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:43,117
We came back for
your catering services.

868
00:53:43,142 --> 00:53:44,811
Perfect timing, Sir.

869
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,090
Edd!

870
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:49,109
- Whoa, whoa!
- Sir!

871
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,768
Edd!

872
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,543
- Mariposa?
- Edd?

873
00:53:57,072 --> 00:53:58,323
Susan!

874
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,255
Who is that woman?

875
00:54:06,185 --> 00:54:07,217
She?

876
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:09,036
- She’s, uh, uhhm…
- Edd.

877
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:10,147
Your wallet.

878
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,326
You left it last night.

879
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:14,255
Maybe you want it back.

880
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:15,549
Right?

881
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:17,319
A goat, huh?

882
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,690
What a beautiful goat, Edd.

883
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:21,782
So sexy.

884
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,210
So fair-skinned.

885
00:54:24,252 --> 00:54:25,420
And big boobs too.

886
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:27,289
Edd, is she your fiancée?

887
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:28,713
- Yes.
- Oh.

888
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:29,789
Okay.

889
00:54:30,305 --> 00:54:32,391
I’m Attorney Susan.

890
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,523
R. Lucas.

891
00:54:34,548 --> 00:54:36,626
The one who was
supposed to marry…

892
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:38,487
…Edd.

893
00:54:39,454 --> 00:54:40,497
So you know me know?

894
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:43,117
Love, love, love wait!

895
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:44,445
Why?

896
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:52,938
Oh, pick up.

897
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:00,236
Son,

898
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:01,572
you have a problem, right?

899
00:55:03,323 --> 00:55:04,323
Tell me.

900
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,577
You know I have a
very wide understanding.

901
00:55:07,035 --> 00:55:08,161
We can talk about it.

902
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,288
I’ll handle it.

903
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,750
Well, Dad…

904
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:16,782
I can’t get—

905
00:55:16,807 --> 00:55:19,142
Can’t get away from
your low grades again?

906
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:20,532
Damn it, son.

907
00:55:20,657 --> 00:55:22,617
Don’t tell me you’re
still not graduating law?

908
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:24,553
No, Dad. That’s not
what I was going to say.

909
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:26,053
What did you say?

910
00:55:26,638 --> 00:55:27,931
What I meant was,

911
00:55:28,432 --> 00:55:29,752
that’s not what
I’m trying to say.

912
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,350
Then what is it?

913
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:33,728
Dad.

914
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,001
- I can’t get my—
- You can’t get—

915
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:39,695
Susan’s been
putting up with you, huh?

916
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:41,277
That’s it, she’s fed up.
She snapped.

917
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:42,361
She ran out of patience.

918
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:43,364
Damn you.

919
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:44,829
Maybe the wedding
won’t push through?

920
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,800
We’ll be humiliated
in front of our friends.

921
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,077
What? No.
The wedding is pushing through.

922
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:50,537
Oh, very well then.

923
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:51,704
So what’s the problem?

924
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:53,997
Nothing. It’s okay.

925
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,333
It’s okay now, Dad.

926
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,720
See? That’s what I told you.
You bounce back fast.

927
00:55:57,846 --> 00:56:00,746
I told you,
every problem can be resolved.

928
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:01,856
We’ll talk it out.

929
00:56:01,882 --> 00:56:03,342
I understand everything.

930
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:08,471
Thank you, Dad.

931
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:09,723
You're welcome, my son.

932
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:13,684
Thank you for the advice.

933
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:15,520
- Thank you.
- You’re the best, Dad.

934
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:16,562
I know, right?

935
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:17,606
Thank you, son.

936
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:20,858
Of course.

937
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:30,160
Hello, Susan?

938
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:31,994
Can we talk?

939
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:49,804
Dear.

940
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:01,817
You know what, dear?

941
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:03,485
When you’re sad,

942
00:57:04,695 --> 00:57:05,696
Edd gets sad too.

943
00:57:08,907 --> 00:57:10,075
And when Edd is sad,

944
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:13,494
I get sad as well.

945
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:17,332
We have a problem, Uncle.

946
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,458
Problem?

947
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:22,671
Why? What did my son do?

948
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:30,137
I caught him.

949
00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:33,557
A woman was on top of him.

950
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:39,021
That kid…

951
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:41,355
Oh dear,

952
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:43,025
let me be the one
to apologize to you.

953
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,778
He really has foolishness
and stupidity in him,

954
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,030
that son of mine.

955
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:50,649
But there's one thing I know.

956
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
He loves you.

957
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:55,328
So whatever it is that you saw,

958
00:57:55,353 --> 00:57:56,353
well…

959
00:57:56,747 --> 00:57:57,789
maybe there’s a reason.

960
00:57:57,998 --> 00:57:58,998
Or…

961
00:57:59,124 --> 00:58:00,375
an acceptable reason.

962
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:02,920
I hope so too, Uncle.

963
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,381
I hope you can fix it.

964
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:09,526
If you didn’t know,

965
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:11,845
we also went through something
before, me and Edd’s mom.

966
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:14,473
But we overcame it,

967
00:58:14,806 --> 00:58:17,267
because love
prevailed between us.

968
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:19,477
So if,

969
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:21,646
if you love him,

970
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:24,149
fight for him.

971
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:28,958
Do you think, Uncle...

972
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:34,785
should I still fight for
what Edd and I have?

973
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:36,661
You know,

974
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:38,038
I’m sure

975
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,039
he also regrets

976
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,583
whatever he did.

977
00:58:42,668 --> 00:58:44,336
And I’m very, very sure,

978
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:47,297
he’s really sad right now.

979
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:49,261
Let’s celebrate!

980
00:58:50,008 --> 00:58:51,747
Cheers!

981
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:53,387
Just enjoy life.

982
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:54,929
Bottoms up!

983
00:58:58,558 --> 00:59:00,452
You’ve had so
much drink, bro.

984
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:02,595
- One more, one more.
- I'm also done.

985
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:05,607
You’re so weak.

986
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:08,559
Let’s drink more.

987
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:10,654
Do whatever you want.

988
00:59:11,405 --> 00:59:12,531
I need to take a shit.

989
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:14,259
No, you're shit!

990
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:17,119
Do whatever you
want in your life.

991
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:18,411
As for me…

992
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:19,955
I’m happy.

993
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:54,948
Ohh…

994
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:57,909
So my hero is here.

995
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:03,196
Mariposa?

996
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:04,950
Ohh.

997
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:06,145
You’re here.

998
01:00:09,463 --> 01:00:10,464
Are you okay?

999
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:19,909
Are you okay?

1000
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:22,319
It’s alright.

1001
01:00:31,153 --> 01:00:32,863
Wait, what are you doing?

1002
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,784
Why are you tying me?

1003
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,704
Don’t rape me.

1004
01:00:39,618 --> 01:00:41,411
Edd, how are you?

1005
01:00:43,413 --> 01:00:44,413
It’s like…

1006
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:45,916
you smell like a hostess.

1007
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:51,409
This is the perfume
my boss gave me.

1008
01:00:52,422 --> 01:00:53,715
He sprays it on me

1009
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:56,676
when we play in his hut.

1010
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,470
Is that so?

1011
01:01:00,347 --> 01:01:01,347
Don’t worry.

1012
01:01:02,498 --> 01:01:04,416
I’ll find a way to
get you out quickly.

1013
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,441
I’m innocent.

1014
01:01:05,806 --> 01:01:06,891
I just want to be free.

1015
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,230
Daddy,

1016
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,926
I’m not a rapist.

1017
01:01:11,986 --> 01:01:13,926
I know that.
I believe you, son.

1018
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:15,987
I know how we raised you.

1019
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,030
So…

1020
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,825
I got the best lawyer.

1021
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:21,275
I’m sure

1022
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:23,717
she’ll win your case.

1023
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:24,829
Really, Dad?

1024
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,413
Who?

1025
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:37,925
Susan.

1026
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:52,493
Raise your right hand.

1027
01:01:53,316 --> 01:01:55,068
Left hand on the Bible.

1028
01:01:56,653 --> 01:02:00,423
I am Michelle P. Alfaro.

1029
01:02:00,552 --> 01:02:02,616
I solemnly swear

1030
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:06,704
that everything I will say
is nothing but the truth.

1031
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:10,792
The whole truth and
nothing but the truth.

1032
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:12,419
So help me God.

1033
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:27,433
Miss Alfa—

1034
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:34,858
Miss Alfaro,

1035
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:38,195
can you tell us

1036
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,906
why you have brought
this before the court?

1037
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:43,240
Because I want to seek justice

1038
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:45,911
for the sexual assault committed
against me by Edward Mendez,

1039
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:48,329
I have complete evidence,

1040
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,538
a medico-legal report,

1041
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,707
and a video that proves

1042
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,543
what he did to me.

1043
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:56,671
How did you record a video

1044
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:58,673
of the supposed assault?

1045
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:02,158
I was about to make a TikTok.

1046
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:04,471
I set my phone down

1047
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:06,514
and someone suddenly grabbed me.

1048
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:08,015
Wait.

1049
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:09,976
Who grabbed you?

1050
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:11,075
Edward.

1051
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,477
It was Edward Mendez
who assaulted me.

1052
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:14,563
Your Honor,

1053
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:18,318
I would like to mark
this video as Exhibit A.

1054
01:03:18,526 --> 01:03:20,153
And if you will
allow, Your Honor,

1055
01:03:20,904 --> 01:03:22,297
can we play this video

1056
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:24,615
- in this courtroom?
- Objection, Your Honor!

1057
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:26,760
Objection overruled!

1058
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:28,245
You may proceed.

1059
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:52,893
He took advantage
of me the whole night.

1060
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:54,066
That's not—

1061
01:03:55,021 --> 01:03:56,314
That's not true!

1062
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:58,566
I didn't rape her!

1063
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:01,177
That video is not real!

1064
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:02,487
I’m not a rapist!

1065
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:04,394
I’m not a rapist!

1066
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:06,722
I didn't do it!

1067
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:10,537
- Judge!
- Huh? Order!

1068
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,947
Order in the court!
Let's have a break!

1069
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:16,221
We will proceed in
15 minutes, okay?

1070
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:28,421
Hey, witch!

1071
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,448
- What are you doing here?
- Why?

1072
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,191
Are you the only one
allowed to use the restroom?

1073
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,842
How’s your rapist boyfriend?

1074
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:37,105
Michelle P. Alfaro.

1075
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:39,928
The only daughter of Mr. Alfaro.

1076
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:41,315
a.k.a.

1077
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,443
Boy Kindat.

1078
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:43,503
Yes!

1079
01:04:43,528 --> 01:04:45,612
I’m Boy Kindat’s daughter!

1080
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,024
What exactly is your motive?

1081
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,617
Don’t you know how hurt I am?

1082
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:51,355
That you don’t have a father?

1083
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,839
That’s difficult!

1084
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:54,204
Do you even understand?

1085
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:55,481
So you’re getting revenge?

1086
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,309
You still want to
ruin me and Edd?

1087
01:04:57,334 --> 01:04:58,381
Revenge?

1088
01:04:58,406 --> 01:05:00,252
You’ve got some nerve!

1089
01:05:00,277 --> 01:05:01,820
I’m the one who’s
the victim here!

1090
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,423
I’m the one who was assaulted
by your rapist boyfriend!

1091
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,664
You’re crazy!

1092
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,251
Huh! You don’t even know?

1093
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:10,347
How your boyfriend

1094
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,474
hurt me?

1095
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,562
- Stop that!
- [scoffs]

1096
01:05:17,187 --> 01:05:18,563
He still did that to me.

1097
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:20,231
I said stop!

1098
01:05:21,024 --> 01:05:22,108
My…

1099
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:24,527
- That’s enough!
- huge melons!

1100
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:26,053
Doesn’t it hurt you?

1101
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,505
Your boyfriend!

1102
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,947
Doing things with someone else?

1103
01:05:28,948 --> 01:05:30,342
You’re not even on my level!

1104
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,658
Oh really?

1105
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:32,810
Look at yourself!

1106
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:35,621
At least your boyfriend
got a taste of me!

1107
01:05:35,622 --> 01:05:37,686
I heard you two
are getting married?

1108
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:42,670
What did he do to me?
He licked my melons!

1109
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:44,964
- Really?
- Yes!

1110
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,805
Does it feel good?

1111
01:05:47,884 --> 01:05:48,884
Of course!

1112
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,220
Excuse me!

1113
01:05:51,554 --> 01:05:52,847
I’ll just fix the pipe.

1114
01:05:54,265 --> 01:05:56,768
I’ve been trying to stop you,
but you won’t listen.

1115
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:11,199
Is it true you were extremely drunk
the night you entered the motel?

1116
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:13,618
Yes. I drank a lot.

1117
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:16,012
And is it also true that
because you were so drunk,

1118
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,797
it was Miss Alfaro herself

1119
01:06:17,822 --> 01:06:19,533
who guided you into the motel?

1120
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,558
Yes.

1121
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:22,836
I don't even know
how I got there.

1122
01:06:23,169 --> 01:06:24,754
And for sure, I couldn’t
have raped her.

1123
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:27,250
Impossible!
And I can prove that!

1124
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:31,803
Susan, I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:34,097
I was wrong to
keep things from you.

1126
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:35,719
What are you talking about?

1127
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:37,349
I have a secret.

1128
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,145
This will prove

1129
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,646
that I am innocent.

1130
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:43,189
It’s a bit embarrassing.

1131
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:45,191
But I think it’s okay

1132
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,694
to say it now, since
I’m already in court.

1133
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,737
And right here in front of Susan

1134
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:51,239
and everybody else.

1135
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:56,119
Oh, Dad.

1136
01:06:57,328 --> 01:06:58,328
Hi, Dad.

1137
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:00,119
It’s also okay

1138
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:02,083
to say it in front of Dad.

1139
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:05,253
Alright, here we go.

1140
01:07:08,756 --> 01:07:09,756
Oh.

1141
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:11,467
Oh my god!

1142
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:15,847
Are you willing to proceed?

1143
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:18,057
Ah, uhm…

1144
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:20,393
Yes, Your Honor.

1145
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:29,326
I want you all to know,

1146
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:30,527
I have…

1147
01:07:31,457 --> 01:07:32,750
erectile dysfunction.

1148
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,100
I can't

1149
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:38,661
- have a boner.
- Let me see.

1150
01:07:39,204 --> 01:07:40,287
Yes, here.

1151
01:07:40,312 --> 01:07:41,312
Objection!

1152
01:07:42,415 --> 01:07:43,958
Your Honor, that’s only for me.

1153
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:47,081
I’m sorry.
I got carried away.

1154
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,431
You may proceed.

1155
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,136
Because of all the pressure
from Dad to finish a course

1156
01:07:56,161 --> 01:07:57,704
I didn’t really want,

1157
01:07:57,926 --> 01:07:59,929
and to become a son
he could be proud of.

1158
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:01,308
I was also pressured

1159
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,623
because I haven't accomplished
anything like you, Susan.

1160
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,232
I know I don’t deserve you.

1161
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:08,315
But I love you.

1162
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,400
I want to be

1163
01:08:10,485 --> 01:08:11,694
the perfect husband for you.

1164
01:08:12,612 --> 01:08:13,613
One that defends you.

1165
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:15,479
The one that you can depend on.

1166
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:18,565
I’m even willing to go to jail.

1167
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,370
If it’s a crime

1168
01:08:21,704 --> 01:08:23,665
to give the ones you love
what makes them happy.

1169
01:08:23,957 --> 01:08:24,957
So be it.

1170
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:28,211
Even if I have to
sacrifice my own dignity.

1171
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,044
Yes. My thing no longer stands.

1172
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:33,007
But I try to stand up

1173
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,009
my family’s pride.

1174
01:08:35,499 --> 01:08:36,523
I try

1175
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:39,718
to stand strong so my future
wife can be proud of me.

1176
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:44,561
I try to build

1177
01:08:45,895 --> 01:08:48,439
a dream for my future children.

1178
01:08:48,773 --> 01:08:49,899
All I ask…

1179
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:52,902
is to get normal again.

1180
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:56,906
Not for myself.

1181
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:00,126
But for the people I love.

1182
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:13,548
I have here a
medical certificate

1183
01:09:13,673 --> 01:09:15,465
proving

1184
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:19,550
that Mr. Edd Mendez
has erectile dysfunction.

1185
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:21,764
Attorney Lucas,

1186
01:09:22,056 --> 01:09:24,767
do you have any
more witnesses to call?

1187
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:25,893
Yes, Your Honor.

1188
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:28,021
I would like to call

1189
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:31,274
Mr. Jaime Magtulis
to the stand, please.

1190
01:09:31,441 --> 01:09:32,609
Calling…

1191
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:34,151
my penis.

1192
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:36,738
My penis can now stand.

1193
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:38,739
What?

1194
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:40,199
Stand up, my penis.

1195
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:42,785
The witness may stand.

1196
01:09:53,046 --> 01:09:54,714
Do you swear to tell the truth?

1197
01:09:55,173 --> 01:09:56,799
And nothing but the truth?

1198
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:58,425
I do.

1199
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:06,643
Mr. Jaime Magtulis,

1200
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,647
is what Mr. Mendez said true?

1201
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,730
Yes.

1202
01:10:12,523 --> 01:10:14,754
It’s true that Edd
can't get a boner.

1203
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,195
That’s why he came to me.

1204
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,072
To help him fix his boner.

1205
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:20,615
To save the wedding.

1206
01:10:21,532 --> 01:10:23,201
Especially their honeymoon.

1207
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:25,119
I helped him...

1208
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:28,706
But I didn’t touch
or even look at it.

1209
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:32,473
Maybe a little—just a bit.

1210
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:33,919
Just a quick glance?

1211
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:35,779
I don’t even remember
what it looks like.

1212
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:37,152
No contact.

1213
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:39,700
I swear your honor,
no contact at all.

1214
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:40,926
No contact.

1215
01:10:44,514 --> 01:10:45,682
That’s all, Your Honor.

1216
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,156
If you can’t get a boner,

1217
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:55,457
and you say you didn’t
raped Ms. Alfaro,

1218
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:59,593
how do you explain
the CCTV footage

1219
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:02,025
showing you both
entering the hotel

1220
01:11:02,448 --> 01:11:04,534
and the video of
the alleged act?

1221
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:05,909
Yes.

1222
01:11:06,035 --> 01:11:07,412
I was with her in the hotel.

1223
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:09,413
I was extremely drunk.

1224
01:11:09,438 --> 01:11:10,689
I could barely even stand.

1225
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:12,458
I don't even know
how I got to her room.

1226
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:14,543
That’s why I’m sure,

1227
01:11:15,044 --> 01:11:17,922
I’m not the one in the
video with Mariposa.

1228
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,044
The evidence looks very clear.

1229
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,026
Can’t you man up and take
responsibility for what you did?

1230
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:25,346
Objection, your honor.

1231
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:28,141
It is an irrelevant
question, your honor.

1232
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:29,449
And please,

1233
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:31,811
turn off the video.

1234
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:33,813
Objection sustained.

1235
01:11:33,996 --> 01:11:35,373
- Turn off the video.
- Wait.

1236
01:11:35,398 --> 01:11:36,441
Don’t turn it off.

1237
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:44,240
I knew it.

1238
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:49,245
The tattoo on the shoulder of the
guy with Mariposa looks familiar.

1239
01:11:49,454 --> 01:11:50,681
I don’t have a tattoo like that.

1240
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:52,415
There’s only one person I know

1241
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,709
who has a…
cock-shaped tattoo.

1242
01:11:58,452 --> 01:12:01,622
Is the man you’re referring
to inside this courtroom?

1243
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,072
Yes, Your Honor.
He’s here.

1244
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:15,228
He disappeared.

1245
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:17,355
He was just here.

1246
01:12:22,361 --> 01:12:24,614
Where were you on the
night the incident happened?

1247
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:26,783
At the hotel.

1248
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:31,120
This is what really happened.

1249
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:33,556
I was drunk back then.

1250
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:34,581
And then…

1251
01:13:06,864 --> 01:13:08,825
I actually wanted to admit

1252
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:11,093
that what I did was wrong.

1253
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,799
But I was scared
of going to jail.

1254
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:18,282
I know what they
do to rape convicts.

1255
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:19,307
I know that too!

1256
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,127
Order in the court.

1257
01:13:23,472 --> 01:13:25,309
I have nothing more
to ask, your honor.

1258
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:30,154
Because of the statement
of Mr. Jaime Magtulis,

1259
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:33,923
he will remain in police custody

1260
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,955
while his case is being heard.

1261
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,980
Wait!

1262
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:40,383
The truth is,

1263
01:13:40,811 --> 01:13:42,437
I filed a case
against Edd because

1264
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:44,100
I was angry at Susan.

1265
01:13:44,468 --> 01:13:45,594
But honestly,

1266
01:13:45,692 --> 01:13:47,277
I enjoyed that night.

1267
01:13:47,472 --> 01:13:49,682
And no sexual assault happened,

1268
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,610
so I am withdrawing the case.

1269
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:53,794
So,

1270
01:13:53,819 --> 01:13:57,656
I think there is no more
case left to discuss here.

1271
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:59,416
Let’s make this formal.

1272
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:04,655
Undoubtedly, the case is
dismissed without prejudice.

1273
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,680
Nice!

1274
01:14:07,884 --> 01:14:09,801
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1275
01:14:18,157 --> 01:14:19,741
- Dad!
- Congratulations.

1276
01:14:19,772 --> 01:14:20,904
Group hug.

1277
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:24,475
I knew you could do it, Susan!

1278
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,503
To Susan!

1279
01:14:27,528 --> 01:14:29,589
To Susan!

1280
01:14:29,614 --> 01:14:31,406
To Susan!

1281
01:14:31,407 --> 01:14:34,785
- To Susan!
- To Susan!

1282
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,506
You may kiss the bride.

1283
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,737
Thank you for not
giving up on me.

1284
01:15:10,262 --> 01:15:11,262
I love you.

1285
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,803
They say,

1286
01:15:14,146 --> 01:15:16,065
when you love someone,
you fight for them.

1287
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:17,763
But now,

1288
01:15:19,371 --> 01:15:20,705
you’re going to
have to fight me.

1289
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:27,533
Sorry.

1290
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:30,925
Looks like I might
ruin our night.

1291
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:36,544
You know, I’ve been
wanting you for so long.

1292
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,353
And I don’t care whether
that thing stands or not.

1293
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,370
