1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,590
Baek Ho Rang, let's go. It's been thirty minutes.

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,580
- Here.
- What's this?

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,530
They gave it to me on my way out. I know you like things like this. You can keep it.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,080
Thank you. Hello? Ah, where it is...?

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,870
You look happy.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,860
Filmbreakers

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,120
People can already send in stories in our forum.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,850
I hope we get many funny stories.

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,830
Dearest friend, it's your birthday soon.

10
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,210
Do you remember Angel karaoke?

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,590
Will you be alright? I have nothing to lose, but you do.

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,360
It's exciting to talk to you on Face.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,440
The truth about Baek Ho Rang... here it is.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,720
- Stop them.
- Young Jae, hit the lights.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,990
I said, hit the lights!

16
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,290
Baek Ho Rang!

17
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,630
Will you hold my hand?

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,490
The truth about Baek Ho Rang

19
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,190
Part two will start in a while.

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,470
We can't know what happened from this clip.
 - Episode 5 -

21
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,030
- She's just at a karaoke.
- I'm not sure. If nothing happened,

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,600
why would someone expose her? Gosh, what a mess.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,850
Everyone go back to your positions. The show isn't over, yet.

24
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,810
I'll go alone.

25
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,290
- Baek Ho Rang...
- I'm all right.

26
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,160
I can go first today, right?

27
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,220
If we go together it's more noticeable.

28
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,370
So you should go back.

29
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,000
The Secret of Us

30
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,700
Ah, that's all fake. All fake. That personality isn't going anywhere.

31
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,370
- Wow, her personality is amazing.
- If it were me, I wouldn't have come out.

32
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,230
- As expected, you can't trust people's looks.
- Gosh, she's unbelievable

33
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,620
- By the way, who got beaten up? Shouldn't we protect her privacy?
- Getting beaten up is embarrassing too.

34
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,600
Baek Ho Rang, where are you?

35
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,990
Baek Ho Rang didn't come to school today

36
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,290
Really? She didn't come?

37
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,490
Yeah, when I went to the classroom earlier she wasn't there.

38
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,260
If I were her, I wouldn't have come either.

39
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,070
Did you talk to Baek Ho Rang?

40
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,620
No, she won't answer the phone.

41
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,790
Is Baek Ho Rang going to drop out?

42
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,480
- That means that all was true.
- She made such a fuss about what Park Hye Rim did, but she's the same.

43
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,570
You're right. Does that mean Park Hye Rim was right?

44
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,380
She's blabbering without knowing any—

45
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,740
I have never seen a person putting so much effort into some nonsense. You're so kind.

46
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,150
The evidence shows clearly what Park Hye Rim did.

47
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,270
- What about Baek Ho Rang? Do you have evidence?
- Why wouldn't we have any evidence?

48
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,160
- That photo.
- Oh, that photo?

49
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,440
Hey! Should I take a picture of you two and post it up?

50
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,180
And write "I caught locker room thieves?"

51
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,430
What are you saying, crazy? Say something that makes sense.

52
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,390
- Hey, she's acknowledging it by hiding. Can't you tell?
- Hey, Choi Yoon Suk!

53
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,170
Let's go. Kang Jae Yi, don't get ahead of yourself and stay quiet. Don't get tangled up in this.

54
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,750
Where are you going? I'm not done yet

55
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,460
- Admit what?
- Baek Ho Rang.

56
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,080
That I took the wrong bus?

57
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,670
Or, that the bus got into an accident so no one could leave until the situation was cleared up?

58
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,250
Ho Rang, were you in an accident?

59
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,160
How would we know that?

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,290
You gossiped so well with just one picture.

61
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,660
Why? You can't believe this without any evidence?

62
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,670
But, what are you gonna do when I bring evidence?

63
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,760
Take it.

64
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,720
You pick it up.

65
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,480
Hey, it's Baek Ho Rang.

66
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,930
Ho Rang, are you okay? You said you were in an accident

67
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,620
Ho Rang, how long will we wait? What's up with that photo?

68
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,390
- Let me see your knee, are you okay?
- Baek Ho Rang,

69
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,000
you saw me taking your side in front of them, right?

70
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,580
If it's not true, I'm gonna be embarrassed so get your story straight.

71
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,560
Did you really beat up someone?

72
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,780
- No.
- Wow, hey did you see him freak out just now?

73
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,890
Not true. I already knew it wasn't Ho Rang

74
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,720
- What are you saying? Your leg was shaking like an earthquake!
- No, it wasn't!

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,210
I'm leaving first, enjoy lunch.

76
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,220
- Ho Rang, where are you going? You're not going to eat?
- I'm late.

77
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,720
She looks fine.

78
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,720
More than I expected.

79
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,240
Will Ho Rang Sunbae come today? Yesterday was a bit...

80
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,930
Then what do you this about Young Jae doing—

81
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,600
This is for today, right? I'll get ready.

82
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,540
Wouldn't it be better for Young Jae to do it today?

83
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,150
- It's still early...
- Then should I?

84
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,500
- Let's get ready.
- Got it.

85
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,780
Standby. Thirty seconds.

86
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,390
- Hello, this is SHBC.
- Isn't this Baek Ho Rang's voice?

87
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,200
- She's unbelievable.
- This week many people sent us stories.

88
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,730
- Isn't this Baek Ho Rang?
- The first story that I'll read was sent to us

89
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,520
- this morning
- As expect, this is Ho Rang.

90
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,710
- I'm losing my appetite, why is she still part of the broadcasting club?
- Because she's shameless.

91
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,760
Those little...

92
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,260
- Let go of me.
-Sit down, just eat.

93
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,250
Let go.

94
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,290
Please give me some tips on living a fun life.

95
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,650
Thanks for sharing your situation openly. Is there really a secret to living a fun life?

96
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,090
In my experience...

97
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,680
The video filming team can continue as usual.

98
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
The team with the change in concept, finish it up and let me know when you're done.

99
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,630
I think that we can go forward with the festival video. Thanks, everyone for your hard work at the festival.

100
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,970
- When you finish your class, the first years should clean up the rest of the equipment and put them in storage.
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,270
- Jin Gook and Hee Soo, please go into the supply closet and check the cameras for me.
- Okay.

102
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,990
- Okay.
- And someone needs to clean up the cables and the lights in the venue...
- I'll do it.

103
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,240
Since I left early yesterday, I'll clean up the rest.

104
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,750
- There's a lot of things so you probably can't do it yourself.
- I can do it by myself.

105
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,070
- Alright. So Hyeon can you collect all the receipts from the festival purchases?
- Yup.

106
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,580
That concludes today's meeting. Good job everyone

107
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,520
Good job everyone.

108
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,690
Baek Ho Rang.

109
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,800
Yes?

110
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,020
You can put the cables in the storage later.

111
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,780
Okay.

112
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,330
- But where did you go yesterday?
- What?

113
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,500
The second half of the festival. I couldn't find you.

114
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,110
I just went home in the middle. It was boring.

115
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,470
Should I buy anything else?

116
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,330
Do you want to buy more? There's a lot already.

117
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,000
Baek Ho Rang didn't eat anything just now. I was thinking to buy her something.

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,390
- Jae Yi Unni!
- Woo Sol.

119
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,550
I sent you a message on Face earlier. Hello.

120
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,030
He's in my class... and... yeah.

121
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,970
What the heck? What kind of weird introduction is that?

122
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,090
He's my friend. And Wool Sol is...

123
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,260
I'm her really close junior.

124
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,370
Hello. Is your hair naturally brown?

125
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,310
Yes. Oppa, is your hair naturally curly?

126
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,460
What the heck is with this conversation?

127
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,960
Kim Yoo Sin, go and buy some more things. Hurry.

128
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
Okay. See you again, Woo Sol.

129
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,140
Bye.

130
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,950
What's this, Unni? Is he a new guy you're flirting with?

131
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,230
With him? Absolutely not.

132
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,730
Isn't he? That's why I purposely didn't mention Do Woo Jae. I got all happy for nothing.

133
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,900
What's there for you to be happy about?

134
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,260
No, it's just that I hope you can date other people.

135
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,560
Then, later on, Do Woo Jae will...

136
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,290
Woo Sol.

137
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm sorry, but I don't want to hear Do Woo Jae's name for a while.

138
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm sorry, Unni. I wasn't considerate enough.

139
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,090
From now on, if I have to mention him, I'll call him "that scum."

140
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,560
Is there anything you want to eat? I'll treat you.

141
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,380
The uncertainty of information.

142
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,390
The information that spreads out is actually...

143
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,380
6:00 a.m.

144
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,990
Hello?

145
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,570
You've gotten prettier, Ho Rang.

146
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,190
Relax. Have you eaten yet?

147
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,330
Why did you contact me?

148
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,580
Because of you, my personal information has all been exposed.

149
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,740
I was living fine, minding my own business, but I closed my account because of you.

150
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,170
I'm really pissed off.

151
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,520
Are you telling me to show concern for the personal information of a bully right now?

152
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Gosh. You dare look me in the eyes because I was being nice?

153
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,860
Baek Ho Rang, why do you think I called you out here today?

154
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,490
You must be asking me to hide the truth for you. Because you also remember everything you did.

155
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey, I don't remember it being anything that serious.

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,510
I have no intentions of hiding it from other people.

157
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,520
Not stirring things up and hiding it benefits you, not me.'

158
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,140
Things will pass for me after getting bashed,

159
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,620
but that's not the case for you, isn't that right?

160
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,000
You're scared right now, aren't you?

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,050
You act like you're all that,

162
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,130
but you're worried your pathetic past of getting beat up will be exposed.

163
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,370
Isn't it hilarious?

164
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,970
The person who got hit was you, but you're the one who's scared.

165
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,830
I came to see this.

166
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,510
When you said you didn't remember anything,

167
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,980
I didn't forget a single thing.

168
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,650
I'd recall it all every day even when I was sleeping or eating.

169
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,450
So, let me ask you something, too.

170
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,200
Why did you do that to me back then?

171
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,870
Let's see... I don't really remember.

172
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,280
Because you were a complete pushover?

173
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,210
I wanted to grab a bite with you since it's been so long, but I guess it won't be today. I have to get to work.

174
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,020
There's still some left. Why don't you drink this?

175
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,890
See you again.

176
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,910
Limited opportunities to approach impact important information. Moreover, if you can't obtain information...

177
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,650
Go Eun Taek, what do you think?

178
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,610
About what?

179
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,400
The thing about Baek Ho Rang.

180
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,060
I'm not sure.

181
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,400
But won't it be hard for her to wrap things up by herself?

182
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,220
There will probably also be a lot of people in the hall.

183
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,900
If I go, she probably won't like it.

184
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,460
If someone else goes, I think it'll be better.

185
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm leaving.

186
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,290
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking this.

187
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,130
The festival video? You're doing this already?

188
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,710
Yes. There's the filming of the film festival and I think that Eun Taek wanted me to do it today.

189
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,250
What about the key?

190
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,320
I got the key from Jin Gook just now, of course.

191
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,810
I'm leaving now. I have to go to tutoring school.

192
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,360
See you.

193
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,140
I don't want to.

194
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,520
So Hyeon Sunbae, can you ask him to stop?

195
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,030
He keeps asking me to get dressed up as an elementary child for the video.

196
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,670
Then, who else would do it? Do you think we'll get an actor for that?

197
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,770
Why are you telling me to do it?

198
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,760
Because you look the most childish and cutest.

199
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,640
After flirting with each other for a year, it should be time you date, isn't it?

200
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Sunbaenim, it's not what you think.

201
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm planning to submit the receipts we sorted out tomorrow. Do you guys have any other expenses?

202
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,080
No, we don't.

203
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,870
Oh, by the way, Sunbaenim, I was planning to check the festival footage. I just have to back up the files in the hard drive, right?

204
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,050
Footage? But Hee Soo was checking it just now.

205
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,050
Hee Soo Sunbae?

206
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,440
Oh, but it's not anything urgent, so I said I would do it.

207
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,990
- You?
- Yes.

208
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
I'll check it again.

209
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,780
Okay.

210
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,520
Doesn't she seem like the bully if you just look at the photos?

211
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,900
- Right. I guess there's a story behind it.
- I knew that something was weird.

212
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,870
- She's a little ugly.
- Yes.

213
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,180
- She's a little skinny too.
- Right?
- Isn't that Baek Ho Rang?

214
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,120
Ho Rang!

215
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,030
We made this when we held our booth. Do you want to try it?

216
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,960
No, it's okay.

217
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,990
I'm Lee Na Hyeon from Class Two. We had moving classes together back then.

218
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,560
Oh.

219
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,200
But seriously, why are they like this?

220
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,800
They keep talking about you all day. They must seriously have nothing to do.

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,830
Ho Rang, it must be hard on you.

222
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,000
Exactly. It was so many years ago, yet they're still...

223
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
- No, I'm not saying you really...
- Hey.

224
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,620
Say it again.

225
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,030
Now that I think about it, I remember. Second-year student, Lee Na Hyeon, from Class Two.

226
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,370
You sent me a direct message saying you want to steal her boyfriend.

227
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,140
Hey. You... Is that true?

228
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,450
- Are you nuts? I wouldn't want him even if you gave him to me!
- What?

229
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,030
No... When did I say that?

230
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,250
- Right. You didn't.
- Hey, you...

231
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,920
But it didn't even take a minute for you to almost get into a fight

232
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,370
because of something I randomly said.

233
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,520
This is exactly what you people are doing.

234
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,190
If you think it's the slightest bit provoking, you rush towards it.

235
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,200
You don't even know if what you're listening to is true or not, but you go and tell it to everyone.

236
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,910
But that never holds up for very long.

237
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,390
That's why I'm enduring it.

238
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,570
I'm not keeping quiet because I have nothing to say.

239
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,820
So, please keep your mouths shut.

240
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,840
Don't let your stupidity show.

241
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,100
Oh, by the way.

242
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,870
No matter how young they are, people should be able to differentiate between what they should and shouldn't do.

243
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,170
Don't you think there's too little of a filter on the posts the account is making?

244
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,810
What do you mean? Do you seriously believe her?

245
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,600
What makes you so sure?

246
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,500
Baek Ho—

247
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,330
This is all true.

248
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,280
By the way, who wrote today's story?

249
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,920
- So can I pick the story?
- You asked about the story. Is that why you decided to join?

250
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,280
Was it really you?

251
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,920
Then why is your name here?

252
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,330
- Do Woo Jae, I want to buy rice cakes on my way home. Give me three dollars.
- I don't have cash.

253
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,810
What do you mean you don't have any? I know that you always ask for cash as an emergency stash.

254
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,660
Hold this.

255
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
Here.

256
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,720
I knew you had it. Thank you!

257
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,440
Why did you buy so much stuff?

258
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,150
Who did you buy them for?

259
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,810
- Did I buy them?
- Does it look like I put them here?

260
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,990
The only person that likes these is Jae Yi Unni—

261
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,280
I guess I accidentally bought it. Give it to me.

262
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,810
Seeing as you've bought a ton of energy drinks, you must be planning on staying up all night.

263
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,970
Yeah. I'll be a senior soon.

264
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,320
Hey, Do Woo Jae. Be honest with yourself. Your life's been boring recently, hasn't it?

265
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,870
Of course. Your always no-fun life was only decent thanks to you-know-who.

266
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,700
Now it'll just be hecka no fun.

267
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,760
- Hey!
- What did I tell you?

268
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,680
I told you not to regret anything and take my advice!

269
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,090
Ho Rang... I believe in you.

270
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,310
Lee Sun Joo posted a statement. It is true? Are you guys both playing us?

271
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,300
Lee Sun Joo

272
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,380
Lee Sun Joo
Add as a friend

273
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,900
Many people are bad-mouthing Ho Rang and me with what happened two years ago,

274
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,630
but it was just a birthday party with friends for Ho Rang. This is unfair.

275
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,670
Don't get the wrong idea. Even in the future. I'm a human, too, and I'm hurting.

276
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,420
- Come in, please.
- Your house is amazing.

277
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,540
Oh, my daughter!

278
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,640
These are our work colleagues.

279
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,100
Hello, you're Ho Rang?

280
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,970
- Isn't she pretty?
- She's very pretty.

281
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,260
She takes after her mom, so she's pretty.

282
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,060
- Hello.
- Hello. She's pretty.

283
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,790
- I'm going to bed.
- Sure, go sleep.

284
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,510
Goodnight.

285
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,900
Sleep well.

286
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,730
Alright. Everyone, come in!

287
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:49,390
To: Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek

288
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,520
Call from: Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek

289
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,350
Hello.

290
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,610
- Baek Ho Rang?
- Yes?

291
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,990
- Hello.
 - Yeah.

292
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,470
What? You're the one who called.

293
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,240
I know...

294
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,850
Why did you call?

295
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:44,010
Oh, that. You know the ticket you gave me during the festival?

296
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,680
I put it into a frame next to my bed where I can see it.

297
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,940
Our Secret

298
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,960
What about you?

299
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,130
You didn't throw this away on the street, right?

300
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,220
I have mine too.

301
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,720
Well, it's ugly so I put it somewhere I can't see.

302
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,970
Why did you call me so late to talk about a ticket?

303
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,520
No reason.

304
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,940
I just called you, but I don't really know what to talk about.

305
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,460
Are you taken aback because it's random?

306
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,890
No, it feels nice because I haven't heard anything random in a while.

307
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,230
Keep going.

308
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,150
That movie we watched together...

309
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,650
- I have it on my laptop, so I could keep it forever.
- Okay.

310
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,910
But after my laptop got reset, I re-downloaded it.

311
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,170
The resolution is much better.

312
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,440
What the... of course, it did.

313
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,330
So, you said you didn't watch that movie, right?

314
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,620
Want to go watch it now?

315
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,110
What?

316
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,280
Let's go watch that movie.

317
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,180
The place with the good movie theater atmosphere is here?

318
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,250
How is it?

319
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,140
Forget the atmosphere. Is it okay for us to be here?

320
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,610
We usually have team meals here and stuff when no one's here.

321
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,810
And I'm the club president, after all.

322
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,280
Does she die at the end?

323
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,690
Is this a sad ending?

324
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,040
Why? Don't you like sad endings?

325
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,220
No, they're fine.

326
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,760
Normally people with secrets

327
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,100
have sad endings.

328
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,060
Because those secrets always end up causing trouble.

329
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,320
She shouldn't tell anyone.

330
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,030
Isn't it better for them to date briefly and then eventually break up?

331
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,490
Is that why you're not saying anything?

332
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,090
Because you don't want a sad ending?

333
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,310
Go Eun Taek.

334
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,460
Do you trust me?

335
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,210
No.

336
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,380
You haven't told me anything yet.

337
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,360
I don't want to assume things just by hearing things people are saying.

338
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,790
Until you say something, I can't believe anything.

339
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,670
Have you watched a lot of movies?

340
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,310
I love movies, so I've watched a lot of them. I think a little differently.

341
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:24,380
Even though people have secrets, it's not always a sad ending for them.

342
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,820
At least most of the endings I've seen have been good ones.

343
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,220
I'll wait.

344
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,310
Until you tell me.

345
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,750
Did you sleep well, Baek Ho Rang?

346
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,050
Hello?

347
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,040
I was at my friend's house and fell asleep.

348
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm fine.

349
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,160
Okay.

350
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,730
You're good at lying.

351
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,000
This isn't a lie.

352
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,790
But, did we sleep here?

353
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,640
I didn't, but you did.

354
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,420
Me? When?

355
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,010
While we were talking about endings.

356
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,730
How can you miss this movie's ending so many times?

357
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,650
You should have woken me up.

358
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,990
It was a relief.

359
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,630
You looked more at peace than before.

360
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,550
Let's go now. They must be worried.

361
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,430
Are you going to be at home alone today?

362
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,600
Probably.

363
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,630
Do you want to come out later if you're bored? We're going to the library.

364
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,980
No, it's fun being by myself.

365
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,350
Figures, you'll probably go home and sleep. And snore like you did yesterday.

366
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,720
Did I snore? No, I didn't.

367
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,310
You snore and sleep in a weird pose.

368
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,380
You slept with your eyes open.

369
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,250
- I couldn't sleep because of you.
- You're funny.

370
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,990
Hey, Go Eun Taek.

371
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,280
- Isn't this something that your father used to wear?
- No, it's high fashion.

372
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,980
Why do I see Kim Yoo Sin?

373
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,750
Am I crazy?

374
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,050
No, you're normal.

375
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,560
Baek Ho Rang! It's Eun Taek.

376
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,160
Let's go.

377
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,770
Baek Ho Rang. Did you guys go somewhere?

378
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,590
Dressed like that?

379
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,910
- Yeah, we went to watch a mov—
- Apartment inhabitors!

380
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,180
We are... so we ran into each other at the bakery's out front.

381
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,630
Why are you guys together?

382
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm here to go to the library with you, and him...

383
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,860
- I came because you weren't picking up the phone. But, where's the bread?
- Huh?

384
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,610
You said you went to the bakery. Where's the bread?

385
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,870
The bread... the bakery said it wasn't time for it to come out.

386
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,690
Stop asking.

387
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,660
Then you haven't eaten yet, right?

388
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,150
I'm going with Woo Jae and Eun Taek to eat. Let's go together.

389
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,410
- Me, too?
- Mmhm. What do you guys want to eat?

390
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,790
I know of a place. Let's go there.

391
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,460
Let's go eat!

392
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:38,030
I can really start again, right? As someone who is very sharp?

393
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,360
Can I get it back in a month if I do this?
[2 to 4-hour classes every week!]

394
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,540
If you're as rushed as you are, you won't last long.

395
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,220
You ned to be determined. It isn't enough to take these lectures.

396
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,750
Yes! I'll try my best!

397
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,810
In any case, I'll have a ton of free time from now on.

398
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,620
Now that you're registered for the beginner class,

399
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,140
you can start attending classes next week.

400
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,340
Yes, thank you!

401
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,350
Thank you!

402
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,540
Then aren't you, Woo Jae, and Baek Ho Rang meeting for the first time?

403
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,390
- Oh, is that right? Hi.
- Yeah.

404
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,690
So awkward.

405
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,890
Then do you two always go to the library on weekend mornings?

406
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,620
Well, there's not much else to do but study, so...

407
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,970
That's so strange. I don't have much to do when I go to the library. Right?

408
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,360
You guys live so boringly.

409
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,960
I can see why you two are friends.

410
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,030
Me? I'm at least better than him.

411
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,390
What are you talking about? In what sense?

412
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,780
You two are the same. Just eat.

413
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,410
Hello?

414
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,930
Hey Baek Ho Rang, where are you? You haven't eaten yet, right?

415
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,840
I'm eating right now.

416
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,660
With who?

417
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm with Go Eun Taek and Kim Yoo Sin. Oh, and Do Woo Jae.

418
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,790
Who? Why is he there?

419
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,550
It just ended up that way.

420
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,820
Alright, alright. Hang up for now.

421
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,760
Why, why? Who was it?

422
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,690
Kang Jae Yi.

423
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,430
Oh, but you two went to Han River and then broke up?

424
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,780
Oh gosh, Ho Rang. At least you're consistent with how you never have a filter.

425
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,760
I like it.

426
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,430
Was I not supposed to say anything? I'm sorry.

427
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,530
As you may know, I don't really have the brain space to think before I speak.

428
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,900
No, it's fine.

429
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,390
But, did you guys really break up because of that?

430
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,060
I said no. Eat your food.

431
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,800
Okay.

432
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,160
How is it? Does it look cool?

433
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,070
Baek Ho Rang, what apartment number are you?

434
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,510
Me? H805. Why?

435
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,230
Oh, nothing.

436
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,580
Then I'll be going first.

437
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,820
Should I take you?

438
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,850
It's fine. It's right there.

439
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,120
Yes, yes. She'll be going with me anyway—

440
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,090
Just go already. Thanks for coming to see me, but you should go.

441
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,520
I have stuff to do at home.

442
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,660
I came to see you this morning.

443
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,620
Kim Yoo Sin, you can come with us.

444
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,360
Okay, Ho Rang. Then you better call me after you get home. Okay?

445
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,820
Go!

446
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,020
I'll be going!

447
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,090
Bye, Ho Rang!

448
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,090
I'm getting worried about her.

449
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,090
About what? She said her house is close.

450
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,480
Do you like Baek Ho Rang?

451
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,900
- You have no tact. These two are just—
- Yeah.

452
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,320
- Is it obvious?
- Yeah.

453
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,860
You said you pulled an all-nighter. Why are you on the go? Is something going on?

454
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,300
I just have a lot to study.

455
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,330
What the... Am I the only person listening?

456
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,770
Why is everyone acting normal except me? Huh?

457
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
Hey, wait for me! Wait for me!

458
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,630
Student Meeting: Kim Jung Bin, Do Woo Jae, Kim Sang Jin, Bang Yoon Hee, Choi Sung Jin

459
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,770
X: Do Woo Jae

460
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,000
X: Kim Sang Jin

461
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,390
X: Choi Sung Jin

462
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,130
X: Kim Jung Bin

463
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,230
Is it better at this viewpoint? What's this?

464
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,030
I wondered why Go Eun Taek asked earlier.

465
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,930
Why is this coming out so bad?

466
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,770
This isn't right. What about...

467
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,350
Wait...

468
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,980
Of course!

469
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,320
It's coming out good!

470
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,120
Alright, got it.

471
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,890
Here, eat!

472
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,490
I don't eat fresh cream.

473
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,820
Really? Then eat the chocolate!

474
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,320
- But what is this?
- What's what?

475
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,590
Why are you here?

476
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,890
Well, you know. I was worried.

477
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,640
I've gone through it before. Even though it feels okay when you're with other people,

478
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,120
reality hits you when you're by yourself.

479
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,820
Do you have a tissue?

480
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,860
You're such a handful.

481
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,760
Wait a sec.

482
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,320
I know! I felt so wronged back then!

483
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,410
The things Baek Ho Rang did when she took my phone.

484
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,650
You must've felt so wronged. So wait, she did it herself and then put on a show?

485
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,610
That's what I'm saying!

486
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,370
Oh right, when you posted your statement. The sixteen minutes?

487
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,880
What does that mean?

488
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,330
Oh, that? I'm not sure. Someone told me so I just put it up without a thought.

489
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,230
Anyway—

490
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,990
Excuse me. Hey, I'm Ji So Hyeon from class 3. Is it okay for me to sit for a sec?

491
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,680
I can't tell who actually lives here.

492
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,340
What are you doing?

493
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,960
What do you mean? Just watch that.

494
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,630
It's hilarious.

495
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,760
Give it.

496
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,330
I don't want to. I came here so you wouldn't look at that.

497
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,360
Go home. Why are you bothering me by coming over here?

498
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,120
Don't you have anywhere to go?

499
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,950
I don't. You know already. I broke up.

500
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,640
Oh, that's right. Why did you meet with Do Woo Jae earlier?

501
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,220
He said he came to go to the library with Go Eun Taek.

502
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,130
I met him by coincidence.

503
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,600
Wait. Something's weird.

504
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,520
What is?

505
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,090
Do Woo Jae came to see Go Eun Taek, but how did he run into you?

506
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,820
Were you guys together this morning?

507
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,590
There-there was a reason for it.

508
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,330
But you're lasting a while this time. When are you guys getting back together?

509
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,060
We're not. This is for real this time.

510
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,300
Yeah, right.

511
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,460
Really?

512
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,040
Yeah. I've done all I can so I don't have any regrets.

513
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,750
If there are any regrets, that jerk Do Woo Jae would be the one who has it.

514
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,590
Don't be so sure.

515
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:15,020
He might be thinking that he also did his best as well.

516
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,570
I just mean that both your methods could be different.

517
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,730
And... you're a handful to deal with.

518
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,000
I came here to console you! You should be on my side!

519
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,800
But where did you guys meet?

520
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,660
In middle school, we went to the same tutoring place. I liked him immediately so I started talking to him.

521
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,670
What about him did you like?

522
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,320
I'm not sure. He looked like my type.

523
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,530
And no matter how hard the situation, he stayed calm.

524
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,820
That was pretty attractive. Oh, and now that I think about it, there's something else.

525
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,990
While we were fighting, I was getting out of breath so he got me some water.

526
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,090
Isn't that so sweet?

527
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,370
You said you didn't know, but it sounds like you could talk about it for two more days.

528
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,490
Whatever. I just liked him.

529
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:10,170
Even if we didn't do anything special, it was still fun and comfortable with him.

530
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,510
Is it weird that I'm being random?

531
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,090
It's kind of nice hearing something random

532
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,450
Keep going.

533
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,650
Did you sleep well, Baek Ho Rang?

534
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,960
It's a relief. You look more at peace than before.

535
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:33,120
So then did he say anything while you guys were eating?

536
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,730
What? Do Woo Jae?

537
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,310
Ah, no, never mind. Tell me about you. What about you?

538
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,810
Do you have anyone you're talking to?

539
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,360
Huh?

540
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,930
What is this reaction? I was just tossing it out there, but you're taking the bait!

541
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,060
What is it? Do you have someone?

542
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,380
No, it's not like that.

543
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,360
What do you mean, no? You just said, "Ah..."

544
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,200
Like that!

545
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,430
What is it? Who is it? Tell me.

546
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,270
So then. When did you start liking Ho Rang?

547
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,610
I found out recently, but it's probably been a while.

548
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:09,030
Does she know? That you like her?

549
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,340
Yeah, I told her.

550
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,460
Wow, awesome. Separately, I would never guess romance,

551
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,590
and even together I can't imagine it. But you guys look good together.

552
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,290
You must've had a lot of worry after the incident.

553
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,340
So that's why I'm calling her now, but she's not picking up.

554
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,960
Maybe it's cause she's with Kang Jae Yi.

555
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,330
Kang Jae Yi? She's with Ho Rang?

556
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,810
She said that she was going over to Baek Ho Rang's place and asked for the address.

557
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,230
What the... She told me to go away.

558
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,900
Woo Jae, what about you? You didn't call her after the breakup?

559
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,270
You know, I couldn't ask because Baek Ho Rang was there earlier.

560
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,650
No matter how I look at it, you guys still have feelings for each other. So why did you break up?

561
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:58,640
If it's bound to end sometime, then better to do it while we don't hate each other as much.

562
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,050
That's why I thought it was good to end things.

563
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,200
You complex guy.

564
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,380
But guys, what time is So Hyeon coming? Why is she so late?

565
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,820
Ji So Hyeon? She's not coming today.

566
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,890
She told us that she was going to study at a cafe today.

567
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,260
What the heck? Why didn't you say anything earlier? I came because of her!

568
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,730
I came to see So Hyeon.

569
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,290
What the heck!

570
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:29,190
Oh, I didn't mean to eavesdrop earlier, but I actually got the same DM.

571
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:32,200
Baek Ho Rang likes the number sixteen.

572
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,060
Oh, you too?

573
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,390
Crazy. Who is that?

574
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,420
I'm not sure. But how did you get the message?

575
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,170
I thought it was weird so I deleted it right away.

576
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,360
There's not much to see.

577
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,490
Thanks.

578
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,380
Should I tell you what Baek Ho Rang hates the most?

579
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,270
If I tell you how to screw Baek Ho Rang over, would you reveal it?

580
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,860
About Baek Ho Rang

581
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,300
Give me Baek Ho Rang's account information. You don't have any use for it anymore.

582
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,060
I'm pretty sure she was the bully, too.

583
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,200
You did pretend to be her.

584
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,030
- What?
- "You don't need it anymore" is what it says here.

585
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,820
If you did something wrong, admit it. Don't brashly say the opposite.

586
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,870
Who the hell is she?

587
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,910
Hey, Baek Ho Rang. If possible, don't look at your phone for the time being.

588
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:38,830
People are bound to forget soon anyway, so don't work yourself up and just go to sleep.

589
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,690
Alright. I will.

590
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,750
I'll get going. See you at school!

591
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,390
[Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek]
What are you doing?

592
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,200
Kang Jae Yi just left.

593
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,290
I heard you told her my address?

594
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,430
Yeah, I hoped you wouldn't be alone.

595
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,260
Thanks to you, I didn't look at my phone all day.

596
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,930
That's good to hear.

597
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,780
Since Kang Jae Yi left, you can talk to me now.

598
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,250
Don't look at anything else.

599
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,780
Are you at the library?

600
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,440
But what is Ho Rang going to do?

601
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,740
There are so many comments on the community forum.

602
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,660
I know, right? But when I looked, there were a lot of people saying "don't say anything unless there's evidence".

603
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,090
- I thought it was a relief.
- Me too.

604
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,960
Really?

605
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,880
I'm not sure.

606
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,400
It's been a few days, but there hasn't been anything new. I think it'll be fine.

607
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,380
Hello.

608
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,160
Hi.

609
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,530
What is this? Why isn't this coming out?

610
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,770
Help her pull out her chair.

611
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,890
We can't afford any chairs if you break it.

612
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,960
I'll do it.

613
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,120
I'll pull it out from now on.

614
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,610
Yeah, you pull it out.

615
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,420
Hello.

616
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,400
Everyone's here, right?

617
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,410
Everyone gets ready for the broadcast, and afterward, we'll have a meeting, so please wait a little.

618
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,200
Alright!

619
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,200
Oh, Sunbaenim!

620
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,270
Have you been the remote control for the beam light?

621
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,470
I left it on my desk but can't seem to find it.

622
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,630
Oh, that?

623
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,990
Baek Ho Rang.

624
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,410
Hm? Where'd you put the remote?

625
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,470
Oh, that? You put it upstairs yesterday, so—

626
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,600
Yesterday?

627
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,860
You put it upstairs?

628
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,560
- Yesterday?
- The weekend?

629
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,450
Hold on.

630
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,110
Did you two come here yesterday?

631
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,890
We looked over something.

632
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,490
- On the weekend?
- Why?

633
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,760
Why?

634
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,510
Why the two of you?

635
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,390
What are you doing? Get ready.

636
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,450
What are you doing? The two of you get ready. The two of you!

637
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,790
Get ready.

638
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,590
So there isn't anything unusual to prepare,

639
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:14,930
I think we just need to prepare the things that the teachers ask us.

640
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,390
- Jin Gook.
- Yeah.

641
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,920
- Tae Won Teacher agreed to film all the retreat's programs.
- Uh-huh.

642
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,240
- He just asked us to bring the camcorder and camera.
- Okay.

643
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,730
Are they going to play our school's promotional video during recreation?

644
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,640
Yeah. If other clubs need a video to be played, ask them in advance for the file.

645
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,900
Okay, that's it for today's meeting. I'll head out first since I need to pick something up from the classroom.

646
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,720
Good job!

647
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,130
Baek Ho Rang. Come talk to me for a sec.

648
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,660
Tell me. I need to get going.

649
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,390
What... what happened to you?

650
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,960
I know that I was the one who said let's not talk to each other.

651
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,230
But let me ask one thing.

652
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,170
What is that picture?

653
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,790
And who is the person that uploaded it?

654
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,140
Why do you want to know?

655
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,990
I know.

656
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,270
That the reason you joined the broadcasting club is all because of that story submission.

657
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,320
So what? If you need confirmation that I'm the bully—

658
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,200
Tell me.

659
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,830
What happened that day?

660
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:16,430
Is the reason you started distancing yourself from me related to that?

661
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,030
What are you hiding?

662
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,090
Baek Ho Rang, tell me.

663
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,950
Don't try to know.

664
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,460
You can just believe what you want to.

665
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:20,540
The reason that wars start is because on party wants to steal something from another.

666
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,950
Let's take an example from the Joseon dynasty.

667
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,200
As seen on page 91,

668
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,270
in the year 1863, Go Jeong...

669
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:32,020
But there's no proof of anyone saying they were victims of Baek Ho Rang's bullying.

670
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,850
That's right. It's about time for someone to speak up.

671
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,200
I think someone is just making stuff up.

672
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,950
In this example,

673
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:48,480
I've been bullied by Baek Ho Rang before... It was so hard on me.

674
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,910
Here are all the ones I couldn't give to you over the weekend. I bought more to give you, but we never met.

675
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,580
I went to a cafe instead.

676
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,110
What are you doing today? Are you studying at the cafe again?

677
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,610
No. Today, I need to edit a video so I'll leave after that.

678
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,050
Edit a video?

679
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:08,330
We need to use the behind the scenes clips from the festival to promote our club.

680
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,390
- I see... You do all of that yourself?
- Yes.

681
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,470
You're so cool.

682
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,550
I have a lot of videos I took backstage during the performance. Should I send them to you?

683
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,050
Wanna see it?

684
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,800
Look, look.

685
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,250
I have the full version on my laptop, but I can see you walking around here.

686
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,870
- Can you email this to me?
- Sure!

687
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,950
This one.

688
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,900
I'll text you my email address.

689
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,030
Look.

690
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,750
[Teacher Park Tae Won (Broadcasting Club)]
Return the keys to the rooftop by tomorrow.

691
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,030
Ho Rang is working hard. Work hard with the filming.

692
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,290
Yes, thank you.

693
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,980
Is it okay for you to use your status as a broadcasting club member like this?

694
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,190
I didn't lie. I just told him I needed it.

695
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,970
It's very interesting.

696
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,030
What is?

697
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:33,420
You always appear right before I hit rock bottom.

698
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,760
What are you going to hit rock bottom about this time?

699
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,910
Just... this and that.

700
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,600
Go Eun Taek. I read fewer comments thanks to you this weekend.

701
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,420
Since I was texting you all day.

702
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,000
That's why I texted you.

703
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,880
I'm a bit grateful to you.

704
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,880
Usually, I would've seen it twice as much, but it was cut in half.

705
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,930
What the heck. I tried really hard, but it was only cut down by half?

706
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,900
Yeah. Just that much.

707
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,650
I feel like you've become a part of my daily life now.

708
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:40,310
That's why I'm scared.

709
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,330
I feel like I need to show you everything about myself now,

710
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:49,500
but I'm not ready to do that yet.

711
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,940
You can tell me then.

712
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,290
When you're ready to show me everything.

713
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,410
I'll enter your life then.

714
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,220
Don't worry.

715
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:25,340
I will stay here, like this, listening to you.

716
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,510
I think what you shared with me today is quite a development in itself.

717
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,930
[Kim Yoo Sin]
The file was large, so I emailed it to you.

718
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,030
Thanks.

719
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,010
The current time is 10:09 am.

720
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,530
I'm so nervous about this.

721
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,250
We'll head on stage now.

722
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,260
I'll escort you this way.

723
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,110
I'm going in now.

724
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,270
It's totally all about him.

725
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,830
What part of this am I supposed to use?

726
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,550
Sorry!

727
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,790
Baek Ho Rang! Do you have the USB from earlier? I need it.

728
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:13,200
Ah, the USB? Just a moment.

729
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,030
I put it here. Where has it gone?

730
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:19,550
I'm certain I put it in here earlier.

731
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,630
- What are you doing?
- I'm just checking something.

732
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,510
The festival video? You're doing this already?

733
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,360
I told her we didn't need that soon, and that I would do it.

734
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,100
- You did?
- I think Eun Hae Tee was taking me to do it.

735
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,340
So Hyeon, you haven't left yet?

736
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,600

What do you think about Baek Ho Rang?

Well... I don't know her that well.

752
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,790
Welcome to all students at this retreat.

753
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:08,390
I think Do Woo Jae was smiling a lot while looking at you. Isn't it weird?

754
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,330
No. It's pretty.

755
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:14,940
I had something to check, but I was right.

756
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:19,740
It was you. The person that posted Baek Ho Rang's picture.
