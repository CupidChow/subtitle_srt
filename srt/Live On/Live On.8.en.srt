1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,380
What the people who like me wanted

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,520
- Final Episode -

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,750
was the truth.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,010
Say it, Baek Ho Rang.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,490
Even though they didn't want to see it

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,180
or want to believe it

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,370
I'll wait.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,640
the people who like me wanted to know the truth.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
Till you tell me.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,410
If I muster up the courage to speak the truth,

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm sure my friends will believe me

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,320
and support me.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,320
That is why I've decided to no longer hide and speak the truth.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,360
Not just for me

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,780
but also for my friends.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,560
Honestly, I'm still afraid of how people will look at me,

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,020
but now I am not going to run away.

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,200
Because the people who love me

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,550
are by my side.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,050
Next week is the video festival.
Let's meet at the video festival of SHBS.

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,130
Hey! How can you do this without my permission!?

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,720
What are you...? What is...? Seriously, hey!

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
You'll be suspended for this!

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,420
Hey, Baek Ho Rang! Hey!

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,240
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,870
- Hey, Baek Ho Rang!
- I'll open it.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,050
Open the door!

28
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,920
Open the door!

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,100
Hey, Baek Ho Rang!

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,730
Did you know you're annoying?

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,140
- Kang Jae Yi.
- Why were you enduring it by yourself?

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,320
- Hey, are you crying?
- Nonsense! I'm not.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,430
I get it, so let go now. So frustrating.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,150
Of course, you aren't affectionate. Acting all tough.

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,860
- Don't smile, it's more annoying.
- Ho Rang!

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,940
Say it from here.

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,470
You should've told me.

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,270
Why is everyone crying?

39
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,930
Do I look like I can't cry, Ho Rang? I thought you were my best friend!

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,830
It doesn't mean your best friends just because you knew each other for a long time.

41
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,460
What? You were here too?

42
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,180
I was here first.

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,500
So what? She's my friend.

44
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,090
Sorry.

45
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,500
Thanks to you guys I was able to speak up

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,530
- Ho Rang...
- Hey.

47
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,760
Say it from here.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,970
Um... Where's Ji So Hyeon?

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,590
- Oh, So Hyeon?
- Right! She wasn't herself earlier.

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,600
If you had seen her arguing with Jung Hee Soo—

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Who argued with who?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,030
Very well done!

53
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,800
The ones who were supposed to have a day of work and study caused trouble.

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,160
- Teacher, about this—
- And one of you made sure everyone heard it.

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,670
You, are you a gangster?

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,870
Why did you hit her?

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,000
I told you she's crazy. You should've heard what she said earlier.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I got hit too.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,430
Look at this too. My palm is all busted. It is redder than yours.

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,830
- Why are you here?
- I came because you asked me to.

61
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,320
- Me?
- Yes.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,490
- Then you also stand here because you are here anyway.
- Eh?

63
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,130
Where you a part of this too?

64
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,890
- Yes.
- Stand right there.

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,970
You guys should know that you caused a huge ruckus today.

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,710
Write apology letters and, next week, you'll clean the auditorium, got it?

67
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,470
Go now! I have a headache.

68
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,030
- And you, Baek Ho Rang.
- Yes?

69
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,080
I heard you're going to have a work-study day until today. You can go home, do whatever you want.

70
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,530
[Teacher's Room]

71
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,530
He's so annoying. Why clean the auditorium?

72
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,760
- Because you had a fight.
- Be quiet.

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,300
- You do it.
- No, you do it all.
- Why me? You do it!
- You did it, not me.

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,680
- Baek Ho Rang, you're going home, right?
- Huh?

75
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,500
- Oh, yes.
- Let's go together, we take you there.

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,130
There's no need.

77
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,300
Why not, we'll take you there.

78
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,950
I'm really fine. I also...

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,820
have something to talk to her about.

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,480
Did you know it?

81
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,860
- What?
- About my broadcast today.

82
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,790
Oh yeah, Go Eun Taek told me.

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,760
He worried a lot when you didn't come to school.

84
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,180
I know.

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,340
You too.

86
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,290
- Huh?
- Kang Jae Yi told me you were also worried.

87
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,480
I heard you talked to Jung Hee Soo during my broadcast.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,470
I told you to act like you don't know, you really don't listen.

89
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,640
Sorry.

90
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,470
I thought that I should tell you this.

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,250
- And—
- I—

92
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,030
- What?
- What?

93
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,110
You can go first.

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,030
Oh, right.

95
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,230
- When I saw your broadcast—
- Isn't that Baek Ho Rang?

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,820
- Wow, she didn't go home yet.
- It's like seeing a celebrity!
- You're right!

97
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,830
That's really Baek Ho Rang!

98
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,550
Class is about to start, let's talk later.

99
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,540
Yes, that's right.

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,500
I'll be going now.

101
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,600
I'll...

102
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,540
text you.

103
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,540
Okay, enjoy class.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,320
- That's her.
- Oh, she acted like a victim to do that?

105
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,470
- She's a weirdo.
- Hey, that's Jung Hee Soo.

106
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,800
She's so shameless.

107
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,970
Don't tell the others.

108
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,030
It's a misunderstanding.

109
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,980
What I said to you wasn't a lie.

110
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,670
- Baek Ho Rang—
- I'll leave the door unlocked,

111
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,880
so pack your things and leave the broadcasting team while there's no one there.

112
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,410
- Hey, Go Eun Taek, hear the whole story—
- That's enough.

113
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,470
I believe Go Eun Taek is already being very lenient with you.

114
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,670
- What about Baek Ho Rang? Did she go home?
- Yeah, she said that when I contacted her.

115
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,290
I'm relieved now. Before, I felt like there was something gnawing at me.

116
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,520
Hey Kim Yoo Sin, take a look at this.

117
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,110
- What?
- Which one do you think is prettier?

118
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,310
- This one.
- Okay, if I get the other one it should be Do Woo Jae's taste.

119
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,210
What's with the watch?

120
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,210
It's my 1000 day anniversary with Do Woo Jae soon.

121
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,510
- I see.
- So I plan on buying him a gift and surprising him.

122
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,010
It's a secret.

123
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,940
You promised to surprise each other?

124
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,990
What? Does that make sense?

125
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,570
We prepare it on our own and surprise each other with it.

126
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,110
It will be like when we started dating.

127
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,690
- You guys are really something.
- Why?

128
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,510
- That means you fought for one thousand days.
- Hey! It's not like we fight every day.

129
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,010
We don't fight anymore.

130
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,230
We won't fight.

131
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,240
We don't fight.

132
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,680
You didn't need to rush. I told you I would come to wait for you out front.

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,610
I wanted to see you.

134
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,510
- Are you coming with us to eat?
- No, I'm going home.

135
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,400
Coming to think about it, why are you here?

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,170
- Is Ji So Hyeon at the broadcasting studio?
- Yeah, she must be busy because of the festival.

137
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,430
My So Hyeon will get sick if she works too hard.

138
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,500
Right. Speaking of which, who prepared the broadcast today?

139
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,740
I doubt Go Eun Taek would let it slide, being so meticulous.

140
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,580
Eun Taek prepared it.

141
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,910
He did, Go Eun Taek?

142
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,260
Eun Taek! I didn't see him like that, but he is very loving.

143
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,160
You're right, but not as much as Do Woo Jae.

144
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,170
Do Woo Jae, I don't need anything big, okay?

Ho Rang, I heard you were the victim.

147
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,820
- You seem so pitiful now.
- I said bad things about you. I feel bad now.
- People are too quick to judge.

148
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,250
- Cheer up!
- Cheer up!

149
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,340
Actually, I am a victim of school violence.

150
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,430
Isn't that Baek Ho Rang? She didn't leave yet.

151
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,420
- It's like seeing a celebrity!
- You're right!

Incoming Call - Go Eun Taek

153
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,870
Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek

154
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,460
What do you think?

155
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,780
What? You video called me to show me that?

156
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,460
You probably missed it earlier since you went home right away. Pretty, right?

157
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,910
I guess so. It's nice.

158
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,270
I actually called to see your face—

159
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,480
What? Aren't you at home?

160
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,900
I am.

161
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,780
You wear that at home? Did you go somewhere?

162
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,660
What are you saying? This is my normal self. A totally natural look.

163
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,660
Natural?

164
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,140
What?

165
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,100
Are you going home now?

166
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,980
Yes. Because of the video production, I had some things to take care of.

167
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,870
No wonder you took so long to call...

168
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,320
Ah, did you wait for my call?

169
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
What? I mean... I did wait

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,380
but I didn't wait for it that much.

171
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,650
Don't laugh.

172
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,020
I didn't laugh. I normally have a smiling face.

173
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,080
As if. You always look like you're frowning.

174
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Hey, you!

175
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,270
So, how was it?

176
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,920
You made a big decision to speak up.

177
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,350
And it must've been difficult.

178
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,170
Honestly, I'm worried.

179
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,400
It's true that I'm more worried than I am relieved.

180
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,570
But,

181
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,680
it's not bad.

182
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,380
I feel relieved.

183
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm glad.

184
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,220
Go Eun Taek.

185
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah?

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
Should we go on a date?

187
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,860
Ho Rang, I'm sorry.

188
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,150
I really wanted to see you but I promised that I would go volunteer at the library with So Hyeon.

189
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,550
I'm sorry too. It's almost 1000 days with Do Woo Jae, so I have to go buy a present.

190
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,930
I had plans today too. Congrats on the anniversary.

191
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,960
Baek Ho Rang, are you awake?

192
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,570
There's 35 minutes and 22 seconds until we meet.

193
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,350
Oh, gosh!

194
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,280
So cold!

195
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,810
Why are you taking it off? It looks cute.

196
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,160
What?

197
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,350
You have something.

198
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,990
But, your hair—

199
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,970
Does it look awkward?

200
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,430
Is it bad?

201
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,150
No... I'm hungry. Let's go.

202
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,960
Wait for me.

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,780
Volunteer Service

204
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,270
Wait for me here.

205
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,210
So Hyeon, I'm so excited. How much longer do you have of volunteer time?

206
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,920
After I do this, I have ten hours left.

207
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,780
Then, you can come to the library two more times with me, right?

208
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,120
How much time do you have left?

209
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
I filled it all.

210
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,040
You did?

211
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,300
My dream last year was to become Mother Theresa so I would leave school early because of volunteer work.

212
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,650
Then why are you here today?

213
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,490
Of course, I came to be with you.

214
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,420
I even rescheduled with Ho Rang because of this.

215
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,850
How is she doing?

216
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,540
Who? Ho Rang?

217
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,330
Gosh, Ji So Hyeon!

218
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,690
You really are Ji So Hyeon. Long time no see!

219
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,170
True! How have you been?

220
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,150
I've been well, and you?

221
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,790
Ah, this is my middle school classmate.

222
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,680
Hi, I'm Kim Yoo Sin.

223
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,110
Oh, hi.

224
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,830
Volunteers, please come this way.

225
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

226
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,470
It's really been a while.

227
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,000
How did you find out about this place?

228
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
You like sushi from this place.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,790
Me?

230
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,580
Didn't you leave the library last time to eat this?

231
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,480
No, I went out to eat dinner with you.

232
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,270
Huh?

233
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,820
Kim Yoo Sin said that you always eat alone. I wanted to eat with you.

234
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,960
Hey, Go Eun Taek...

235
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,700
Do you like texting or calling better?

236
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,460
Calling. Texting has no affection.

237
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,660
You're the same as Kim Yoo Shin.

238
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,020
Does he call you often?

239
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,940
Pretty often.

240
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,840
He once called me twelve times in a day.

241
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,990
He's a nuisance, that Kim Yoo Sin.

242
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,650
Even when I dated, I never received over ten calls.

243
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,570
Why? When you date, I guess you called over ten times.

244
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,570
Huh?

245
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,810
Tell me. For how long have you dated someone?

246
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,090
What for?

247
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm just curious.

248
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,960
- 200 days.
- Oh!

249
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,760
You didn't even think about it, you answered right away.

250
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,250
It's because you asked.

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,400
You have good memory.

252
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,610
Or maybe... you're just senseless?

253
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,970
Hey, you started—

254
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,530
It must have been so easy for you since everything fits.

255
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,280
Baek Ho Rang.

256
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,500
Are you jealous right now?

257
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,630
Nonsense. Hurry up and eat.

258
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,770
No, I think you are mad.

259
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,600
What are you saying? I said no. We have a lot to do today.

260
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,340
You have 1 minute and 20 seconds to eat everything.

261
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,300
It's only been 8 minutes since this came.

262
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,720
I don't know.

263
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,670
♫ My feelings for you ♫

264
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,250
Hey, it's narrow. Move aside.

265
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,140
You should move to the side. I also have nowhere to go.

266
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,180
♫ Are now disappearing ♫

267
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,240
♫ Your shadowed face ♫

268
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,020
♫ You can never... ♫

269
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

270
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,370
Don't fall asleep today, be sure to watch the ending.

271
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,030
- I won't fall asleep, but did you only buy one?
- Yeah.

272
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,290
There was only one left.

273
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,580
♫ When my loneliness calls out to you ♫

274
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:10,160
Your hand looks cold.

275
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,990
♫ into my heart ♫

276
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,730
So Hyeon, is it hard? Should I do it?

277
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,980
No, I did everything here but this.

278
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,300
You must like this book.

279
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,370
Do you know it?

280
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,550
Of course.

281
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,170
The author also wrote this, did you read it?

282
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,010
- I read everything besides his newest work.
- Oh!

283
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,050
I have the new book at my house. Should I lend it to you?

284
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,520
What?

285
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,950
Nothi—

286
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,750
It's quite a surprise. You look like you really don't like books.

287
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,140
So Hyeon, you're so good at dissing people while smiling.

288
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,030
My mom doesn't make me study, but she has always made me read.

289
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,390
But... then perhaps, did it come across as an unexpected charm?

290
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,450
Did I earn some points?

291
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,890
Should I help you with this?

292
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,700
Yeah.

293
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,910
- So Hyeon!
- Hm.

294
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,580
It's really been a long time, right?

295
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,250
How long has it been? Three years?

296
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,130
Right. Three years.

297
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,050
I think that we also volunteered at the library together then too. I remember that time.

298
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,430
Library volunteer? Did we?

299
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,020
What? Don't you remember?

300
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,260
School library volunteer, we did it together.

301
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,010
I can't remember, sorry.

302
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,790
Do you remember we used to date?

303
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,990
We used to date?

304
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,390
Wow, you are too much. You forgot that? We dated for a month.

305
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, really?

306
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,240
The male student over there, can you come here for a minute?

307
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,810
I'll be back.

308
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,420
So Hyeon, you are going to roll this over, right? I'll do it.

309
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,330
It's fine, I'll do it.

310
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,150
I'll do it.

311
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,240
[Subway]

312
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,520
I will help you with your order.

313
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,890
Please give me a meatball sandwich. And please heat it up.

314
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,140
And you?

315
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,800
I'll take a steak and cheese.

316
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,270
Tell me the truth. You cried earlier, right?

317
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,740
I heard you sniffle at the end.

318
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,440
What are you saying? That's not true.

319
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,930
It's true... I saw you blow your nose on your sleeves.

320
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,650
I didn't blow on my sleeves. It was on a tissue.

321
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,520
Says you, who was so touched by the movie you memorized every line.

322
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,460
That's because I did the ending for the first time with you.

323
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,790
Why are you becoming more and more shameless as the days go by?

324
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,130
So, where are we going next? It's your turn now.

325
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,380
Next time... there is a place that I wanted to go with you.

326
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,360
What is this? I thought you took pictures well.

327
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,800
- It came out well.
- It's so awkward. What do you mean?

328
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,860
It's because it's my first time taking a picture with a bare face without any sponsored products.

329
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,810
Take it again. I'll keep this one.

330
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,930
You want to take it again? You take pictures as you do a takeover test.

331
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,890
Since we came here already, we need a proper one.

332
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,660
You deleted all of your social media photos.

333
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,730
Tigrrrrrre

334
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,080
Delete

335
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,090
Do you wish to delete your post?

336
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,640
Delete

337
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,750
Since you aren't doing that anymore, make taking photos with me your new hobby.

338
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,780
So you need to do well this time, Baek Ho Rang.

339
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,620
- This came out well.
- Well, it's not bad.

340
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,360
Where did I leave my phone?

341
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,080
- Should I call you?
- Yes.

342
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,920
Ah, I left it inside. What a relief.

343
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,620
What's wrong?

344
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,890
Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek? Isn't that too cold?

345
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,710
I need to save it like this, so it's easy to recognize.

346
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,790
You can't even recognize just the name "Go Eun Taek"?

347
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,240
Did you also set other people's contact like this too?

348
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,440
- Yes, I told you so.
- Let me see.

349
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,900
See, look. If you look here,

350
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,950
Yoo Sin ❤︎

351
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,770
What is this heart?

352
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,210
What heart?

353
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,070
Wow, what is this? I really didn't know about this.

354
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,900
- It's fine.
- I said I really didn't know about this.

355
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,280
Let me change this. Look. Kim Yoo Sin. It's good, right?

356
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,500
- It's fine.
- Hey, don't be upset with me.

357
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,950
- Your arms don't hurt?
- Yes.

358
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,120
Yoo Sin Heart? Do you want to die? When did you touch my phone?

359
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,970
I love you too.

360
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,050
Your Face account is still the same. Can I message you more often?

361
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,800
- Yoo Sin.
- Yes?

362
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,060
But why do you—

363
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,340
- It's nothing. Because of you, time went by really fast.
- Really?

364
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,760
Then next time you go volunteering, you must call me. Got it?

365
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,960
I got it.

366
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,550
Ah... but since the sun went down, it's really cold, right?

367
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,130
You are cold? This can't be. You wear this, So Hyeon.

368
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,080
No, it's fine. You are only wearing one layer. It's fine. You just wear it.

369
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,650
I'm not cold at all. You put it on.

370
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,780
Thank you.

371
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,090
Yoo Sin... but today...

372
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,070
You are cold, right? This can't be.

373
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,000
No. I told you I'm not cold at all.

374
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,870
You can say what you were gonna say. What were you going to say?

375
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,740
No... I just wanted to ask if you knew what Baek Ho Rang was doing.

376
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,380
She said that she's going out to meet somebody.

377
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,510
So Hyeon, I'm really not trying to chat you up. So don't misunderstand.

378
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,740
Yes.

379
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,660
- Can I put my hands inside the padded pockets?
- Of course.

380
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,650
Thank you.

381
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,850
She said that she's going to meet somebody in the morning.

382
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,460
I thought Kang Jae Yi and I were her only friends. Well, it's a relief.

383
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,170
But she said that on the broadcast. That she couldn't tell her only friend.

384
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,490
I thought that was me. But when I asked, she said it wasn't. Who could it be?

385
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,670
It's really pretty here.

386
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,810
I thought you would like it.

387
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,570
How did you find a place like this?

388
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,230
I thought about it until dawn.

389
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,110
About where you would like the most.

390
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,890
It's fascinating.

391
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,600
What is?

392
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,590
When we first met, I really didn't imagine that we would be doing this.

393
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,700
When we first met, you were really— ah...

394
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,180
What are you saying? You were really not my taste either.

395
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,740
To think that I would really be laughing and eating food with you like this...

396
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,340
And to think that I would be here with you like this, I really never imagined it.

397
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
And

398
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,280
I really didn't know that I would like you this much.

399
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,740
I like you, Go Eun Taek.

400
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,570
I should have told you this sooner.

401
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,460
But I never thought the timing was quite right.

402
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:12,010
Let's date. I'm sorry that I made you wait so long.

403
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,380
Baek Ho Rang.

404
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,100
When I first confessed to you,

405
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,530
I thought I really liked you then.

406
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,590
But that wasn't it.

407
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,680
I think I like you more now.

408
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,450
So much that it can't compare to then.

409
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,390
It's good I waited.

410
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,220
I waited for you to say those words all day.

411
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,810
But, are we really dating now?

412
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,730
Then...

413
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,580
Then call my name without saying the surname.

414
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,840
Hey, what now...?

415
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,130
I'm not here as broadcasting club president, but as your boyfriend.

416
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,900
Ah, hey... wait a minute.

417
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,810
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

418
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,150
Ho Rang.

419
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,370
Thank you.

420
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,830
I thank you too.

421
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,680
It was really pretty there.

422
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,910
Right?

423
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,770
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

424
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,800
Everyone is hectic because of the video production, right?

425
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,150
Yes, since we don't have much time left.

426
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,490
Then, Go Eun Taek, should I go back into broadcasting?

427
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,710
I've been thinking about it since yesterday, but I feel wronged.

428
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,630
I mean, I pulled so many all-nighters for that.

429
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,530
I want to be with the others until the end.

430
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,340
If I skip out, then Ji So Hyeon will take over.

431
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,790
I heard that you talked with Ji So Hyeon for a bit yesterday.

432
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,570
- Yes.
- Did she said that?

433
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,170
I didn't tell you yesterday because I thought it would be hectic.

434
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,270
When I asked to let you do broadcasting again,

435
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,720
she was really relieved.

436
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,560
It seems like Ji So Hyeon thinks about you as much as I do.

437
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,630
I know that too.

438
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,070
I talked to her yesterday because I know that,

439
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:48,290
But it was a bit chaotic. To be honest, it is still a bit awkward.

440
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,250
So in a short while, I want to tell her again properly.

441
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,360
You can do it today.

442
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,000
I—

443
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,400
Spicy Rice Cakes

444
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,390
I bought spicy rice cakes, wanna eat some?

445
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,030
Go inside and call me.

446
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,550
This place is just as good as it was in the past.

447
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,370
Exactly.

448
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,030
You know that we are very awkward right now, right?

449
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,570
That's expected.

450
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,540
It's been two years since we've been apart.

451
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,950
That's right, two years.

452
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,720
Thank you.

453
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,070
I wanted to tell you this yesterday

454
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,990
but I couldn't.

455
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,220
Thank you, for not pretending to not know.

456
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,570
I also have something I didn't get to tell you yesterday.

457
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,450
Do you know what I thought when I saw you on the broadcast?

458
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,420
I thought you were cool.

459
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,710
I never had any sympathy towards you.

460
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,210
You were the first person who talked to me.

461
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,860
- When I only talked with guys...
- Why do you make excuses?

462
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,300
You're also the first person who told me it wasn't weird and not to make excuses.

463
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,600
So you were always a great person to me.

464
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,570
That's the same now.

465
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,060
If I happened

466
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,940
to find out the truth then,

467
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,740
nothing would have changed.

468
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,430
Even the fact that you were my friend.

469
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,930
I'm sorry too.

470
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,780
The fact that I turned away not knowing that you were having such a hard time.

471
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:57,670
I should have held onto it once more and asked "why are you like this?".

472
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,110
You did.

473
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,290
That's enough.

474
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,030
Do you remember what I told you before?

475
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,030
That I had to eat spicy rice cakes with you, here,

476
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,600
for the day to feel complete?

477
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,630
Of course I do.

478
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,320
This was the most relaxing time of the day.

479
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,840
Want to sleep over?

480
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,600
Second grade?

481
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,020
We lied pretending to be sick to leave early, but we got caught.

482
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, right. When we mixed up our stories.

483
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,600
Hey, we didn't mix up our stories. You said you had indigestion and got caught eating a fried sausage.

484
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,430
What are you saying? That was after you had a slip of the tongue and got caught.

485
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,990
- Did I?
- Yeah.

486
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,440
Anyway, it was something about our facial expressions.

487
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,170
That's right.

488
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,940
Hold on.

489
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,030
So Hyeon, should I lend it to you tomorrow?

490
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,290
Yeah, thanks.

491
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,450
Is that good? I was thinking about buying it.

492
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,710
Yes, my skin keeps breathing out because it's cold.

493
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,570
It's pretty good.

494
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,640
Who was that, Kim Yoo Sin?

495
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,210
He was very elated since morning because he was going to volunteer with you.

496
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,210
Be good to him... if you are just gonna talk with meaningless people.

497
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,000
You be good to him, he thinks about you a lot.

498
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,830
He's just trying to gain something from me.

499
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,090
You don't mean that.

500
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,980
So, are you dating Go Eun Taek?

501
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,670
What?

502
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
- Yeah.
- Really.

503
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,580
Since when? Since when?

504
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,570
Since today.

505
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,310
Woo Sol, did you get home safe?

506
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,320
But would Do Woo Jae like it?

507
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,230
Of course. Or he still isn't in his right mind.

508
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,970
Do Woo Jae just came in, Unni.

509
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,020
Really, how is it?

510
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,890
Does it look like he prepared anything?

511
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,780
I'm not sure, he seems the same as usual.

512
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,880
What if he doesn't do anything?

513
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
No way, how could he forget your first anniversary?

514
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,710
Don't worry. When I see it, Do Woo Jae recovered his consciousness.

515
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,330
I understand. You can't be so obvious in front of him, you know, right?

516
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,230
Ah, I know, I know. Unni, just trust in me.

517
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,850
Knock, will you?

518
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,680
You are very childish.

519
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,610
What? Why?

520
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,140
Nothing. At least you didn't forget it.

521
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,130
- Keep doing what you were doing.
- Hurry up and leave.

522
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,780
She's saying such nonsense.

523

524
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,080
My Woo Jae's 1000 days present. It's pretty, right?

525
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,540
You didn't leave yet? Late.

526
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,090
It's our anniversary date. Is being late such a big deal?

527
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,470
You'll be coming to school today, right?

528
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,670
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

529
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,340
- Then, who is the perpetrator?
- I don't know. Who did it?

530
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,630
Hey, I told you that it wasn't Baek Ho Rang.

531
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,720
What? You talked badly about her too.

532
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,410
When did I?

533
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,920
Stop acting like you didn't.

534
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,550
Here, you can never take this off.

535
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,250
It's too visible over there.

536
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,600
Then, on... on the inside?

537
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,920
Are you upset?

538
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,630
Why would I? It's not like it's the first time you do whatever you want.

539
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,840
Hey! When did I?

540
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,060
That's you.

541
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,410
Going on your path without thinking about other people's thoughts.

542
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,780
Done. Is it good here?

543
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,320
It's not bad.

544
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,150
Not bad? I think it's very good.

545
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,520
You're here.

546
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,980
Yeah.

547
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,060
How is it? It's been a while since you've been in here.

548
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,270
I feel like this might have been a mistake. I should have taken a longer break.

549
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,070
You really can't leave on your own now.

550
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:27,340
And also Baek Ho Rang, I'm saying this just in case...

551
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,060
I'm not gonna take sides or be obvious that I like you, so don't be too upset.

552
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,620
What are you saying? Did you ever let it go because you liked me?

553
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,120
Even when you confessed to me, you made a fuss that I lost your USB.

554
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,360
- Here.
- What is this?

555
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,040
You said your arm hurts from shaking your handwarmer. This is an electric one.

556
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,600
So how you work this is—

557
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,950
Sunbae! Did you decide to join the team again?

558
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,130
- Yeah.
- What a relief.

559
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,870
You knew that I was always on your side, right?

560
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,570
- Me too.
- Me too.

561
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,770
- Stop trying to suck up to her.
- It's true, I missed her.

562
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,900
Thank you both, you guys too.

563
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,650
Why are you over there, Sunbaenim? Do we have a broadcast today?

564
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,690
Huh, ah.

565
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,650
I was just doing something.

566
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,460
Let's start the meeting.

567
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,500
Second-year, Class one, Kang Jae Yi. You're late.

568
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,750
You startled me.

569
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,020
Good thing it's you. If I get penalty points today, I'll have to clean the school walls.

570
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,550
You did get penalty points.

571
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,870
I already wrote it.

572
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:47,420
Why? I was late because of you, it's only right that you let me off.

573
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,850
How could I do that?

574
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,570
I was actually late because of our date, look at this.

575
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,970
You're pretty, but I can't.

576
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,000
I prepared for our date too, and I was early.

577
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,790
What, were you preparing something?

578
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,080
Gosh, I had no idea.

579
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,380
Hurry up and go inside. I have to stay until 9 to check on this.

580
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,040
Got it, I'm going.

581
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,130
Bye.

582
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,060
So cute.

583
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,030
As you guys all know, Jung Hee Soo left the team.

584
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,460
Ah, it didn't seem like she would do that. Why did she do it?

585
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,190
I heard she's transfering.

586
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,980
- Really?
- Yeah.

587
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,900
Jung Hee Soo is transferring?

588
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,840
That's what I heard.

589
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,400
Just think that it was just bad luck.

590
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,130
I heard you're transferring.

591
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,790
Yeah.

592
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,910
Go and live properly there, so you don't end up like this again.

593
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,110
What?

594
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,300
Always comparing this person and that person, you felt guilty about it too.

595
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,020
Stop caring about what people think.

596
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,910
You too should just live comfortably.

597
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,230
If you think it's hard on your own, try to find a good person.

598
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,340
Because I'm trying to do that.

599
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,060
Did you guys fight again?

600
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,130
What is it this time?

601
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,120
I have to clean the auditorium today.

602
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,320
Suddenly?

603
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,260
We're getting new equipment, so they want us to clean it.

604
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,390
What is this? We planned everything that we are going to do today.

605
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,460
It can't be helped then.

606
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,780
Let's go tomorrow, we don't need to go today.

607
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,240
What?

608
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,030
Why does it not have to be today?

609
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,180
Huh?

610
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,100
For you, our 1000 days is just something that can be celebrated today, tomorrow, or any other day?

611
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,120
Is it just a meaningless day?

612
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,760
Anniversary?

613
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,010
What, did you forget our anniversary?

614
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,370
Isn't that why you dressed up today?

615
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,440
You said you reserved a restaurant, too.

616
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,800
That...

617
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,540
I bought this for you anyway, so just take it.

618
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,740
I'm going.

619
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,540
Jae Yi.

620
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,770
I'll call you later, I feel like we'll keep fighting if I stay.

621
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,980
How could he forget our anniversary?

622
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,490
You said you guys even promised each other.

623
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,630
I thought so too, but I guess not.

624
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,490
So I just gave him his gift and left.

625
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,980
You must be disappointed.

626
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,310
But what's sadder is that we decided to tell each other everything, but he is shutting himself up.

627
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,140
So Hyeon, not all guys are like that, so don't have a stereotype.

628
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,010
You didn't even get caught. Why are you here?

629
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,000
Why do you complain even I help?

630
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,780
Then do mine too.

631
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,460
Why would I do that? I might do So Hyeon's.

632
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,890
It must not have been a big fight.

633
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,100
Right. It's not a situation to turn it upside down.

634
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,880
We decided not to do so. I'll talk to him later again.

635
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,780
But I'm getting angrier the more I think about it. Forgetting this is too much.

636
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,640
Sorry for being late.

637
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,670
What's wrong? You are being late?

638
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,690
What should I do?

639
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:38,250
Move those things to the waiting room then.

640
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,420
So Hyeon, what do you think of Kim Yoo Sin?

641
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,120
He's definitely sincere about his feelings for you. Just look at him.

642
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,880
So Hyeon, I'll do all this so you can just rest.

643
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,170
I think that you have some feelings too.

644
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,590
Right? She looks so comfortable when she is with Kim Yoo Sin.

645
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,610
I do?

646
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:09,050
The bystanders know well.

647
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,790
Think about it well just like she said.

648
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,810
I think that it would be nice if you date a guy you also like.

649
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,620
One minute guys.

650
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,860
Go and rest, I'll do it.

651
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,980
I want to hurry so that I can eat with you.

652
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,320
Why were you late earlier?

653
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,990
What? I had a call.

654
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,750
With who?

655
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,630
What?

656
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,490
Never mind, I'll hold this so you get that one.

657
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,620
He asked me to come out!

658
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,760
What is this?

659
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,940
Your anniversary gift.

660
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:33,040
We decided to surprise each other, but you are giving this now after the day is over.

661
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,890
I'm sorry, I thought it was next month.

662
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,390
What, our anniversary?

663
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:46,100
I took out the time that we were apart, so it would be exactly next month from today.

664
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,090
I thought we were going on a regular date today.

665
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,120
You should have said so...

666
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,170
That is why I came to tell you, otherwise you will misunderstand me again.

667
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
Hurry and take it.

668
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,200
I didn't know, and I was disappointed.

669
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,890
Thanks for telling me now.

670

You seemed very upset earlier but you were holding it in.

673
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,880
- Let's celebrate today and the next month also.
- Hmmm.

674
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,450
I love you, Do Woo Jae.

Do you remember when we used to date?

You still have the same Face account, I can contact you later, right?

Yoo Sin.

684
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,290
Why haven't you asked me once?

685
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,580
What?

686
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,160
This is the guy that you saw this weekend,

687
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,030
and you know that we used to date,

688
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,790
but you're not saying anything.

689
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,390
Because I am not in a place to ask you.

690
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,090
Of course, I'm jealous.

691
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:41,670
But you don't have to like me just because I like you, right?

692
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:47,310
I'm doing all this because I like you.

693
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,670
So it's only right that I expect nothing from you.

694
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,430
Don't you think?

695
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,540
How is that obvious?

696
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,890
They said that I look comfortable when I'm with you.

697
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:05,320
They're right.

698
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,680
Truthfully, I was very comfortable and sometimes took you for granted because you were always there with me.

699
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,580
So I accepted everything you did.

700
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,190
But no,

701
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,950
it was something I am grateful for.

702
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:31,140
So, thank you Yoo Sin. I thought I should tell you this at least once.

703

Did something happen?

00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:21,050
If it's hard to tell me, you don't have to,

710
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:25,600
but you helped me a lot,

711
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,400
so I could tell you everything.

712

Can't I do that when we're dating?

714
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:56,110
Earlier I was talking with my mom.

715
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,650
Hello?

716
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,170
Eun Taek, I'm leaving today.

717

Today?

718
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,980
It wasn't today originally.

719
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,010
I had some urgent work so I pre-poned my departure.

720
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,860
Okay.

721
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,680
And I might not be able to come back for a while once I leave.

722
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,140
If I knew this would've happened, I would've gone to see you once more.

723
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:40,990
Anyway, no matter what happens, be sure to call me.

724
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,790
I'll get going now.

725
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,760
Travel safely.

Mom

727
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:59,860
I couldn't say anything.

728
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,210
I thought of so many things to say,

729
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,020
but the words wouldn't come out.

730
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:16,760
So I called her according to her departure time,

731
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,450
but I was late.

732
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,020
I couldn't do it again.

733
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,490
I am so frustrating, right?

734
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,820
Does my mom also think so?

735
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,420
No.

736
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,710
She won't think that way.

737
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:48,800
She understands you,

738
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,620
so she will wait for you.

739
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,120
You also did that for me.

740
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:05,730
When I was afraid and couldn't tell you anything, you

741
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,250
waited for me, right?

742
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,270
Your mom would also do the same.

743
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,440
So,

744
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,900
you should also give yourself some time.

745
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,830
You can do that.

We can make mistakes sometimes, and give someone a smile

801
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:10,240
if we focus on this current moment, we will be recognized someday.

802
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,890
Also, when we all become one

803
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,700
the story will shine brighter.

804
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,700
Baek Ho Rang! Baek Ho Rang!

805
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,960
Baek Ho Rang! Baek Ho Rang!

806
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:13,160
♫ When the tiny lights blink, I flinch for a moment ♫

807
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,520
Live On

808
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,790
♫ I'm still getting used to "ON AIR", it's just the beginning ♫

809
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:25,780
♫ Yesterday was like a warning signal, it frightened
me (I know it now) In your shining eyes ♫

810
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:32,790
♫ It feels like I can become anything
Woo glamorous light up, My heart beats and beats ♫

811
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:39,790
♫ It's blinding and blinding so it's dangerous
Woo even when you get lost ♫

812
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:46,790
♫ Follow the line your heart drew,
Let's turn on your light and fly high ♫

813
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:53,770
♫ Colorful lights, hug me as much as you
want, Let's color your mind ♫

814
01:03:53,770 --> 01:04:00,750
♫ I get curious, It gets more
mysterious, Color the world with you ♫

815
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:07,720
♫ As you wish alright ♫

816
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:14,780
♫ Really really do ♫
