1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,210
Ji So Hyeon, how much do you know?

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,400
Let me also know.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,700
How come you only think of yourself every time? Two years ago you also did the same thing.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,470
You don't want others to know, so I kept my mouth shut, and did my best.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,130
What else am I supposed to do?

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,700
You should've pretended not to know until the end.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,990
How could I do that?

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,910
You are still a friend to me.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,150
You and I

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,920
stopped being friends two years ago.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,690
Let's

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,310
not get ourselves tangled again.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,760
3 missed calls - Go Eun Taek

14
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,450
Baek Ho Rang

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,570
Eun Taek, are you with Baek Ho Rang right now?

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,300
No, why?

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,030
There's another post.

18
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,350
Proof that Baek Ho Rang was a school bully

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,380
I still can't run a social media account because she traumatized me.

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,260
I wanted to die when I saw her doing well as a celebrity.

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,400
Social Media celebrity, Baek Ho Rang Bullying Scandal

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,120
- Episode 7 -

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,610
Wow. Where can I see that there is a victim? This is crazy.

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,510
I saw her hanging out with Lee Sun Joo in junior high, too.

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,100
I have proof if you need it.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,930
Hey, isn't it so shameless of Baek Ho Rang to keep her account open?

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,380
Of course.

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,690
Eun Taek!

29
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,430
What are you doing here? We don't have a meeting today.

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,700
You said you were coming to check the material.

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,440
You came because of that?

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,730
I can do it by myself

33
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,460
It would be faster if we do it together

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,300
And I have something I wanted to ask you

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,460
I think it would be best if I do it now.

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,070
Isn't that Baek Ho Rang?

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,740
Where are you?

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,360
Broadcasting room.
I had something to tell Go Eun Taek about.

39
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,800
I thought it would be right to ask you first.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,830
So, what do you want me to do?

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,890
Just as I said now, I tried to fix the problem on my own,

42
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,860
but I'm just tired.

43
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,660
If it's difficult, then I'll think about it again.

44
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,090
No. Do it that way then.

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,090
Thank you, Eun Taek

46
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,500
- Baek Ho Rang.
- Are you crazy?

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,740
What are you doing here!

48
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,010
- Ho Rang...
- Get up, right now!

49
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,520
You must be misunderstanding something.

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,570
It isn't what you think.

51
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,660
- I'm serious.
- What misunderstanding?

52
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,200
What else is there for the two of you to be talking about right now?

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,980
No, the thing is—

54
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,600
It's about the festival's video.

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,730
She asked me if the video can be shortened.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,560
Are you asking me to believe that?

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,060
- Really? At this time? Both of you?
- You didn't contact me all weekend.

58
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,010
The event is scheduled for that date.

59
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,620
We had to change the plan and re-edit since we were one person down.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,900
I think we're done talking, you can leave.

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,550
Okay.

62
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,620
Are you sure she didn't say anything?

63
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,250
- Go Eun Taek—
- Baek Ho Rang.

64
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,600
Why are you acting like this? What happened?

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,440
- You haven't talked to me all weekend, and you just show up here.
- I'm sorry, but Go Eun Taek.

66
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's talk later. I'll call you later.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,230
What are you doing right now?

68
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,580
You must be really scared.

69
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,750
You came here even faster than that night.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,410
Hey, Jung Hee Soo!

71
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,580
Right, what happened with you and So Hyeon?

72
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:56,200
You guys must not have ended too well, considering how she hasn't come looking for me.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,760
- Do you think that all I'll do is keep searching for you?
- And you?

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,120
Do you think this is all I have?

75
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,910
- What?
- You asked me that day why I was being like that to you.

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Baek Ho Rang.

77
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,890
You looked

78
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,820
down on me first.

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,260
What?

80
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,400
You dropped this down on the way.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,470
Thank you.

82
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,740
Who is that?

83
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,180
She's in my class, she must want to be friends with me, she keeps trying to talk to me.

84
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,250
Ho Rang.

85
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,740
I bought yours when I was there.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,740
Do you know her?

87
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,820
No, I'm seeing her for the first time today.

88
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,570
Do you know me?

89
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,950
- I...
- Look at her pretending to be close.

90
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,590
Let's go to the cafeteria.

91
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,420
We aren't that different.

92
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,690
But you keep acting different.

93
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,930
It was annoying.

94
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,760
You blocked me just because I commented a few times.

95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,940
Block? What is that about?

96
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,350
- I didn't even know who you were.
- Stop saying that!

97
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,220
Stop saying that you didn't know who I am. I don't like listening to that.

98
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,520
Ho Rang, I don't want anyone to remember you.

99
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,360
I want you to feel the same way.

100
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,410
Leave the broadcasting club.

101
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,610
- Stay away from your friends. I want you to...
- Hey!

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,600
be lonely again.

103
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,520
When I searched my flash drive, I found a video.

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,930
At the festival I was scared, so I didn't upload that also. But if you ignore me again

105
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,910
all the school will watch your video tomorrow.

106
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,140
Don't think too much.

107
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,620
Then, I'll be waiting for the news.

108
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,890
But

109
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,830
seeing you standing here looking so silly

110
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,730
made me feel bad, too.

111
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,550
I'm curious about

112
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,370
what expressions your friends will wear when they see it.

113
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,770
I'm stressed.

114
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,410
Go Eun Taek didn't call you, right?

115
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,210
No. He also seemed out of it.

116
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you know how many times I called her because I was worried?

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,650
How can she leave her bag and not show up?

118
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,940
No matter what, she's dead, if I see her.

119
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,460
- Did you find her?
- No. I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find her.

120
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,610
Seriously.

121
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,620
- I miss Ho Rang.
- Me too.

122
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,790
You must've gotten close with Baek Ho Rang when we broke up.

123
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,690
Well,

124
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,990
she's better than I thought.

125
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,210
But the more I think about it, the more annoying it gets.

126
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,490
She can just say the rumors are either true or false.

127
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,680
Why does she keep me nervous by not saying anything?

128
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,370
Gosh.

129
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,750
- Today we agreed to post up the ads for the festival video, right?
- What? Oh, right.

130
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,570
I can help you if you're busy.

131
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,770
No, I'm fine.

132
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,480
She wasn't in the classroom.

133
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,490
Baek Ho Rang. I went to the nurse's office to see if she was there, but she wasn't.

134
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,780
Uh, okay.

135
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,590
Aren't you curious?

136
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,360
About what?

137
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,450
You're not even looking for her.

138
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm waiting, since I promised,

139
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,540
but I'm not sure.

140
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,930
I hope she doesn't keep me waiting for too long.

141
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,260
Are you anxious?

142
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,920
Don't be, she's going to tell you herself.

143
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,020
Isn't this really funny?

144
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,490
The fact that you're feeling so bad when you're the one who got beat up.

145
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,120
Ho Rang, was our school always this wide?

146
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,780
Tell me where you are. I'll go by myself quietly.

147
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,050
Me too.

148
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,520
Do you think she'll tell us if we say we'll go together?

149
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,960
Why not? I'm Baek Ho Rang's bff.

150
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,770
I'm curious about what expressions your friends will wear when they see it.

151
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,790
So Hyeon is going to advertise our page tomorrow. Today, we're just going to put up posters on the bulletin board of each floor.

152
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,960
We can split up into groups of two and each takes one floor.

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,690
Got it.

154
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,760
Does anyone have any questions?

155
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,740
What's happening to Ho Rang?

156
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,100
Because Ho Rang and I are on the same team—

157
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,930
Didn't we finish talking this morning?

158
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,090
Yeah, right.

159
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,830
I asked because we can re-edit the video, but we still need stage prep and other stuff.

160
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,670
I was wondering if there were any updates in between.

161
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,060
We can give Baek Ho Rang another task when she comes, so let's have someone cover for now.

162
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,710
A Team's almost done filming, right?

163
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,120
Yes. We'll finish it by today. Should we join Team B tomorrow?

164
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,160
Sure. Thanks.

165
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,830
Sunbaenim.

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,370
Ho Rang Sunbae left the chat.

167
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,630
- What?
- Really?

168
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,940
She really left.

169
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,500
Go Eun Taek, I'll quit the broadcasting club.

170
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,340
- Go Eun Taek.
- Tell me later.
- Even if you go to her, she won't tell you anything.

171
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,490
- What?
- This morning, when I told you that I'd tell you about Ho Rang,

172
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,920
you said that you wanted to hear it from her.

173
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,500
She won't tell you that even if you go now.

174
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,450
I was the one who wrote the post on the community board.

175
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,240
Hey, why are you ignoring my calls? I was worried.

176
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,360
Is it so difficult to message me one time? You don't care about other people.

177
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,830
Where are you going? Wait.

178
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,570
Here. It's very obvious. You didn't eat, right?

179
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,640
Eat this and come talk to me.

180
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,700
I had my phone turned off.

181
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay.

182
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,400
- Okay, so take this now—
- I got all the annoying messages and calls.

183
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,830
I have to go, can you let go?

184
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,870
Hey, Baek Ho Rang!

185
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,430
What are you doing?

186
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,660
I understand, tell me before you leave.

187
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,430
- What?
- You know it, right? That I'm always straightforward.

188
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,060
What was that post?

189
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,970
You have become really strange after that post was uploaded. You told me it's not true.

190
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,370
You told me it wasn't true, right?

191
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,240
If I asked you a question, answer it. Stop making me frustrated.

192
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,170
Why do I have to tell you that?

193
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,630
What?

194
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,660
The post...

195
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,860
It's true.

196
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,070
Your expression is priceless.

197
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,420
- Hey, you—
- If you can't believe me, just curse me behind my back like everyone else.

198
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,650
Don't behave like we're close and pretend that you're the only one who got hurt.

199
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,750
It's annoying.

200
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,810
Hey, Baek Ho Rang...

201
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,710
Hey, Kang Jae Yi.

202
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,080
We just started to talk to each other a few months ago.

203
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,540
Did you think that we were close?

204
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,770
You must've forgotten, but...

205
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,930
I was always like this.

206
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,170
Quit your sloppy, exaggerated friend act and please just shut your mouth.

207
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,850
Baek Ho Rang.

208
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,660
Move.

209
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,540
What are you talking about?

210
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm asking if you know why Baek Ho Rang joined the broadcasting club.

211
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,950
She joined to find out about the broadcasting account.

212
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,590
Who wrote the story in the lunchtime broadcast just now?

213
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,130
I wrote that story.

214
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,220
So, come out and say it to my face.

215
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't hide and spout all that nonsense.

216
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm still affected everyday by those memories.

217
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,850
I hated her living happily, forgetting all her mistakes.

218
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,440
I became really angry and wrote the story before I knew it.

219
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,430
For her to hear it.

220
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,670
Just because she didn't want her reputation spoilt,

221
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,660
she joined the broadcasting club and monitored me.

222
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,300
Every day felt horrible.

223
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,930
Go Eun Taek, this is the answer you really wanted to hear.

224
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm...

225
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,130
the Baek Ho Rang story's victim.

226
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,490
Rude girl! I asked her just out of care but she started acting up.

227
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,330
She must've forgotten that I was on her side this whole time.

228
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,240
I slightly... Just slightly... suspected her.

229
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,720
But that's not a reason so she can talk so unfairly to her friend.

230
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,430
She should've just told me clearly.

231
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,240
Kang Jae Yi, when is she getting punished?

232
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,020
What punishment?

233
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,430
I'm talking about Baek Ho Rang.

234
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,050
Aren't they preparing action for school violence in your school?

235
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,150
It happened when they were in middle school, so why would they take action for school violence?

236
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,920
You still don't know whether it's true or not!

237
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,200
Hey, there's evidence and a victim. Of course, it's true.

238
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,030
Hold on.

239
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,820
The victim came out?

240
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,550
How do you not know that and you guys go to the same school?

241
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:38,760
A post was uploaded saying that the victim is 11th grade, Class 6 Jung Hee Soo.

242
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,710
Isn't this Jung Hee Soo? They said this is Jung Hee Soo, the 2nd year from our school.

243
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,510
- It is Jung Hee Soo.
- Who's Jung Hee Soo from Seoyeon High?

244
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,720
No way.

245
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,650
91234 likes

246
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,930
She has guts. If I was in her shoes, I would be too scared to do a post like this.

247
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,750
You can see that her personality sucks.

248
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,890
Ho Rang Unni! If you're pretty, you're unni.

249
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,740
My eyes were healed by Ho Rang today, too.

250
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,320
Broadcasting Club President Go Eun Taek

251
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm in front of your house. I'll wait for 10 minutes and then I'll leave.

252
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm in front of your house. I'll wait for 10 minutes and then I'll leave.

253
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,410
How long have you been here?

254
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,620
I've been organizing my thoughts.

255
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,360
It's fine since you came.

256
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:18,390
There's a lot I want to know, but I'll ask you again.

257
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,820
Have you straightened it out yet?

258
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,150
The things you said you would tell me... Are you ready now?

259
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:43,940
It felt a bit rude to let you know that I will leave the broadcasting club by text, so I thought I should tell you in person.

260
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,530
Is there nothing else?

261
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,960
No.

262
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,420
You would have felt tired of this even if you didn't say so.

263
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:08,240
All the kids went crazy after the incident, so all havoc would've let loose in the broadcasting club, too.

264
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,410
And... I didn't want to do it anymore eith—

265
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,270
Baek Ho Rang!

266
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,550
I've been waiting all this time, and that's all you have to say to me?

267
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,130
To someone who was worried something happened to you

268
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:35,980
and was waiting all weekend for you to call. That's all you have to say?

269
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,700
Everyone is talking about you, but you're not saying a thing.

270
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,550
So how can I trust you?

271
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,780
By any chance,

272
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,210
by any chance, if it was true, I thought of

273
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,690
making an opportunity for you to apologize. I even thought these things.

274
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,550
While you were avoiding me, I was thinking about all that and thought my head was going to explode.

275
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,570
But I endured it.

276
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,610
Since you said you would tell me eventually.

277
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,410
Were you afraid

278
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,440
that it might be true?

279
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,050
Right, you must have been.

280
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,230
Maybe I thought of you very lightly because you said you would wait for me to tell you.

281
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,800
You can stop waiting now.

282
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,260
Don't wait.

283
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,940
I won't tell you anything until the end.

284
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,420
Just think what you want.

285
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,630
That would make us both feel better.

286
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,180
Are you being serious?

287
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,170
Yes. It's relieving to let it all out.

288
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,350
I should've done this earlier so that it would have been easier for us.

289
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,230
I came out here to tell you that

290
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,860
I'm going to leave the broadcasting club, so replace me or do whatever you want.

291
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,140
Now that we're at it,

292
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,650
isn't it better to be the perpetrator than the victim?

293
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:05,270
I'm regretting for the first time today

294
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,400
telling you that I liked you.

295
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,200
Sure, you live like that.

296
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:26,260
Keep avoiding the people who sincerely wait for you.

297
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,520
You want to quit the broadcasting club?

298
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,700
Sure, if that's makes you more comfortable, do that.

299
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,000
What's this?

300
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,820
They gave this on the way out. You like these things right? Have it.

301
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,730
I'll wait

302
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,110
until you tell me.

303
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,850
Don't wait, I won't tell you anything anyway.

304
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,430
Jung Hee Soo, is it really you?

305
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,760
What?

306
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,750
You were mentioned in the comments so I just wanted to ask.

307
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,850
Why are you looking at me?

308
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,610
Just tell them truthfully that it isn't true.

309
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,750
Could she just sit there like nothing happened, if she really was the victim?

310
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,420
I don't think I could do it.

311
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,930
The truth is—

312
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,370
Everyone's here.

313
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,550
I gathered everyone because I have an announcement.

314
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,530
The reason I called you here today

315
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,990
is because Baek Ho Rang left the team.

316
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,720
I would like to re-assign roles.

317
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,120
For the month that's left, I'd like Young Jae and So Hyeon to be the announcers.

318
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,330
Eun Ha can help Team B with their stage props for their video.

319
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,320
I know it's chaotic for you guys because things suddenly turned out this way.

320
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,900
But I wish you would all do your best for the remaining month.

321
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,930
Got it.

322
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,190
Good job everyone.

323
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,430
Good job.

324
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,330
Are you okay?

325
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,690
I just suddenly told you everything like that yesterday. Now that I think about it,

326
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,530
I was worried that you would be shocked.

327
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,560
I was going to find out anyway.

328
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,910
Thank you, for believing me.

329
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,620
I don't believe everything you said.

330
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,630
The story you told me about last time... Did you really just write it out of anger?

331
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:41,240
Huh? I can't write it very obviously, right?

332
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,980
I just wanted it to be broadcasted in a way that only she understood.

333
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,690
Sure, okay.

334
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,200
I'll get going then.

335
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,970
I told your teacher you're taking a work-study day.

336
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
- Did you stay up all night?
- Yeah.

337
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,450
They suddenly asked me to revise the proposal.

338
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,520
What about dad?

339
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,250
Business trip till tomorrow, I didn't tell you?

340
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,720
When did you ever tell me?

341
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,720
Should I drop out?

342
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,540
Why?

343
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,050
Just because.

344
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,290
Because of the school violence?

345
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,880
How did you know about that?

346
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,350
The employees are all young, they showed it to me.

347
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,770
Is it true?

348
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,220
No.

349
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,790
Then that's enough.

350
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,830
If you avoid it and hide because you're scared, it's like you're admitting to it.

351
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,260
Try holding out a bit longer.

352
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,520
Ho Rang, I think I should get to bed now.

353
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,020
Did you meet Baek Ho Rang yesterday?

354
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,420
I can tell just by looking at your face. Did you guys fight?

355
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,360
But why do you look like that you're the one who got more hurt?

356
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,340
With your personality, you wouldn't have stayed quiet. You would have pointed out her mistakes logically.

357
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,210
Why do you look more hurt?

358
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,840
This time when I broke up with Jae Yi,

359
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,580
I also thought that I was very logical when we fought.

360
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,630
But I wasn't. Nothing is clear in a loving relationship.

361
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:30,810
It's just because you remind me of myself a few weeks ago.

362
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:36,050
Do as your heart says. I don't know why you think so much these days.

363
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,060
There's nothing more painful than not being able to see the person you like.

364
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,460
I learned it this time for sure.

365
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,820
- Let's eat some snacks.
- Snacks.

366
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,690
Why does he look so down?

367
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,800
Your face looked so tired.

368
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,560
Go Eun Taek, have you contacted Baek Ho Rang? She didn't show up to school today.

369
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,600
Jae Yi, here.

370
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,420
Thank you.

371
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,820
I'm near your school. Would you be able to meet me?

372
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,600
No, I have a lot of work.

373
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,190
I'll get going.

374
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,680
He must be feeling really bad, too.

375
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,460
Why are these people insisting that it's Jung Hee Soo when they aren't even sure?

376
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,170
Baek Ho Rang didn't come to school today.

377
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,950
I'm sure she'll drop out.

378
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,330
But who is Jung Hee Soo?

379
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,340
It's her.

380
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,980
Excuse me, hi.

381
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,590
That post online, is that really you?

382
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,380
No.

383
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,280
I see.

384
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,120
You're that famous Jung Hee Soo?

385
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,370
Famous?

386
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,490
Everyone is talking about you.

387
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,920
The post, is it true?

388
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,420
- She said it's not, I jus—
- Honestly,

389
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,290
I couldn't say anything, because I was scared.

390
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,150
Wait, is it true?

391
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,740
I pity her.

392
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,450
Are you okay?

393
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,400
Are you okay?

394
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,630
Don't cry.

395
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,090
Yoo Sin, which sandwich do you want?

396
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,890
I'll get this.

397
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,730
How could you only get some for yourselves?

398
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,060
We didn't know you'd come here.

399
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,970
We're about to become seniors, but we can't even focus on school because of Baek Ho Rang.

400
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,020
And I feel guilty going to have fun, too.

401
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,130
Do you think you're the only one? I want to do fun things with So Hyeon, too, but I can't.

402
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,120
But it's so obvious Kim Yoo Sin likes you. Do you really not have any feelings for him at all?

403
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,950
When are you guys going to date?

404
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,360
Hey, how can you ask her that when I'm here?

405
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,520
Ah seriously, Kang Jae Yi.

406
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,100
I see.

407
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,920
I missed you.

408
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,680
If you have time this week just let me know.

409
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,230
Okay, I'll do that.

410
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm leaving next week. It'd be nice to see you before I left.

411
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,960
Oh?

412
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Sunbae, you're still here.

413
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,590
You're here?

414
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,790
I already synced the audio, so all you need to do is finalize it.

415
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,260
Could I ask you to do that, please?

416
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,250
Yes.

417
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,730
Thank you, see you tomorrow.

418
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,600
Then, would you like to have dinner?

419
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,300
I've arrived, I'll go in.

420
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,420
Are you Eun Taek?

421
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,370
Eun Taek.

422
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,830
I wonder if it's because it's past-dinner time, there aren't many people.

423
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,590
People don't like missing the right timing.

424
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,230
Huh?

425
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,790
Thank you.

426
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,410
I was near your school. Should we have come together?

427
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,750
How's school going?

428
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,390
It's fine, I'm busy studying.

429
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,680
Do you eat properly? Does your dad make your meals?

430
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,120
Yes. Sometimes we take turns too.

431
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,040
I see, make sure to eat well.

432
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,900
You're a senior now.

433
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,720
Excuse me, Eun Taek.

434
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,920
Your food is ready.

435
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,380
Let's eat.

436
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,450
Enjoy.

437
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:57,280
You weren't able to eat shrimp when you were younger, you must like it now.

438
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,430
A lot of time has passed.

439
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,300
Is that the trend these days?

440
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,360
Baek Ho Rang had the same one at her house.

441
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,220
This?

442
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,650
- This was at Baek Ho Rang's house?
- Yeah.

443
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,280
I saw it the day we went to the retreat. Maybe it's popular these days.

444
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,460
We can take my car, you don't need to take the bus. I'll drop you off.

445
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,190
It's okay, it's a short bus ride.

446
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,400
You should just let me give you a ride.

447
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,750
You're leaving next week?

448
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,470
Yeah, but it's nice that I was able to see you this one time.

449
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,510
I enjoyed dinner, I'll get going.

450
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,360
Okay, if anything happens, be sure to let me know.

451
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,900
Okay. Go home safely.

452
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,490
Eun Taek.

453
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,180
I thought that I shouldn't lose the timing.

454
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,530
If I lose the timing, I might not be able to see you for a long time.

455
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,950
Then we might not be able to meet next time.

456
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,530
I've never forgotten about that day.

457
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:23,030
When I left at dusk that day... I should've hugged you one more time before I left you behind.

458
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:31,940
I regret it every time I think about it. I also promised that I'd come back.

459
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,000
But I couldn't muster up the courage.

460
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,360
I made a promise I couldn't keep and kept you waiting all this time.

461
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,010
Sorry, Son.

462
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,890
I'm really sorry.

463
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,110
But...

464
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,090
there was never a moment that I didn't love you.

465
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,210
Will you believe me?

466
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:26,720
Because she loved you, and only wanted to show her best to you.

467
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,030
I understand her.

468
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:40,350
The more you like someone, the more you want to hide from them.

469
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,890
There's a broadcast today. I hope you will listen to it.

470
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,550
Hello, this is SHBS, where winter has already arrived, and the cold winds have started blowing.

471
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,820
- The CSAT is soon, so this voice recording is substituting our lunchtime broadcast.
- Your sandwich is ready!

472
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,600
Thank you for understanding.

473
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,200
So, let me start the first story.

474
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,660
I'm a senior with only four days left until the CSAT.

475
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,350
I'm nervous to death now.

476
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,250
So, I also want to express my support for my seniors in their exams. You can do it!

477
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,930
Now, for the next story.

478
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,290
To the one who likes the song "When My Loneliness Calls to You."

479
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:04,560
Though I don't know if you're listening to this broadcast or not, there's something I have to tell you.

480
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:12,890
At first, when I was struggling to decide how I should start this off, this song came to my mind.

481
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,610
When I first let you hear this song, you said you didn't like it,

482
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,230
but you ended up liking it even more than I do afterward.

483
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,620
I thought about what else you like.

484
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:42,400
You like enjoying the breeze on the rooftop, and you're secretly happy when someone praises you, though you pretend you're not.

485
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,970
Though you didn't tell me, I knew it all.

486
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,900
Because you're someone who can't hide their emotions.

487
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:58,190
That's why when I'm not sure how you feel, I observe your expressions first.

488
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,790
But why couldn't I do that this time?

489
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:08,890
You kept telling me with your actions and expressions.

490
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,400
Perhaps I wanted to hear it in my own way.

491
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,460
You said this.

492
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,990
The more you like someone, the more things you want to hide from them.

493
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,390
I think I kind of understand that now.

494
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,190
That's why I regret it.

495
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,760
I couldn't understand you completely and lost you.

496
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,460
I'm sorry.

497
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,160
I'm really sorry.

498
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,670
Why is it always so cold during the CSAT period?

499
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,990
- My brother's going to have to retake the test.
- I think we're going to have to retake it too.

500
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,410
Good luck on your CSATs! Here's to a good future!

501
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,960
Apparently, Baek Ho Rang is dropping out.

502
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,790
Really? Who said so?

503
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,500
- I don't know.
- What the heck?

504
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,870
- It's true.
- What?

505
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,010
Who does that empty seat belong to?

506
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,620
Baek Ho Rang.

507
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,070
Let's start class. Last week you were given an assignment.

508
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:31,880
No.

509
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,540
I did!

510
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,050
Baek Ho Rang

511
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,060
Kim Yoo Sin, what's for lunch today?

512
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,840
Purple rice, seaweed soup, stir-fried kimchi, and Yakult.

513
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,200
That's horrible. Do you want to go to the school store?

514
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,510
Are you not eating with Woo Jae today?

515
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,060
Woo Jae already ate and went to the student council meeting just now.

516
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,230
Is that so? Okay, I'll eat a grilled beef burger or something.

517
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,050
- Hey, guys.
- So Hyeon.

518
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,230
You don't have a broadcast today?

519
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,030
Someone else is doing it today.

520
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,360
We're going to the school store. Do you want to come?

521
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,650
Sorry, I have to go somewhere. It's important.

522
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,870
What is it?

523
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,760
Why does she look so happy?

524
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,200
I know, right? So cute.

525
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,730
This is when I uploaded the photo of the karaoke in Daejeon.

526
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,830
Didn't you already show us a few days ago?

527
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,610
Really?

528
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:30,590
Oh, right. But come to think of it, there was that too.

529
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,070
- What?
- Hey, Hee Soo.

530
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,830
Why are you here instead of going to eat?

531
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,450
Don't worry about me. Just go on with what you were doing.

532
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,800
Jung Hee Soo.

533
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,090
So what was it?

534
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,480
So...

535
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,210
Before the broadcast, there's something I need to tell you.

536
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,610
We're going to do a live broadcast today.

537
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,930
Live?

538
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,510
Then who will be the announcer?

539
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,430
Shouldn't we have Young Jae do it then?

540
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,130
Sunbae, then I—

541
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:23,790
Don't worry, the announcer... will be here soon.

542
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,190
Go Eun Taek.

543
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,690
I actually...

544
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,460
wasn't the bully. I was the victim.

545
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,590
I couldn't tell you...

546
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,430
Don't say it. You don't have to.

547
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,280
It's okay. It's all okay.

548
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,930
So...

549
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,470
I think I can tell everyone now.

550
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,820
Just say as much as you want to say.

551
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,250
I'll do the rest.

552
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,710
Please turn the TV on.

553
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,370
Our broadcast is starting!

554
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,430
- What?
- Huh?

555
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,820
- Turn the TV on.
- Are they going live?
- What's happening?

556
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,600
Turn on the TV.

557
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,430
Are you guys having a live broadcast today? I didn't hear anything about it.

558
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,520
- Earlier in the—
- You should get going.

559
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,010
I'll explain.

560
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,420
Got it.

561
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,730
Are you guys going to stay here, too?

562
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,690
Isn't that Baek Ho Rang?

563
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,860
What?

564
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,930
No way!

565
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,140
Hello, I'm Baek Ho Rang.

566
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,130
It's her!

567
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,680
There's something that I wanted to let everyone know.

568
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,060
So, I'm here in front of the camera.

569
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,830
I think this will be the first and the last time I will say these words.

570
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,870
I...

571
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm...

572
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,310
I'm a victim of school violence.

573
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,050
What is she talking about?

574
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,570
Ho Rang was the victim and not the bully?

575
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:01,830
It took me two years to say this.

576
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,460
That day was my birthday.

577
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:10,380
My friends called me to a karaoke room saying they were having a birthday party for me.

578
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:15,530
There, they assaulted me.

579
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:24,310
However, I couldn't tell anyone the truth.

580
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:31,180
Not even to the one person who really thought of me as a friend.

581
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:37,150
The fact that I was hit and the fact that I was in pain

582
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,570
wasn't as scary as how I thought I may be perceived by others.

583
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,710
- OMG!
- Is this really true?

584
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,960
"There must be a reason she was treated that way."

585
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,490
I dreaded those thoughtless comments and pointed looks.

586
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,170
The only thing I could do in that situation

587
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:12,430
was to close my eyes and shut my mouth.

588
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,000
I thought one day, I could forget it.

589
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,590
After enduring for so long with this hope,

590
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,440
I've turned into the bully.

591
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:34,350
Now that I must deal with the judgment of others no matter what I do, I no longer care.

592
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,690
I finally realized that being a victim isn't as embarrassing as being the bully.

593
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,680
What is all this?

594
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,550
Ho Rang.

595
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,820
But that wasn't it.

596
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:52,880
What the people who really cared about me wanted was the truth.

597
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:02,100
The people who like me, even if they don't want to see it or believe it,

598
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,830
wanted to know the truth.

599
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:18,500
So I decided not to hide anymore and tell the truth,

600
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,890
not just for myself but for my friends.

601
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:53,420
Jung Hee Soo, enough now.

602
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,110
What are you talking about? I did it because I was scared.

603
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:01,830
So Hyeon, you know how hard I've had it because of Baek Ho Rang.

604
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,930
After she entered the broadcasting club, every day I—

605
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:08,510
Baek Ho Rang losing the USB during the festival, it was your doing right?

606
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,600
Don't you think this was too blatant, considering you were afraid of her?

607
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,290
- What?
- Why?

608
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,280
I did it because I hate her. Why? I can't do that?

609
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,800
Sure, let's go with that.

610
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,370
Can you show me that proof shot that you showed your friends?

611
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,660
I want to search it up.

612
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,350
Who knows? Maybe a similar picture exists online.

613
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,220
Give it to me.

614
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,160
You're right, it was all a show.

615
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,850
It was all my doings to make Baek Ho Rang miserable.

616
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:19,640
But what about you guys? You guys took this as your chance to diss her.

617
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,390
But why are you looking at me like that? Why are you looking at me like I've gone crazy?

618
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:30,920
You guys also hated her from the first but why are you guys differentiating me alone? Why?

619
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,180
Crazy wench!

620
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,510
Say that again!

621
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,860
Leave me!

622
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,830
I am scared of the way people will look at me, but

623
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:52,070
now I won't run away from that.

624
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:05,920
Because the people who love me are with me.

625
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,870
Staff only

626
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,650
Good job.

627
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,700
I'm not hiding anything else from you.

628
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,520
I know.

629
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,350
Thanks for waiting, Go Eun Taek.

01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:34,550
♫ The eyes of a beast that chose its target, uh.
The sign of the rejection maybe ♫

637
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:38,510
♫ Are you going to stay in the frame as others tell you to? ♫

638
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:43,160
♫ See as you live, it becomes anew every day ♫

639
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,200
♫ Use all of your senses, let's go far away ♫

640
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:53,400
♫ Woo... everything will be different, even
if because of secrets, secrets ♫

641
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,200
♫ You become a bit nervous, nervous ♫

642
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:03,100
♫ Woo... more like eighteen. Yes, happily, happily, jump in now ♫

643
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,390
♫ Let's turn on your light ♫

644
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:07,410
Live On

645
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,290
Go Eun Taek, let's meet tomorrow.

646
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,870
So Hyeon.

647
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,080
It's been a while.

648
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,660
Do you remember when we dated?

649
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,730
Soon it's my 1000th day with Do Woo Jae.

650
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:23,570
We have decided to buy each other gifts and surprise each other.

651
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:29,850
I'm sorry for making you wait so long. I like you too, Go Eun Taek.

652
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,050
You did well in making me wait, Baek Ho Rang.

653
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,460
♫ Really, really do as you wish ♫
