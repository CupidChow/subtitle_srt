1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
D-15!!

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,580
Guys, it's the festival!
 - Episode 4 -

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,380
Festival: D-15

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,890
There are 15 days left till the festival.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,050
- Let's be ready!
- Yes.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,340
- Let's check everything. Check each thing to see if something's missing.
- Yes.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,850
First, Hee Soo and Jin Gook received a list of performance teams from the student council and placed them in order.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,030
- Sung Joon and Eun Ha, tell the performing teams to bring their music on a USB.
- Yes.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,620
Hee Won and Young Jae, go to the auditorium and look for

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,790
- a place to install the service camera this time.
- Yes.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,460
And, Ji So Hyeon, Baek Ho Rang, keep checking the story corner. List up any of the good ones, and show them to me.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,110
- Got it.
- Sure.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,230
Then that's it for that.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,820
Then, are we doing the corner like this?

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,510
Oh right, the corner. According to the feedback we got last time, we chose the corner concept as the most suitable.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,640
By any chance, does anyone have any comment to add about it?

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,520
Since it's a festival, I think it would be nice to have something to increase participation.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,960
So how about providing more quantity of products?

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,300
Or how about sending around surveys to every classroom?

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,620
The products will be a little hard because of our budget.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,870
Wouldn't it be a little hard to get honest answers from surveys?

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,670
Oh, maybe you're right.

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,210
If not, how about a live broadcast?

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,430
A live broadcast?

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,500
Yeah. A YouTube live stream.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,780
If we respond to the feedback in the live chat, I think the students will like it.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,840
I really like it. It's like a visual radio program, right?

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
- I think that'll be fun.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,150
So, are we able to show something cool this time around?

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,250
We'll be number one in the school!

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,340
Then let's make this corner a live broadcast as Baek Ho Rang said.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,600
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
Since we're preparing for the festival right away starting tomorrow,

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,510
let's meet in the broadcasting room at 8:00 am.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,220
Let's end our meeting here today. Good work.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,160
- Good work.
- You worked hard.

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,720
Baek Ho Rang, you...

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,750
Huh? I what?

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,990
Baek Ho Rang.

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,710
Baek Ho Rang. Are you okay?

41
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,150
I'm okay.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,460
It's nothing.

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,650
I left first that day because I wasn't feeling well.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,760
Really. It's not a big deal.

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,980
Okay then. You worked hard.

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,830
- I'll head out first.
- Sure.

47
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,740
Oh, Go Eun Taek.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,880
Thanks for the present. I'll use it well.

49
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,480
See you.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,670
I wasn't expecting this kind of highlight.

51
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,060
This is so frustrating. Why aren't you saying anything?

52
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,910
Why are you so obsessed with me these days?

53
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,500
You're not usually this kind of person.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,050
What are you guys doing this time?

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,600
Us? Mini-arcade. And you?

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,980
I said we were going to eat at the rest area.

57
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,050
No, stop changing the subject. I'm asking what's going on.

58
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,420
Hey. How does this look?

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,860
I don't have daily clothes. I noticed it when I had no money.

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,580
You broke up with Do Woo Jae again, didn't you?

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,910
You did, that's it. That's why you so courageously...

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,930
What are you saying? I'm totally fine right now, you know.

63
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,780
Only beginners at dating cry and make a big deal over breaking up.

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,610
I'm a total veteran, you know.

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,260
Do Woo Jae, this horrible punk. I hate you!

66
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,590
Veteran? Yeah, right. I bet you cried while listening to sad songs

67
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,530
then ripped off all your pictures in anger.

68
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,630
"It's fine, you'll regret it someday."

69
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,750
You'll unfollow him, too.

70
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,830
I miss you...

71
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,190
Then when you miss him, you'll cry again.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,070
Ugh, I don't know. Don't even bring it up. It's annoying.

73
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,700
See if I ever start dating Do Woo Jae again.

74
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,770
- How many times is it again?
- For what?

75
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,160
What you said just now. I feel like I heard that line more than ten times during my freshman year.

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,740
I mean it for real this time, okay?

77
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,650
Now stop talking about it so I can forget it.

78
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,180
So, are you going to wear this at school?

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,720
No. I'm going to wear it right now.

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,230
You said you were going to buy clothes to wear at the festival!

81
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,930
What's going on? Where are you going?

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,860
- Kim Jae Jun. Kang Jae Yi.
- Here.

83
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,670
- Kim Soo Ho.
- Here.

84
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,630
- Na Seong Mi.
- Hello.

85
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,070
And... Do Woo Jae? Do Woo Jae?

86
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,080
­

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,140
010-361-0659

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,860
Hello?

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,160
- Hel—
-  Eun Taek. It's Mom.

90
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,490
Oh. You changed your number.

91
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,360
Nothing much has happened, right?

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,470
Some things suddenly came up, so I came to Korea.

93
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,070
By any chance, do you have some time tomorrow?

94
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,410
I wanted to eat with you for the first time in a while.

95
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,330
I have a lot of work to do for the time being.

96
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,090
I see.

97
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,190
Does next week work for you?

98
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,620
Of course!

99
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,500
I'll check my schedule and let you know.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,850
Sure. Until then, don't forget to eat and take care of yourself.

101
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,320
I will.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,470
I'll hang up now.

103
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,330
She's a woman that gave up on custody so that she could breathe easily. It would be shameful for her to contact you now—

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,990
Aren't you tired of it?

105
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,950
Aren't tired of saying the same thing constantly?

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,590
♫ My feelings for you are ♫

107
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:21,750
♫ Slowly starting to disappear now ♫

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,730
♫ Your shadowed face ♫

109
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:45,010
♫ I know you can never come back to me ♫

110
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:54,050
- Hello, Sunbaenim.
- Hi.
- Why is this on?

111
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:03,660
♫ When my loneliness calls to you, you quietly come ♫

112
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,300
♫ Into my heart ♫

113
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,340
Excuse me. Please write down the title of a movie you want to watch at the festival.

114
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,500
Hero

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,520
And you can just stick it on that wish tree over there.

116
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,880
Sure.

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,340
You're here early.

118
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,440
If I'm late, you'll just make a big deal out of it again.

119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,380
You know me well. You're going to pop by the classroom first, right?

120
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,640
Yeah. You too?

121
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah. Me too. Let's go together.

122
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,180
When did you go home yesterday?

123
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,860
Around eleven? Editing took a little longer because of someone.

124
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,040
Who?

125
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,870
There's just someone. Someone who sings well.

126
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,400
You broke up? How many times is it already?

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,660
The fourth time.

128
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,760
Wow, it's not just once or twice. Whether it's you or Do Woo Jae, I really respect you.

129
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
But what about it? In less than a week, you guys will be glued to each other anyway. Right?

130
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,790
I thought that'd happen, too. But no, this time is a little different.

131
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,890
Jae Yi, we are way too exhausted to cover it up, and

132
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,230
turn the other way.

133
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,310
So about that, how is Do Woo Jae these days?

134
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,230
Do Woo Jae? I wonder. I don't see him often nowadays.

135
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,000
He always comes in late because of festival preparations.

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,580
Why? If you're curious, do you want to try calling him?

137
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,280
- I'm good, okay?
- Enough.

138
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,510
What's so different about this time?

139
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,310
He hasn't even changed his profile picture. So this time is exactly the same.

140
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,300
You're right. I noticed he hasn't taken down that profile picture yet.

141
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,000
I guess he was just upset.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,940
As you know, he always acts so elegantly, but he's just a kid.

143
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,130
- That's true, you're right. He is kind of like that.
- That's what I'm saying.

144
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,160
Woo Sol! Let's go!

145
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,970
- Bye, Unni. I'll send you a Face message later.
- Sure. Talk to you later.

146
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,390
Have fun.

147
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
Do Woo Jae

148
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Good job.

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,970
Alright, take one each.

150
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,620
Sung Joon and Eun Ha, take the USB from the performance team and come to the venue.

151
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,300
Okay.

152
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,110
Hee Soo and Hee Won, review the schedule one more time.

153
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,780
Yes.

154
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,690
And for the others, don't forget to frequently check on the sound and mics.

155
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,770
We will.

156
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,270
Sunbaenim, let's all do that thing. This thing...

157
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,490
Goodness.

158
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,050
Really?

159
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,270
We don't have time.

160
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,220
Broadcasting club—

161
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,460
Fighting!

162
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,920
Jin Gook, you should move the camera three a little to the side.

163
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,410
Okay.

164
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,950
- Young Jae.
- Yes?

165
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,060
Are the lights good to go?

166
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,300
Yes, they're good to go!

167
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,830
Okay.

168
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,330
- Sung Joon.
- Yes?

169
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,920
Can you check the mics?

170
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,020
Ah, ah. Mic test. It's coming out.

171
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,860
Hello, the SHBS "Adversary Corner" is starting now.

172
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,710
Is the screen quality okay?

173
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,390
Yes. It's streaming clearly without snags.

174
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,970
Is it coming out okay?

175
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,350
He said it's streaming clearly without any snags.

176
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,540
No, not the stream. My face.

177
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,700
Hey! What did you just do?

178
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,960
Hey! I can also do this.

179
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,030
Should I show you again?

180
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,610
Baek Ho Rang, later on—

181
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,150
Because of you, the ending—

182
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,230
Is going to be perfect.

183
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
Let's go.

184
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,410
Broadcasting!

185
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,830
[Mom]
Okay then,

186
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,870
I'll see you then.

187
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,880
Alright.

188
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,970
Festival D-3

189
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,480
How far are we on the promotional video?

190
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,690
All we need to do is include the rooftop montage scene.

191
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,060
Then today we'll need myself, Sung Joon and Eun Ha, right?

192
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,380
Oh, then can you return this for me? The rooftop key. I need to go grocery shopping later.

193
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,580
Alright. But will you be okay on your own?

194
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,500
I think we'll need one more person.

195
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,550
Apart from the editing team, is anyone else free?

196
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,140
I have to go set up the stage in the venue.

197
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,990
I have to check the sound.

198
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,630
I need to do a light check.

199
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,440
I need to return the props.

200
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,720
Well... I guess we could go together.

201
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,110
New Message

202
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,660
I'll see you soon.

203
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,950
Hello?

204
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,190
Oh, you actually answered.

205
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,180
Who is this?

206
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,990
It's Noh Min Gyu, 'cause you ignored all my messages.

207
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,190
How did you get my number?

208
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,860
I just asked a few people? So when do you want to meet?

209
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,850
Why would I meet you?

210
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,530
What do you mean? We've only been flirting.

211
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,800
I had a suspicion based on your Face, but you really don't know how to take a hint.

212
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
Your tone is a little rude.

213
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,690
I didn't contact you because I didn't want to.

214
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,720
I haven't ever thought I was flirting with you, so I'd appreciate it if you stopped calling me.

215
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,000
- Hey! Ji So Hyeon!
- I'm hanging up.

216
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,440
Hey, So Hyeon!

217
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,490
Hey, Yoo Sin.

218
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,500
Here you go!

219
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Whoa, where'd you get these? They don't sell these at school.

220
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,930
I bought them elsewhere. When we were going to the library, you said that you liked these.

221
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,060
Did you remember that?

222
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,860
Of course! My brain is full of information about you.

223
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,420
It's my number one priority to understand Ji So Hyeon's tastes.

224
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,720
Do you mean a wish list?

225
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't know. I just mean that you're my priority.

226
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,810
I'll come by your classroom later. Enjoy those!

227
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,340
- I'll enjoy these!
- Enjoy!

228
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,220
The more I think about it, the more pissed I get. Girls like you are everywhere.

229
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,360
[Kim Yoo Sin]
So Hyeon, what are you doing? Are you going to the library today?

230
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm at the grocery store.

231
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm with Baek Ho Rang to buy stuff for the festival.

232
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,610
What? I'm busy.

233
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,680
Ho Rang! You're with So Hyeon right now, right?

234
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,670
Yeah.

235
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,750
Hey, hurry and ask So Hyeon!

236
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,600
We ate a meal together and it went really well.

237
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,520
But if asked bluntly, it could be burdensome so you should ask in a subtle way—

238
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,720
Hey Ji So Hyeon, Kim Yoo Sin is asking what you think about him?

239
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,020
Hey Baek Ho Rang! Ugh, seriously!

240
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,100
Happy? Hanging up now.

241
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,140
Hey! Hey!

242
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,440
Hey! I'm supposed to buy this stuff.

243
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,420
What are you talking about?

244
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,680
You're buying from lights until the gummies. Otherwise, why did we divide the list?

245
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,370
Whatever. I've already grabbed it, so what do you want to do?

246
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,250
What are you doing?

247
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,610
Grab a variety. Don't grab just stuff you like.

248
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,970
I don't even like that one.

249
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,980
What are you talking about? You used to buy these at the cafeteria all the–

250
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,300
Do it right! Don't make us do this twice.

251
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,650
Hello?

252
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,710
Baek Ho Rang, is shopping going well?

253
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,060
Nope.

254
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,100
Where did you put the copy of the cue sheet?

255
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,540
Oh, that. Do you know where I was sitting? There's a blue folder there.

256
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,210
Oh, I found it. Thanks. Good luck with shopping.

257
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,480
Baek Ho Rang is so annoying. She bumped into me and didn't even apologize.

258
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,920
Why is she taking her anger out on innocent people because of her bad grades?

259
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,750
She's the one who ran into me.

260
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,490
At the mall, Baek Ho Rang kept looking me up and down for wearing the same brand as her.

261
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,440
Maybe even that pisses her off.

262
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,590
I've never done this. Who is this?

263
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,500
Hey, the backup file is corrupted.

264
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh no!

265
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,150
Which file is it?

266
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,710
The montage scene.

267
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,470
This is why we kept asking the teacher for an external hard drive.

268
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,220
We'll have to re-film it then. Move forward without it. None of the other files have issues, right?

269
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,260
Yes, that's right.

270
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,710
Then that's fine. I'll re-film it later.

271
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,440
By yourself, Sunbaenim?

272
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,030
It's a good thing I got the keys.

273
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,630
Let's go together, Sunbaenim.

274
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,480
No, it's fine. Keep doing your work.

275
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,610
You get it.

276
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,720
[Kim Yoo Sin]
Hey! So Hyeon isn't responding now! Fix this!

277
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,990
Since you're not responding, he's messaging me now.

278
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,400
If he's not your type, then cut it off clearly.

279
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,330
I never said he's not my type.

280
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,790
What are you saying? You like guys with bold facial characteristics.

281
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,190
Me? No, I don't.

282
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,960
What do you mean, you don't? That's why you used to like Hee Min Oppa—

283
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,310
I'll take these, so you settle the bill and take the rest.

284
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,200
Hey, Ji So Hyeon!

285
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,410
It was two years ago.

286
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,780
Just cause we knew each other briefly then, don't act like you know everything about me.

287
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,040
We were with each other for too long today.

288
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
We shouldn't do this.

289
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,450
Hey, is it true that this time we'll have a guest performance from Yeonri High School?

290
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,140
Hey, the kids from Yeonri will dance at the festival, right?

291
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,200
Yeah.

292
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,020
Hey, Do Woo Jae!

293
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,280
I know it's none of my business,

294
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,960
but you're making it my business you fool!

295
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,790
Just get to the point. What is it?

296
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,590
You... Did you really break up with Jae Yi Unni?

297
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,870
If you didn't, then hurry up and make up with her instead of dragging it out.

298
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,310
Is Jae Yi okay?

299
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,970
If you're that curious, call her yourself and ask.

300
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,860
Ugh! Whatever. You do your own business.

301
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,090
I can't help others, I've been single for two years...

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
You're really selfish, Do Woo Jae.

303
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,420
I was tired like you said too,

304
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,320
let's break up.

305
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,710
- Why did you come back?
- Oh, since I left this behind.

306
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,260
- Sunbaenim, will you really be fine working on it alone?
- I'll finish it up quickly, so don't worry about it and go home. Good work today.

307
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,220
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

308
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,450
Why, did you leave something else behind?

309
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,920
What have you been up to til now?

310
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,110
You scared me.

311
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,520
- What are you doing?
- I was going to leave this here.

312
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,930
- Oh, the stuff you bought?
- Yeah. Otherwise, I have to lug it back here. That's a pain.

313
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,970
Right. Good job.

314
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,360
Wait a second. What if the door was locked?

315
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,200
- Then I could just leave it in front of the door.
- Hey, do you really think that makes sense?

316
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,920
- Where so many people pass by—
- Hey! Who would take this? I wouldn't take it even if you gave it to me.

317
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Whatever. It's fine since you were here.

318
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,250
- When are you planning to go home?
- One of the video files got corrupted, so I'm going to fix this and then go home.

319
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,190
- Right now?
- It'll be quick, maybe twenty minutes.

320
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,050
- Where are you going?
- To the rooftop.

321
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,950
- Then let's go together.
- Forget it. Don't come.

322
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,020
Why? Let's go together. I've been wanting to go to the rooftop.

323
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,980
And since I haven't learned how to film yet, I'll watch.

324
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,120
But you're going to go like that?

325
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
Why?

326
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,280
It's cold at night. Cover up with this at least.

327
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,520
Give it over. If you do this, you can magnify.

328
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,620
And if you go in the opposite direction, you can go back to the normal view. Try taking a picture.

329
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,990
- Oh, you did well for your first try.
- Obviously. How many photos do you think I've uploaded to my feed?

330
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,990
You said you didn't like it, but you listen to it often.

331
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,260
Often? This is the first time I've played it in front of you.

332
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,420
Right. This is the first time.

333
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,060
But you seem to like getting fresh air. You even opened that stuck window right away last time.

334
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,990
That's right, so why did you close something that was always open?

335
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,100
I like it because it's refreshing.

336
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,330
If I get fresh air, all of them disappear. The things that stifled me.

337
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,370
She's the one who ran into me.

338
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,360
- Why don't you tell them it's not true?
- What do you mean?

339
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,760
To the people who badmouth you, I mean.

340
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,000
"That's not the truth. You guys are misunderstanding."

341
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,550
Isn't it easier to talk like that instead of staying quiet?

342
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:47,520
Of course, talking is easy. But try talking for a hundred, a thousand days. Who would listen?

343
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,820
And in any case, I don't have any expectations.

344
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:08,010
I don't think I'll be able to keep our promise. What should we do? Can't we reschedule for another day?

345
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,900
What's wrong?

346
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,730
What you said is right. Talking is easy.

347
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,390
Do you maybe want me to listen?

348
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:33,190
- About what?
- If you want to rant about something, you can. I'll listen.

349
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,390
No, it's just... Someone keeps breaking their promises.

350
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,930
I was right. It was something that ticked you off.

351
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,930
I knew they wouldn't keep their promise this time either. But I feel pathetic since they really didn't, and I still got disappointed.

352
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,830
You must have some expectations for that person still, seeing as you're disappointed.

353
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,200
Well. I wonder.

354
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,000
But what is there to feel pathetic about? The one who did wrong was the person who broke the promise.

355
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,900
That's not your fault now, is it? Others try so hard to blame others for their own faults,

356
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,280
but why are you carrying all those burdens by yourself? So tiringly at that.

357
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,230
That's because...

358
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,550
Because I'm the leader.

359
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,900
Anyway, keep trusting like that.

360
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,830
Keep trusting, and if you get disappointed, you can just blame it on others.

361
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:38,820
They say if you don't have expectations, then you won't be disappointed, but that doesn't necessarily feel good either.

362
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,200
You're talking about yourself, aren't you?

363
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,640
But do those words apply to me, too?

364
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,100
- Which words?
- What you said about not expecting anything from people. I'm asking if that applies to me, too.

365
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,660
Oh. You?

366
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,800
You're a little different, I think.

367
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,950
Hey, can't we come out here more often to shoot photos? This is really nice.

368
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,920
Should we just take a taxi since we're tired? What do you think?

369
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,590
Sounds good.

370
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,620
- Baek Ho Rang.
- Yeah?

371
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,000
- Remember that day when I brought sushi over?
- Oh. Yeah.

372
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,130
That day, after I went back, I noticed I was fifteen minutes later than planned.

373
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,400
- What's up with you? You have times when you're late?
- That's what I'm saying.

374
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,980
At that time, I thought it was a coincidence.

375
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:16,480
I thought I was too comfortable with you and everything because you were a good person.

376
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,260
But after today, I realized that wasn't it.

377
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,860
I've been thinking the whole time till now.

378
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,320
After thinking it over carefully,

379
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,980
I think I've sorted it out.

380
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,280
What have you been talking about since before?

381
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,340
So, what I'm saying right now is...

382
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,230
I think I like you, Baek Ho Rang.

383
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,730
I like it–you, that is.

Awesome!
 Flower One-Day Class: Sharing flowers with your precious love.

403
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,960
They deliver flowers too. I should send one to So Hyeon later.

404
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,510
Ah, seriously. I'm so sick of listening to you talking about Ji So Hyeon.

405
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,290
- Well, she'll like it.
- Right.

406
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,190
Look at me. Do I look better with this lipstick or the other one?

407
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,990
I can't see any difference. Just wear any lipstick.

408
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,520
Can you be serious and take a look?

409
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,450
I hear you were cooking today. The lipstick will later wear off–

Let me see it.

412
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,810
Okay. You look much better with this one. You're prettier. Use this.

413
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,390
Really? Okay, I'll use this then.

414
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,550
Do you think this will help you get back with your ex?

415
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,460
What are you saying?

416
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,330
Are you mocking me?

417
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,980
Baek Ho Rang! Go Eun Taek!

418
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,120
Hi!

419
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,090
Will you stand there instead of the lights?

420
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,670
Why? I wanted to dress up a bit more, but I stopped myself.

421
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,530
- Are you promoting your booth?
- Yes.

422
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,360
I already voted for your team. Want to see it?

423
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,050
Take a look.

The popularity contest.

426
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,210
Hey, why did you vote for her booth instead of yours?

427
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,900
Can't I also vote for mine?

428
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,730
Idiot. You can't vote twice.

429
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,960
Really? That's surprising.

430
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,340
You didn't have to vote.

431
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,860
We'll win without your vote anyway.

432
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,890
Baek Ho Rang, so confident! How cute!

433
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,700
You are something, really.

- Yeah, okay.

436
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,960
Jung Hee Soo, we're going to use photos of the rehearsal later. Take photos of each performance.

437
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,190
Okay, got it.

438
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,510
And Young Jae, they want more lights for the guitar solo.

439
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,300
- Two more will do.
- Right.

440
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,930
And you Baek Ho Rang, when you pull out the wired mics, turn off the amplifier first.

441
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,830
Don't mess it up like last time.

442
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,410
Okay.

443
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,580
How can he be the same person?

444
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,790
That's why I think I like you Baek Ho Rang.

445
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,420
I noticed I was 15 minutes late on my schedule.

446
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,630
When I'm with you, I feel at ease and can be myself. And I sorted out my thoughts.

447
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,200
That's why I think I like you, Baek Ho Rang.

448
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,270
I like you.

449
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,340
I'm not saying this because I want an answer from you.

450
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,880
You know I can't lie.

451
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,120
I feel sorry because I think it was out of the blue, but I'm not forcing anything on you, so don't feel uneasy.

452
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,660
Though I know you're not one to do that anyway.

453
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,370
- Let's go.
- Huh?

454
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,430
Yes.

455
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,050
Baek Ho Rang, are you listening?

456
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,400
Y-yes.

457
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,930
When the theater club starts their rehearsal, get the USB with the Can High School Trot music ready.

458
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,190
There's not much time, so be sure to not forget it.

459
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,910
Yes, I understand.

Come here and help make waffles.

464
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,560
Oh, over there?

465
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,330
Yes. I put the batter I made there. Can you make some quickly?

00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,760
Help me one more time, please.

467
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,300
Where do you think you are?

468
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,290
Madam! Hit my other cheek as well.

469
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,970
You punk! Goodness.

470
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,770
Where are you going?

471
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,430
Baek Ho Rang, can you get that USB I told you before? I'm giving it to Sung Joon now.

472
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,930
The USB? Hold on.

473
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,730
I had it with me earlier. Where is it?

474
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,580
- You don't have it?
- No.

475
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm sure I put it here earlier.

476
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,110
The rehearsal of the play is over.

477
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,100
Can High School Trot, please get ready.

478
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,190
If you can't find it...

479
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,590
Here it is!

480
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,130
What the– How is this here?

481
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,880
Give it to me.

482
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,500
Baek Ho Rang, stay focused during the real performance.

483
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,060
The Chicken Tower will test the mics first.

484
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,660
♫ It's really, really ♫

485
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,970
Let's play the music.

486
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,950
Hey. I'm from Yeonri, but I know you.

487
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,820
You're much prettier in person. Do you have a Face account? I couldn't find you on it.

488
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,890
It looks delicious.

489
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,010
Teacher!

490
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,120
- So delicious!
- Did you pay before you ate it?

491
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,000
Please buy us one.

492
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,330
- Buy us one, please.
- Yes, please.

493
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,060
Should I? Get one each.

494
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,680
- Hot, hot.
- I want this one, this one.

495
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,890
Are you two playing house or something like that?

496
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,810
Can they make the food properly like this?

497
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,040
There! Hyun Jin is over there!

498
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
Teacher! There, over there.

499
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,790
What? What's wrong?

500
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,290
Let's buy one pair each, what do you think?

501
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,090
Yes, all right.

502
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,820
What color do you prefer?

503
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,490
I like this one.

504
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,420
- This one?
- Yes.

505
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,600
- You, Do Woo Jae–
- Excuse us.

506
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,870
Yes?

507
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,680
By any chance, do you have a girlfriend?

508
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,790
No, I don't.

509
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,940
Jae Yi, where are the waffles? I'm starving!

510
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,200
Please hurry!

511
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,270
Just a moment.

512
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh, are you all right?

513
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,730
There's medicine in the classroom, let's go there.

514
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,880
No, it's okay. I'll go alone.

515
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,270
Take care of them for me.

516
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,320
What were you saying?

517
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,690
Can you give me your number?

518
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,570
No, I'm sorry.

519
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,030
I liked you because you are different from me.

520
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,200
I liked you because we were so different.

521
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,250
Then you should have told me yesterday over the phone.

522
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,120
But we struggled so much because of our differences.

523
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,060
Can't you just tell me?

524
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,240
What I'm saying is, Jae Yi,

525
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,550
let's break up.

526
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,760
Do Woo Jae

527
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,360
Then, what did he say earlier?

528
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,370
Who?

529
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,450
- The guy from Yeonri High School dance team.
- Ah.

530
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,820
He asked if I had a Face profile.

531
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,500
And then?

532
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,730
Did you tell him your profile information?

533
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,770
Why are you asking me this?

534
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,670
I am curious because I like you.

535
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,700
I told you.

536
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,690
I'm asking 'cause I really don't understand.

537
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,510
If you like me–

538
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,790
How come you looked so coldly at me earlier?

539
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,160
- Earlier?
- Yes.

540
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,420
When I lost the USB. You gave me such a cold gaze.

541
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,410
That was because you made a mistake.

542
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,610
I believe that liking you is different from that.

543
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
Why?

544
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,070
Right, I forgot you were Go Eun Taek.

545
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,300
I told him I didn't have one.

546
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,320
The Face profile, I said I didn't have one.

547
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,600
- Oh really.
- Enjoy your meal.

548
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,660
Enjoy your meal.

549
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,150
Let's meet in the auditorium by 12:30.

550
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

551
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,530
I came all the way here to see you.

552
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,400
I made an effort, so come and meet me.

553
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,810
Stop pretending you're so busy.

554
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,540
So this is where Kim Yoo Sin was.

555
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,400
Oh, he must be sending a bouquet to Ji So Hyeon.

556
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,670
I was wondering what he'd been doing without calling me all day.

557
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,000
If you got one of these, too, you'd feel—

558
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,310
He was doing something useless.

559
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,460
What'd you say?

560
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,490
Nothing. There're twenty minutes left.

561
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,620
Ah. Okay.

562
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,790
Amazing! Hey, Go Eun Taek! Look at this. Yours got chosen!

563
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,090
Oh? It did.
Our Secret

564
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,260
- This is the one you requested, right?
- Yup.

565
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,120
Do you want to go inside?

566
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,740
Here?

567
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,990
So? What's this movie about?

568
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,790
You haven't seen this?

569
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,520
Nope.

570
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,750
I've seen this more than ten times, so I have the script memorized.

571
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,210
What is this? Do you even know how to lie?

572
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,470
This isn't a lie.

573
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,870
Then what's the next line?

574
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,770
I like you.

575
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,850
I like you

576
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,450
Whoa...

577
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,880
I've seen this a lot since I was little.

578
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,750
Why do you like this movie so much?

579
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,850
There isn't really a reason.

580
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,490
Just that those two people are together at the same time,

581
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,890
it looks really warm, should I say?

582
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,380
It's nothing spectacular, but still comforting?

583
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,720
What is this?

584
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,640
They were handing it out while we were coming out. You like this stuff so I grabbed you one.

585
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,430
Thanks.

586
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,000
You take one.

587
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,550
Yeah? Oh, where that is... I'm heading there now so I'll show you.

588
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,230
You look happy. LOL

589
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,920
What's that? Look at that! No way!

590
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,960
[Kang Jae Yi]
To be honest, I had my hopes up.

591
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,120
I thought we'd get back together like in the past,

592
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:20,260
but now I'm going to accept it. Let's really break up, Do Woo Jae.

593
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,330
Take care.

594
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,010
What about your burn–

595
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,710
Where are–

596
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,350
Thanks for everything. Take care.

597
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,640
Everyone stand by in your positions.

598
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,940
We're starting the countdown.

599
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,320
Three...

600
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,670
Two...

601
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,740
One...

602
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,240
Cue!

603
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,720
You've waited long, haven't you?

604
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,920
The long-awaited special performance will now begin!

605
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,520
Poetry

606
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,400
It's dark at night and I hear the cry of wolves.

607
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,470
Brother! Please help me this once!

608
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,090
Darn it!

609
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,950
Wow, you've both showed us great performances, but the contestant moving to the next round is...

610
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,740
the Seoyeon Chicken!

611
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,520
Relax a little! It's going well.

612
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,030
So far.

613
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,570
So about that... Can't you let me sing again? Please! Just one!

614
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,840
Who is that?

615
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,010
Not sure. I wasn't at the auditions either.

616
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,430
Please show us your face!

617
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,940
Excuse me.

618
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,860
- Me?
- Someone requested delivery at our booth today.

619
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,710
- Who did?
- Him.

620
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,010
- Please introduce yourself.
- Young Jae, are the lights ready to go?

621
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,790
Hello, I'm a sophomore named Kim Yoo Sin!

622
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,640
- Hey Ji So Hyeon.
- The reason why I joined the competition–

623
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,320
Thank you.

624
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:50,980
Yes, well this has been the first round! Yeah!

625
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,180
Ji So Hyeon, I kept my promise.

626
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,000
- What?
- I told you. I'd definitely come to see you.

627
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,770
But now that I'm seeing you in person, you look really different. Me, well, I prefer you this way.

628
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,230
I guess you don't know the difference between making a promise and being clingy. I told you pretty clearly.

629
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,520
I'm talking to way more guys than just you, and I've lost interest in you so leave me alone.

630
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,840
Hey! We haven't even been flirting for that long.

631
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,990
So frustrating.

632
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,900
Right? Right! I know we haven't met—

633
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,510
Why can't you freaking understand anything I'm saying?

634
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,850
If I put it this way, would it be easier to understand?

635
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,680
- Get lost.
- What?

636
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,350
I said get lost.

637
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:37,200
And also, don't go around telling people that I'm your girlfriend. It's an embarrassment.

638
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,550
That crazy bitch!

639
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,810
- What the?
- Where are you going?

640
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,970
Let go. Not letting go?

641
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,110
It's not 'bitch' it's "Ji So Hyeon". Also,

642
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,800
if So Hyeon tells you to stop calling her, then stop.

643
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,810
Surprise!

644
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,410
It's pretty, right? I've been making this all morning. Myself, directly.

645
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,190
- Kim Yoo Sin.
- Huh?

646
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,580
You heard everything, didn't you?

647
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:04,820
Then you should know, I obviously have no interest in dating.

648
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:10,420
So if you're going to go around spreading rumors, just stop it right now.

649
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,850
- Anyway, I—
- I won't.

650
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,940
I didn't have those thoughts from the beginning.

651
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:22,990
So I won't make you feel uncomfortable, nor will I make you worry.

652
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,760
So...

653
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,240
Don't ever ignore my texts. Okay?

654
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,420
So Hyeon, how many guys are you talking to? Can't you just tell me that much?

655
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,140
- Why are you curious about that?
- Oh, please! How many?

656
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,610
- Four?
- Me included?

657
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,790
No, wait. Six including you.

658
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,110
Not bad...

659
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,910
- What?
- Nice. I have a chance.

660
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,480
Now go away. I have to get ready for the next performance.

661
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,010
Can't I stay next to you? I couldn't even look at you properly today because of the competition.

662
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,980
- I won't bother you. Please?
- You can't.

663
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,290
Just once. Please?

664
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,750
Just once. I'll be quiet! Seriously!

665
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,650
Jin Gook, move the camera just one step?

666
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,460
Ho Rang Sunbae, is all set to go! The mood is amazing.

667
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:31,200
I know. Is everyone here to see Ho Rang Sunbae?

668
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,150
Wow, so cool.

669
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,730
I think we'll really get first place this year.

670
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,480
Yeah, I think so too.

671
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,090
Baek Ho Rang.

672
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,570
Baek Ho Rang, we're going to start soon, so get ready to go on stage.

673
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,850
Yeah.

674
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:16,260
Come out when you hear the sound effect and the light is fixed.

675
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,940
And...

676
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,730
Don't be nervous.

677
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,520
Nervous my butt. We've rehearsed so many times!

678
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,830
I know you'll do well.

679
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,460
Yes. I'll do well.

680
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,430
Let's do it.

681
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,620
Hello, I'm Baek Ho Rang, SHBS announcer.

682
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,080
Apparently, some of you didn't see the announcement yet, so we'll let you know.

683
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,260
If you click on the link uploaded to the broadcasting department Face page,

684
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,800
you can watch this broadcast live on YouTube.

685
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,480
So starting now, we are starting the SHBS "Adversary Corner".

686
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,030
Hey, Baek Ho Rang's live stream started!

687
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,380
...I'll confront them for you.

688
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:41,020
All the stories will be shared anonymously, so there's no need to worry.

689
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,630
Let's start with the first letter.

690
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,510
"During summer I bravely got my double-eyelid surgery."

691
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,520
"The swelling was gone and I was satisfied because my eyes looked natural, but my friend"

692
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,680
"posted a picture we took together one year ago on social media."

693
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,450
"That was before my surgery."

694
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:04,380
"This is what she said after adding a lot of filters for herself: #WhereisthisHospital,"

695
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,430
"#I'llGoRightAway; She's crazy, right?"

696
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:12,370
First, congrats on your surgery.

697
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,380
And friend, you asked where she got her surgery done.

698
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:20,190
Before fixing your face, you should fix your disgusting personality.

699
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,560
Deal with your inferiority complex at home.

700
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,300
- She's crushing her with facts.
- Are you watching this?

701
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,930
What is this broadcast?

702
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,020
- That hit the spot.
- Just you wait.

703
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,050
Good job.

704
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,170
Let's go to the second story.

705
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:42,450
"Not long ago, my friends defriended me, and shortly after, my boyfriend dumped me."

706
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,560
"He said he couldn't date me because we weren't at the same level anymore."

707
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:52,940
"But the thing is, I still miss him so much and this makes me really mad."

708
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,890
"If I ask him to stay with me, would that make me crazy?"

709
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,060
Yes, you are crazy.

710
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,710
If you want to live your life by his expectations, you can ask him to stay with you,

711
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:08,690
but if not, you should consider yourself lucky that a jerk like him left you.

712
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,800
Also, ex-boyfriend, are you watching this?

713
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,390
I don't know where your level is, but you should come to your senses.

714
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:26,330
There are a lot of comments.

715
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,830
Congrats on 200 thousand followers, Unni!

716
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,870
- Forty seconds.
- You look as beautiful as ever!

717
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,020
Isn't this a PR stunt?

718
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,840
- Thirty seconds.
- This is not PR stunt.

719
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,690
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Twenty seconds.

720
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:35,930
Are you seeing someone?

721
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,990
Am I seeing someo...

722
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,160
- Who is it?
- Tell us!

723
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,990
- No!
- Tell us!

724
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,610
This is not my personal broadcast, I'll skip the question.

725
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,620
Ten seconds.

726
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,820
Five seconds.

727
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,420
It's time to come down now, Ho Rang.

728
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,590
What's her deal?
What is this?
WOW!

729
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:05,020
- No way!
- What's this?

730
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,470
Check it.

731
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,940
- What is this?
- Incredible!

732
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,650
- She's so nasty and fake.
- I wouldn't have done this if I were her.

733
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,030
This is crazy.

734
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,570
Wow, incredible.
This is the real Ho Rang...

735
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,520
Really don't want to see her.
Her personality sucks.

736
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,400
The truth of Baek Ho Rang now revealed.

737
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,790
I witnessed school violence!
Here's the truth about Baek Ho Rang.

738
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:30,900
Did she forget what she did

739
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,190
Here it is.
- Happy birthday!

740
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:41,920
Ho Rang, it's your birthday. We should have fun.

741
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,920
You're a nobody.

742
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,450
- No way.
- Baek Ho Rang.
- Baek Ho Rang.

743
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:53,000
Baek Ho Rang! Baek Ho Rang!

744
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,490
You look happy.

745
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,930
Know your place. Will you be fine?

746
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,830
I have nothing to lose, but you do. You are a picky eater, Ho Rang.

747
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,760
I'll show you.

748
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,520
Just you wait. The truth about Baek Ho Rang...

749
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,620
Here it is.

750
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,960
Stop them.

751
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,320
Young Jae, hit the lights.

752
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,240
I said, hit the lights!

– Preview –

775
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,010
Did you contact Baek Ho Rang?

776
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,630
No, she won't answer the phone.

777
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,120
Is Baek Ho Rang dropping out of school?

778
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,700
You are scared now. You pretended to be great,

779
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,930
but you're scared that everyone will find out that you used to get beat up cowardly.

780
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,980
What are you trying to hide? Tell me.

781
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,600
There's something wrong, right?

782
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,890
Is that why you aren't telling me anything?
