1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,700
Where are you?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,030
The classroom. I'm not on duty today.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,000
Come to the broadcasting room.

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,250
What did you get?

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,880
The thing is... Ho Rang Sunbae told me that she'd give me some of her sponsored products if I did her work for her.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,210
You're here.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,090
Do you hear what you're saying now?

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,920
I heard that Baek Ho Rang joined your broadcasting club. How is she?

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,420
I've moved everything.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,700
She really wasn't so great at first, but it seems she has gotten better now.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,770
Yesterday I switched to new markers. Should I bring them now?

12
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,020
It's okay. Just leave it.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,500
- Why didn't you bring them?
- I switched them yesterday.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,420
- Sunbae.
- I'll do it. Give it to me.
- Hi!

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,890
Hello!

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,400
- Did someone get into trouble?
- Those guys.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,160
- I'll do it.
- Sunbae.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,960
Go Eun Taek, here is the revised script.

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,130
Let us do it.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,220
Broadcasting Club Class
Cheer up, Go Eun Taek

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,310
Hello, my beloved friend.
– Episode 2 –

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,120
After the Elephant Hat, did you receive my second gift? You were surprised, right?

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,350
I really wanted to see your reaction, but it's too bad.

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,430
Oh, and I kept myself a secret from the friend who sent you the gift.

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,730
I hope you like it a lot. See you again.

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,430
I'll start this next song,

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,900
These moments are when–

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,830
Hey, Baek Ho Rang!

29
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,530
Hey, you're listening, aren't you? Doing this doesn't scare me at all.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,660
So, come to me and say it to my face.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,800
Don't hide and say all this bull crap!

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,780
I was so shocked upon hearing this. Is this a prank, is it?

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,590
You punk! You...

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,660
That's admirable.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,940
Please work even harder, for our school,

36
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,430
Seoyeon High School.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,860
Got that? Are you even aware of the huge problem you caused?

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,860
Do you know that, you punk?

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,990
How dare you consider this a joke?

40
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,160
You punk, for someone who never gets into trouble, how could you stir up something so big?

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,960
Now since it already happened, just cut the segments and give more tasks to others.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,100
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes? Sorry.

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,930
Think about it.

44
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,500
So, you chose something like this as your story?

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Huh? Apologize first. You caused trouble for everyone here.

46
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,460
Alright. I'm sorry about that.

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,290
Now, answer me. I'm asking if you're the one who chooses those rubbish stories.

48
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,940
Well... We're going to leave first.

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,340
- So Hyeon Sunbae, we'll leave now. Bye.
- See you.

50
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,690
Yes. I chose them.

51
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,440
What weird taste.

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,620
- Listen So Hyeon, if you're going to do this—
- I feel that you're really hiding something.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,460
- What?
- What is it?

54
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,020
What is it that had you so scared?

55
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,090
Should I tell you something? Since long ago, you–

56
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,820
Ji So Hyeon.

57
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,810
What are you doing?

58
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,360
- What?
- In your eyes, is what we're doing all a joke?

59
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,210
Yes. It is like a joke.

60
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,260
Did you bring me in without knowing this is how I am? You knew.

61
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,750
You brought me in because you guys wanted the attention.

62
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,840
You don't need it now?

63
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,170
Leave it then.

64
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,520
You think other's business doesn't matter but yours is the most important?

65
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,200
I do not know how famous you are to behave like that, but you know what?

66
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,530
There's no one by your side.

67
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,760
You think all the attention you're getting belongs to you, don't you? Don't get it wrong.

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,290
People just need someone to pay attention to. You just happened to be in that spot.

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,760
When people stop caring about you, do you think there will be anyone left around you?

70
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:54,660
Wake up. People who live like that end up alone forever.

71
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,590
Hey. You're the one who needs to wake up.

72
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,320
Hey, that's what I want to tell you. You must think if you act cool and tough, you might be a famous student.

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,500
You'll be the one with no one by your side.

74
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,180
To rot at an awful place like this for the rest of your life.

75
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,760
Go.

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,310
Baek Ho Rang is unpredictable.

77
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,740
How can she cause trouble at the beginning of the semester?

78
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,340
- Who?
- Baek Ho Rang.

79
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,100
Be careful. There's water.

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,630
Hey Woo Jae, want to go to the Han River after the exams? I want to experience something.

81
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,870
- I want to try putting up a tent by the Han River and eat ramen.
- Han River?

82
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,970
Or, how about just studying there? What do you think? We can also bring a mat.

83
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,790
If we stay too long by the Han River, it'll get cold.

84
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,810
Geez, if it gets cold, we'll just bring down jackets with us.

85
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,630
- All right.
- I'll look into it then.

86
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,820
Let's get some gummy bears on our way back.

87
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,410
I downloaded an American Netflix Drama so we can watch it offline.

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,940
Sorry, I promised to play soccer with the guys.

89
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,880
What? We talked about it on the phone yesterday. We promised to watch a drama at lunchtime today.

90
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,890
- I promised them last week.
- Then you should've told me on the phone yesterday.

91
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,660
All right. I'll contact you later then.

92
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,640
- Hey, Kang Jae Yi!
- Hey! Let's go together!

93
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,940
- Can you do this?
- What?

94
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,010
- What is it?
- It's a trend.

95
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,930
- What sort of a trend is this?
- How come you don't know about this?

96
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,010
Misunderstanding due to lack of proper communication.

97
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,630
This is class one and two, right?

98
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,640
- Yes.
- You were so cool just now.

99
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,550
Shut up. I'm in a bad mood.

100
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,580
Is this the reason you joined the broadcasting team? So that you can go after the person who's exposing you?

101
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,170
You're sure on a whole other level!

102
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,760
Wait, won't this mess cause trouble for my So Hyeon?

103
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,250
- Kim Yoo Sin.
- That's me!

104
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,380
- Concentrate, Yoo Sin.
- Yes.

105
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,990
- Kim Joo Hyeon.
- I'm telling you to just give it up. Don't lay your hand on the broadcasting club.

106
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,680
Hey, Kim Yoo Sin.

107
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,270
Has that mouth of yours ever taken a beating?

108
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,040
Also, don't mention the broadcasting club to me again.

109
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,820
I quit.

110
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,310
Really? Awesome!

111
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,230
Application for SHBS, Kim Yoo Sin

112
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you, my friend! This is a God-given opportunity!

113
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,130
Ji So Hyeon

114
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,000
But in that case, why did you join?

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,350
You never had an interest in that kind of thing.

116
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,100
There was something I was looking for,

117
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,450
but I don't need it anymore.

118
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,900
What is it?

119
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,960
I can do it by myself. I can do it.

120
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,900
I can do it, my foot.
A few days later

121
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,420
Gosh!

122
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,460
You have so much money. Why are you always taking the bus?

123
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,020
How could I take the taxi to and from school all the time?

124
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,820
Why not? You even buy expensive candles.

125
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,310
Ho Rang, here. You know the YouTuber Melonie, right?

126
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,320
Wow, what a piece of trash. I better unsubscribe.

127
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,990
- Ho Rang, I'm leaving! See you tomorrow!
- Yeah.

128
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
I'll explain.

129
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,950
Are you going to take it down, or what do you want to do?

130
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,340
It's true. She suddenly contacted me to tell me things you hate hearing.

131
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,540
It was also my first time seeing that ID.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
Ho Rang, let's go to the new VR after school.

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,460
If you post it, you'll definitely get a lot of likes, so...

134
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,260
I've been wanting to try that. Is it good?

135
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,980
- Do you want to try it?
- Yeah, just one bite!
- Come here.

136
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,100
That's my friend, Baek Ho Rang.

137
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,060
Ho Rang, say hi.

138
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,510
- Hi!
- Kim Yoo Sin, have fun. I'm leaving.

139
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,210
Why? Let's go together.

140
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,380
Yes! We got some more snacks, let's enjoy it!

141
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,710
Go Eun Taek.

142
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,990
Do you have a bit of time?

143
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,570
Sorry.

144
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,790
I'm saying I'm sorry.

145
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,940
No matter how mad I was, I shouldn't have acted so stubbornly.

146
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,220
Also, I didn't get hurt at all from your blunt remarks.

147
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm completely fine.

148
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,750
I never asked if you were okay.

149
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,280
I thought you might have been feeling sorry towards me.

150
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,430
Not at all. When I think about what you did, I still get mad every time.

151
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,690
All right. It was all my fault.

152
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,000
- So, just—
- That's right, it was your fault.

153
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,900
It's true that it's my fault, but...

154
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,690
Then, what about you? You probably didn't do anything right, either.

155
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,730
Look at you. You're not sorry at all, are you?

156
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,750
It's obvious.

157
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,190
No, of course, I'm sorry. I am sorry, but...

158
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,650
No, but why am I apologizing when he was the one who spoke all rudely?

159
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,100
Did you call me to say this?

160
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,140
The one getting mad every time is me, not you. Isn't that right?

161
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,720
- I'm going.
- Sure, go!

162
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm going to go, too.

163
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,700
Okay, last sentence.

164
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,450
She had no way out.

165
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,560
She had no way to get out. Right?

166
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Yes.

167
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,520
So what's the tone of the current narrator like?
 Ji So Hyeon, Kim Yoo Sin

168
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,220
Getting worried!

169
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,750
It's Ji So Hyeon.

170
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,660
Isn't she so cute?

171
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,140
If you get anything wrong, then correct it.

172
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,590
How do you guys refresh your mood?

173
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,530
You would have it completed by now.

174
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,520
We are going to start group performances next week.

175
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,330
- Can't we just have tests?
- Pay attention here.

176
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,610
I picked randomly, so don't complain and gather in your groups. Quickly now.

177
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,470
Yes.

178
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,700
Lee Jun Ho > Kang Jae Yi
Kang Jae Yi, Pingsu Friend looks like you.

179
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,970
Kang Jae Yi! Can you do this?

180
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,910
Do you think everybody's work is insignificant?

181
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,500
Yes, it does seem so.

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then, what about you? You probably didn't do anything right, either.

183
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,360
I was wondering since when you played games, a guy like you who writes in your planner that you're going to an Internet cafe.

184
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,390
I did write it down. There are thirty-seven minutes left now.

185
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,500
- Are you being like this because of them?
- Who?

186
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,520
The broadcasting accident.

187
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,970
Anyway, we fought again today.

188
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,190
I heard everything is cool now. Jae Yi told me that things are hot even on the Seoyeon confessions page.

189
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,000
The page?

190
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,530
Year 2, Class 1 Baek Ho Rang was living the way she wanted every day, lol.

191
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,210
Seeing how Baek Ho Rang is in the classroom nowadays, she must've been fired after causing the broadcasting accident.

192
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,890
- What in the world does Baek Ho Rang do?
- Ho Rang?

193
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,830
I'm Ho Rang's best friend. Oh!

194
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,750
You guys play this game too. Let's play on the same team. What's your user nickname?

195
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,590
Give it to me, I'll do it for you.

196
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,360
Just a sec.

197
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,460
Okay, done. Give me yours, too.

198
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,620
Done. Start, start!

199
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,200
Hurry, hurry, start.

200
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,030
I picked randomly, so don't complain and gather in your groups.

201
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,870
Who knows how to make a PowerPoint?

202
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,090
Who made you feel bad? I won't leave them alone.

203
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,610
I'm in the same group as Baek Ho Rang.

204
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,790
Who wants to look up references?

205
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,230
Give it to me. What is it?

206
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,800
What do I have to do to look up references? I'll do it.

207
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Call me ASAP.

208
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,370
ASAP? What is this?

209
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,920
What does this mean? Oh, to be sly as a fox.

210
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,890
Are they saying to call them slyly, like a fox?

211
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,280
- What is this?
- Hey.

212
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,480
Does that make sense?

213
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,440
They're saying to call them "ASAP".

214
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,470
That must be then. You're so ill-mannered.

215
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,120
I am what?

216
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,820
I was already in a bad mood today, but now you're making me even more annoyed.

217
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,850
Guys, it's not "ASAP". It's "As Soon As"—

218
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,490
You were annoying me since way before, okay?

219
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,260
I'm saying I'm getting more annoyed than you are.

220
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,160
Teach! Can't you switch me out?

221
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,030
Si Eun, let's look up references first, then—

222
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,190
This weekend, I have to go to the countryside with my mom.

223
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,640
Ye Seung, if you do it first and show me, then later I'll—

224
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,530
Don't get cute.

225
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,390
What are you saying? How dare you try to dump all the work on us?

226
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,890
Then I'll look up references. How about you two make the PowerPoint?

227
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,830
Why?

228
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,850
- Let's finish up quickly.
- Yeah.

229
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm busy, so finish up quickly.

230
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm busier than you are.

231
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,230
What about Yoo Si Eun?
Give me the references.
Hey, Yoo Si Eun

232
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,770
Yoo Si Eun didn't even read my message. She has to send the references for us to make the PowerPoint!

233
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,190
That's really bad.

234
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,680
Could You Save the Earth?

235
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,800
This is a hundred times better than your Bonobono PowerPoint.

236
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,960
What? Even your font sucks, too.

237
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,260
In the time you're saying nonsense—

238
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,150
What's this?

239
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,450
- Hey, Do Woo Jae!
- Yeah.

240
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,710
What? That's it?

241
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,370
Oh, you called?

242
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Where are you?

243
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,160
At an Internet cafe. I'm with Eun Taek right now.

244
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Go Eun Taek?

245
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,960
No, but if you went to an Internet cafe, you should've told me you went there.

246
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,120
Come to think, you never tell me things like this first.

247
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,290
Only I'm curious about it every day. Ugh, whatever. I'm hanging up!

248
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,900
Yeah.

249
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,430
What? I told him to hang up, and he really hangs up?

250
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,690
Damn it, Do Woo Jae.

251
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,320
- He said he's with Go Eun Taek?
- What?

252
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,700
What'd he say they're doing now?

253
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,840
Do you hang up for real when I tell you to?

254
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,590
No, but why don't you ask where I am? Aren't you curious?

255
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,360
Why don't you ask in return? Can you even play games right now?

256
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,000
This isn't the time for you to be playing games. It's not the time for you to be at an Internet cafe...

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,450
We made a lot of progress in English, right?

258
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,910
Yes, we have a steady speed.

259
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,720
That's what I'm saying.

260
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,420
- What's up?
- I left my pencil case behind.

261
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,970
- You go ahead.
- Sure. See you tomorrow.

262
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,380
See you.

263
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,330
Isn't it obvious?

264
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,170
Who? Ji So Hyeon? Is she like that at your school, too?

265
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,120
She doesn't say a word to us, but she talks a lot in front of the guys.

266
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
Such a sly girl.

267
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,390
Come to think, she's in touch with male upperclassmen at our school.

268
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,930
I'm telling you, she looks so pure and innocent, they completely fall for it.

269
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,520
Doesn't she seem sort of starved for affection?

270
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
I think those kinds of kids are starved for affection.

271
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
Can you give me that?

272
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,870
- This?
- Yeah.

273
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,120
Thanks.

274
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,380
See you tomorrow, guys.

275
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,150
Acting pretty?

276
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,420
That's crazy.

277
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,670
Amazing, really.

278
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,700

Application to SHBS

282
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,000
I can sit, right? I came to do an interview.

283
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,370
Baek Ho Rang's SNS @tigrrrrrre_

Baek Ho Rang, 70 posts, 170,000 followers, 0 following

286
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,590
How can somebody think she is 17?

287
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,990
I enjoyed watching you break your parents' backs.

288
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,920
I thought she was difficult to approach. I just acted a little friendly and she came attracted right away.

289
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,160
She's dumb. She's a little simple.

290
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,380
I pretended to like her a couple of times, and she thinks it's real.

291
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,770
She said hi to me today, too.

292
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,940
Jae Yi did tell me about things being hot on the Seoyeon confessions page.

293
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,130
So come say it to my face.

294
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,860
Mom

295
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,230
- Hello—
- I called by mistake.

296
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,610
I was going to call your dad.

297
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,860
You don't need more money?

298
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,660
- How about food?
- I ate and left.

299
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,780
No, there— Yeah, you can leave it there.

300
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,350
Ho Rang, I'll call you later, okay?

301
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,000
Special Lecture

303
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,800
Why can't I reach you nowadays?

304
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,010
Want to go outside for a bit?

305
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,390
Yeah, let's go and come back.

306
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,500
Here.

307
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,860
Thanks.

308
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,970
Is it over once we finish the English presentation next week?

309
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,710
Yeah, probably.

310
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,720
I'd rather take a test.

311
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,310
That's what I'm saying. Human relations are more stressful than academic stress.

312
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,830
Who's in your group?

313
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,670
Seo Yun Gi and Lee Ji Tae.

314
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,190
Oh. Good luck.

315
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,620
By the way, are you going to pick a new one?

316
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,030
For what?

317
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,340
She left. Baek Ho Rang.

318
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh. We have to anyway, right?

319
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,840
I'll put up a notice next Monday.

320
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,420
Yeah.

321
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,940
She's always been like that. She comes in and leaves however she wants.

322
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,730
Just don't worry about it.

323
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,290
You must know Baek Ho Rang well.

324
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,180
I just knew her for a bit in middle school.

325
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,990
LP Store

326
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,230
Hello?

327
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,510
I need to take this call for a bit.

328
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,130
Yes.

329
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,420
So Hyeon. Do you like macarons by any chance?

330
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,170
I still have the chocolates you gave me, though?

331
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,460
Kim Yoo Sin. Send Message. See Kim Yoo Sin's info.

332
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,580
Baek Ho Rang doesn't ever get tired of it, seeing how she wants to meet up on the weekend.

333
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,270
At any rate, I can't live because of you. I'll treat you at the cafe.

334
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,150
Ho Rang, what you bought is more delicious. How did we meet there just like that?

335
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,790
Tell me about it. Of all places, in front of my house, which is in the opposite direction of yours.

336
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,820
Hey, Kim Yoo Sin. Do I have to see you even on the weekends?

337
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,310
You don't have friends to hang out with on the weekend, so you'd be lonely anyway.

338
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,000
And you got fired from the broadcasting club on top of that.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,290
Who said that I got fired?

340
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,910
I didn't get fired. I left on my own, got it?

341
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,080
Didn't Eun Taek fire you?

342
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,650
I'm telling you, that's not it. And since when did you start calling him Eun Taek?

343
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,590
I'm totally close with Eun Taek!

344
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,840
We also went to the internet cafe together recently.

345
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,360
Whatever. Anyway, eat and go off on your own. I have a lot of things to buy today, so I'm busy.

346
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,870
That so? I'm coming with you.

347
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,490
No. I want some peace, so eat this and just go home.

348
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,230
- Bye.
- I am almost done. Let's go together. Baek Ho Rang!

349
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,740
Wait for me!

350
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,490
Good. It's perfect.

351
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,920
What are you doing at home when it's the weekend?

352
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,860
You're not going on a date?

353
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,010
Oh my, Mother. Since when did I do that?

354
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,010
Aish!

355
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,120
Damn it.

356
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
Woo Sol, are you home?

357
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,070
Yeah, I arrived just now. Why?

358
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,470
Is Do Woo Jae home?

359
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,540
No, I don't think he's home yet—

360
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,780
Unni, did you fight with Do Woo Jae? He's cleaning right now.

361
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,180
I think I've gotten really close with Eun Taek.

362
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,580
Want this?

363
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,080
Thank you.

364
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,990
So like, did Go Eun Taek say anything in particular?

365
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,780
Eun Taek? About what?

366
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,360
No, just, like...

367
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,540
Never mind. I'll take the taxi home. What about you?

368
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,850
Really, already? Ugh, why? Hang out with me longer.

369
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,950
I get tired when I'm with you.

370
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,330
I'm going home to rest, so you go home now too.

371
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,900
Fine.

372
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,090
But when are we meeting tomorrow?

373
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,940
What are you saying? I'm going.

374
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,190
Hey, Ho Rang! Call me when you get home!

375
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,260
I'll wear these socks well!

376
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,630
You startled me!

377
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,690
What the heck is up with you?

378
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,510
I'm going home.

379
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,980
Home. I'm also going hom—

380
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,980
By any chance, do you live in Mirae?

381
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,660
Yeah.

382
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,390
Hey. Instead of bothering me by walking behind me, why don't you walk in front?

383
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,980
Hey, Baek Ho Rang.

384
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,240
Let's talk for a bit.

385
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,970
About what?

386
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,370
I was just wondering if you weren't tired of living like that.

387
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,290
Are you picking a fight with me here, right now?

388
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm not picking a fight. I mean it. I saw your account.

389
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,450
After going in and looking at it, I get why you made such a big deal now.

390
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,020
What did you see that you're acting like this all of a sudden?

391
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,190
But that definitely doesn't mean it was okay for you to cause trouble,

392
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,500
since it's clear that you made a mistake.

393
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,470
Hey. That's why I apologized. I said I'm sorry.

394
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,320
Is that an apology? That's you picking a fight.

395
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,710
In any case, I'll apologize for what I said while not knowing anything. I'm sorry about that.

396
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,470
Yeah. You did say harsh things without knowing the whole story.

397
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,580
Were you hurt?

398
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,920
Hurt? People on your level don't even have an impact on me.

399
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,610
There are people lined up to hurt me excluding you.

400
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,540
What's this? An LP?

401
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,150
Yeah.

402
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,030
Can I have a look?

403
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,480
Ugh, what's this?

404
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,540
I have tissues.

405
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,410
Why isn't it coming off?

406
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,260
Hey!

407
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,440
Starting today, we have to check the sounds for CSAT. Hee Soo and Eun Ha are on duty, right?
(T/N: CSAT stands for College Scholastic Ability Test)

408
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,270
- Also...
- Eun Taek.

409
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,180
Then, are we picking another announcer?

410
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,020
Should I upload another post on Face?

411
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,860
Oh, about that—

412
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,850
- You're eight minutes late.
- Yeah, I know.

413
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,620
- Clean up after we're done.
- Okay.

414
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,060
- Good work.
- Good work.

415
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,360
- Good work.
- Good work.

416
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,230
- You all know that the UCC is airing at 6 pm today, right?
- Yes.

417
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,330
Come back by 5:30 pm if you're on duty.

418
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,430
- Okay.
- Good job.

419
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,240
- Good job.

420
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,510
You're not leaving?

421
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,320
Yeah, you go first. I have something to say to Baek Ho Rang.

422
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,530
Sure.

423
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,330
Sure. See you later, Go Eun Taek.

424
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,080
Yeah.

425
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,910
What do you have to say? Is it about cleaning up?

426
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,640
Here.

427
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,770
What's this?

428
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,400
It's the broadcasting club account. I want you to work hard.

429
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,550
I will.

430
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,130
One more thing. Don't forget you're indebted to me for yesterday.

431
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,210
I got it.

432
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,530
- Make sure to repay it.
- I said, I got it.

433
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,140
- Let's go.
- You go first.

434
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,810
Why? What are you going to do?

435
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,290
I want to rest for five minutes before I go back to class.

436
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,640
Okay, don't be late.

437
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,350

Hello my lovely friend, it's almost your birthday.

448
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,140
The party we had in ninth grade was really fun.

449
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,660
Do you remember? Angel Karaoke.

450
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,280
I really liked the times back then. It's been two years already.

451
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,040
I hope you really like it.

452

♫ Whose warm prayer ♫

454
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,440
I love you.

I'm thinking of training Baek Ho Rang soon.

459
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,660
As an announcer?

460
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,980
Speaking of which, I'm hoping you could do it.

461
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,750
I see.

462
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,300
Does it make you uncomfortable?

463
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,830
No, what's there to be uncomfortable about?

464
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,270
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

465
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,480
I'm going to stop by the convenience store before PE. Want to come?

466
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,720
I have to lock the doors before we leave. You go.

467
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,830
Do you want us to wait?

468
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,600
- It's fine, you guys go.
- Okay.

Send a Message

476
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,390
Hello.

477
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,690
Har Ley

478
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,240
Ho Rang, let's go.

479
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,680
Are you close with Ji So Hyeon?

480
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,400
Of course.

481
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,500
- So Hyeon and I are really close nowadays.
- Really?

482
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,450
She's close with me, Do Woo Jae,

483
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,380
Eun Taek, Yeonri High's Park Sang Min.

484
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,760
But we're probably the closest.

485
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,250
She doesn't like guys like you.

486
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,030
How would you know?

487
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,670
What does she like? What's her type?

488
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,530
Do we have a meeting later?

489
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,330
Yes, we have to practice our positioning for the festival.

490
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,880
That's hilarious.

491
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,290
Hi, Oppa.

492
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,470
Hi, Woo Sol.

493
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,050
We'll go to the convenience store first.

494
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,480
- See you later.
- Hurry up.

495
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,380
- Do Woo Jae, give me ₩2,000 ($2).
- I don't have any cash.

496
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,100
I know you do, I saw.

497
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,000
- I don't have any.
- I saw you did.

498
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,420
- I saw that you had some.
- I don't have any.

499
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,910
- Here, I only have ₩1000.
- Thank you.

500
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,090
Don't give it to her. She won't pay you back.

501
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,760
I'll pay you back.

502
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
Did you call Jae Yi Unni?

503
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,730
Mind your own business, I'll handle it myself.

504
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,100
Like hell, you'll handle it yourself. It's so obvious you kept your mouth shut and went "Yeah" or "No."

505
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,950
Jae Yi Unni always goes through so much trouble putting up a one-man show.

506
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,670
Go. Hurry, and go.

507
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,160
I was going to go anyway. Listen to me well, otherwise, you will regret it later.

508
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,910
See you later, Eun Taek Oppa.

509
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,570
See you again.

510
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,260
I agree with what Woo Sol said.

511
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,600
You, too?

512
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,820
Isn't Kang Jae Yi a bit special?

513
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,150
Someone who speaks with no filter might be annoyed at how you never speak your mind.

514
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,170
Get angry, and let her know when you have a problem.

515
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,080
Wait up.

516
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,120
Hey, see if it sticks out somewhere.

517
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,930
It doesn't. What do you think? Do my legs look long?

518
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,550
You just look like a farmer.

519
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,170
Did you wash your pants? I think they smell.

520
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,400
What's wrong with you, I washed them.

521
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,050
Is it me then?

522
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,830
Everyone gather around.

523
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,020
Teacher Han had to go to the hospital today.

524
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,780
So, classes one and three will have class together. What was it again?

525
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,050
Right, you were supposed to prepare for your test.

526
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,630
But you can't, so let's play dodgeball between the two classes.

527
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,300
How's that? Great, right?

528
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,080
Class one, class three, gather around!

529
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,520
Park Sam Sik go get the ball.

530
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,720
One from each team come out.

531
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:42,920
What will happen if you throw the ball on the face of your ex in the other class? It will painful, they will tear up. Got it?

532
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,230
- Hey, move over a bit.
- What are you?

533
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,730
So Hyeon, Fighting!

534
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,440
Is he on our team or not?

535
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,760
Let's just put him in the middle so he can die.

536
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,480
- Don't step on the line.
- Hey, you don't step on the line.

537
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,610
Mind your manners. Ready? You take it.

538
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,100
Hey, give it to me. Quickly.

539
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,140
♫ Yesterday was like a warning signal that it frightened me (I know it now) ♫

540
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,590
♫ In your shining eyes, it feels like I can become anything ♫

541
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,800
♫ Ooo, glamorous light up, my heart sometimes beating, beating ♫

542
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
♫ It's blinding, blinding so that it's dangerous ♫

543
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:27,810
♫ Ooo, even when you get lost, follow the line your heart drew, drew ♫

544
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,230
Baek Ho Rang, that was so scary! Are you okay? You're not hurt?

545
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,980
I'm fine.

546
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,900
♫ Let's color your mind, I get more curious, it gets more mysterious ♫

547
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,700
♫ Color the world with you, as you wish alright ♫

548
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:54,770
♫ Really, really do ♫

549
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,230
Are you okay?

550
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,440
- I'm fine, be sure to win.
- Got it.

551
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,980
♫  Really, really do, as you wish your light  ♫

552
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,490
Hey, Do Woo Jae. Hey, Do Woo Jae!

553
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,410
Why didn't you avoid the ball?

554
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,040
I wanted to get it over with.

555
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,880
Don't lie. Anyone can tell that you are mad.

556
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,450
What about yesterday? Why didn't you call me?

557
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,990
I was studying.

558
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,870
Seriously.

559
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,840
Are you the only one annoyed? I'm annoyed too.

560
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,820
Why do I have to pull you aside and force you to talk every time? Why?

561
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,220
- Come on, you did.
- When did I do that?

562
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,020
Jae Yi,

563
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,330
me not calling you all day isn't something to be upset over.

564
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,530
I'm not like this because you didn't get back to me for one whole day.

565
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,570
Other people call each other every day, you're the one who doesn't.

566
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,840
Okay, I'm sorry.

567
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,180
Do Woo Jae. I've gone out with you for two years,

568
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,900
but I have no idea what you're thinking.

569
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,500
I feel like I'm the only one putting on a show about our relationship.

570
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,350
Forget it, I'm the only one who'll have a hard time if I get upset.

571
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,800
Har Ley

572
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,770
Go Eun Taek wants me to train you.

573
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,280
- So, later—
- Ji So Hyeon.

574
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,160
Did you...

575
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,130
You really get on my nerves.

576
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,330
That's a relief.

577
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,050
I thought only I felt that way.

578
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,810
Seriously, if you're done washing your hands get out.

579
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,480
Move.

580
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,170
Baek Ho Rang! We have to prepare for the presentation. Why are you wasting time here?

581
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,100
Why are you picking a fight with me?

582
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,370
No, Yoo Si Eun skipped the meeting yesterday, too. Shouldn't we just remove her name?

583
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,360
This is annoying.

584
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,920
You're angry because of Do Woo Jae, not Yoo Si Eun.

585
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,390
Why would I be angry because of Do Woo Jae? I'm not!

586
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,380
Why? In the gym period earlier, why didn't you guys just grab each other's collars and fight?

587
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,610
Enough, just hurry and give me the USB.

588
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,400
Why would you ask in the bathroom? Follow me.

589
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,380
I'm already following you.

590
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,920
Friends: Ji So Hyeon

591
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,760
Lee Sun Joo

592
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,940
Lee Sun Joo

593
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,790
So Hyeon! So Hyeon!

594
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,590
How does it feel where Baek Ho Rang hit you earlier?

595
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,360
I got all this from the nurse, so make sure to use them, okay?

596
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,010
You didn't have to. Thanks.

597
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,950
That Baek Ho Rang really needs to kill that temper of hers.

598
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,290
She was complaining about how she didn't want to do it, but she was the worst out of everyone.

599
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,810
So Hyeon, even if it doesn't hurt now, it could hurt later so make sure—

600
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,880
- Yoo Sin.
- Yeah?

601
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,740
I'm really okay, so can you go now?

602
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,390
Since I have to get ready for class.

603
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,320
Oh, I stole some of your time, didn't I?

604
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,630
I'll come back next time! Good luck getting ready for class, So Hyeon.

605
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,410
Suitable solution to your problem is the key.

606
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,960
Anyone can become an assailant, and anyone can become a victim.

607
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,880
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

608
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,590
Baek Ho Rang. You go in too and watch for today.

609
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,100
What?

610
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,300
I don't want to.

611
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,790
It's not even today's lunch broadcast.

612
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,650
And hold the broadcast script on top of the table.

613
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,560
All you have to do is just read as it's written here.

614
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,730
After you're done reading it, so that your voice isn't transmitted,

615
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,420
make sure to turn off the mic, and signal to Go Eun Taek.

616
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,960
We're going live in fifteen seconds. Get ready.

617
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,900
And... Pay attention. Don't cause another accident and make the people around you suffer.

618
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,790
Five seconds.

619
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,980
May I have your attention?

620
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,330
The school violence prevention education video will broadcast soon.

621
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,060
So please turn on the TV in your classroom and wait.

622
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,190
I repeat.

623
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,310
The school violence prevention education video will broadcast soon.

624
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:08,450
So please turn on the TV in your classroom and wait.

625
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,720
The first step to preventing school bullying is a concern.

626
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,000
If anyone has suffered from violence,

627
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,490
or have witnessed an act of violence, you must request help from your teachers or parents immediately.

628
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:25,480
If you use fear as an excuse to keep quiet, no one will be able to help you.

629
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,910
Because if you don't say anything, no one will know.

[Kang Jae Yi]
Jae Yi, later...

631
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,870
The courage to let people know, the courage to not bear it anymore,

632
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,580
that is the most important.

633
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,560
If something happens, don't cry by yourself

634
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,200
and tell me or the teacher right away. You, too.

635
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,030
Kim Yoo Sin. You should make sure you don't get beaten up.

636
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,700
Worry about yourself.

637
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,360
Okay, but make sure to tell me. Got it?

638
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,230
So in order for school bullying not to arise,

639
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:16,010
continuous conversation with your friend is required, as well as a proper solution to work out the problem.

640
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,790
Anyone can become a bully or a victim.

641
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,920
There are ten seconds left.

642
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,880
What kind of person do you want to become, everyone?

643
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,920
It was Ms. Kim So Young from Green Tree Foundation on school violence prevention until now.

644
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,930
Do we have a meeting tomorrow morning?

645
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,950
No, we don't. Let's see each other again tomorrow at lunch.

646
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,330
- Good work.
- Good work.

647
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,320
You did well today.

648
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,150
Good work.

649
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,940
Is Baek Ho Rang ready for tomorrow onward?

650
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,500
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

651
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,730
Why aren't you going?

652
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,030
What were you talking about just now? What's happening with Ji So Hyeon tomorrow?

653
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,290
You're taking over.

654
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,430
Taking over? Do we really have to do that?

655
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,190
Do you know what you have to do as an announcer?

656
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,400
I just have to read what's written on the paper exactly as it's written.

657
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,420
Starting from tomorrow, learn well what So Hyeon teaches you.

658
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,350
- Soon, we'll have you working on your own.
- Damn it.

659
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,360
Then you do it. I don't want to do it with Ji So Hyeon.

660
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,410
Is the broadcasting club a joke? Doing things as you want.

661
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,230
Why? She said she was fine working with you but are you uncomfortable?

662
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,420
Did she talk about me?

663
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,860
She just told me that you two knew each other in middle school.

664
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,590
Whatever. Anyway, you are in charge of my taking over.

665
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,520
I'll think about it.

666
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,120
You'll think about it?

667
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,260
If it's not you, I said I'm not doing it, okay?

668
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,920
- Hurry up and go.
- I really won't do it.

669
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,460
I got it. I said I'll think about it.

670
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,290
- Aren't you going?
- I'm going to work on some editing.

671
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,900
Okay.

672
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,500
Why are you carrying this around?

673
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,100
So that you see it.

674
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,270
How petty of you.

675
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,720
I'm not going to forget.

676
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,170
I'm kidding. I'm planning to go to buy it later.

677
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,060
Instead of doing that, let's just go together.

678
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,050
- Where? The record store?
- Yeah.

679
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,700
If I leave you like this, you'll never let it go with the damn LP.

680
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,170
I don't want to hear that, so I'm saying let's go now. I'll buy it for you.

681
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,030
Why? Right now.

682
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,980
What is it? Are there no seats?

683
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,120
That one there's empty.

684
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,270
Well, hello.

685
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,370
Hello.

686
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,930
The September exam is coming soon.

687
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:18,270
And what is our goal? The college entrance exams.

688
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,850
Then today...

689
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,250
Were you the one who moved my bag?

690
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,710
Please emphasize this part.

691
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,630
Why?

692
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,560
I just thought you could sit next to me.

693
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,260
Why are you mad?

694
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,350
It's not that. I was just like that because I was tired.

695
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,180
I'm sorry.

696
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,280
Are you not feeling well somewhere?

697
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,120
No.

698
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,100
- Jae Yi.
- Yeah?

699
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,700
Do you want to watch a movie with me later?

700
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,190
Should we? Did you watch Hero?

701
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,030
I want to see that, but I haven't been able to yet.

702
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,770
Who would I watch with, if not you?

703
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,440
I want to watch The Reporter too, so should we watch that tom—

704
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,670
Be quiet in the back.

705
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,900
So, It wouldn't be ''R''...

706
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,870
Let's watch that, too.

707
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,800
Sounds good.

708
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,430
This is the same as this, right?

709
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,690
Yes, that's right.

710
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,430
This...

711
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,150
I mean, what is most expensive here?

712
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,900
This is our most expensive product since it was released this week.

713
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,060
I'd like to have this.

714
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,250
Okay. I'll take out a new one in the front for you.

715
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,960
Okay.

716
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,700
You have terrible taste in music.

717
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,330
How many times do I have to tell you? It's analog.

718
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,190
Here it is.

719
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,130
Listen to it.

720
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,250
It sucks.

721
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,920
What do you think? It's nice, right?

722
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,950
I could've just listened to it on my phone. Why did you bring me all the way here?

723
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,760
It makes your heart flutter.

724
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,880
Ordering it, waiting, then coming here to pick it up.

725
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,850
I really don't get it.

726
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,150
Your speakers are ready.

727
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

728
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,930
You're going to buy this, right?

729
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,570
Give it to me.

730
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,940
I bought it already.

731
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,960
When?

732
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,620
When you were doing something else before.

733
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,530
Go pay.

734
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,220
Why the change? You told me to repay my debt.

735
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,560
Here.

736
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,370
For me?

737
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,370
I don't even have a turntable.

738
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,700
You like this kind of stuff. It makes you look good.

739
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,630
It's pretty, so leave it out in your room.

740
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,320
Okay, I will.

741
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,720
I'm about to get home. Where are you?

742
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,690
- Baek Ho Rang.
- Yeah?

743
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:26,630
Since I bought the LP for you...

744
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:29,980
I knew it. Hey, that's why I said I would buy that for you—

745
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,780
Eat with me.

746
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,360
You can pay for the food.

747
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,490
Will this be enough?

748
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,670
There's no need to go far.

749
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,180
Then order takeout.

750
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,770
If you don't like it, you can buy me something better next time.

751
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,800
Why would I? Once is enough.

752
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,760
Is there something going on with you?

753
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,500
No.

754
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,080
Why do you keep looking at your clock?

755
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,900
I have to be back by eleven.

756
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,760
Why?

757
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,350
Because that's what I told myself.

758
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,480
Exactly. Why?

759
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,810
I've noticed this since the moment I met you. Why are you so fixated on time?

760
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,020
You write diligently in your planner every day.

761
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,320
Are you cosplaying as a perfectionist or something?

762
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,100
Not that.

763
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,780
You also live a difficult life.

764
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,130
I want to protect it.

765
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,280
Protect what?

766
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,050
My promises.

767
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:18,630
I hate people who lie and don't keep their promises the most.

768
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,850
They might not realize it, but they always end up hurting others.

769
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,030
You must have nothing to hide.

770
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,690
That's not true.

771
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,840
That's that, but you have to manage the booth during the festival.

772
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,000
What the heck? Why would I do that?

773
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,730
I'm not doing it. Nope.

774
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,660
I accepted you so you could do that, so you have to do it.

775
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,770
Look at you talking. Give me something else to do, I don't want to do that.

776
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,590
It's already decided so we can't.

777
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,260
I said I'm not going to do it. And drink the whole thing.

778
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,860
You have it.

779
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,070
I don't want it. And I'm not going to do it.

780
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,730

Can you call yourself a mother?

786
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,500
- Yeah?
- Ho Rang, where are you?

- I overslept.

00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,660
I'm on my way.

789
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,260
Wait, did you just leave your house?

790
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,390
Yeah, just now. The teacher isn't there yet, right?

791
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,640
- No, he's here now.
- What?

792
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,130
- What are you doing?
- Baek Ho Rang!

793
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,790
- Sir, shouldn't you be in the broadcasting—
- Ho Rang, this is your teacher.

794
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Right, there was no meeting today.

795
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,360
Tell Baek Ho Rang to hurry up. We miss her.

796
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,800
The teacher said to hurry.

797
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,820
Just tell him I overslept.

798
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,740
Since I'm caught, I'll just go by independent study.

Hello, Baek Ho Rang.

801
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,430
Hello, Baek Ho Rang. Haha.

802
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,840
How did you know it was m–

803
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,510
You...

804
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,870
Hey, Ji So Hyeon.

805
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,680
It isn't you, right?

806
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,230
What are you talking about?

807
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,160
By any chance,

808
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,140
is it really you?

Hello, Baek Ho Rang. Talking on Face with you like this makes my heart flutter.

816
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,040
I thought you wouldn't be able to handle it and run away.

817
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,880
I don't run away. Who would that benefit?

818
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,270
We agreed to go to Han River this weekend.

819
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,590
Did you guys fight?

820
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:30,190
To be honest, I was suspicious when you said you wanted to join the broadcasting team.

821
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,710
By the way, Ho Rang, do the others know

822
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:34,450
what you were like back then?

823
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,440
Go Eun Taek.

824
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,820
I have to tell you something.
