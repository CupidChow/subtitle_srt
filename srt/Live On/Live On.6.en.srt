00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,810
So Hyeon, you're still here.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,630
You—

3
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,880
Bye, Ho Rang. I'll see you tomorrow.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
Okay.

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,460
Weren't you going to say something, So Hyeon?

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,220
Just now, what were you saying?

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, that. To-today, good job.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,690
You too. See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,360
Have a safe trip seniors!

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,560
All right. Itinerary, emergency contact information, and supplies.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,520
Make sure you check everything. Alright, any questions?
 - Episode 6 -

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Teacher! How are we doing room assignments?

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey, Baek Ho. Since our bags are going to be heavy, do you want to split up some stuff?

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,280
- I'll bring the shampoo and conditioner. You bring the face wash.
- Alright.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
Then, I'll bring the flat iron. Oh, what else do I need?

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,870
Then I guess I won't have to bring conditioner. Right?

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,660
Crazy, what are you talking about? We'll be in separate rooms.

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,590
Oh, you're right.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,170
You can bring the pants you wore when we watched the movie.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,980
You looked totally comfortable.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,480
Hey, don't insult my pants. Those are expensive.

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,920
Our video is 5 minutes 30 seconds long. Wanna watch?

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,830
Baek Ho Rang, can you give me the USB?

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,050
I put it in here earlier. Where did it go?

25
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,570
I believe we can narrow it down.

26
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,470
- Let me take a look. Send it to me.
- Okay.

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,870
- Oh, there are ten seconds left.
- Until what?

28
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,970
Until Eun Taek Sunbaenim walks in. Oh, now there's 5 seconds left.

29
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,550
Come on, no matter what there's no way a human being can arrive at the exact sec—

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,510
Wow.

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,030
Of course.

32
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,210
- You guys know that you are in charge of the program tomorrow, right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure we don't need to check it again?

33
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,700
You've already checked it six times. It's perfect.

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,110
Alright, then. We're just going to check the fitting on the screen and finish.

35
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,670
Okay.

36
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,460
You and me. We live on like that.

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,960
Like that, we laugh and cry again.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,260
What did you record with?

39
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,870
My phone. Why? Is there a problem?

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,420
Who records audios with a phone? This isn't a guide recording.

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,560
Jung Hee Soo, what were you doing not checking this when editing?

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,590
Oh, I thought she would know.

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,740
Oh, sorry. I should've checked earlier.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,360
Re-do this by the end of the week.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,420
End of this week? When we leave for the retreat tomorrow, this week will be over.

46
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,090
You can do it after you come back from the trip. You also have the weekend.

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,190
Sorry. Let's do it together.

48
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,360
Baek Ho Rang's in charge of cleaning. Everyone else is dismissed.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,620
Okay.

50
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,270
I'll match whenever you're free. Give me a text.

51
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay.

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,410
Hello?

53
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,910
Hey, should I bring my hair straightener or curler?

54
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,700
- Oh, that's right. Tomorrow's the retreat.
- What?

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,050
Because of someone, I've been busy cleaning the broadcasting room.

56
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,850
- I forgot that it was the retreat tomorrow.
- What?

57
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,650
Should I bring the curler or the straightener?

58
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,560
- Yeah, I'll probably be working even after I get back.
- Whatever, I'll just bring the flat one.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,390
- Alright, talk to you later.
- Hey, hey!

60
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,170
So, which hair tool is she bringing?

61
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,050
Straighten— huh? What the heck?

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,300
I heard everything. Kang Jae Yi's voice is naturally loud.

63
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,560
You were reassured that I was quiet for a while?

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,290
And I let a few things slide when you were going through the rough time.

65
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,250
I wrote down every time you did something wrong. Should I show you?

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,960
Oh, forget it.

67

68
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,930
- October 15th, didn't return supplies to the closet.
- Hey.

69
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,250
Wow, you were late a lot.

70
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,120
I really hate people who aren't on time.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
When was the time you told me I was pretty decent?

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,570
Oh, the pretty decent times. There are a few.

73
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,330
October 16th, on time. October 19th, returned supplies to the closet.

74
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,460
Ahh! I get it, so be quiet.

- Nothing special.

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,200
But did you see this?

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,820
You know we have to do the folk dance? Isn't that so lame?

80

- Hey, can't you knock?
- Let me use your laptop.

81

Why are you using mine instead of yours?

I downloaded something from Netflix and realized that I used your account.

- I already sent money to your account and I'll log out right now.

I said don't lie down!

Hey, can't I use your mattress? It's so comfortable.

90

You're acting like you own this place.

You even packed like you're immigrating somewhere.

Hey! It's only this size because it's one day.

93
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,840
But why aren't your parents home? I thought I'd need to meet them so I even brought juice.

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,890
Forget the juice and get up. You said you wanted to do your makeup.

95
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,140
Just five minutes.

- Hi, Yoo Sin.

- But this is the bus for class 3—
- Which brings me to my request.

Trade seats with me. Please!

- No. Hurry and go.
- No, please!

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,380
The bus for Class 1 should be nearby~ Love you!

But why isn't Kim Yoo Sin here?

Oh. Hi.

I'm not lending it to you.

Everyone here? Don't get too excited and put your seatbelt on.

129
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,570
- Hey, Kang Jae Yi. Have you seen this?
- Yeah, I saw it.

130
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,430
- Isn't it obvious?
- Right?

131
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,400
- It's obviously this.
- It's this.

132
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,510
What are you saying? Don't you know that top=up and bottom=down?

133
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,710
People also differentiate between top and bottom this way, so it's this.

134
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,650
Hey, think about it. When kids crawl around when they're young,

135
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,380
do you think that their arms and legs start off by being considered their 'bottom' but then change later on?

136
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,410
No, it's not. It's the same with them.

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,280
Mmm. It was the happiest moment of my life.

158
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,550
Oh, so it was? Because of someone, it was the worst moment of my life.

159
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,700
Okay, the first item on the agenda is folk dancing.

160
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
Please welcome the teacher with a warm welcome.

161
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,240
First, let's stand arms-length apart.

162
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,570
We'll begin when you're all ready. Hold both of your partner's hands and girls take a step with your right foot. One.

163
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,230
Two. Turn around and clap two times.

164
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,670
Then, get closer with your partner. I'll show you how.

165
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,470
Just trust me, So Hyeon. I'm a great dancer.

166
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,590
What are you doing? You have to step back.

167
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,060
Huh?

168
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,770
What the heck. You said to trust you.

169
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,480
I know, right?

170
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,720
- Should we dance again?
- Okay.

171
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,550
Argh. I really hate this dance.

172
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,170
Why did we come all this way just to do a pig dance?

173
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,390
- What are you talking about?
- What?

174
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,730
Pork dance, pig dance.

175
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,490
- Never mind.
- What the heck!

176
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,650
Look at them!

177
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,230
- Can you let go?
- Oh. Sorry.

178
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,100
Next, group two get on the stage please.

179
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,770
You guys are really intense. Can I take a look?

180
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah.

181
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,790
I thought that the broadcasting team was the most intense, but you guys are the same.

182
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,050
Why are you doing this? It looks bothersome.

183
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,160
Then why are you doing broadcasting? If you think about it, you're weirder.

184
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,180
Well... it just happened that way.

185
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,370
It just happened that way for me, too.

186
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,510
Hey, everyone's already heard that you guys are awkward.

187
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,770
- I'm not cold.
- It looked like your clothes were riding up when dancing earlier.

188
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,910
Do Woo Jae, the teacher wants to see you.

189
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,910
How was he with Kang Jae Yi earlier?

191
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,680
Earlier? Oh, on the bus?

192
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,300
It was quite a scene. You should've seen their faces.

193
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Hey, Go Eun Taek. Hold this for a sec.

194
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,890
This?

195
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,470
Is it fair that we have to dance in such hot weather?

196
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,150
What the heck? You don't have a hair tie, do you?

197
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,870
Would I?

198
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,560
Oh. Do you want at least this?

199
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,280
Hey, how can you tie your hair with that?

200
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,940
Why? I think it would work.

201
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,730
How is it? Is it uncomfortable?

202
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,810
It's not uncomfortable, but isn't it weird?

203
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,380
No. It looks pretty.

204
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,620
Where did Do Woo Jae go?

205
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,550
I don't know.

206
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,590
- Look at those two.
- What are they? Are they dating?

207
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,510
But, Baek Ho Rang, what happened with that situation earlier?

208
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,970
Didn't it become calm pretty fast?

209
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,830
Applause. Next is team 3.

210
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,130
I know. It's annoying.

211
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,220
753411

212
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh right, when you posted your statement. The sixteen number what it means?

213
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,830
Oh that? I don't know. Someone told me through DM.

214
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,390
I for sure had it at the field earlier.

215
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,440
We'll take a look. Room 345, right?

216
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,390
Yes. Thank you.

217
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,570
- Isn't he good looking?
- I don't know.

218
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,470
Did you try calling me?

219
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,420
I tried three times, but I told you there's no answer.

220
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,970
Student 345. One moment.

221
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,050
Someone picked this up.

222
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,130
Oh, really? That's a relief.

223
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,050
Please follow me.

224
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,190
Go ahead without me.

225
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,040
- Come here.
- Hurry.

226
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,430
Girls from class 5 want to hang out.

227
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,610
- Who? Who?
- The red-headed girl.
- When?
- Later.

228
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,820
My hat!

229
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,510
Don't you think that our guard is handsome? He's really cute.

230
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,690
Hey, but is that yours?

231
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,380
- What did you say?
- I asked if that's yours.

232
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,920
It is Do Woo Jae's. He left it in the bus earlier.

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,870
Now that we're talking about it, you give it to Go Eun Taek and ask him to give it to Do Woo Jae.

234
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,810
Really? All right.

235
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,490
Speaking of Do Woo Jae, he laughed a lot when he saw you today.

236
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,690
It's the first time I saw him with such an expression.

237
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,700
- Do Woo Jae?
- Yes.

238
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,870
He was probably laughing at how funny I was.

239
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,490
Well, how is it going on for you?

240
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,290
- What about me?
- Wasn't there someone you've been chatting with?

241
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,680
No, or should I say someone you're flirting with?

242
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,400
- It's nothing like that.
- What do you mean nothing?

243
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,540
So, which school is he from? Where does he live? How many times do you guys contact each other a day?

244
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,750
Forget it. It's already complicated, so don't ask.

245
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,400
If he's a nice kid, you should just date. What is there to think about?

246
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,110
Don't think it much. Just for it. That's the answer.

247
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,070
Why don't you just go for it?

248
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,660
Hey, I—

249
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,280
Lights are out in one minute!

250
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,280
Am I nuts?

251
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,950
Do Woo Jae

252
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,300
Who was just now?

253
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,640
Gosh. That scared me.

254
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,010
Do Woo Jae is unavailable.
Press to call again.

255
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,070
What do I do?

256
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,850
Hey, what's the matter?

257
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,930
Nothing.

258
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,410
Sorry. I pressed the wrong button.

259
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,440
Is there something you want to say?

260
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,180
Yes, you left your hat on the bus. I'll give it to you tomorrow.

261
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,100
Okay.

262
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,200
What I'm going to do? I'm stupid.

263
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,260
It's going to collapse!

264
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,170
Instead of tomorrow, do you want to give it to me now?

265
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,670
Holy!

266
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,940
Hey, where did you put the curling iron earlier?

267
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,480
I'll come over. Stay there.

268
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,390
I already came out. The supervisor isn't here.

269
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,690
I told you to stay there.

270
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,910
I don't think he left yet.

271
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,440
Here.

272
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,740
Thank you.

273
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,590
Did you call me out at this time to get this?

274
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,120
No.

275
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,600
It's because I missed you.

276
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,190
I missed you, Jae Yi.

277
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,500
What's with your expression?

278
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,710
I can't delete this. Send it to me.

279
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,920
Send me the pictures we took on the bus too.

280
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,650
Photos

281
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,120
Ji So Hyeon

282
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,760
Why don't we meet for a bit?

283
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,160
Did you get your phone?

284
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,030
So Hyeon.

285
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,360
My phone... Did you perhaps—

286
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,320
I took it.

287
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,250
- Why?
- There was something I wanted to confirm. I was right.

288
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,360
It was you. The person who uploaded Baek Ho Rang's picture.

289
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,130
And the person who wrote stories to provoke Baek Ho Rang, who sent DM to Park Hye Rim

290
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,350
and the one who posted the photo online during the festival, it was all you.

291
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,130
So Hyeon.

292
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,060
You can't do that.

293
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,470
- How could you take someone else's phone—
- What?

294
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,280
Did you think others would live correctly except you?

295
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,180
- Why did you do it?
- Did I not tell you?

296
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,750
I was in the same class as her in middle school.

297
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,580
She doesn't even remember a classmate she spent a whole year with.

298
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,530
She has no regard for me, and that pisses me off.

299
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,350
You also know this, So Hyeon.

300
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,840
When she talks, she looks down on people and manipulates them.

301
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,880
She was also a nobody like me in the first year.

302
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,100
But she continues getting attention when she didn't even deserve it.

303
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,360
We were on the same level, and she still pretends to be different.

304
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,590
That's why I let her know. Baek Ho Rang...

305
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,350
That's not the place she should be in.

306
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,860
She belongs right here, below.

307
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,890
It was a little disappointing when the people thought she was the bully.

308
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,260
- What do you mean by that?
- That's true.

309
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,500
She acted like she didn't know her place,

310
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,450
so she had it coming.

311
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,320
"Had it coming"?

312
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:22,420
So Hyeon, do you think I made up that post?

313
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,450
Do you know that? Actually, Baek Ho Rang

314
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,570
hates the number 16.

315
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,490
You're curious too, aren't you? About what happened that day.

316
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,060
School violence. That's right.

317
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:49,000
That day, Baek Ho Rang was beaten up by Lee Sun Joo.

318
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,940
Two years ago

319
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,230
16

320
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,120
Happy birthday!

321
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,690
Happy birthday!

322
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,060
- Who is that?
- My best friend.
- Best friend!

323
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,560
- Now that you've seen me, that's enough, right? I'll get going now.
- Where are you going?

324
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,120
Are you trying to insult me after I set all this up for you?

325
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,900
Sit down.

326
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,930
Let's go and play.

327
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,290
- You're insane!
- Who wants that?

328
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,570
Get it away!

329
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,520
So cute!

330
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,400
An elephant needs to spin around like this.

331
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,160
♫ Open your eyes Mind your own business ♫

332
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,420
- I think she smells.
- I have perfume. Wait a sec.

333
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,260
- It's expensive, so don't spray much.
- Okay

334
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,640
♫ Whose warmth prayer ♫

335
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,100
♫ A helping hand ♫

336
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,260
How many times should I spray it?

337
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,600
♫ But I go high ♫

338
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,370
♫ Yeah, but I go high ♫

342
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:25,040
Clean this before you go. I'd be in trouble if the owner called our school.

343
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,010
You wouldn't like that either, would you?

344
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:14,090
♫ But I go high, yeah ♫

345
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,630

346
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:55,130
Angel Karaoke

347
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,600
Angel Karaoke

348
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,810
Angel Karaoke

349
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,890
Is that true?

350
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,480
- If you're bluffing, you—
- I saw it with my own eyes.

351
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,130
She hung out with them pretending to be all good, and in the end she—

352
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,030
I felt so much pity for her. But then, what's with this now?

353
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,730
She kept quiet about it and couldn't even remember me.

354
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,120
So Hyeon, you hate her too. I know all about it. You guys were close before and then you had a falling-out.

355
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
She will never confess that she was bullied.

356
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,220
Look at her now, she can't say anything and she is being framed as a bully, but she's staying quiet.

357
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,410
- So, as long as you pretend you don't know anything—
- Wait.

358
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,130
I haven't gotten all of this straight yet.

359
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,040
Can you just shut up for a moment?

360
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,270
Let me lay this out for you.

361
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,410
So Baek Ho Rang...

362
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,880
ended your friendship because she didn't want to show you how pathetic she is.

363
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,830
Do you get it now?

364
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,830
She hid from you all this time because she was scared to tell you she got beat up.

365
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,660
What did you say?

366
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,280
It's your birthday next month. What do you want to do?

367
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,300
Let's go to the amusement park. We can wear headbands and take pictures.

368
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,850
Hey, we're not kids.

369
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,010
- Should I search up admission prices?
- Yeah.

370
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,120
Baek Ho Rang, are you stupid or what? Keep your mouth shut.

371
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,610
What was that? Why does she type like that?

372
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,350
Hey, she's a friend. She's just joking around.

373
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,880
So we're going to the amusement park on your birthday, then.

374
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,980
I promise! I promise.

375
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,590
- Hey! Ji So Hyeon!
- Hey!

376
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,590
Ta-da! I bought spicy rice cakes!

377
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,630
- Sounds good, right?
- Didn't you say you ate with Lee Sun Joo?

378
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,800
I did, but how should I put it?

379
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,230
I felt like my day wouldn't be complete if I didn't have spicy rice cakes with you right now?

380
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,930
- What was that?
- It just is.

381
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,900
The time of day when I'm most comfortable.

382
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,920
So I'm going to stop by often.

383
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,350
Without letting you know beforehand, like today.

384
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,860
But, what if we end up going to different high schools?

385
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,440
Even if we do, we can still meet up every day.

386
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,890
Well, we do live near each other.

387
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,890
It's unfair now that I think about it.

388
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,520
You looked way too fine after breaking up with me, Do Woo Jae.

389
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,950
- Did I look that way?
- Yeah, completely.

390
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,260
I did try to live normally.

391
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,990
After breaking up with you, Jae Yi.

392
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,800
What the hell, Do Woo Jae.

393
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,190
But I wasn't okay at all.

394
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,070
Without you, there wasn't a reason to get angry or laugh.

395
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,740
I wasn't happy at all.

396
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,020
That's how I knew for sure

397
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,560
that the feelings I had for you were very special to me.

398
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,700
We fought a lot, but it turns out

399
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
they were still meaningful.

400
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,010
It might also be the reason I became selfish.

401
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,890
Jae Yi,

402
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,100
go out with me again.

403
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,050
I'll try my absolute best.

404
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,560
Hey, Do Woo Jae, it's the same for me.

405
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,290
After we broke up, I also thought of you every day and wondered how you were coping.

406
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,700
I'll also do my absolute best.

407
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,450
If you answer late, I'll wait as long as it takes.

408
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,890
I'll try harder to understand you.

409
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,800
So from now on, don't think on your own and make decisions by yourself.

410
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,430
I'm going to kill you.

411
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,630
Okay, I won't.

412
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,700
Let's go in now. You'll catch a cold.

413
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:18,540
Wait. You know, Woo Jae, should we keep us getting back together a secret?

414
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,530
- Why?
- The thing is...

415
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,060
I kind of talked crap about you, so there needs to be a transition period.

416
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,030
- You're so honest.
- Well, it wasn't really talking crap.

417
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,720
I just told everyone I knew that I would never date you again.

418
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,530
- You told everyone you knew...
- Come on, just hear me out.

419
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,160
I guess you talked to a lot of people.

420
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,460
- Hel—
- Where are you, Baek Ho Rang?

421
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,530
That's what I should be saying. Why aren't you picking up?

422
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,570
- Where are you?
- Me? I just returned to the dorm.

423
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,700
- But why are there kids from different class?
- What?

424
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,110
- Damn it.
- Why, what is it?
- I came outside because I thought you'd be out.

425
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,230
Okay, I'm hanging up.

426
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,630
Okay. Come in quickly! I'll be washing up.

427
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,600
What is it?

428
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,310
Hey, don't hang up until I get back to the dorm.

429
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,330
It's right around the corner. What are you so afraid of?

430
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,270
I'm walking right now,

431
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,980
but I hear something behind me—

432
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,240
What? Why aren't you saying anything? Hey, if you're so scared, why don't you call your flirt?

433
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,380
When you're having a flirt, you're finding excuses to call—

434
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,220
Is she talking about me?

435
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,740
No. That...

436
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,480
I'd like it if she were talking about me.

437
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,230
I'll check this area. Okay.

438
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,810
Hey, follow me.

439
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,300
Gosh. What is that? Why they're out at this time? Don't they sleep?

440
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,190
Because kids like you won't listen and will walk around.

441
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,210
What are you saying? I went out to look for Kang Jae Yi because she didn't come back in.

442
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,090
Kang Jae Yi?

443
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,650
Now that I think about it, Do Woo Jae wasn't in the room either.

444
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,560
They must be seeing each other.

445
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Is that what it was?

446
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,760
Kang Jae Yi told me to just go for it and confess—

447
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,670
Confess what?

448
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,810
Does it have to do with the flirt she said earlier?

449
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:38,880
Enough, you already heard it, why do you keep asking?

450
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,040
- Give me your arm.
- My arm?

451
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,810
What about you?

452
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,780
Why are you out here so late?

453
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,600
I just couldn't fall asleep

454
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,550
Did you forget to write what time to sleep in your planner?

455
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,330
- Come on.
- What is it then?

456
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,830
Did something happen?

457
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,990
Nothing happened. Just because.

458
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,760
Do you remember that day we went to the roof while we were preparing for the festival?

459
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,750
- The first time we went to the roof?
- Yeah.

460
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,050
I told you earlier that there is a person who keeps breaking their promises, right?

461
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,630
What should I do? I don't think I'll be able to keep my promise.

462
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,570
Can we meet another day?

463
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,630
She sent me a message, and she said she wants to meet with me.

464
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,800
I told her I don't want to

465
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,870
but it felt a bit weird.

466
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,560
Go Eun Taek,

467
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,400
can I ask who it is that you're talking about?

468
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,630
If you don't want to say it, you don't have to.

469
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,820
I was just curious.

470
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,470
It's my mom.

471
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,070
When I was younger my parents got divorced

472
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,010
and my mom left home after that.

473
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,500
I see.

474
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
I didn't know.

475
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,110
She promised me that she'd come back,

476
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,260
then she never contacted me.

477
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,650
She's not that great of a mom, is she?

478
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,600
So I resent her.

479
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,400
She shouldn't have made the promise.

480
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,080
Couldn't it have been because she was scared?

481
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,310
Because she loved you, and only wanted to show her best to you.

482
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,710
I understand her.

483
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,130
The more you like someone,

484
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,310
the more you want to hide.

485
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,450
I'm not sure, I don't really get it.

486
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,530
It sounds like an excuse.

487
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,490
The other person is hurt without even knowing the reason,

488
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,950
and that behavior shows that she doesn't care.

489
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,730
That's why I dislike them.

490
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,980
People who lie.

491
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,030
I'm sorry, I got too serious didn't I?

492
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,500
Should we go? No one should be there now.

493
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,440
Sure, let's go.

494
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,220
Ji So Hyeon, did you sleep well?

495
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, hi.

496
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,810
Good morning.

497
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,200
Why are your eyes so puffy? Did you not sleep well.

498
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,920
- Oh, just a little.
- Oh! I left my charger in the room.

499
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,060
Baek Ho Rang, stay right here and don't leave me.

500
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,590
What are you hiding?

501
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,310
Don't try to know.

502
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,920
You should just

503
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,540
see things the way they seem.

504
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,560
Hey, Baek Ho Rang.

505
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,430
Bring the luggage closer, so you don't block the people who are passing.

506
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,830
Jung Hee Soo

507
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:39,360
Jung Hee Soo, I will shut my mouth just as you said, so you should stop here.

508
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,810
My hands are dry.

509
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,700
Does anyone have hand cream?

510
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,660
Thank you.

511
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,400
Why am I so tired?

512
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,150
Right? My neck is hurting.

513
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,520
We did over-exert ourselves.

514
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,910
Hold on, if you guys are tired why are you just sitting here?

515
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,620
I'm waiting for So Hyeon, but why are you two here?

516
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,470
Are you waiting for someone?

517
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,840
Go Eun Taek and I are going the same way.

518
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,520
- Okay.
- What?

519
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,380
Ok. Let's just say it's that way.

520
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,620
- What about you, Kang Jae Yi?
- Me?

521
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm just...

522
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,530
They're coming.

523
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,660
I'm leaving now.

524
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,140
I'll get going, see you guys at school.

525
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,710
Bye.

526
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,470
Look at her avoiding Woo Jae.

527
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,480
I'll get going too.

528
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,130
Bye.

529
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,490
Are you guys going home?

530
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,030
Wanna go eat?

531
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,460
We were going to get dinner, wanna go together?

532
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,990
I don't mind.

533
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,090
Then let's go together.

534
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,220
Do you want to eat pizza? There's a new pizza store.

535
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,470
Wait up!

536
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:25,250
So Hyeon, did you sleep early yesterday? I called you, but you didn't answer.

537
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,870
I was tired yesterday, so I went to sleep early. What about you?

538
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,800
Because I couldn't contact you, I went to his room and I slept there.

539
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,030
Aren't you and Woo Jae in the same room?

540
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,950
Why wasn't he there when I came?

541
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,480
The thing is,

542
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,120
- he went out to see Kang Jae Yi.
- Hey, what are you two doing?

543
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,490
You guys went the other way, why did you guys come here?

544
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,000
- We came in the opposite direction on purpose.
- Wow!

545
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,610
What, did you guys know?

546
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,380
- Are you guys dating again?
- How did you know?

547
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,190
- Hey, Do Woo Jae, did you tell them?
- No.

548
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,690
What?

549
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,390
Thank you.

550
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,700
- Eat up.
- Thanks.

551
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,150
- Eat this, So Hyeon.
- Thanks.

552
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,380
Tell me exactly. When did you guys get back together?

553
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,690
Exactly, I thought you guys would never get back together.

554
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,540
When did I ever say that?

555
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,120
What, you spend an hour at my house—

556
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,630
Don't say nonsense. Hey, that's why I didn't tell you about us.

557
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,890
How did you guys start dating again?

558
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,680
Exactly, who decided to get back together first?

559
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,520
The thing is, he left his hat on the bus and I went to give it back and...

560
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,780
No one went first.

561
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,350
Why aren't you guys surprised, am I the only one who didn't know?

562
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:49,370
Now that it's come to this, don't you think you are the problem?

563
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,530
I was surprised when Eun Taek said he liked Ho Rang.

564
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,420
Go Eun Taek, do you like her? Since when?

565
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,980
You're surprised too.

566
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,420
Kim Yoo Sin, how did you—

567
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,050
How did you know that he liked me?

568
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,330
Baek Ho Rang, is he the flirt that you've been talking about?

569
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,380
- Eat up.
- Hey, stop!

570
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,540
So Hyeon is getting bored, let's talk about something else.

571
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,700
No, I'm listening.

572
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,890
Congrats on getting back together.

573
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,160
Thanks, Ji So Hyeon.

574
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,370
Can I have the menu?

575
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,140
Did something happen?

576
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,220
- What?
- You weren't eating earlier.

577
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,240
I'm fine.

578
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,830
I seriously had no idea that you liked Baek Ho Rang.

579
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,140
You're not feeling disappointed, right?

580
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,970
Me? Why would I?

581
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,110
Because you guys aren't on good terms.

582
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:12,250
I told you that that's between me and her.

583
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,060
I hope it works out for you guys.

584
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:21,240
Are things still bad between you guys?

585
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,470
I still dislike her.

586
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,280
I'm going to keep more distance because I hate her more now.

587
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,400
So, stay beside her.

588
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,520
What?

589
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,890
It was nice seeing so many people on Baek Ho Rang's side.

590
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,360
So Hyeon.

591
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,510
- Here.
- Thank you.

592
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,220
Where are you going? We're going downtown.

593
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,110
I'm going to take So Hyeon home, that's okay, right?

594
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,660
- What about you guys?
- We're going home.

595
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,730
It's late.

596
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,400
Okay then, bye everyone, see you at school.

597
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,060
Bye.

598
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,020
- Bye.
- I'll carry it.

599
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,660
It's fine.

600
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,500
Let's go.

601
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,230
It's coming soon, in 3 minutes.

602
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,140
Have you scheduled the recording?

603
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,420
Please! I'm going to do it in the weekend.

604
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,020
I just wanted to ask if we could hang out after you finish recording.

605
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,950
Hang out? Kang Jae Yi also asked me the same thing earlier.

606
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,860
Is there anywhere that you want to go?

607
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,820
Rather than wanting to go, there's somewhere I need to find.

608
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,300
Someone recommended a list.

609
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,900
What is it?

610
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,190
I'm sorry, you get going first.

611
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,590
What?

612
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:19,060
I have something to do, I'll see you later.

613
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,930
Is something wrong?

614
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,960
I'll tell you later.

615
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,340
I'll explain everything later.

616
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,250
I downloaded apps for couples again and switched back my passcode to your birthday.

617
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,300
- And also the profile picture—
- So Hyeon, would you like to eat another one?

618
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,020
- No, it's okay.
- Really?

619
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,630
I should do it now since we're talking about it.

620
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,280
Crazy, what is this?

621
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,250
I'm sorry, I know this isn't the right place.
[Evidence that Baek Ho Rang is a bully.]

622
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,700
But I still can't have my profile on SNS because she bullied me.

623
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,710
And watching her being famous on social media made me want to die.

624
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,000
I have somewhere to go, so I'll leave first, sorry.

625
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm sorry.

626
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,470
Where are you right now?

627
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,520
Evidence that Baek Ho Rang is a bully.

628
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:50,080
You got here quickly. It hasn't been long since we just spoke.

629
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,830
I happened to be in the area.

630
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,320
What? Are you disappointed because I'm completely fine?

631
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,490
That was when I didn't know that it was you.

632
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:14,500
I had a bad feeling since I first saw you. So I did some searching and

633
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,020
it was you.

634
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,100
Gut feelings are really something, you know.

635
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,360
You knew...

636
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,220
that it was me?

637
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,630
How could I not? You left a trail of clues pointing at you.

638
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,050
I heard you're in charge of the corner segment.

639
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,330
Corner?

640
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:40,620
After you used the word 'corner' by mistake...

641
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,060
I looked over the messages you sent during lunchtime.

642
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,420
You're a picky eater, Ho Rang.

648
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,990
I could check some people on the broadcasting team, but the problem was the student council.

649
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,860
And happened that the student council had a meeting that day.

00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,440
I was lucky.

651
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,110
After eliminating some names from my list, I had you and some sophomore students left.

652
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:21,690
And with everything I found, the culprit verified her age for me, I was grateful for that.

653
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,220
I knew you were stupid but I didn't know you were this dumb.

654
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,620
So? Is this everything you have?

655
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:41,290
L-let me explain, Ho Rang. I-I always told you.

656
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,280
You're the idiot.

I posted that for you to see.

What?

659
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,860
I said I posted it for you to see.

660
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,040
You'd be a fool if you couldn't discover it was me after seeing that post.

661
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,820
If I was intimidated would I have waited here for you to come?

662
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,730
Hey, Ho Rang. Please, think a little.

663
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,950
Your problem is that you're too obvious.

664
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,890
Jung Hee Soo, why are you doing this to me?

665
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,140
That's the wrong question.

666
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,500
You should be asking "How much do you know"?

I saw it all.

671
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,780
You're lucky you're famous now.

672
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,510
You looked like such a loser that day.

Do you know how terrible I felt?

674
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,890
That's right. You should know your place.

You knew everything but pretended you didn't and watched me. I must have looked like a fool to you.

No, that isn't it.

Right, Baek Ho Rang, so listen to me, please.

You.

702
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,020
I'll see you later.

Baek Ho Rang! Baek Ho Rang! Hey!

705
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,110
How could you only think about yourself every single time?

706
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,480
You did the same thing two years ago.

707
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,280
Do you how much I resented you for pushing me aside so suddenly?

708
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,460
And after discovering what happened, I couldn't sleep at all 'cause I was so sorry.

709
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,350
But I pretended not to know,

710
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,060
because you didn't want people to find out. So I kept my mouth shut and did what I could.

711
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,820
What else am I supposed to do?

712
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,480
You should've pretended not to know until the end.

713
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,500
- What?
- You!

714
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,970
You're pitying me right now.

715
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:32,210
And you're terrible at it. If you were really looking out for me, you should have hidden this until the end!

716
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:38,160
You shouldn't have met her to protect me! You should have cursed me and asked me

717
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,430
- why I didn't tell you—
- I also wanted to do that.

718
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,590
I almost hated you for life for not knowing the whole story.

719
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,720
I wanted to curse you and

720
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,730
ask you why you didn't tell me, but...

721
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,520
How could I do that?

722
