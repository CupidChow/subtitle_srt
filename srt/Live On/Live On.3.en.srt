2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,530
Yes, Teacher. I've bought the medicines, and I'm heading towards school.
 - Episode 3 -

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,850
Yes, Teacher. I've bought the medicines, and I'm heading towards school.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,960
Thank you.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,300
Oh!

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,530
Why run? We're late anyway.

7
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,460
What? You're late again?

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,900
What do you mean by again? It was only a few times.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,670
Did you eat?

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,650
Food? No.

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,020
Then shall we go eat breakfast?

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,230
What are you saying? Even if we go now, the teacher—

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,530
If we go now or in thirty minutes, we'll have to do cleaning chores anyway.

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,480
- Let's go.
- No. No!

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,770
- What's this?
- It means love and friendship.

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,070
What's this? So cringy.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,030
- Give me your bag. I'll put it on for you.
- It's pretty.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,310
- It's pretty right?
- I'm going to put it here.

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,960
I can't do this all today. I give up. I'll just say that I lost it.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,070
I'll help you out as soon as I finish mine. Wait up.

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,840
Hey Baek Ho Rang!

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,030
One minute.

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,200
Did you ignore our messages?

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,590
I didn't see it.

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,720
What are you saying? You ignored it!

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,330
Let that be. Do you want to go to the karaoke?

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,770
I have to go to the academy later.

28
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,870
With Ji So Hyeon?

29
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,600
Did I make a mistake?

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,210
No, you didn't.

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,640
Then why are you avoiding me?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,570
Why are you avoiding me suddenly?

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,530
You're really tactless.

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,850
If I have done this much, you yourself should leave me and go.

35
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,310
I wasn't going to say this, but

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,990
Ji So Hyeon, is it true that you slept with Hee Min Oppa?

37
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,410
Was it really you?

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,170
How can I reply without knowing the context?

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,450
Then why is your name here?

40
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,270
Har Ley

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,820
Even I don't know. I get many friend requests in a day.

42
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,050
What are you curious about?

43
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,420
- Leave it.
- Hey, Baek Ho Rang!

44
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,800
You always said only what you wanted to say.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,970
What?

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,970
I don't know what's going on, but don't suspect people with that expression on your face.

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,260
It really makes us feel like crap.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,030
And hereafter, let's really not talk to each other.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,490
Don't be so scared Ho Rang. Hahaha

50
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,290
Ho Rang, did you see the socks of our Chinese teacher? You didn't, right?

51
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,410
Who are you?

52
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,980
There were two holes in his socks.

53
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,770
Why? Eun Taek wants you to come?

54
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,890
Huh?

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,130
You were looking at it so seriously. I thought you weren't on duty today.

56
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,810
Yeah, I am not on duty.

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,600
You're a fussy eater Ho Rang.

58
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,370
I'm excited that I'm able to message you like this.

59
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,320
Come out. Talk face to face with me.

60
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,410
Why? Do you miss me Ho Rang?

61
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,540
But I don't like texting while eating.

62
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,750
I'll contact you again.

63
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,220
Baek Ho Rang! Is there something wrong?

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,710
Let's go if you're done eating.

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,770
Can you do it?

66
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,830
Training Baek Ho Rang?

67
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,680
I know that you don't like it if we can't differentiate our personal and official feelings,

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,910
but to be honest, I feel uncomfortable around her.

69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,730
Something happened before and we aren't on good terms.

70
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,100
I will try to keep those feelings apart,

71
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,110
but if we keep seeing each other, I think I'll start acting upon my feelings.

72
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,720
Why didn't you say anything during Baek Ho Rang's interview?

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,320
At that time,

74
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
I thought it got better, but it hasn't.

75
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,050
So, I'm sorry but can you train Baek Ho Rang?

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,260
Instead, I'll do the rest of the work.

77
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,330
No need. You are already doing enough work.

78
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,450
I got it. I'll do her training.

79
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,090
Thanks.

80
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,940
Are you going to leave later?

81
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,220
Yeah. After I finish what I was doing.

82
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,620
Okay.

83
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,220
Ji So Hyeon. Are you possibly—

84
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,820
Go Eun Taek.

85
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,480
Don't be bothered by what I said just now.

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,660
You can just act as usual.

87
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay, I get it.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,450
Okay, I'll see you later.

89
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,420
Do Woo Jae, when will the conference be over? I want to see you.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,960
Hey! The picture was coming out really well.

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,870
Why are you hitting me again? Hey, I'm going to the cafeteria. Come over later, Jae Yi.

92
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,300
Okay, bye.

93
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,270
Hey.

94
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,420
Yes?

95
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,370
Do you like Jae Yi?

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
What are you saying?

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,660
- Me?
- If you're going to like her, keep it to yourself.

98
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,700
Don't make it obvious and spoil my mood.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,530
I got it, dude. I'll buy you a meal since I made a joke.

100
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,640
Hey, Do Woo Jae.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
What did you talk about with Lee Jun Ho?

102
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,160
Nothing special.

103
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
What were you doing?

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,830
We decided to go to the Han River this weekend.

105
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,810
See? I prepared the schedule.

106
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,460
Date Schedule

107
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,490
We are very busy on that day.

108
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,020
We have to watch Netflix.

109
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,010
We have to click a pic like this and post it on your and my social media.

110
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,730
But weren't we supposed to go there to study?

111
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,580
Yeah. That's why I have put it on the list here. Study.

112
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,650
You mean this small part here that you set aside for thirty minutes?
 5:30-6:00: Study

113
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,050
I gave plenty of time if it's thirty minutes.

114
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,710
Come on. In the two years we've been dating, it's the first time we're going to the Han River.

115
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,230
Shouldn't we do at least this much?

116
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,380
Hm... How cute.

117
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,360
If I'm cute, then give me a kiss.

118
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,000
Good times. It is such a good time.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,960
Look at your face from all that studying.

120
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,210
- Teacher.
- Teacher. That's mean.

121
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,050
Well, we learn about Silla in the last class, and today we'll learn about the unification of the three kingdoms.

122
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,230
Who's the person who played a huge role in unifying the three kingdoms?

123
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,860
Kim Yoo Sin!

124
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,820
I didn't fall asleep, Sir.

125
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,710
One raised a kingdom, and the other always fall asleep in the class.

126
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,830
Don't get too scared, Ho Rang.

127
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,310
Then it won't be any fun.

128
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,530
What do you want?

129
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,360
Kim Yoo Sin played an important role in unifying the three kingdoms.

130
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,430
- After getting married to Lady Jiso—
- Oh my gosh!

131
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,950
Why? What is it?

132
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,160
Kim Yoo Sin and Ji So Hyeon?
Kim Yoo Sin, Lady Jiso

133
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh my, this is crazy.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
And I got to know this only now?

135
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,310
You kids should hurry up and start dating too.

136
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,530
I'm not sure. I will think about that slowly.

137
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,420
But you joining the broadcasting club was so cute, Ho Rang. Lol.

138
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,870
And that's why I'm writing a story for you now,

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,770
and it's very fun. Look forward to it.

140
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,600
Come to the broadcasting room today at 5.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,120
I've decided to be in charge of your takeover.

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
There are still three minutes left till five o'clock.

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,540
Fine.

144
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,910
Oh, geez! Hey.

145
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,300
Throw out this stopwatch.

146
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,220
I have so much on my mind already.

147
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,260
Why do you have so much on your mind?

148
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,010
What's all this?

149
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,360
- Things that you'll memorize from now on.
- What?

150
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,380
This much?

151
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,620
You're going to be tested on this, so listen up now while I'm explaining it.

152
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,840
Look. The sliders on the left are to change the mic volume.

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,860
The black sliders on the right control the speaker volume.

154
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,910
Hold on.

155
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,930
Give me a second.

156
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,480
You're good at paying attention to details.

157
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,430
You can do it.

158
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,420
So, listen carefully and focus.

159
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,960
The black sliders on the right

160
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,520
control the speaker volume.

161
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,720
If you match these up.

162
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
- Focus.
- Okay.

163
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,600
I'll explain it again.

164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,530
The black sliders on the right are for the speaker volume.

165
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,160
Got it?

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,980
Here, do it again.

167
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,260
Name: Baek Ho Rang

168
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,530
Stop.

169
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,100
Why?

170
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
How can you get the same question wrong twice?

171
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,330
Exactly. How?

172
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,360
Cool? You must be kidding me.

173
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,680
Nobody likes you anywhere else.

174
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,150
Grade: Second Year
 Name: Baek Ho Rang

175
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,350
Explain what headroom is.
The space above someone's head.

176
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,070
Extreme Long Shot (ELS), Natural View, Broad Background.

177
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,360
Explain pan and tilt. Explain the terms and draw diagrams.

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,490
Best shot, Worst shot

179
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,170
You're awake?

180
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,160
I placed a sample of the script on the desk, so take it with you to read over.

181
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,110
So you get used to it.

182
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,520
Hey, I just woke up.

183
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,080
Don't mess with me!
Second Year, Baek Ho Rang

184
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,960
Who's going to be afraid of this drawing?

185
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,650
Hey, I'm done.

186
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,800
Seoyeon High School Broadcasting Club Entrance Test

187
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,790
You got a 100.

188
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,520
Wow!

189
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,900
Seriously?

190
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,090
Here. Now the passing on of information is complete.

191
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,400
All right, I have to go home.

192
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,490
Did I become a genius or something? Why am I so good?

193
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,080
How unexpected.

194
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,060
- What?
- I didn't think you would last long and just run away.

195
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,480
I won't run away. I won't be a benefit to anyone.

196
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,270
I promised.

197
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,940
Either way, I promised you that I would do this.

198
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,240
You're pretty quick at picking things up.

199
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,510
I told you, you had potential.

200
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,430
It's because I'm smart.

201
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,490
It's not that I can't do it, I don't.

202
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,160
Then you should use that good brain of yours to come up with some ideas.

203
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,330
There you go again.

204
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,600
After this, we'll officially be preparing for the festival. So don't miss out.

205
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,480
I don't want to.

206
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,990
It's my dad.

207
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,240
Hello!

208
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm leaving first, see you tomorrow.

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,690
Sure.

210
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,480
Have you been talking to your mom recently?

211
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,230
No.

212
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,130
Of course not. She's a woman that gave up on custody so that she could breathe easily.

213
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,890
- It would be shameful for her to contact you now—
- Don't you get tired of it?

214
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,870
Aren't you tired of saying the same thing every night?

215
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,790
Get ready for dinner and come out.

216
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll eat with my friend today.

217
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,440
[Hot Men's Chatroom (3)]
Come on in, friends.

218
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,610
Kim Yoo Sin?

219
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,230
Kim Yoo Sin

220
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,150
Ho Rang? I'm Ho Rang's mate. Huh?

221
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,070
You must play this game too. Add me.

222
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,300
Remember the kid that wanted to game with us at the PC Room last time? Do you know him?

223
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,020
No, not really.

224
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,940
Eun Taek, Woo Jae! Let's go to the cafeteria. I'll pay.

225
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,320
Go Eun Taek, Go Eun Taek!

226
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,300
Bye!

227
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,290
Goodbye.

228
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,460
Do Woo Jae, do you want to eat?

229
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,980
Excuse me, the food is ready.

230
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,130
Thank you.

231
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,070
Did you guys fight?

232
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,790
- No.
- No, why?

233
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,520
You guys are so quiet. I thought I'd have to help deescalate things.

234
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,890
But where were you going with that backpack of yours?

235
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,140
The Han River with Jae Yi.

236
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,930
Ah, it's so cold.

237
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,420
In this weather?

238
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,590
You have it hard.

239
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,060
Here, eat up.

240
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,570
Thank you.

241
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,660
That's right. I thought it'd be like that for Kang Jae Yi's boyfriend.

242
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,420
Of course, it's just like I thought it'd be. Hang in there.

243
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,320
You don't look that good today, will you be alright?

244
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,920
I'm fine, it's just a day.

245
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
Woo Jae can come up with a corner.

246
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,540
Eun Taek, let's go to the PC Room after we're done eating.

247
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,590
I can't go either, I have to go to the library.

248
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,050
Who studies on the weekend?

249
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,540
Ah, let's just go to the PC Room. Please?

250
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,310
Did Ji So Hyeon say she was heading straight to the library?

251
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,090
So Hyeon!

252
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,820
Ah, right, you like So Hyeon, don't you?

253
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,420
Yeah, I really like her.

254
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,370
Can I go with you? I want to show her what I look like out of uniform.

255
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,450
- There's no reason for you not to.
- Hey.

256
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,020
Can you help me get with So Hyeon?

257
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,970
What does So Hyeon like?

258
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,900
Ask the guy who's dating.

259
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,140
The Han River?

260
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,630
Han River?

261
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,210
Forget it, just ask me.

262
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,950
So Hyeon seems like

263
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,690
she doesn't like cute guys.

264
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,180
Me?

265
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,650
Ta-da, here.

266
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,150
How is it? Isn't it good?

267
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,090
It's good.

268
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,390
You can eat all of this.

269
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:14,080
There's one more down here. And eat this, and this, too. Eat all of this.

270
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,790
Jae Yi, you're going to catch a cold.

271
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,520
It'll be warmer if you wear it like this.

272
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,490
Thank you.

273
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,350
What's this? Did she go all the way here?

274
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,780
Yeah, to meet that doctor just now.

275
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,330
There she is.

276
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,200
Why did it end here?

277
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,970
It's okay. I brought an extra battery.

278
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,270
Oh, I forgot the power cable.

279
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,250
I'll go buy one.

280
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,140
No, no, it's okay. It wasn't fun, so I was going to turn it off anyway.

281
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,810
Is the mat okay?

282
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,600
What? How did you know?

283
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,590
- Should we get going now?
- What?

284
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,640
No, you wanted to come to the Han River.

285
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,950
We still have one hour until we have to return the mat.

286
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,990
Let's go.

287
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,200
Why?

288
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,590
I just don't want to be here anymore.

289
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,560
What's the problem now?

290
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,120
What? Hey, Do Woo Jae.

291
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,140
I was doing my best to match your feelings, but why are you mad this time?

292
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,930
Hey! Matching my feelings? What do you mean by that?

293
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,770
If you're going to make a face like that while matching me, then don't do it in the first place,

294
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,220
since I dislike that even more.

295
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,950
If you just keep your mouth closed and stay still by my side, you think that's matching my feelings?

296
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,380
I sense all that–that you don't feel well,

297
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,640
that you don't want to eat but are forcing yourself for me, that you want to go but are still sticking around. I sense all that.

298
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,320
Then what do I have to do?

299
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,720
I ate diligently since you worked hard to prepare it, and I covered you with a blanket in case you were cold—

300
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,710
I heard you already ate.

301
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,530
Kim Yoo Sin just told me that you guys ate together.

302
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,820
He asked me if you were okay, and I had nothing to say.

303
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,200
Why do I have to hear it from someone else? Can't you just tell me?

304
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,930
If not, then is it too annoying to do?

305
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,940
Jae Yi–

306
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,730
I'm going.

307
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,720
Sit down for a second.

308
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,320
Dating you is hard for me.

309
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,660
In case you're thinking about something deep inside other than trivial things,

310
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,810
I'm always trying to guess how you're feeling. Do you know that?

311
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,440
- I'm leaving.
- Why am I the only one who does wrong?

312
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,890
And I'm the only one who feels suffocated.

313
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,500
- What?
- Have you ever asked me once?

314
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,820
If you sensed everything,

315
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,590
why didn't you ever ask once?

316
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,890
Hey, Do Woo Jae...

317
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,610
And I'm the one who tries to guess at how you're feeling every single moment.

318
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,610
If you look sad, I wonder what I did wrong, if I said something wrong.

319
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,460
I feel like my head is going to explode because of it.

320
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,620
Is that right? You're saying that dating me was hard for you, what with trying to gauge me, right?

321
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,840
Then why are you dating me?

322
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,990
Then we're going to the amusement park on your birthday, okay?

323
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,880
Okay, sure. I promise.

324
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,670
Ho Rang, I feel weird since we're not meeting up on the weekend.

325
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,840
Where are you? Do you want to go eat?

326
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,760
I'm with So Hyeon at the library. Do you want to eat dinner with us?

327
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,610
I don't know what's going on, but don't suspect people with a look like that since that really makes us feel like crap.

328
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,670
And let's really not talk to each other from now on.

329
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,480
She always eats alone.

330
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,270
Who?

331
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,810
Ho Rang?

332
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,530
Baek Ho Rang?

333
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,660
Doesn't she live with her parents?

334
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,040
Her parents are very busy. They're very famous.

335
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,200
So she always eats alone. And when I ask her to eat out, she says she doesn't feel like it.

336
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,710
Straighten your shoulders when you walk. Otherwise, you'll get narrow shoulders. I noticed this when I eat

337
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,760
but when I don't have an appetite, eating rice with water tastes the best.

338
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,770
Just so you know.

339
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,870
I have to go home for a second.

340
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,310
What, now?

341
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,480
The two of you should eat together.

342
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,210
Yeah, of course, totally! You seemed busy today. Go, go!

343
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,340
Bye.

344
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,930
What's with him?

345
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,020
So Hyeon, what do you want to eat? We'll get whatever you want.

346
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,280
How about pork cutlets?

347
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,050
Oh, pork cutlets. That'll be great, I was craving it too.

348
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,490
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I have a place I go to often, shall we go there?

349
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,550
- Sure.
- Let's go.

350
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,280
Eat up.

351
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,870
Weren't you at the library?

352
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,650
Yeah, I left to eat.

353
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,160
All the way here?

354
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,660
I suddenly felt like eating sushi from here.

355
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,890
You're unusual, too.

356
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,900
Why? Is the sushi bad?

357
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,490
No.

358
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,460
I like it.

359
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,510
What happened to your arm?

360
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,310
Oh, this is because I was doing something earlier.

361
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,930
You didn't even wash your hands before eating?

362
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,720
Hey, I washed them earlier.

363
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,780
You're dirty.

364
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,080
Give me.

365
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,450
What?

366
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,470
Give me your hand.

367
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,920
It's not that I didn't wash my hands, it just didn't come off. Don't misunderstand.

368
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,040
I was right, you didn't wash them.

369
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,800
Damn. Hey!

370
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,070
I got it, let's eat.

371
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,620
Why are you laughing?

372
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,330
It was funny.

373
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,160
What?

374
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,260
I thought you were being less rough since you're full.

375
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,720
What are you saying?

376
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,100
Oh, right. It really was delicious like you said.

377
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,500
You told me before to eat rice with water when I don't have an appetite.

378
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,490
It tasted pretty good.

379
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,860
I don't just tell that to anyone.

380
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,190
You should be grateful.

381
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,590
Okay, thank you.

382
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,910
Then that makes up for the sushi? What do you think?

383
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,200
Is this and that the same?

384
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,720
What? Hey, I discovered that after a lot of experience and effort.

385
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,780
Next time you're eating alone call me.

386
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,830
I don't want to. Why would I call you?

387
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,210
I know how it feels to eat alone since I've done it before too.

388
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,830
It doesn't feel that good.

389
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,660
It's fine, I've gotten used to it.

390
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,190
It's more awkward eating with others.

391
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,560
Then who's the one who ate all the sushi before?

392
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,350
- Do you want to die?
- Wow, but I even got you sushi.

393
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,900
It all evens out if I buy you something later too. Doesn't it?

394
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,760
Honestly. I was suspicious

395
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,190
when you said you were joining the broadcasting club.

396
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,610
Why?

397
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,670
You had just told me you weren't interested at all. It was weird when you suddenly wanted to join.

398
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,050
As if you had a different reason for joining.

399
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,750
You bribed the other members to make them do your duties. And you walked into the broadcasting studio and caused trouble.

400
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,280
Even thinking about it again, I really don't like it.

401
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,630
Did you find out that I'm like this only now?

402
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,250
No.

403
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,160
You're not like that.

404
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,980
You're pretty okay.

405
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,750
So let's work well together from now on, too.

406
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,170
I need to get going now. I'll throw this out on my way.

407
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,340
Sure. Thanks.

408
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,510
See you tomorrow, Baek Ho Rang. Good night.

409
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,070
Okay.

410
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,770
See you.

411
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,570
But Ho Rang, do the others know

412
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,190
that you were like that back then?

413
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,250
Come to think of it, you're pretty shameless, seeing how you're living well now, so unconcerned.

414
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,730
Go Eun Taek.

415
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,020
I have something to tell you.

416
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,530
What is it?

417
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,270
You said you have something to tell me.

418
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,700
I didn't get to say thank you.

419
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,260
Did you run so hard to tell me that?

420
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,750
I know how to do that much at least.

421
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,920
Is that really all?

422
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,890
Yeah. Do you want me to bow in thanks?

423
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,120
No, not that.

424
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
I'm asking if you're okay.

425
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,040
Of course, I'm okay.

426
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,210
I finished saying what I needed to say, so bye.

427
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,610
Baek Ho Rang.

428
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,910
That doesn't suit you.

429
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,730
Just act like you always have. Since that's more like you, Baek Ho Rang.

430
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,310
Bye.

431
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,690
What's the problem now? I'm adjusting to your feelings as much as I can right now, but why are you feeling bad again?

432
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,220
Did he have to say that so coldly?

433

- Oh!!
- Where is Yoo Sin?

435
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,140
The bathroom, to wash his face.

436
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,520
It's unexpected. I thought he'd go home quickly.

437
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,640
- But what happened?
- What?

438
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,100
You said you'd be here by eight, but did you know you're late by fifteen minutes?

439
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,830
Oh.

Our dear Ho Rang is so picky. Don't be too scared, Ho Rang.

443
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,430
Then this loses its fun.

444
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,780
It was so cute when you entered the broadcasting club.

450
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,530
Oh, you're here?

451
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,840
You're up?

452
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,700
What are you doing in the morning like this?

453
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,780
Today's your birth—

454
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,570
...the day you were born.

455
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,450
Eat.

456
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,010
- You're not having any issues at school, right?
- No.

457
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,660
Even if it isn't, think of it as a life experience and let it go.

458
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,510
Yes. Even if you feel like everything revolves around you now, it won't be anything in the future.

You know I don't eat whipped cream.

462
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,610
Is that right?

463
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,360
You know, I—

464
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,910
Oh, give me a second.

465
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,620
Hello?

466
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,240
Ugh, why are they being like that?

467
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,460
Okay, I'll head out right now. Bye.

468
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,760
- What's wrong?
- They want to change the day of the demonstration. What time is it?

469
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,400
They're asking you to give it to them now?

470
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,170
Eat and then come out. I'll be working first.

471
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,160
Let's go together in my car.

472
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,330
Ho Rang, put everything in the sink when you're done eating.

473
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,860
We're sorry, Ho Rang.

474
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,430
They need to have their information leaked and get beaten, seriously.

475
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,890
I think Ho Rang is incredible. I'd have filed a lawsuit.

476
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,010
Why would she post this?

477
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,590
Isn't that her? Ji So Hyeon?

478
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,890
Is that Noh Min Gyu's girlfriend?

479
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,190
Yeah. But seeing her in person, she's just okay. No charm.

480
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,090
That's what happens when you use apps. It makes you look charming.

481
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,070
Why are you like that when you use photo-editing apps?

482
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,440
Hey, want to die?

483
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,750
- Are you sure?
- What?

484
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,670
As far as I know, she doesn't have a boyfriend.

485
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,210
Really? We heard from someone—

486
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,180
Know for certain when you talk. If you don't know, then keep your mouth shut.

487
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,460
Student Council Room
And the media club can prepare festival related films.

488
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,390
- Then we just need to provide camcorders and video edits, right?
- Yeah.

489
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,350
Let us know once the performance team roster is decided.

490
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,540
We have to schedule our skill rehearsal, too.

491
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,050
Are you guys really planning to lead a feature during the festival?

492
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,790
You're going to be busy even without that. You should just turn on the videos.

493
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,980
Oh, right. You guys made a big deal about taking a famous kid.

494
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,200
You should get some good use out of her.

495
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,280
All she did so far was a broadcasting incident.

496
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,820
I don't think we're meeting to discuss that.

497
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,040
What's going on? Why is everyone so serious?

498
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,070
I'm just saying that's what they say. It's a joke, a joke.

499
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,240
- They say she's so famous, so I tried making a joke.
- Hey.

500
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,990
Joke around when you're with yourselves.

501
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:38,340
Do you know that I'm in charge of that corner?

502
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,770
How would I know that?

503
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,000
Almost everyone knows it.

504
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,050
Your information strength is really sub par, huh?

505
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,300
- Say that again–
- So what I'm saying is,

506
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,320
as long as I'm in the broadcasting club, your booth is the one that's going to be pointless.

507
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,160
You can check with your own eyes

508
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,310
how much power my fame has.

509
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,120
Good work.

510
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,190
Good work.

511
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,550
Oh, that's right. I'm going to pop by the broadcasting room. You go first.

512
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,970
Why?

513
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,020
I left some performance review printouts.

514
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,920
Sure.

515
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,490
That's weird.

516
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,100
- What is?
- What? Oh.

517
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,690
It's just that guy back there.

518
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,030
- Kim Jung Bin?
- Yeah.

519
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,590
He's the student council president, right?

520
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,330
Yeah.

521
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,420
The school sure is crawling along well.

522
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,630
He doesn't even look like he can look after himself.

523
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,430
But why did you suddenly say you're in charge of the corner?

524
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,300
It makes me mad to see him keep beaming like he's all that.

525
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,420
Then should I be thankful for Kim Jung Bin?

526
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,570
Here.

527
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,420
What is this?

528
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,920
The script for the lunch broadcast later.

529
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,440
What? I'm doing that starting today?

530
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,430
Yeah. So come in a little earlier to prepare ahead of time so we can line things up.

531
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,630
Sure. Got it.

532
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,860
Oh, right. Also...

533
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,730
Thanks, Go Eun Taek.

534
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,520
For what?

535
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,660
For something.

536
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,330
Jeon hwa wee bok.

537
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,760
Jeon hwa wee bok.

538
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,940
It means you can always change a crisis into an opportunity.

539
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,830
Number two. Su hwa sang geuk.

540
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,370
Su hwa sang geuk.

541
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,480
It means it's difficult for people or objects with the complete opposite

542
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,520
properties to coexist.

543
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,180
It's hard dating you, Do Woo Jae.

544
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm always worried that there is more in your head

545
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,050
than these minor things. Do you know that?

546
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,990
Unable to forget someone you miss.

547
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,890
It's always my fault, isn't it?

548
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,240
What more do you want from me?

549
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,280
Enough.

550
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,200
Enough!

551
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,540
Kang Jae Yi, stop!

552
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,500
Jae Yi Sunbaenim, you flipped the stage.

553
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,890
Rhythm, soul, beat.

554
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,520
You're the best, Sunbae.

555
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,420
Who's next? Come to the front.

556
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,370
Don't try me, Ho Rang.

557
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,580
Why? Scared?

558
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,780
- What?
- You said you know me well.

559
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,530
Then you must know pretty well what I did to Park Hye Rim.

560
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,800
Even if I go down, I'm not going down alone.

561
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,690
Just you wait. I'll make sure to take you down with me.

562
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,060
Lol, you think you'll be okay? I don't have anything to lose, but that's not the case for you.

563
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:56,630
I guess you don't know. The person who has more to protect is more rash.

564
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm saying you tried to mess with the wrong person.

565
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,280
I heard you're in charge of the upcoming corner?

566
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,260
You seem to want attention no matter what, but the more you do that, the more it only takes a moment to fall.

567
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,050
Do you know I'm in charge of that corner?

568
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,250
Corner?

569
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,470
You're one of the people with me in the meeting earlier, aren't you?

570
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:21,690
That was the first time I ever said I was in charge of the corner.

571
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,250
Lol, don't try to act smart. I just heard about it.

572
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,360
From who? Then I can just find them and ask them one by one. Isn't that right?

573
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,550
Lol, you're so stupid.

574
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,080
Are you a student council member?

575
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,560
Or are you in the broadcasting clu—
[You cannot contact this person on Messenger.]

576
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,460
We're all ready.

577
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,970
You can go in now, Sunbae.

578
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,220
Fighting.

579
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,250
Ho Rang Sunbae, good luck on the broadcast.

580
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,120
Do well.

581
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,920
Five-second standby.

582
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,760
On Air

583
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,560
Hello, this is a time where cumulous clouds are floating in the clear sky.

584
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,320
This is SHBS.

585
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,120
Many good stories came in this time, too. This is the first one of them.

586
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,470
I recently went on a date to the Han River with my boyfriend.

587
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:42,480
Since he was full after having eaten already, I understand him not being able to eat my lunchbox.

588
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,630
I understand because we met late.

589
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:52,030
But what really made me sad was that he didn't tell me the truth.

590
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,460
If you already ate, say you ate. If you want to go home, say you want to go.

591
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,800
- If you're not feeling well, say you're not feeling well. Why isn't he telling me?
- No way!

592
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,650
Do you think he's uncomfortable around me?

593
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:05,790
When I'm not a stranger, but his girlfriend? I'm really sad.

594
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,610
That's the end of the story sent to us.

595
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,930
They say there is a famous saying in France.

596
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,850
An hour-long conversation is much better than fifty letters.

597
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:20,840
It means that communication is much more important than anything else in human relationships.

598
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,620
Honestly, you don't even need an hour.

599
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,810
Five minutes– no, even a one-minute conversation filled with sincerity,

600
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,040
that's enough.

601
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,870
Don't justify yourself by saying "I'm usually like this."

602
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,070
"Usually" is a word you use when it's convenient.

603
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:37,870
Isn't that Baek Ho Rang?

604
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,130
The comment just now was mind-blowing.

605
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,090
- Wow, she's good. Right?
- She's good.

606
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,630
A new announcer is coming to you.

607
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,400
-The announcer changed. Who is it?
- Yeah, Baek Ho Rang.

608
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,150
Lunch broadcast became spicy.

609
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,330
I feel so relieved.

610
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,460
So good! Good vibes!

611
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,120
Who heard the broadcast just now?

612
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,320
Whoever sent this story should do the same.

613
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,660
Didn't you hide your feelings and avoid expressing them?

614
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,260
I see that both of you don't want to break up yet.

615
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,620
Hey, but honestly, wasn't he trying to be considerate?

616
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,680
Do you call that consideration? It's frustrating.

617
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,530
Exactly. You are going to the Han River, why would you eat and then go?

618
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,200
They met late. You don't think of friends when you're hungry either.

619
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,980
We'll play a song before moving on to the second story.

620
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,630
- I recommend Baek Ho Rang to be stationed.
- I agree.

621
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,300
I want to submit a story, too.

622
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,470
Baek Ho Rang, daebak.

623
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,000
Who wrote the story?!

624
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,260
Have it. Drink it.

625
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,660
You did a good job reading the story, Baek Ho Rang.

626
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,900
You wrote the script, right?

627
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,460
- That—
- What do you guys think?

628
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,090
The Han River story, whose side are you on?

629
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,220
Me or Do Woo Jae?

630
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,480
You guys figure out your fight on your own. Don't take it out here.

631
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,460
Baek Ho Rang, you should take my side because we are friends.

632
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,690
- We were friends?
- Heyyy!

633
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,860
I think Do Woo Jae is at fault.

634
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,240
You should speak. If you don't say anything, how can anyone know what's on your mind?

635
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,930
If the relationship becomes distant, it's his responsibility.

636
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,130
Right? I'm not overreacting or anything, am I?

637
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,640
- So—
- No.

638
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,430
Right. If he doesn't say, he has his reasons. Why are you so curious?

639
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,760
It'll blow over in time.

640
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,920
What? Baek Ho Rang, weren't you on my side?

641
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,660
I'll leave now. I'll drink this well, Jae Yi.

642
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,870
Hello.

643
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,330
Hey, Eun Taek.

644
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,160
Go Eun Taek, today's broadcast program was really fun.

645
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,090
Can I also send a story?

646
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,700
- Thank you, Sir.
- Hello!

647
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,560
Hey kids.

648
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,350
Right, today's broadcast was really awesome.

649
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,820
Shall I also send a story? I wish Baek Ho Rang could read it out.

650
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,430
Yoo Jin, that's the bell. Go inside.

651
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,260
Yes!

652
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,680
[Baek Ho Rang_Broadcast Club]
We have a soundcheck today. Come to the broadcast room by 5.

653
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,790
What are you taking?

654
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:34,720
I take the subway.

655
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,070
- You take the bus, right?
- Yeah.

656
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,860
I'll go this way. See you tomorrow.

657
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

[Do Woo Jae]
Where are you?

659
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,040
In front of the school.

660
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,630
Going home now.

661
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,120
What to do?!

662
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,270
Come toward the intersection.

663
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,390
Let's meet.

664
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,420
What are you doing? Sit down.

665
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,030
Today, the two of us are going to do the soundcheck together. If I turn on the sound,

666
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,090
you will go around from the third floor–

667
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:46,840
Nevermind. Since you already learned this stuff, you stay here. I'll do the rounds.

668
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,990
So I just need to play them one by one from the first to the third floor, right?

669
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,930
Yeah. When I signal you over the walkie-talkie.

670
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,640
Okay.

671
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,420
How do you turn this on?

672
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,160
Press here and...

673
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,470
Try it.

674
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,430
I'm off. I'll page you.

675
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,120
Okay.

676
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,820
Can you hear me?

677
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,830
Yeah, I can hear you.

678
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,630
This is really cool.

679
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,860
That's why you use these instead of a phone, huh?

680
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,780
What are you saying? It's because it's easier when there are three or four people doing rounds.

681
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm on the third floor. Turn it on.

682
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,700
Okay.

683
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,670
Good job. No mistakes. I taught you well.

684
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,030
I learn well.

685
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,990
Hey, Go Eun Taek. How come you're not saying anything to me?

686
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,040
What do you mean?

687
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,740
I didn't go by the script during the broadcast today.

688
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,060
I thought you'd be mad, but you didn't say anything.

689
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,100
You did well.

690
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,180
Honestly, I was going to say something if you didn't get called out in the middle but I reconsidered and it wasn't that big a deal.

691
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,660
It wasn't bad and the reactions were good.

692
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:17,030
See? Sometimes it's better to improvise as I do than to be so rigid,

693
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,870
and do things according to plan.

694
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,370
That doesn't mean you should do that every time. Next time, let us know first.

695
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,100
Okay, fine.

696
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,100
The third floor is done. You can turn it off.

697
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,640
Okay.

698
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,390
But, Baek Ho Rang.

699
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,920
You were right. Sometimes,

700
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,640
change can create a good situation.

701
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,660
In that way,

702
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,920
you did well on your first broadcast today.

703
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,380
I felt like I couldn't say this earlier.

♫ Inside my heart ♫

The lunch-time confession.

711
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,930
You sent that, right?

712
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,210
Yeah.

713
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:54,750
I didn't know that I'd be chosen and wrote it out of anger but it was read as a story.

714
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,230
- So, what I'm trying to say is—
- I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

715
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,870
I was listening to your story today, and it must have been so difficult for you recently.

716
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,840
Well, it's not like I did any good either.

717
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,580
Jae Yi,

718
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,650
do you remember when we first met,

719
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,650
when we were in middle school?

720
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,260
Can I sit here?

721
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:22,680
Of course, I do. I talked to you first because I liked you.

722
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,460
Your expressions were so blank then, I thought you didn't like me.

723
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,380
I told you that I spoke to you because I liked you first.

724
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,930
Hey, is that how you look at someone you like?

725
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,980
Back then, I was really happy on the inside,

726
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,540
that you sat next to me.

727
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,130
Do you want to eat dinner with me later?

728
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,430
The letters that you wrote on that memo, asking me to eat with you, was so cute.

729
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:00,520
I really liked how you talked about yourself when we ate together for the first time.

730
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,350
Me, too.

731
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,840
I was thankful that you listened to everything I said.

732
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,820
I liked that you were different from me.

733
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:19,210
I have difficulties expressing even a single emotion, so I try to hold it in as long as I can before I say one thing.

734
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,190
But you always told me everything.

735
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,420
I thought about this and that, after our fight at the Han River.

736
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,600
I should've just asked to go another time.

737
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,960
"I already ate. I don't feel too well."

738
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,380
At least once, I should've been straightforward and told you how I was feeling.

739
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,990
I regretted not saying things because then we wouldn't have fought to that extent, but...

740
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,400
This wasn't the first time.

741
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,780
What are you trying to say?

742
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,180
I liked you because we were so different.

743
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,450
But, we were having such a difficult time for that same reason.

744
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,120
- That's it, I don't want to hear it.
- Jae Yi.

745
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm going.

746
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,450
Saying that everything's okay, and ignoring things to move on.

747
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,470
We're too exhausted to do that.

748
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,680
Hey, Do Woo Jae.

749
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,230
That's why I'm saying this, Jae Yi.

750
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,770
Let's...

751
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,090
break up.

752
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,130
That's the right thing to do.

753
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,230
Hey, what's right about that?

754
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:55,220
I was happy that you were finally saying what was on your mind but now you want to break up?

755
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,260
Hey, you really are selfish, Do Woo Jae.

756
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,220
Suddenly...

757
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,020
- If you're suddenly like this—
- This wasn't sudden.

758
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,320
Alright, let's break up.

759
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,320
As you said, I was having a hard time too.

760
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,460
Let's break up.

761
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,790
I checked it, you can turn it off now.

762

Are you done now?

763
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,010
Yeah, you've done well. I'll head up now.

764
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,790
- That's right, Baek Ho Rang.
- What?

765
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:40,260
I was going to give it to you after I got there, but you might not like it and cringe.

766
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,160
- What?
- My bag is on the chair, right?

767
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,220
Do you want to open it?
