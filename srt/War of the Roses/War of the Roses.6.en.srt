1
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,240
No need.

2
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
I can handle it.

3
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,520
That's good.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,039
I can help you too.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,400
What are you going to repay me with?

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
If you want anything,

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,800
just tell your brother.

8
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,160
50% of the club shares.

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,840
Fifty?

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm telling you, I don't agree.

12
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,960
We are in the same boat now.

13
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,360
If I go in,

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
you'll be doomed too.

15
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,240
Are you threatening me?

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,479
Do you know

17
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,560
lawyers are not afraid of threats.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
If the plan fails,

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,120
I will lose some money.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
But Mr. Sun

21
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
will lose his life.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Think it over, okay?

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,480
50 is fine.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,200
Cheers.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,680
I've been thinking

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,520
why you like this painting.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Everyone likes something similar.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,680
The arrogance of the upper.

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,680
So beautiful.

30
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,920
What do you think?

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,800
This electronic version of Yin and Yang contract

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,840
When the board

33
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,040
Yo.

34
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Miss Wen.

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
You look good recently.

36
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Isn’t this Li Jie?

37
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
We are sisters.

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,160
We're together again

39
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
What brings you here today?

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
As the legal advisor of Arakang Media,

41
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,480
of course I have to attend today’s meeting.

42
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,240
But Miss Wen,

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,240
you hired a loser who didn’t even graduate from college.

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,360
Isn't it a bit low?

45
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,840
I don't know how capable he is,

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,800
But I've been willing to be your lover for so many years

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
but it's cheap.

48
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,400
You...

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
This is my first time joining the board meeting as the general manager.

50
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,720
Please help me.

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,200
Looks like Mr. Wen

52
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Mr. Wen is ready.

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,480
Is there any good news to announce?

54
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
I’ll do what I should do

55
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,560
I’ll do what the general manager should do.

56
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,520
I’m looking forward to your performance in the meeting.

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Good luck.

58
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
I invited you here today

59
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,200
to plan the next quarter merger of Around Light Media.

60
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,520
there is another important

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,120
about Mr. Sun's personnel appointment.

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,560
to the shareholders.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
The company has decided

64
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,320
to fire Sun Seon-jun from all his duties in Luguang Entertainment.

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,080
Miss Wen,

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Although Mr. Sun caused some scandals,

67
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
he's just suspended for now.

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Firing Mr. Sun is a big deal.

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,159
Because Mr. Sun has committed a serious violation of the law.

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,240
This will threaten the management of the company.

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,640
I have to make this decision

72
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,520
I have to make this decision.

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,120
Miss Wen,

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,800
You need evidence for everything.

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You suddenly...

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,080
Miss Wen won’t frame Mr. Sun for no reason.

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,800
Please have a look.

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,520
Today,

79
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,960
I would like to ask all of you to be our witnesses.

80
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,240
Yin and Yang contract, financial fraud.

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,200
Mr. Sun is still doing this at the most critical moment of the company.

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,280
Firing him should be the lightest punishment.

83
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,160
At this point,

84
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,640
we have to minimize the loss.

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,440
We support Vincent’s decision.

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Everyone,

87
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Calm down.

88
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,040
Look at the screen.

89
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,520
Who is the person

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
of these contracts?

91
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,960
I think

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,760
you should know

93
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
the financial fraud.

94
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm responsible for

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,400
for doing this.

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,200
She wants to kick me out of the board.

97
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
I think

98
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,280
for Sun Group,

99
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
to Sun's Group.

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,600
We're all seniors who fight the country with our old man.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,720
I, Son Sun-jun, admire you all.

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,720
I think today

103
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,520
it's time for everyone to save Arko.

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,080
If you agree to kick Wenshan out of the board,

105
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,320
raise your hand with me.

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Just one step away.

107
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,400
Honey.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,200
Let's go home.

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Just like when we first got married.

110
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Yes, Miss Wen.

111
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Go home and rest.

112
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
As for a loser like you,

113
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
just wait for the lawsuit.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
Let's get investigated.

115
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
How shameless.

116
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
Son Sun-gun, what are you doing?

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,760
What are you doing?

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Let me out!

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
Aren't you going to fire me?

120
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
You're amazing.

121
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,800
Why are you always looking at me so arrogantly?

122
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,760
Yes.

123
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
You have the right to be arrogant.

124
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
Because you’re Miss Wen’s daughter.

125
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,400
Right?

126
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Back then,

127
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
my dad forced me

128
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,480
to marry you.

129
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
It's been more than ten years.

130
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,800
I've always raised you high.

131
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,400
outside,

132
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,440
I have to bow to my dad.

133
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,040
I'll bow to you when I get home.

134
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760
Koko is Sun, right?

135
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,360
Right?

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,440
But you know what?

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,680
people say I'm a dog raised by the Wen family.

138
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,440
You told me not to touch you.

139
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,960
Right?

140
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,240
