1
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,160
I avenged Anle.

2
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,680
I saved Wenshan.

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
In all sense,

4
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Shouldn’t you thank me?

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,200
Anle, here.

6
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,360
Cheers.

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,039
First,

8
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
we are not a family.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,920
We can never be a family.

10
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,039
It's your duty

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,880
That's what you should do.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,640
We're here today

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,600
to hear an apology from you.

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
We don't have to see each other anymore.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,360
I've been fighting for more than 20 years.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,640
and everything I have today.

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,080
But I was confused before.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,520
Because I didn't know why I worked so hard.

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,240
Until you showed up,

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,039
I realized

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,080
what my hard work and the meaning of my life is.

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Anle.

23
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,640
I really hope

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,840
you can make up for your lack of father's love.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,840
Father's love?

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,320
Zhao Zhenghua, do you deserve it?

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
How could you

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,440
forget what you did before

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720
and still pretend to be your father.

30
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,880
Xiaojie

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
Because of your incompetence and cowardness,

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,440
my precious daughter

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,000
I suffered so much with you.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,240
and she was bullied.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,320
Are you a qualified mother?

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you deserve to be a mother?

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
Enough, stop arguing.

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,920
Can't we talk calmly?

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Yes.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Anle is right.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,880
Calm down.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,640
I want you and your mother to come back to me.

43
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,440
I can protect you.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,440
and give you everything you have.

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Anle.

46
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,680
My hug is always open to you

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Can you understand what I said?

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,240
Are you really willing to accept us?

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,440
Of course.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,440
I've had enough these years.

51
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,520
If there's a better condition,

52
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
I’m willing.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Li Anle, are you out of your mind?

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,519
Do you want him or me?

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,680
No, Mom, I...

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,720
Are you leaving or not?

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Xiaojie

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Why are you still so childish?

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,080
Fine.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
Just pretend that I never gave birth to you.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Mom.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,640
Anle,

63
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
I’m really happy

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm really happy.

65
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course, you don't have to worry.

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
As long as you stay by my side,

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
your mom will change her mind.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,760
You decided to come back to me to celebrate.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,640
I have a gift for you.

70
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Tell me what you want.

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,240
I just don't want to be wronged anymore.

72
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,640
I've loved movies since I was a kid.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
I worked hard to get into an art school.

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
I finally got into the Arc,

75
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,200
to realize my dream.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,640
But Son Sun-gun ruined everything.

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600
I have nothing.

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Now the whole industry sees me as a shame.

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,120
I don't know what to do.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,240
Be good.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't cry.

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
I promise you.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,960
no one dares to hurt you again.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
How about

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
take her photos?

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Which department do you want to go to?

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
I'll arrange it for you.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Is that true?

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
Are you lying to me?

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,200
Of course.

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
I won't lie to you.

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,840
Here.

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,200
Cheers to our new life

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Good morning, Jung Yul.

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Li Anle.

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,880
Why are you here?

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm here to work.

98
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
Work?

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,120
Who told you to come to work?

100
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
Zhao Zhenghua.

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
He didn't tell you?

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,600
I guess you’re not that important.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
Why is Li Anle here?

104
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Nannan, calm down.

105
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,520
She's my daughter after all.

106
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
You have to work together.

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
and become colleagues.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Don’t go against her.

109
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Lee Ahn Le and her mother are full of evil thoughts.

110
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,600
Look what you've done to Sun-gun.

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,040
Jo Jung-hwa, you're good to them.

112
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,440
they won't go easy on you.

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Jo Jung Hwa.

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
You don't care?

115
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
I'll do it.

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,159
Zheng Nan.

117
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,040
What belongs to a bitch doesn't deserve to be in our company.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
Everyone, I have a question.

119
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
why is the project

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
Why is it taking so long?

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Jung Yul.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,480
No, Mr. Zheng.

123
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,600
It's Mr. Wen from Koguang.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't want an explanation.

125
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Who will be responsible for this?

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,400
Sorry.

127
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm late for our first meeting.

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll treat you afternoon tea.

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
Why are you everywhere?

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,640
Do you want some?

131
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,320
Take care, Mr. Zheng.

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
By the way,

133
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
I've already

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,200
your office.

135
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
Please move your nest.

136
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
Let's continue. Where were we?

137
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,679
Mr. Zhao, why is there a producer in her photo?

138
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
Nan Nan.

139
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,600
Calm down.

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Anle finally came back.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,480
She only made one condition.

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
I have to promise her.

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Do you know what Li Anle did?

144
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
She stopped all our projects

145
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
all of our projects.

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,680
I see.

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
If that's the case,

148
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
this kid

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
is indeed wrong.

150
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Well,

151
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
It's up to her to stop.

152
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,400
What about you?

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,680
I'll teach her a lesson later.

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
Jo Jung-hwa.

155
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,840
We have to make a choice.

156
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
Nannan.

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
Anle.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,240
Mr. Zhao, thank you for putting me in an important position.

159
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,600
I have a small gift for you.

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
It's not very expensive.

161
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,320
I hope you don't mind.

162
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,080
Sure.

163
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,200
Let me see.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
You have good taste.

165
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
That's just like me.

166
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Let me take it for you.

167
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
OK.

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,920
Li Anle, you’re so young.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,200
I didn’t expect it to be so tea.

170
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Tea?

171
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,400
I think it's better

172
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,040
I think it's okay.

173
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
By the way, Mr. Zhao,

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
I'm going to change to another office.

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Will you disagree?

176
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,680
No, I won't.

177
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
How about this?

178
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,040
You can choose one you like.

179
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,080
Go ahead.

180
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,400
It's just a tie that makes you obedient

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
Nan Nan, you have to understand me.

182
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,040
I finally found my child.

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,120
Can't I make her happy for a few days?

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,840
Kid.

185
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
Your child.

186
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
What about our baby?

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
What did you say?

188
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.
