1
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,200
I was wrong.

2
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,560
Don't...

3
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
Don't hand me over to the police.

4
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,160
Don't give me to the police.

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,120
I beg you.

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Don't worry.

7
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I won't tell the police about us.

8
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,520
I will only send you to reunite with Wenshan.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,240
Let me go. I'm not sick.

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Doctor.

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm not sick.

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,880
Doctor, I'll give you money.

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,120
I can give you as much as you want.

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Doctor, let me go.

15
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,240
Let me go! Don't!

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,880
Zhao Zhenghua, I'll kill you!

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Wenshan.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,880
Aunt Wen.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
Yi Ming, Anle.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,320
Aunt Wen, we're here to save you.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,040
It's too dangerous.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
Sun-gun has been watching me.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
If he finds you,

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
you won't be able to leave.

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,079
Jo Jung Hwa has agreed to let you go.

26
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,320
Son Sun Sun is the one who is locked up here.

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,680
I need you to release Wenshan.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,640
Sure.

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Aunt Wen, are you okay?

30
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
I'm fine. How is Myung Joo?

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,880
Myung Joo.

32
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,079
Myung Joo is here.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Myung Joo, talk to me.

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,360
Myung Joo, I miss you so much.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
How have you been?

36
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,920
Aunt Yi Ming and Anle. You've taken good care of me.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Aunt Yi Ming promised Ming Zhu

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
to save my mom from the devil.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
Auntie did it.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,800
Auntie is amazing.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Auntie is awesome.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,280
She’s not good.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
Wait for me at home.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,320
Bye.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,640
Let's go.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,440
Let's go.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,240
Wait.

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,400
Where is Son Sun-gun?

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,160
What are you doing?

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
I can't just leave like this.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,440
I want to watch him

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,079
suffer a thousand times.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,600
Let's go.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,800
Son Sun-gun.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
Get up and get treated.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,640
Yes.

57
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
Cooperate well.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
or you'll suffer.

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,280
Wenshan, why are you with them?

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
I can see the day again.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,120
And you...

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,480
Just enjoy it here.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
Wenshan, no.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Honey, I know I was wrong.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,079
I know I was wrong.

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,120
Let me go.

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,920
Ladies,

68
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,160
There are three modes here. Mr. Zhao asked me to do it.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,480
Which one do you choose?

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,640
Mr. Sun likes to play various kinds of games.

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,160
Then

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,200
try every one of them.

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,520
No, Wenshan.

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
Wenshan, I...

75
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Prince Seon.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,400
I heard that water can cure psychos' excessive and abnormal behaviors.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,640
Let me think.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
You abused your daughter too much.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
It's abnormal to imprison a wife.

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,720
and insulting women is crazy.

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Fine.

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,600
It's all yours.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Enjoy it.

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,160
Is it fun?

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
Is it fun?

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
Do you still want to play?

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
There are more tricks.

88
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
No! No!

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,600
Son Sun-gun!

90
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
I will pay you back

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,280
I'll pay you back a thousand times.

92
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Not enough.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,280
There are many innocent girls waiting to take revenge on you.

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,360
Live your life in repentance.

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
TCR 1, don't come over. 37:11.

96
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,600
TCR 1 Don't come over 37:11

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't come over.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,880
I haven't seen the sun for a long time.

100
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,159
So warm.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,320
Wenshan,

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
You've suffered.

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm the only one left.

104
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,840
I have to pull myself together.

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,320
Revitalize Arc.

106
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,240
[and cleanse all sins of the crown.]

107
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,400
Hello, reporters.

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,400
Today, It's the opening ceremony of the new project of Around Media.

109
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,840
This movie

110
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,400
is the key project of Around Media.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Because it focuses on the awakening of women.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,680
Mr. Sun just admitted to sexual assault.

113
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,360
I heard he’s still doing a mental test.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,280
Vincent, if the prostitution deal is confirmed,

115
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
how can you make a female movie?

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,440
Do you know what Mr. Sun did?

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
I heard both you and your daughter were abused by Sun Seon-gun.

118
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Is this movie too ironic?

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,680
Wenshan,

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
your dignity will be torn into pieces in public.

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,440
That's right.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,440
Wrong.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,640
Come on, Aunt Wen.

124
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,320
Hang in there.

125
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,480
My husband, Son Sun-gun, is a beast.

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
He's the one who injured him.

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
And my daughter.

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
For a long time,

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,800
I had to put up with his messy private life.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I even had to do crisis PR for him.

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
This is all because

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to maintain the dignity of a perfect wife.

133
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,200
Because of my vanity,

134
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,360
I hurt a lot of people.

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,960
Today,

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,200
I sincerely apologize

137
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,600
to those girls.

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
What I want to say is,

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Son Sun-gun's behavior doesn't mean his optimism.

140
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,840
nor myself.

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,480
I chose to show my imperfect self.

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,720
I hope this courage and power

143
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,880
can infect more female compatriots.

144
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,559
From now on,

145
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,520
Arc Media

146
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,000
will focus more on the creation of women's movies.

147
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
and promote the power of women's culture.

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
Well said.

149
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,920
What Mr. Wen said

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,120
is consistent with me.

151
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Mr. Zhao.

152
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,000
May I know who you are today?

153
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I'll answer you later.

154
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,560
Please have a seat.

155
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhao Zhenghua.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,400
I sympathize with Vincent.

157
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,240
Sun Sun Sun, his behavior is worse than animals.

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,160
But now, the change of Koko is the top priority.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,720
On this point,

160
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Miss Wen and I are in sync.

161
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,920
Today, I officially announce

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,920
Her Shadow Fund will officially launch

163
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,240
And today, her photography and Arale have reached a cooperation.

164
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,560
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Cultural Media Co., Ltd.
