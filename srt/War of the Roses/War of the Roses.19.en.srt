1
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,200
Honey.

2
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,440
Li Yi Ming has already replaced the medicine in the coffee.

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,840
What?

4
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,920
Mr. Zhao.

5
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,920
The medicine you prepared for me

6
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,400
you prepared for me.

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,160
Teacher

8
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,640
Come and have a rest.

9
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,840
Have some water

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Nannan

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,039
What's wrong? Are you okay?

12
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,080
I'll get you some water.

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,479
Honey.

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,080
I don't want to drink water.

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,440
Your hallucinogenic drugs

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
were replaced by me.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,880
Jo Jung Hwa.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
Calm down.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,240
Zheng Nan doesn't listen to me.

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Come on, honey.

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
My two good students.

22
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,120
Li Yi Ming.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,640
Do you think our professor

24
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,480
smart or stupid?

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,560
God bless me.

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,040
Please.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
attempted murder.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Sir.

29
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,080
What should we do with this?

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,040
Pour the soil into the lake in the villa area.

31
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Are you okay?

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm fine.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,079
I'm a diving player.

34
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,600
Zhao Zhenghua doesn't know.

35
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,160
I love diving.

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,640
[I'll treat him in his own way.]

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,840
He's very smart.

38
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,200
But...

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
You deserve it.

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,680
You deserve it.

41
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,200
That was foolish.

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,800
My two good students.

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,600
How did you get together?

44
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Although I still hate her,

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
but we have one thing in common.

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,720
attempted murder.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
How should we sentence him, Mr. Zhao?

48
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,440
Doctor.

49
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,360
Help me.

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,680
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
We'll do our best.

52
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Have a good rest.

53
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,760
Doctor.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,880
How is my husband?

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Your husband's condition is very serious.

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,000
He has a rare brain stem tumor.

57
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,480
This kind of malignant tumor is very fast.

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,280
The operation is extremely risky.

59
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Well,

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
how high is his success rate?

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Because this tumor

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,640
is in the brain stem.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
It controls people's breathing and heartbeat.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,840
If the surgery is careless,

65
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,360
it will cause irreversible damage.

66
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
What if we don't do the surgery?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
If he doesn't,

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
the patient can live for a while.

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
But in the end,

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,760
will also die

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
due to tumor.

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,800
Time is running out.

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Please hurry up

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
to make a decision.

75
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Mr. Zhao.

76
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
I didn't expect

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
I would become your family.

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,040
Zheng Nan.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
Are you reading again?

80
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
Take a rest.

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
This time,

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
this time.

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,600
You did well last time.

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Why do you work so hard?

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,960
You don't know.

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
In my dad's heart,

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Sir.

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,600
I have a question.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
Wait a moment.

90
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
Xiaojie

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
Come here.

92
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
Here's the thing.

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Last time.

94
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,159
The question you asked me last time.

95
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,800
It's like this.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Xiaojie.

97
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
You are No.1.

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,400
Congratulations on being chosen by Professor Zhao.

99
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,160
Zheng Nan.

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Let's go out for dinner tonight.

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,760
My treat.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,840
You can go to the celebration party yourselves.

103
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
I don't need to accompany you two.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
That's not what I meant.

105
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,600
Zheng Nan, Wenshan wants to comfort you.

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,280
Comfort?

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
I don't need your comfort.

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,200
Professor Zhao.

109
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Why?

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Why can't you see me

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
but you still can't see me?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Back then,

113
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
I betrayed Li Jie for you.

114
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,640
I reported her when she was helpless.

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,600
and told on you.

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
All these years,

117
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
I've done so many dirty things for you.

118
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
I didn't complain at all.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,680
I thought

120
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,160
as long as I listened to you,

121
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
and work for you,

122
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
you can respect me

123
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,560
and fall in love with me.

124
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
Anle.

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
In the end,

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
my original intention.

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Anle.

128
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Anle.

129
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,800
I bet my 20 years of youth

130
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
in exchange for something.

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,400
A car accident.

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
A kid I've never seen

133
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,480
and my cold heart.

134
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
Jo Jung Hwa.

135
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Do you know how much I want to be your bride

136
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
and your family?

137
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,840
Look.

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
I've become

139
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
But now,

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,680
I will decide your life.

141
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
Honey.

142
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,680
Do you think

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,000
should I sign this?

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.
