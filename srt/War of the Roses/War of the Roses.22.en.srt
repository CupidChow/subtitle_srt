1
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't go to jail.

2
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,400
I can't go to jail.

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,280
How can I go to jail?

4
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,200
Am I crazy?

5
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm really sick.

6
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,240
I can't go to jail.

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
Come and get it yourselves.

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,400
Zheng Nan.

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,440
Are you crazy?

10
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,360
From now on,

11
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,840
Koko.

12
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,240
and her shadow

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200
are all mine.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,240
You called me to come down.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,560
to make fun of me?

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,320
Li Jie.

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,240
I really admire you.

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
You said what happened 20 years ago

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,800
to go against me.

20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,520
I don't want to go against you.

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
We just want to find out

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,240
all the crimes behind Koko and her shadow.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,480
Jo Jung-hwa and Son Sun-gun did all this.

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
I was threatened.

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,800
Threatening means

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,040
threatening an accomplice.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,640
Article 28 of Criminal Law,

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,560
When you were forced to commit a crime,

29
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,320
At that time,

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
can reduce the crime

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
and exemption.

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,600
You're so familiar with the laws.

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
What's the use?

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
As a student of law,

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
where is your original intention?

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
and our friendship.

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
Have you forgotten?

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,760
We treat you as good friends.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
but you always treat us as opponents.

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,240
Friends?

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Have you ever treated me as a friend?

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,960
You were always against me in school.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
You took away my friendship with Wenshan

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,040
and my postgraduate recommendation.

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,040
and my beloved teacher.

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680
I worked harder than you two.

47
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
Why did you take my spot for postgraduate studies?

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Why? I worked so hard

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
but not recognised by others?

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Why does everyone like you?

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,640
Li Jie.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,240
You deserve to be raped.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
You asked for it.

54
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
Twenty years ago,

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,040
I treated Wenshan and you as my best friends.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,040
I also

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,480
I think

58
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,520
more qualified to be recommended than me.

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
The day I went to see Jo Jung-hwa,

60
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,279
I wanted to give up my postgraduate recommendation.

61
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,360
I want to leave this place

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
to the most qualified one.

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,840
Among the three of us,

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,680
among the three of us.

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,159
You're the most qualified in my heart.

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,560
But Jo Jung Hwa seduced me

67
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,120
to lure me.

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,640
I said I would give up on the postgraduate recommendation.

69
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
I refused.

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,080
Xiaojie, I really like you.

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,000
That's why I wrote this statement.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,560
When I gave this statement to Jo Jung-hwa,

73
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,200
will anyone believe you?

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Do you have evidence?

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
He was so angry

76
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
and let me have you.

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
That's why he attacked me.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,120
I was so happy.

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,400
When I was going to sue him,

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,440
you reported me.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
Li Jie, Class 4, Grade 4 of law school,

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,040
Its thesis is involved in plagiarism and fraud.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
The school has decided

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,200
Zheng Nan.

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,480
You should trust your friends,

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
instead of being jealous.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
and turn into hatred.

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,159
This is the original sin of all your tragedies.

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,480
Zheng Nan.

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,320
We like how you looked 20 years ago.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
Turn around.

92
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
Look at you.

93
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
We hope

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
confess everything

95
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
and start over.

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,640
We're willing to wait for you.

97
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,240
Can we

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
go back to the past?

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Do you remember the day we entered the academy?

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,680
We swore under the national emblem

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,480
we will always be righteous

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,600
and work together.

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,159
Li Jie.

104
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
Ms. Zheng Nan.

105
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,280
[Please come with us to the Public Security Bureau]

106
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Please come with us to the police station

107
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
to be investigated.

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Myung Joo.

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Are you having fun? Are you tired?

110
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm not tired.

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,200
I can play for another day.

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,120
That's amazing.

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,760
Mom I haven't been so happy for a long time

114
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Mom, I want to bring grandpa here.

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Grandpa has recovered.

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,000
Grandpa is discharged,

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
he still needs to recover.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
No hurry.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
Good boy. Take this.

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,880
Thank you, Anle.

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,080
By the way, Xiaojie,

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
my father-in-law has been discharged.

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,440
He already knew about the arc switch.

124
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,960
So, he decided to stop the arc

125
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,760
and establish a new foundation.

126
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,840
What do you think?

127
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,920
Arc attacked so many girls before.

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,560
We'll make

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,360
a charity organization

130
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,240
for women.

131
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,360
and awaken the power in their hearts

132
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,840
so that they won't be bullied anymore.

133
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Great!

134
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,840
What should we name it?

135
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,440
Well, let's call it

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Wake up.

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Awakening is good.

138
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
It's called Awakening.

139
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
Great!

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,840
Why are you here? Didn't I tell you to rest in the hospital?

141
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm fine.

142
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,040
How can I not attend such a big event?

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,680
Help the weak women.

144
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
and promote women's power.

145
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,880
It's not just about you girls.

146
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,120
Should we try hard together?

147
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,320
Mr. Bai is right.

148
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,760
Let's unveil the cards together.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,640
Okay, let's do it.

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:29,960
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,320
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Cultural Media Co., Ltd.
