1
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,600
Son Sun-gun, you're so despicable.

2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
You've been acting like a coward for over ten years.

3
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,560
you've been pretending well.

4
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,720
The prison you mentioned is also my hell.

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,680
Mom.

6
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,800
Myung Joo.

7
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Myung Joo, are you okay?

8
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,200
Mom.

9
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,800
I miss you so much.

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,400
Myung Joo, don't be afraid.

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,039
I'll be out soon.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
Mom, are you thirsty?

13
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,560
I'll get you some water.

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
Didn't I tell you not to come down?

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
Are you deaf or can't you remember?

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,400
Myung Joo.

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,800
Myung Joo.

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,360
Mom.

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,000
Myung Joo.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,720
Mom.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,120
Son Sun-gun!

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,920
Son Sun-gun!

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,200
If you come back, come at me.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
Son Sun-gun.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
Why is that crazy woman quiet?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Why are you bringing her up now?

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
It's finally quiet.

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
Let's not talk about her.

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Mr. Sun.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
I haven't had a good time yet.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
waiting to be eaten by you.

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Mommy, I want mommy!

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,120
Mommy, I want mommy!

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
Stop it.

35
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,320
Mom, I want mom.

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,120
I'll send you abroad tomorrow.

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960
Son Sun-gun, you beast!

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,880
Son Sun-gun, you scumbag! What are you doing?

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,720
Son Sun-gun!

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
Myung Joo.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
Myung Joo, I'm here.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,280
Myung Joo.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,440
Ming Zhu.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Wenshan, are you okay?

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,200
Hang in there.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,240
I've sent someone to save you.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,800
What are you doing?

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,240
I know this place.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,840
Okay, you two go ahead.

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,120
You must be tired.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,280
Are you Shanshan's assistant?

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,920
I heard you were investigated by them.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
I've explained everything.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
It's okay. Don't worry, president.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,040
Good job.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,280
If

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,320
you didn't send back the photos of the contracts,

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,440
I don't know yet.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,080
This unfilial son has done so much evil.

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
This is what I should do.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
Lee, I need to take care of my family matters.

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,000
Get back to work.

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Thank you.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,800
Wenshan.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,960
Grandpa, help Mommy!

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
Mom is locked up by dad.

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Good girl, Myung Joo.

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,760
Where's Mom?

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
The basement.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
Myung Joo, go back to your room.

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,120
I'll go see my mom.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Go back.

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
How did he torture you like this?

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't worry.

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,960
I'll teach that bastard a lesson for you.

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
You unfilial son!

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,440
How dare you

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
behind my back.

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Dad!

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Calm down.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
It's not like that.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,560
It's not like that.

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,400
Also,

84
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
what else do you have to say?

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
You treat Shan like this.

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,440
do you feel guilty to Uncle Wen?

87
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,600
And what's with those contracts?

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,960
You have no conscience.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,720
Wenshan did it.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
So I asked her to come home quickly.

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,080
It's good for her and the company.

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,000
Your dad is not blind yet.

93
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,360
When he was working on this document,

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Wenshan wasn't in the company at all.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Who are you fooling?

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
I have no choice, dad.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
I can't hold on.

98
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
Get out!

99
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
From now on,

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
the Sun's Property

101
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
has nothing to do with you.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,320
Get lost!

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
If you don't leave your business to me,

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,760
Are you leaving it to this outsider?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
You bastard!

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,720
I don't have a son like you anymore.

107
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,480
Get lost!

108
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Fine.

109
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
You finally said it.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,320
It's been so many years.

111
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
I've embarrassed you.

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Do you remember this scar?

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
My mom left.

114
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,760
I went out to find my mom.

115
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
I broke my arm.

116
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,800
What did you tell me the next day when I came back?

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
You said I was incompetent.

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
You said I was weak.

119
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
You said I was useless.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
You said I don't deserve to be your son.

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm incompetent.

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm rebellious.

123
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Today...

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,480
Dad.

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,240
As you wish.

126
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
We're done.

127
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm not your son anymore.

128
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840
What did you say?

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
Say that again.

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,880
You're not my dad either.

131
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
You don't deserve to be my dad either.

132
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,720
What did you say?

133
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
Say it again.

134
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,680
All these years,

135
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,200
If it weren't for me,

136
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
if it weren't for me?

137
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,840
What's wrong with that?

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,440
What's wrong with money laundering?

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,000
It's me, Son Sun-gun.

140
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,200
Not you.

141
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Not you.

142
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Xiaojie, why are you here?

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
Xiaojie go

144
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Why are you here?

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,400
It's not safe here.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,520
You were my best friend 20 years ago.

147
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,240
You saved me 20 years later.

148
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,120
Myung Joo was right.

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,040
You're a superwoman.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,680
You're invincible

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,280
and do everything.

152
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
You are our hope.

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,440
Leave now.

154
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,400
Come with us.

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
No, it's too late.

156
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,320
Go!

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,800
No.

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go.

159
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
Security, get them!

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,280
Stop!

161
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,400
Did she embezzle the Sun family's assets?

162
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
She killed my father.

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Go!

164
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Get her!

165
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,159
She's an accomplice.

166
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
Stop right there!

167
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,440
Son Sun-gun, where are you taking me?

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,320
To see a doctor.

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Where are you taking me?

170
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,400
Son Sun-gun!

171
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,920
Bastard!

172
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,320
You can't hurt Myung Joo.

173
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,840
If you want to see her again,

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,200
just listen to me.

175
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
Sir, follow the car in front.

176
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,760
Anle, come to Sun’s villa now

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
and take Myung Joo back.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,679
And call an ambulance to send the chairman to the hospital.

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Stop right there!

180
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
This is illegal confinement.

181
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
Aren't you afraid of going to jail?

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
She's sick.

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Are you crazy?

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
Try it.

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
You're indeed my good student.

186
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
In just a few words,

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
in just a few words.

188
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
Xiaojie, long time no see.

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,640
Mr. Sun, take Miss Wen in.

190
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,520
Wenshan.

191
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,600
Take your time.

192
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,640
Xiaojie

193
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
Actually, we are saving Wenshan.

194
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,800
Vincent made a prostitution deal

195
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,480
and framed Mr. Sun.

196
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,440
Normally, she shouldn't be sent to a mental hospital.

197
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
She should be sent to the police station.

198
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
I will save Wenshan.

199
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
We're sisters.

200
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
Shouldn't we catch up too?

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,320
On April 25, 2004,

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,400
made me get you.

203
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm so happy.

204
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,760
It still smells so familiar.

205
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,120
Jo Jung-hwa.

206
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
If you want to relive your old dream,

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,920
look forward to our reunion.

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
Let go of me!

209
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm not sick.

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
People who come here

211
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,440
say so.

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,280
You were out of your mind

213
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
and pushed your grandpa down the stairs.

214
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,520
and got seriously injured.

215
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,280
I didn't do it.

216
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
Sun-gun did it.

217
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,360
Those who are not honest

218
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,720
will be punished, Miss Wen.

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
Let go of me!
