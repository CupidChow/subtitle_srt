1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,080
Anle.

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,200
Anle.

3
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,120
I’m Li Anle, the victim of the arc rape case.

4
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Now,

5
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm going to report Son Sun-jun, CEO of Kogwang Media.

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
for the evil deeds he committed to me.

7
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,440
I swear on my life that

8
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
everything I said is true.

9
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,039
That night,

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Son Sun-gun...

11
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,000
and erased all the evidence.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,560
and made me go to hell.

13
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
and fall into the endless hell.

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,080
All I have left is my broken body.

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,039
and a ironic promotion notice.

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,560
Anle.

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Anle!

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
Anle, get down!

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,800
Don’t come over.

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
If you come any closer, I'll jump.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,199
Son Sun-gun destroyed all the evidence.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't do anything stupid.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,800
Living is more important than anything.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,760
Li Yi Ming.

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,440
Do you want me to be a coward like you?

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,640
I can't.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
We can't defeat them.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't want your life to be ruined.

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
That bastard Son Sun-gun...

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,160
He is free and popular.

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
As a victim,

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,520
lost my job,

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,200
but also being criticized by the people.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Even if I die,

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,320
I will reveal the truth.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,880
Son Sun-gun must be punished.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
If you think

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,440
as your daughter,

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,560
In the next life,

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
in the next life.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Anle.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,600
No!

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Anle.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,760
What did I do wrong

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,640
to make Anle hate me so much?

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,440
Twenty years ago,

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,040
I was attacked by someone I respect the most.

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
At that time, I was unjustified.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,680
I was expelled from school.

50
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,120
And I chose to run away.

51
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,200
I've been hiding my identity for 20 years.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,360
for 20 years.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,200
but let Anle go to the same end.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
If I could start over again,

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
you're kicking me, right?

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
I will

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
hurt us again.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Anle! Anle!

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
If this goes on,

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,160
the Navy will drown them.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,560
Anle.

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,640
She was in the swimming school team in school.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,159
Don't worry.

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,400
Get ready for the press conference this afternoon.

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,400
Leave it to me.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,159
Since young,

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,159
I never cared about your feelings when you were bullied.

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,160
That's why you did something stupid.

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,320
Even though I did so many silly things,

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,040
no one cares

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,080
No one cares about right or wrong.

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
No one cares.

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,800
Even if no one cares,

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
I will always be by your side.

75
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,240
I won't let you be bullied again.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,000
Old classmate.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Long time no see.

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
My daughter has grown up.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Not only she looks like you,

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,400
but also what he did.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,400
I forgot to introduce myself.

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm now the legal consultant of Around Media.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,280
Today, on behalf of Mr. Sun,

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,200
on behalf of Mr. Sun.

85
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,720
Mom.

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,400
Here is 200,000 yuan.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
It’s nutrition fee from Mr. Sun.

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
You are so kind.

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,040
Please stop

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,320
to defame Mr. Sun and Armed Media.

91
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
Take the money and leave.

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,520
is your best way out.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,480
Otherwise, you'll lose everything.

94
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Mom.

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,000
You haven't changed for 20 years.

96
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
You're still in a mess.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
You're right.

98
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,480
What can you do

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
what can you do?

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
200,000.

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Not enough.

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't be greedy.

103
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,680
Take your money.

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,440
I've endured it for 20 years.

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,480
for 20 years.

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
I won't hold back anymore.

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Let's go.

108
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,360
Mr. Sun is here.

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,040
Mr. Sun. Can you explain the incident

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,640
Is what Li Anle said true yesterday?

111
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,320
Mr. Sun, what do you think?

112
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Did your company take any measures?

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
Is Li Anle a female artist in your company?

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,560
Mr. Sun, please wait.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,240
Mr. Sun. Will this incident affect his stock price?

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,280
It's very popular online now. What do you think about this?

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
First of all, thank you

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
for your care

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,400
and all female employees.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Now this matter

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
has caused

122
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,200
has caused a very bad influence to society.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
Here,

124
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,680
on behalf of the public,

125
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
I promise to the public

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
I will protect

127
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,200
I will protect every female employee.

128
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,320
I, Son Sun-gun,

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,960
have never done anything to harm women's rights.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
All the truth

131
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
When I find out the truth,

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,120
I will give you a satisfying answer.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
Son Sun-gun.

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,880
It's easy to get you into trouble.

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,440
How does it feel to be exposed in public?

136
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,880
Enjoy it.

137
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,320
You'll be more surprised later.

138
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,160
Give it to me.

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,840
Leave it to me.

140
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Hello, everyone from the media.

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm Sun Sun-gun's wife, Wenshan.

143
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,000
One, two, three.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Swing the sword of law

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,559
and uphold justice.

146
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,600
and get rid of the evil in the mortal world.

147
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,280
and abide by the law.

148
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,200
The press conference today

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
mainly because the group

150
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,400
to discuss what happened recently.

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,600
to express

152
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
to express your attitude.

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
What I want to explain is

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,040
when the video was filming,

155
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,560
I was there.

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,920
It was actually a wrap party.

157
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,360
We drank a few more cups and made a joke.

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880
and made Mr. Sun stand in the middle.

159
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Is the girl in the photo Li Anle?

160
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,400
Are you saying that you encountered Sage Jump?

161
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,920
Then why didn't you call the police?

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,920
The evidence is right in front of you.

163
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
I believe

164
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
you will have your own judgment.

165
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Our lawyer will continue to follow up.

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Some girls

167
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
who don't cherish themselves

168
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
I don't care about myself.

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
and did too much.

170
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
It's not the first time.

171
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
I chose to trust my husband.

172
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
I believe

173
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
I will pay you back soon.

174
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,720
Act.

175
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,840
and clear my husband's name.

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
Is this what you call justice?

177
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,000
You’re a high-ranking student from Lam’s Faculty.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,440
has become a pawn of the evil.

179
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,320
In that case,

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,240
if you're willing to be a pawn,

181
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,280
you must appear on my board.

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
Thank you for your recommendation and approval.

183
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,120
See you at the interview.

184
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,920
Looking forward to meeting you, Wenshan.

185
