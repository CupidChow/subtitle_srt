1
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,039
I'm pregnant.

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
What's with that face?

3
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,680
Are you not happy?

4
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,039
Pregnant is good.

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Pregnancy is good.

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,640
You have to choose between our child and Li Anle.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Of course I choose you.

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
Because Li Yiming and Wenshan

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,120
have been eyeing us.

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,440
I asked her to stay with me.

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,759
Even if I keep her by my side,

12
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,160
Do you know why?

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,960
Why?

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,880
Because Anle is their weakness.

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
You said that.

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Mr. Zhao.

17
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,080
Of course.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
Mr. Zhao.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
To keep you,

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,040
I don't mind using any means.

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,320
How is it, doctor?

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,320
The embryo transplant is successful.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
The baby is growing well.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,960
Congratulations.

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,079
I'm pregnant.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes. It's been three years.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,160
Thank you, doctor.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,160
Then I'll prepare the baby well.

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,960
To fulfill your wish,

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,000
I've suffered so much for you all these years.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,560
When will you understand my feelings?

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
If you knew we were pregnant,

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
would you marry me?

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,920
Anle,

35
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,280
Those projects

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
are very important.

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
We can't stop it.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,880
I didn't stop.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200
I just want to know more about the project.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,080
Who told you I wanted to stop?

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
Zheng Nan, right?

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
She just doesn't want me to be good.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
I see.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Speaking of these projects,

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,640
I haven't seen the contract yet.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
Where did you put it?

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
I want to know more about it.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Anle,

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Don’t worry.

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,400
You'll see these events sooner or later.

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
Okay, I'll get back to work.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,640
Okay, go ahead.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,320
Wenshan,

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
You want to talk about cooperation with me?

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,840
Sure.

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
I want to go to her shadow.

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
You can't go.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Mom.

59
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Didn't you say Jo Jung Hwa threatened Aunt Wen

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
to threaten Aunt Wen?

61
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,640
I want to take this opportunity to join his company.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320
and find evidence to bring him down.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,520
Then I can avenge you and us.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
But it's too dangerous.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Mom, I was born because of your courage.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
I don't want to be only your weakness.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
I want to be your armor too.

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,320
Come with me.

69
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,840
This way.

70
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Mom, you're amazing.

71
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
Why are you so professional?

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,880
I did everything to support you.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Including this.

74
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,520
including stealing a safe.

75
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
is to unlock the door.

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Mom, I'll go out and help you.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,200
Be careful here.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,520
He's not in the office.

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't go in.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Go away. I'll go in to get the documents.

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you want?

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll get it for you.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
No need.

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Get out of my way.

85
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Verification failed.

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
This is your last chance.

87
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,240
I won't let you in.

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,560
You can’t go in anymore.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
Li Anle, are you crazy?

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
I hate you.

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
I don't want you to go into my dad's office. What's wrong?

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
Don't go too far. Move.

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
No, I...

94
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,080
Thank you for reminding me of today.

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,720
On April 25, 2004,

96
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
I got you.

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Jo Jung-hwa.

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm so happy.

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
You beast.

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,520
Miss Wen,

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,920
Why did you ask me out at such a place?

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,520
Vincent is in charge of the Armour.

103
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,000
It’s time to restart our previous project.

104
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,600
Hope we can work well together.

105
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Mr. Zhao, please take a closer look.

106
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,159
This is the termination contract.

107
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Koko doesn't plan to continue with any project.

108
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,159
I invited you here today to get your signature.

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,320
Have you thought it through?

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,360
By the way,

111
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,880
What's the number of the bed you used to live in?

112
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
Number 87, right?

113
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
I forgot to tell you.

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,360
Yesterday,

115
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
your attending doctor called me

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,520
asking about your condition.

117
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,440
Bang.

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,840
No, I...

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
Get out of my way!

120
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Who is it?

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
Mr. Zhao's safe is broken.

122
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll ask someone to fix it.

123
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are you making a fuss?

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Let’s go if it’s fixed.

125
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,680
Stop, Li Jie.

126
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
No!

127
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,280
Li Anle.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,880
What are you doing?

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
Who told you to bring a stranger in?

130
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Take her out.

131
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,240
Li Anle.

132
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Nannan.

133
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,080
Zhao Zhenghua and others are here to steal your company's information.

134
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,960
You just let them go?

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
Didn't you lose the information?

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,640
The point is we know what they want.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
Then why did you keep them?

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
I have my own plan.

139
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,040
It's safer

140
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,400
is safer than disappearing in my sight.

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,400
Jo Jung Hwa, you're always perfunctory.

142
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
What do you want?

143
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,640
Nan Nan.

144
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
All right, calm down.

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Leave these things to me.

146
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Be careful of our child.

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,880
Child?

148
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,920
Do we have kids?

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
I think you care about them.

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
Li Jie, Wenshan.

151
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,200
My good students.

152
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,200
I will destroy you one by one.

153
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.
