1
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,039
Dad, go comfort mom.

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,120
Mom is sad.

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,640
Even you

4
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,880
are lecturing me, right?

5
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,920
Don't look at me like that.

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,200
Don't look at me like that.

7
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,560
Son Sun-gun!

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,600
Bastard!

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Mom!

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
Mom.

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,520
Myung Joo.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,479
Myung Joo.

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm doing my best to protect this house.

14
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,160
It's all for you.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm afraid you'll get divorced.

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,920
I don't want to be a child without parents.

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
When I was tutoring her,

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
when tutoring her.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,680
I asked her for a long time before I said a little bit.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
She's so sensible.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
Where did you get the video?

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
There must be some special means.

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Li Jie.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
You’ve changed.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,079
I'm not who I used to be.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
What about you, Wenshan?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
You know Sun Sun Sun

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,560
You did all the bad things outside.

29
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,960
Now you're insulting Myung Joo.

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,680
Is this the perfect family

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,360
you tried so hard to protect?

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,760
I know it's hard for you.

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,680
But if you still choose to run away,

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
you'll suffer more in the future.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,880
Just like the old me.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
No matter what choice you make next,

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,440
I will keep going.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,520
But if you continue to protect Son Sun-gun,

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,680
I won't go easy on you.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Wait.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,480
Li Jie.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,720
I’m willing to

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
with you.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,720
Wenshan,

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,000
If one day

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
Zheng Nan and I become rivals,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Whose side will you take?

48
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,120
Me.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
Then I must

50
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,079
On the side of justice, I represent the moon.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
I'll destroy you.

52
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,480
Then we're friends again.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,440
The crown

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
shines so brightly.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
What I see now

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
is endless darkness.

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,720
I'll make him shine again.

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
I trust you.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,800
That's why we have to drag Son Sun-gun down first.

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,000
Koko cares about reputation the most.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,200
The investors are about to invest.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
We must seize this opportunity.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
Yes, seize the chance.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Pull him down.

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
and step on him.

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,080
Anle. You help Sun Seon Jun

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,720
from Sun Seonjun’s beautiful beauty.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,840
The audition will begin tomorrow.

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,080
You didn't know?

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,080
What?

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
No one told me about the audition for the new movie.

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Darn it.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,680
Clear all sins.

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm not in the audition for the new movie.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
How despicable.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
The investment meeting is next week.

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
My father-in-law will be there too.

78
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
Let's take this opportunity

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,280
to give Son Sun-gun a good show.

80
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,920
You're so annoying.

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,760
You didn't even tell me about the movie preparation.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,440
Wait.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,440
What audition?

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,280
I made it today.

85
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
Where did I get the audition?

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,560
Fine.

87
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,080
You're the one who stole my role.

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
How can you make a drama?

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,960
The audience is stimulated by the boss

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
and watch a TV drama at home.

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,800
I have to be scared by people like you.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
Please be kind.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,880
How dare you talk about me?

94
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Why did you push me?

95
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
How dare you say that to me?

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
Say it again!

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,400
You bitch!

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
Come on.

99
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,760
Let's talk later. Come on.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Sit down.

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,920
It's not a big deal.

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,840
Why did you come to my office?

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Tell me.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
Did she steal my heroine?

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,720
What do you mean?

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Everyone.

107
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,880
This is

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,960
is our biggest investor.

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,480
Mr. Hu.

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,640
Where's Seon-gun?

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,720
You promised to give me a role.

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,159
You can't break your promise.

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,560
No.

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,760
Mr. Sun.

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,520
You promised me.

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,880
Have you forgotten

117
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,400
Have you forgotten?

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
No. Impossible.

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,280
Impossible.

120
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,360
Come on.

121
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,120
Listen to me

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Well, like this.

123
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,720
Listen to me.

124
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,480
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,360
I

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't have much resources now.

127
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
It only has one female lead.

128
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,720
right?

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,120
Mr. Hu.

130
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Mr. Sun invited us

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
to his office.

132
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay.

133
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Mr. Hu, please.

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,960
Everyone, join us.

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,200
What are you going to do now?

136
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
What you need to do now

137
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
is to reflect on yourself

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,400
to improve your ability.

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,120
right?

140
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,480
It won't take long.

141
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
It won't take long.

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
When I make the old man leave,

143
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
everything

144
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,720
belongs to me, Son Sun-gun.

145
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,560
You can shoot whatever you want.

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,440
Act as the heroine as you want.

147
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,680
Son Sun-gun.

148
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Hello.

149
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,920
You didn't attend the event of so many people,

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,880
but you came here to mess things up.

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,240
and curse me to die.

152
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
I'll break your legs.

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,720
Someone sent a fake message

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,880
and asked someone to audition.

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,960
I have to comfort him.

156
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,560
An audition?

157
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,680
You're really something.

158
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
You always make excuses like that.

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Can't you do something else?

160
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
Calm down.

161
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Give him face.

162
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,680
The priority is the project meeting.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Dad, sit down.

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,160
I'll give you an answer later.

166
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,600
The company is in a serious public opinion crisis.

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
This project

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
is related to the future of the crown.

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
But Mr. Sun

170
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,120
brought us such a big trouble.

171
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
and made us such a fool in front of Mr. Hu.

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
It's not good for the company.

173
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,600
No matter who it is,

174
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,680
shouldn't be in the position.

175
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,640
Wenshan,

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Although Mr. Sun has been following up this project,

177
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,400
it's not a big deal that a project can be established.

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,760
The most important thing is to move on.

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
If Mr. Sun continues to follow up this project,

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,840
it's not a matter of a project.

181
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,400
It's about whether the whole arc can continue to run.

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,560
Seon-gun.

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,400
There are many rumors about the company online.

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Everyone did their best

185
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
to calm down the public opinion.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
That's why the situation is like this.

187
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,800
Wen Shan has made the most contribution.

188
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,760
In fact, Wenshan is one of the contributors in the early stage.

189
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,680
For the sake of our family,

190
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,600
So, I hereby announce

191
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,520

Shut up!
