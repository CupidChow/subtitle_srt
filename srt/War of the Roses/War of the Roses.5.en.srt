1
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,640
I secretly investigated Son Sun-gun's club these days.

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,760
It's very strict.

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,440
We finally got these.

4
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,360
Koko Entertainment used young and pretty girls as baits.

5
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,760
and did too many shameful things behind their backs.

6
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,039
prostitution, illegal money laundering.

7
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
The day Anle was invaded,

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,640
was the day of their sexual trade.

9
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,440
I thought Sun-gun was just flirting with girls at work.

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,120
I didn't expect him to be so dirty.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Son Sun-gun used them to gain resources.

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Some of them volunteered to be promoted.

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,840
but most of them are forced and tempted.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,759
These projects are all like this.

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,960
So the first step we came down

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,320
is to stop these illegal projects

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
and then collect evidence of the black trade of Koko.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,920
It should be hidden in that shady club.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,520
Su’an, Zhou Tian.

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,960
Who asked you to come?

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,640
You are not welcome here. Get out.

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,160
When Mr. Sun was here,

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
no one dared to stop us.

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,520
Miss Wen,

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,240
We signed a contract before.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
We can't stop this project just like that.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,040
We have to stop if there's a problem.

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,040
You can't just stop.

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
We know very well

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
about the pickles.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,440
If you don't mind those media coming,

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
we can stop together.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,040
Are you threatening me?

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,720
Do you think this is a place for you to mess around?

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Just don't do anything you shouldn't do.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
I won't

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,040
these photos.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,520
But if you keep pestering me,

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
and don't listen to the company,

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,360
I can be a bad guy.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,040
As the staff of Arakang,

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
you and the company are one.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
If you keep making trouble,

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
you'll be the only ones who get hurt.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Don't you know

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,560
Don't you understand?

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
Get lost!

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Xiaojie

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,440
The righteous and brave you seems to be back.

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Why are you two here?

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
A toad wants to eat swan meat.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
Look at yourself.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
Who do you think you are?

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
I don't want to play with you.

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,840
You're a loser now.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,800
I was abandoned.

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Does it have anything to do with you?

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,640
I know.

60
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,440
You're just trying to get close to Wenshan.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,800
I was your tutor after all.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,440
I also hope you two can reconcile as before.

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
Vincent is soft-hearted.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
She wants me to tell you

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
she asked me to tell you

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,840
she'll be waiting for you at the club tonight.

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,720
As for whether you can get her forgiveness,

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
it depends on you.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,360
I swear we will live a good life

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Let's make it bigger and stronger.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Son Sun-gun.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,840
I've never doubted your ways to please women.

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,640
But this...

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,440
Not enough.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,360
This is just the beginning.

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,360
Alright, Miss Wen.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,200
Honey.

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,960
Mr. Sun has realized his mistake.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Calm down.

80
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Let's have a drink first.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Mr. Lee is right.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,760
Here, honey.

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,120
Cheers!

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Seon-gun.

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,640
You stay here today

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
in this club today.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Vincent was afraid that you would lie,

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,159
so she asked me to add something in the glass.

89
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,840
Hurry up.

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
If not, the whole Arc

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,640
will no longer be Mr. Sun.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Honey, I told you.

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
Zhou Tian Su’an

94
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
those messy people.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
I swear that we have nothing to do with each other.

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
Who asked you that?

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,640
Those girls are like you.

98
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,440
I’m asking Li Anle.

99
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
What did you do to her?

100
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,920
I told you that too.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,520
She set me up.

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
She wants to get promoted.

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,960
She's a lower class.

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,600
When a lower class takes the chance,

105
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
he climbs up desperately.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Shut up!

107
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,800
Who are you to talk to Miss Wen?

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
Get lost!

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
Wait. Wait.

110
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,840
What’s your relationship with Li Anle?

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,600
Li Anle is my daughter.

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
Look.

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,440
She wants to mess with me.

114
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Fine.

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Since you want to know so much,

116
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,640
Honey, I’ll tell you what happened that day.

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
That day,

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,040
with me that day.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
But I was drunk.

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,400
Then Li Anle

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,440
she slept with me.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Just a business meeting?

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
What evidence do you have?

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,240
My contract is on the table.

125
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,560
The billiard hall, right?

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,040
We have all your evidence

127
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,360
in this club.

128
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
We just don't know where they are.

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,200
Thank you for your guidance.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,520
Xiaojie, thank you for today.

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,920
We collected so much evidence

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,320
Yes.

133
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,200
What did you put in his cup?

134
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
Bubble slices.

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
Just poke his psychological defence.

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,640
Sure.

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,920
Brother Zhao.

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
What should I do now?

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,800
I was careless that day.

140
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,440
But if they really got the evidence,

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
I...

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I have to go in first.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Mr. Sun,

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,560
how important

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
is to us.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,640
how important it is to us.

147
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,600
How could you make such a stupid mistake?

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,840
Brother Zhao.

149
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,640
Look.

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,120
You're the founder of Red Circle Law Firm,

151
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,840
and a well-known figure in Lin City.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
This time,

153
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
you have to help me.

154
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,799
Go ahead.

155
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,039
if Wenshan exposes those contracts,

156
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,200
you and I...

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
Family affairs?

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,039
It does give me a headache.

159
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,240
I raised many birds.

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,440
I've only kept this bird for three months

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,720
You've been married with Wenshan for over ten years, right?

162
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Over ten years?

163
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
Didn't you recognize anyone?

164
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
It's not like that.

165
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
I...

166
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,040
My dad liked her.

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,160
He only cares about the shares.

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,640
If you were me,

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Domesticator is boring.

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,000
It's useless if you don't tame me me.

171
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,240
Mr. Sun.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
Your cage

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,720
can't stop Wenshan's ambition.

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,360
You'd better make a decision early.

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Don't let her ruin our plan.

176
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,040
If you can't do it,

177
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I can help you with the housework.
