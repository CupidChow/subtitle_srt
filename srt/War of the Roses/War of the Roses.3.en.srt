1
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
Honey, listen to me.

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
Honey, you...

3
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,840
Honey!

4
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,200
Honey, let me explain.

5
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,640
Mrs. Sun.

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,160
The live video just now was very exciting.

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,320
Is Mr. Sun's behavior

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,960
violating female subordinates?

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
Mrs. Sun, how do you feel now?

10
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
Which stage are you on?

11
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,800
Here's the thing.

12
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,840
We were auditioning just now.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,200
Is there any new drama in Koko Entertainment?

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,200
Koko is preparing a new drama.

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,759
It's about a couple.

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,600
Perfect.

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,240
There's a character

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,440
who suits my wife very well.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,280
So,

20
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,080
I asked her to have a try.

21
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,520
Mrs. Sun, was it really an audition?

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Yes.

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,560
And my husband's scene

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
Great.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Okay.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
We can't tell you more today.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
When it's released,

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,320
I'll let you know.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,079
Okay.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,040
Wenshan.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Your acting is also good.

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
Myung Joo.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,280
Myung Joo.

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
Go upstairs and take a rest.

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
I have something to talk to Mr Yi Ming.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Go ahead.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,640
What should I call you?

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
Li Yi Ming.

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,960
is also my college classmate, Li Jie.

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,680
Wenshan.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,120
Long time no see.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,800
You've been hiding in my house.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600
What do you want?

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm just here to see my old classmate.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
I want to see

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,360
living in a rich family these years.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
It's been 20 years.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Is this how you treat me?

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
Now I see it.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
Satisfied.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you want?

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
I just wanted to ask.

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,880
You knew the truth about Son Sun-gun,

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
why are you still defending him?

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
This is not like you.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
It's none of your business.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
This is my life.

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Are you going to ruin me because your life is ruined?

60
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
What happened back then has nothing to do with me.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,000
No one can find me.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Twenty years ago,

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I treated you as my closest friend.

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Now I'm standing in front of you.

65
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,640
You just thought I was going to take revenge on you.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,120
I once asked you

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
if I did something wrong,

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,640
you would choose justice to destroy me.

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,920
And now, Son Sun-gun...

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,920
You know everything he did.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
Why are you still protecting him?

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm not protecting Sun Sun Sun Sun.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
but my dignity.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,080
How sincere you were 20 years ago,

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,600
how sincere you are now.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I don't care what you do.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,840
But if you hurt Myung Joo,

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
I won't let you go.

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,040
Let Myung Joo live in a family like this.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
and let her have such a terrible father.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
Do you think she's happy?

82
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,280
You think you're a good mother, right?

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,880
Unfortunately,

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
You're not.

85
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,880
This is your reward for this period of time.

86
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Take the money

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
and leave my house.

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,920
will you continue

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
your fake perfect marriage?

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,720
False perfection is also perfect.

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,720
I will try my best to protect my perfection

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
and maintain my dignity.

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,000
Go.

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't want to see your face anymore.

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
Hello, everyone.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm XIN Lu.

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,200
I know you're worried about me

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,440
after seeing the news yesterday.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
About yesterday's video,

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
What I want to say is

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,120
it was just a audition.

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,560
There's no sexual harassment and no grey trade.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,120
I think those marketing accounts are so good at rhythm.

104
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,880
Let me kowtow to you.

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,600
Please let me go.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,080
What's more ridiculous?

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,159
I want to get involved in the relationship between Mr. Sun and Mrs. Sun.

108
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
Do you know how loving they are?

109
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,360
I eat their dog food every day.

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,040
Why would I want to break them up?

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
So I hope you can be rational

112
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,880
Don't be used by others.

113
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,440
and be their navy for free. and fight for them.

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
All right. Dismiss.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
I've said everything.

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,760
If I keep talking, those marketing accounts will get into trouble again.

117
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Lastly,

118
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm sorry for making you worry.

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,960
Bye.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Love you.

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
Well done.

122
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
I've already

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
according to

124
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
as you requested.

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
My photos...

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,120
Photos

127
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,600
are in this USB.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,080
This is the only copy.

129
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,120
Mr. Zhang.

130
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,600
Ms. Jang.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,320
Isn't the event over? Where's Myung Joo?

132
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,920
The event was already over.

133
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,240
She was already picked up by your family teacher.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Family teacher?

135
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,880
I think her surname is Lee.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
I heard Myung Joo call her Miss Li.

137
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,200
Li Jie.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,760
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

139
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,760
[Please try again later.]

140
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Li Yi Ming.

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,960
If you dare to hurt Ming Zhu,

142
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
I won't let you go.

143
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,640
Myung Joo.

144
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,280
Myung Joo!

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
Why are you here, Myung Joo?

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Tell me. Why are you here?

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,720
Are you hurt?

148
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
How did you get hurt?

149
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Li Jie.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
Are you crazy?

151
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
What did you do to Myung Joo?

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,480
Mom, Ms. Lee didn't do it.

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
Ms. Lee didn't do it.

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Myung Joo, don't be afraid.

155
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
Who else could it be?

156
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,360
You won't feel pain if you don't get hurt.

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,840
You hit me like crazy

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,280
you hit me like crazy.

159
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
But have you ever thought

160
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
when you see your daughter

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,320
being attacked,

162
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
and almost died in front of myself.

163
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
in front of me?

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,960
What are you talking about?

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
What daughter was assaulted?

166
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
If your life is ruined,

167
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,760
you will destroy

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,040
and my daughter?

169
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
Li Jie.

170
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
What are you doing?

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
Li Anle.

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,280
She’s my daughter.

173
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
I beg you.

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,480
You're kicking me, right?

175
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
So back then,

176
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
you had Anle.

177
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
But with her,

178
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
I have to protect her.

179
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's see Myung Joo first.

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,040
Myung Joo.

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
Tell me.

182
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,560
how did you get these injuries?

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,920
It's dad.

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
Dad.

185
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
No way.

186
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,640
He's a father.

187
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,400
How could he hurt his daughter?

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,120
It must be you.

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
You taught Myung Joo to say that, right?

190
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,440
See for yourself.

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,200
