1
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,039
I'll take you home.

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,960
No need.

3
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,880
I'll go back by myself.

4
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,640
Okay.

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,039
Be careful.

6
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,120
I'll take you to the car.

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,840
Okay.

8
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,320
Why can you be together

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,600
you can be with Mimi?

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Enough.

11
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Darn it.

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,080
Let's stop here.

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,160
Go back.

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,080
Are you crazy?

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Can't you calm down?

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
Calm down.

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,720
Li Yi Ming.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,440
What are you doing?

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,240
Li Yi Ming.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,960
Calm down.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,920
Can't you calm down?

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
You only care about your daughter.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,840
Our child.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,680
It's not a child.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
Li Yi Ming killed our child.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
Nan Nan, can you listen to me?

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
That child is also my child

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,760
It hurts me too.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
But I care about you more.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,560
You know?

31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,440
In broad daylight,

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
in broad daylight.

33
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,520
you'll go to jail.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,520
You can sacrifice everything for me.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,040
We want to destroy everything.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
This is revenge.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
You need to hit her seven inches.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,560
Only by ruining everything of her

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,160
is the real revenge.

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,400
If you hit her to death,

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,600
she'll be lucky, you know?

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
What should I do?

43
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
Tell me.

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Arale Entertainment

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
is their trump card.

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,320
We must defeat Arc Entertainment.

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,640
Have you ever thought that

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,640
after they lose everything,

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
after losing everything.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,120
And they're like rats crossing the street

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
Everyone is shouting.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
Aren't you good?

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,560
That's revenge.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,640
Koko.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,640
There's something I want in your safe.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,560
Can I borrow it?

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay.

58
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,720
What?

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Zheng Nan is crazy.

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,400
How dare he hit you?

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Someone set me up.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
She thought I caused her miscarriage.

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
She's pregnant.

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,480
Someone called me that day.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,640
saying that he had evidence of Karang and her.

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,720
But when I arrived at the garage,

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,040
she was already in trouble.

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,040
And that person gave me an empty USB.

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
One more thing.

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,320
She has a special relationship with Jo Jung-hwa.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
If she was pregnant,

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
she should be Jo Jung Hwa's child.

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
But I found out yesterday that

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,160
Jo Jung Hwa lost his ability to give birth a long time ago.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
So,

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,000
the one who doesn't want the child to be born

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
is Zhao Zhenghua.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,080
Miss Wen.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
I came without an appointment.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,080
Did I scare you?

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Jung Yul, I don't think

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,480
between us anymore.

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,400
Are you afraid that the creditors will come after you?

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Zheng Nan, just say it.

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
We're not beating around the bush.

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
So straightforward.

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm here today to tell you

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,600
none of you will be punished.

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,840
By the way, Miss Wen,

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
did you say goodbye to your daughter this morning?

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
And you, Li Yi Ming.

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,520
Where is your daughter, Li Anle?

93
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,520
What are you doing to her?

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
Come at me.

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,320
Don't touch the child.

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,040
Child.

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
You killed my child.

98
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,360
I will make you

99
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,560
and all of you.

100
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,360
You may not believe me,

101
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,040
I still have to tell you

102
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
I didn't do it.

103
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,360
It doesn't matter.

104
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,080
I don't want to hear your explanation and your apology.

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
I want to see you guys dying.

106
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,440
The karma is coming.

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Wenshan, we are from CSRC.

108
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
We received a report from her film fund

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,760
about the fabricated accounts.

110
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Please help us with the investigation.

111
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Impossible.

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,640
They took over this project before.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
Not me.

114
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,000
But...

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
the financial report provided by her Film Fund is fine.

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,560
Please come with us.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Please cooperate with our investigation.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,960
Zheng Nan, it's you again.

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,240
Miss Wen, I used to be the legal advisor of Luguang Media.

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,800
Dragging you into this

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,360
That's simple.

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,720
Shameless.

123
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,159
I'll take good care of Luguang Media for you.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,640
Zheng Nan.

125
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,400
What are you doing?

126
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,800
Since the stock price of Taoguang Media has decreased,

127
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,280
as one of the partners of Arakang Media,

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,560
Of course.

129
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll take over at the bottom price.

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,120
How dare you!

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,880
Please.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Miss Wen, please.

133
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,920
Wenshan.

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Take care of yourself.

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,760
You two are really sisters.

136
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,680
Li Yi Ming, the next one is Li Anle.

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,920
Who are you?

138
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
Who are you?

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,880
Hello, who are you looking for?

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,960
Mr. Zheng.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
What a rare guest.

142
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,880
Zheng Nan, what did you do to her?

143
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,800
Come at me.

144
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,680
Don't hurt my daughter.

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
You deserve it.

146
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,920
Unfortunately, I don’t have Li Anle.

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Otherwise, I’ll let her die with my child.

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,920
Who else could it be?

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
What did you do to her?

150
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,680
Li Jie.

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
You deserve it.

152
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,200
When you asked someone to hit me,

153
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,160
why didn't you think of this day?

154
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
Zheng Nan.

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,640
If you dare to hurt my daughter,

156
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,440
I promise

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,200
in despair.

158
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,919
in despair.

159
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,720
My baby is gone.

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
Confession.

161
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,440
Li Anle.

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,760
I will find you.

163
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Daughter.

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,880
My daughter.

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Anle.

166
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,160
My good daughter.

167
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
My daughter.

168
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,720
I have a daughter.

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,160
Why?

170
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,800
Doctor, why?

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,600
In your case,

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
is very common.

173
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,760
You should take care of yourself.

174
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
and be flexible.

175
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,560
Yes, Doctor.

176
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,000
Fortunately, please report the report.

177
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
Don't worry, no one will know.

178
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,280
Okay, don't worry.

179
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,960
Thank you.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Jo Jung-hwa.

181
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
Where am I?

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
This is your home.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
Don't be scared.

184
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
You're crazy.

185
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,000
Let me go home.

186
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
I want to go home.

187
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,040
Anle.

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
There are too many bad people out there.

189
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,000
I can only guarantee your safety

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
can I guarantee your safety.

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,760
You can't go anywhere.

192
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
