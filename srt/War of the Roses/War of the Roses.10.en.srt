1
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,720
And today, her photography and Arale reached a cooperation.

2
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,200
Mr. Zhao.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,840
When did you sign the contract?

4
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Why didn't I know?

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,080
There's something important that I didn't tell you.

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
(Zhejiang) Co., Ltd.

7
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,160
I also want to tell you

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,920
(Zhejiang) Limited.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,160
There is

10
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,960
I also want to tell you

11
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,960
Zhejiang

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Zhejiang.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,039
Those are some major projects that were displayed before.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
The cooperation with Koko will continue.

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
Jo Jung-hwa, you forced me to sign the contract

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
to continue your plan

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,240
Or are you afraid that your bad things will be exposed?

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,680
I have the evidence of Son Sun-gun's crime.

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,720
Culture Entertainment.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,360
His signature.

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,360
Culture Entertainment.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
I want to change him to your name.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
to change him to your name.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,400
Why don't you promise me

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,479
or I'll send you to jail.

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
Think carefully.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
Shameless.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:03,920
Limited Company.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:05,760
The name of Hangzhou.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,479
Her goal is also the direction of her shadow development.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,680
Nanlim Company, Hangzhou name.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,720
Limited company.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
to promote the power of women.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Company.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Let’s work together.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,320
OK. Let’s welcome Vincent with applause.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,240
Wait a minute.

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Aunt Wen.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,600
Aunt Wen.

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Anle.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,840
Anle!

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
Stop!

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,600
If you stop me from seeing her,

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
can you stop me for the rest of my life?

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Jo Jung Hwa, I won't let you.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Promote the power of women.

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Stop right there!

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
I won't let you!

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,320
Get lost!

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Anle.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,600
My daughter

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
I wish you were with me.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm glad Jo Jung Hwa didn't do anything to you today.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,520
He just threatened you to sign her.

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
He'll be suspicious later.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,120
He'll have his back.

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
But Myung Joo and I...

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,120
are much better.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,640
As long as I'm here,

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
I won't let him succeed.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
Wenshan, you've changed.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
This is the real you.

63
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I didn't expect

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,720
we would stand together again in this way.

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
You know what?

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,520
Ever since you became Myung Joo's teacher,

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
I have a feeling

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,640
my life might change a lot.

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,720
I just didn't expect it to change so much.

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
If it were a few weeks ago or a few days ago,

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
I might still blame you.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,040
You ruined my life.

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,840
But now I just want to thank you.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,880
You gave me courage to be a new person.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,560
Thank you, Yi Ming.

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,600
You're welcome.

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Just like 20 years ago,

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
like 20 years ago.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Anle.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,720
Rock, paper, scissors.

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
You're already here.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
We'll go back now.

85
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Okay.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,680
Myung Joo, come home with me.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Bye.

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Bye.

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Jo Jung-hwa.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Anle, didn’t your mom tell you anything?

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Shut up!

93
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
Tell me what.

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Anle, I’m your dad.

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
It’s not funny at all.

96
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm telling the truth.

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
What is he talking about?

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,280
Anle.

99
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,480
Didn’t you say mom has been running away?

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
It's all because of him.

101
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,120
He is your biological father.

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
I did love your mother.

103
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
But for various reasons,

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,600
because of various reasons.

105
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,960
But you've seen everything I have now.

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
I can be a qualified father.

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,040
So,

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,000
please come back to me.

109
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,280
Zhao Zhenghua.

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
I’m warning you. Don’t touch her.

111
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,160
Anle.

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Our past has become the past.

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,480
But you are my only daughter.

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,920
I can give you everything.

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,680
You know?

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,600
Anle.

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
Take this.

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
By the way,

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,880
Anle, besides these,

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
I can give you safety.

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,600
As long as you and your mother come back to me,

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,480
no one will dare to bully you.

123
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,760
For example, Son Sun-gun.

124
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
If anyone dares to bully you again,

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
I will make him pay for it.

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,920
So Son Sun-gun...

127
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,840
You asked him for help.

128
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Do you know

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,159
the day Son Sun-gun bullied me,

130
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,200
he was there too.

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,680
But I didn’t know you were my daughter.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,880
I did that for you.

133
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,840
For me?

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
For me?

135
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,960
you're working with a bad guy who took part in bullying me.

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
What's the point of winning?

137
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Yes, I know you're doing this for me.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
But I don't accept this result.

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,360
I know it's hard to fight for justice for myself,

140
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,000
but I can’t give up my dignity for justice.

141
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Anle, no one hurt your dignity.

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Your mother chose to work with me.

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
to work with me.

144
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,120
Because only I can provide you with safety.

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
Trust me.

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,640
Jo Jung Hwa.

147
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Stop your sweet talk.

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,560
Leave!

149
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,360
Anle.

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,280
I know I came here abruptly.

151
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,960
You can think about it calmly.

152
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
When you've made up your mind,

153
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
when you've made up your mind.

154
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,680
Go away.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,600
So how did you get together with him?

156
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,520
She won't tell you.

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.
