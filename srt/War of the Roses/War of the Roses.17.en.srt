1
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,039
She acquired Arakang.

2
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,120
We will work together

3
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,000
and create glory together.

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,680
Arc,

5
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
You finally belong to me.

6
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,320
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,240
When I can expose my weakness to you,

8
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,160
it proves your importance to me.

9
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,200
The acquisition of Luguang

10
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,720
is all thanks to you.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
I have a gift for you too.

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,320
Take good care of him for me.

13
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
We're family.

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,039
Can you believe

15
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,720
Can you believe it?

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,600
You don't believe me?

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I've prepared a celebration party for you tonight.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Enjoy me.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
Sure.

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,760
How do you want me to enjoy you?

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,120
Is something bothering you?

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,400
For the past 20 years,

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
I've been thinking every night

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,640
when I can be your wife.

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,800
Isn't it good now?

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Psychological partners are more noble than marriage.

27
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,280
An unstable relationship will always lead to betrayal.

28
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,960
Are you threatening me?

29
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,160
How many dirty things have I done for you in the past 20 years?

30
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,800
I have only one wish.

31
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,000
to be your wife.

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Zheng Nan.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,560
Mr Zhou Chuan.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's get married.

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Or kill me.

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,200
Or I'll go to hell with you.

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Let's try on the wedding dress tomorrow.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me be your wife.

39
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,960
I'll help you with the rest.

40
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Okay.

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,840
The marriage property and insurance notaries.

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
Is everything done?

43
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Once the other party dies,

45
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
you can have the money and compensation.

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,400
Then get ready.

47
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Is it clean?

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay.

49
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Honey.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,800
Coming.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,840
Honey.

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,200
Am I pretty?

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,400
Would it be inauspicious

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
if I wear a black wedding dress?

55
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
No.

56
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,120
You are my black swan

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Nannan,

58
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
You can never be my White Swan.

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,400
It's good to be a black swan.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,960
Unfortunately, the black swan can never perform on my stage.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll choose a clean way for you

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll send you to the stage where you should go.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,800
Okay.

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm coming down now.

65
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,440
How is it?

66
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Didn't we just acquire Around Media?

67
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
We have a lot to deal with.

68
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,720
I know.

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Don't tire yourself out.

70
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,960
Look.

71
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,560
I bought your favorite iced coffee

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
to relieve your fatigue.

73
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Thank you, honey.

74
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Nannan

75
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,800
Nannan

76
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,960
What's wrong?

77
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,600
Are you okay?

78
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,560
I'll get you some water.

79
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Honey.

80
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I don't want to drink water.

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't sleep well last night.

82
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Honey.

84
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
I've been dreaming a lot lately.

85
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,640
I dreamed that we went on an island trip with our kids.

86
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
I dreamed of us

87
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Nannan

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
I know you've been too tired lately.

89
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

90
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Honey.

91
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Honey, don't go.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
Nannan, do you still feel dizzy?

93
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,000
Have some coffee

94
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,679
Do you know

95
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,360
why I brought you here today?

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,200
This is the villa we're about to complete.

97
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,360
It's also my wedding gift for you.

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,760
Let's go in and have a look.

99
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
What do you think?

100
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,800
Honey.

101
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,360
I think I heard a kid crying.

102
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
I think I heard it too.

103
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,080
Baby.

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
Baby.

105
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Mommy is here.

106
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
I'll take you home.

107
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,480
Honey.

108
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,040
Look.

109
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,200
Our baby is smiling at us.

110
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,920
Let's take him home, okay?

111
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay?

112
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Let's go home.

113
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
Baby.

114
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Baby.

115
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Cultural Media Co., Ltd.

116
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Cultural Media Co., Ltd.
