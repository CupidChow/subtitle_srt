1
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,360
This is the one I saw at the auction.

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
I saw at the auction.

3
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,400
I know you like it.

4
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,560
so I bought it for you at a high price.

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,600
Honey.

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,280
You did a great job at the press conference today.

7
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,039
at the press conference today.

8
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Good job today.

9
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,479
When we were filming,

11
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,840
I was there.

12
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
I’m Sun Sun Sun Jun’s wife, Wenshan.

13
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,960
Is the girl in the photo Li Anle?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,640
You mean

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Did you run into Sage Jump?

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
Jewels suit my wife better.

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,200
I asked you to find Myung Joo's family teacher.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
How did it go?

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,120
Hello.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
Are you Mr. Li?

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm here to sign the contract with you.

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Li Yi Ming.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
You look like someone I know.

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
What a coincidence.

25
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,040
You have a good resume.

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
I hope you won't let me down.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Wenshan.

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,440
You're amazing.

29
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
Why are you so professional?

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,600
As a mother,

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I can do anything for my daughter.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,079
Wenshan is having a dinner tomorrow.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
Sun-gun is alone at home.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,320
You mean...

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,200
Wenshan has a perfect home for herself.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,760
But we...

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,080
tear her gorgeous shell apart

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,360
Let them see

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
inside.

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,640
Didn't you work at the Arc Centre?

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,320
He likes Swallow.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,360
Tomorrow,

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,040
prepare a big gift for him tomorrow.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,240
Coming.

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,680
Why are you here?

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Mr. Sun, I miss you.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
I heard your wife is not home.

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,079
so I came to see you.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,080
Thank you, Mrs. Sun.

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,080
You're welcome.

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
It's on the way.

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,640
But you're good at educating kids.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,480
In the past,

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,560
quite experienced.

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
I don't have any experience.

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,320
Maybe it's fate that brought me here.

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,440
Thank you, Mr Yi Ming.

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Yi Ming.

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,080
Your name sounds so nice.

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
I have a college classmate too.

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
She has the same last name as you.

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,880
I think I left my key in Myung Joo's room.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,120
It's not too late.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
There's still some time before the dinner.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
I'll take you home.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Thank you.

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
Who's here?

68
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,480
Honey, why are you back?

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Seon-gun.

70
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,800
Aren't you going to work today?

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Why are you home?

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Take a shower.

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm not feeling well, so I slept a little longer.

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,400
I want to take a shower and go to work.

75
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,760
Miss Li

76
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Wait a moment.

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
I'll go find the key.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,320
What's wrong, honey?

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,200
You use two bath towels?

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,640
No.

82
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,640
Just now

83
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,080
The water pipe leaked.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
It's full of water.

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,680
The window is full of water.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,120
Look, it's all water.

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
It's on the floor.

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,320
Look.

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,320
Mr. Li.

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,320
Let's go.

91
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Nothing happened at home.

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,560
The water heater is broken.

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Mrs. Sun.

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,040
Is this yours?

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
I picked it up on the stairs.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
It's not mine.

97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
I think the housekeeper dropped it.

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
It's okay. Let's go.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Mrs. Sun.

100
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,560
This is the latest model of Kelin.

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you sure the housekeeper dropped it?

102
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,760
Should we ask Mr. Sun?

103
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
Mr. Li,

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,000
I want you to focus on Myung Joo's teaching.

105
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
As for the rest,

106
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,000
about other things.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I just heard that

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,280
Mr. Sun and his wife are very close.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,880
So I think

110
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,960
the gift Mr. Sun bought for you.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
I've found the key.

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
I took a taxi.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,520
I'll go back now.

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,760
Wenshan.

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,440
wearing Mrs. Sun's perfect mask.

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,120
to maintain a harmonious family.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,720
Is this the happiness you want?

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I want the star shape.

119
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
Mr. Li, right?

120
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,760
It's okay. Go on.

121
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay. Go on.

122
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,840
Go on.

123
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,200
Go on.

124
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,600
Mr. Sun.

125
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,320
Mr. Sun ordered the wine.

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Why are you so slow today?

127
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,840
Send it in.

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Go on.

129
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,120
Mr. Sun, you...

130
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,920
Go on.

131
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
Mr. Sun.

132
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,800
I have a reading meeting tomorrow.

133
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,080
I'll go back first.

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Have fun.

135
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Did I let you go?

136
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,280
Lu Xin.

137
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Don't think that the investors like you.

138
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
she can also act.

139
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,320
She can also act.

140
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,160
It's all about me, Son Sun-gun.

141
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Then let's sing together.

142
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,400
No, I...

143
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,080
Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun.

144
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,640
Mom, happy birthday.

145
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,640
This is a birthday surprise from dad.

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,360
Mrs. Sun.

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Mr. Sun asked me to take you upstairs.

148
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
This way.

149
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,960
Mr. Sun, another new face.

150
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Aren't you afraid

151
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
Aren't you afraid your wife will find out?

152
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Let me tell you.

153
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
The money of Sun Group

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,960
was earned

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,960
I earned every penny.

156
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,560
is me, Son Sun-gun.

157
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
I earned every penny.

158
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,000
I can spend it

159
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
I want.

160
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,080
Pick them up.

161
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,360
Pick them up!

162
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
We have enough money tonight.

163
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
let alone money,

164
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
Sun Group

165
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
of Sun's Group.

166
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
Son Sun-jun.

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Who are you going to give your wife to?

168
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,720
Honey.

169
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,160
You're finally here.

170
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,520
Have a seat.

171
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
I've been waiting for you.

172
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,680
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

173
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,400
