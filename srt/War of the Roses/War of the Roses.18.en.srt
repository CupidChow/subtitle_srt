1
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,560
Nannan

2
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,640
Just go with the kid

3
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,640
Pour the soil into the lake in the villa area.

4
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Did you drink?

5
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,960
Honey.

6
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160
Let's go home and play.

7
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Don't you like this the most?

8
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,640
Let's go home and play.

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
Get lost!

10
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Get lost!

11
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,079
Jo Jung Hwa!

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
Calm down.

13
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,560
Zheng Nan won't listen.

14
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
Darn it.

15
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
Honey.

16
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,920
You don't like me anymore?

17
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,640
Honey.

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,040
Honey.

19
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
Don't you like me?

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Let me show you our baby.

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,079
The baby wants the dad to hug.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
Honey.

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,840
Come on, honey.

24
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,920
Zheng Nan doesn't listen.

25
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Darn it.

26
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,800
I hope you have a good life

27
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,640
and find a good family.

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,200
Honey.

29
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Honey.

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Zheng Nan.

31
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,079
Zheng Nan.

32
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
God bless me.

33
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,640
Bodhisattva, please bless me.

34
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,440
Don't come to me again.

35
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,720
Don't come again.

36
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,640
I'll burn more paper

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,760
and burn more incense.

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Honey.

39
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,960
Please bless me.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,000
Please.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
Don't come to me again.

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,240
I beg you.

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Please bless me.

44
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,760
Honey.

45
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,160
Please...

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Don't come to me again.

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,200
Please.

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,159
As the founder of the first Red Circle Law Firm in the city,

49
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,440
Mr. Jo Jung-hwa,

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,840
not only did he contribute to the legal field,

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,280
but also gained popularity

52
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,440
with the business resources

53
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,400
and become a famous entrepreneur.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,280
Next,

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
let's applaud for Mr. Jo Jung-hwa's speech.

56
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,159
to share his success password.

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Actually, I don't have any successful password.

58
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,440
From college teaching to my law firm,

59
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,360
Then I'll enter the cultural and entertainment industry.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,640
The password to success

61
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
may be just a phrase of my life.

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
Then this sentence

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,680
When I was teaching in college,

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,800
my students must remember.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,440
That is justice.

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,080
and get rid of the evil in the world.

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,760
and upright.

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,200
and uphold justice.

69
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,080
This is the password to my success.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Honey.

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Honey.

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,520
Koko.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,000
I did make some mistakes before.

74
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,680
Honey.

75
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
Don't come near me!

76
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Honey.

77
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,040
It's such a grand occasion.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
Why won't you let me and my child join?

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
Are you a human or a ghost?

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,120
Of course.

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
Your wife...

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Impossible.

83
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
I pushed you into the river myself.

84
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,520
I watched you drown.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,840
You pushed me into the river.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,720
Jo Jung-hwa.

87
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,680
How does it feel to expose your crime?

88
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,440
I have a question.

89
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,360
If you confess your crime,

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,440
Can you reduce your sentence?

91
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Sure.

92
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,120
Zheng Nan.

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
How dare you frame me!

94
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
I set you up?

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
You killed me.

96
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
You're a barrister.

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,720
You killed your wife.

98
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
and your wife's baby.

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,640
I really want to say

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Take a look.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,920
How dare you stand here?

102
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,600
What is justice?

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,120
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,360
I think you are the most disgusting evil in the world.

105
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
No way.

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,840
How could there be a mistake?

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,160
Jo Jung-hwa.

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,520
Do you think you're smart?

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
When you were ready to do it,

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,040
we were already watching your clumsy performance.

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
What?

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,840
I will make those who hurt me

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,680
for hurting me.

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Not enough.

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,000
I want Jo Jung Hwa to be destroyed at the most glorious moment.

116
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,640
We can cooperate.

117
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
What is it?

118
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
I'll help you defeat Zhao Zhenghua.

119
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
You help me collect evidence of Arakang and her shadow.

120
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,920
Deal.

121
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
Mr. Zhao.

122
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
You acted so hard.

123
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
How can I not help you?

124
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
Unfortunately,

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,240
everything you did

126
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,200
is under our control.

127
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,400
Let's try on the wedding dress tomorrow.

128
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
Let me be your wife.

129
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll take care of the rest for you.

130
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,960
Have you finished the notaries

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Is everything done?

132
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,640
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

133
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Once the other party dies,

134
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,200
the property and compensation will be yours.

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,680
Don't worry.

136
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
Let's get ready.

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Is it clean?

138
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Colorless and odorless.

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
We have plenty in our hospital.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,240
Okay.

141
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay.

142
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm coming down now.

143
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Put it in the cabinet No. 7.

144
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't give it to me face to face.

145
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,080
What?

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,640
Isn't it ironic, Ms. Jo?

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,320
You designed a flawless murder.

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,240
Two students who are inferior to you

149
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
who are far inferior to you.

150
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,440
Li Yi Ming.

151
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
Do you think our professor

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,400
smart or stupid?

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,400
I'll treat him in his own way.

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,640
He's very smart.

155
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
But you deserve it.

156
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,800
You deserve it.

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
That was foolish.

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,960
Honey.

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
The medicine in the coffee

160
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
was replaced by Li Yi Ming long ago.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
What?

162
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,880
Yumo Pictures (Zhuhai Hengqin) Culture Media Co., Ltd.
