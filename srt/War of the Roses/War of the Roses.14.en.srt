1
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
Nice shot!

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,080
Why are you here?

3
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,560
Zhao Zhenghua, let me tell you.

4
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Is she here or me?

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm not here.

6
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
You know my personality.

7
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,960
I know everything in the safe.

8
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,080
I have a way to make you unhappy.

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
You've grown up, right?

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
You've learned to threaten me.

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Nan Nan.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,320
We've been together for more than ten years.

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,320
Over the past decade,

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,440
you've done a lot for me.

15
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,039
You're too anxious.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Just remember that you're pregnant with our child.

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,720
Our relationship

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,640
between us.

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,360
I asked my assistant to prepare for our wedding.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,320
Really?

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,040
Of course.

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,680
I've been too busy lately.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,840
Let's get married after this.

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Marriage?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
What about Li Anle?

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,079
Listen.

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
Didn’t I tell you?

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,920
even if she is a vase,

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,200
even if she’s a vase.

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
Then she won't be able to make any trouble.

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
She is also a tool for Li Jie and Wenshan.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,040
Understand?

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
I'll trust you for the last time.

35
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,480
All right. You've had a long day. Go back.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,160
Give me a hug.

37
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Good boy. Go back and have a good rest.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,880
Go.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,440
There are so many disobedient people.

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay.

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,480
Let you

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
balance each other.

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
Do something for me.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,560
So you want to recognize her

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,800
because you can’t give birth.

46
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Li Jie.

47
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,920
Li Jie.

48
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,040
You’re awake.

49
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,920
How is my baby?

50
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,320
You're still young.

51
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
You'll have a baby.

52
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
My baby is gone?

53
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
Doctor.

54
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
Please save my baby.

55
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
He's still moving.

56
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
Save my baby.

57
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,120
He's still moving.

58
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
Don't be too sad.

59
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
Have a good rest.

60
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,840
I must kill you, Li Jie.

61
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,560
Kid,

62
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,040
I hope you can have a good life

63
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
and find a good family.

64
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,040
Mr Zhao.

65
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
Why are you still here?

66
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,840
I want to explain to you.

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Sure.

68
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
If you want to explain,

69
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
please explain

70
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,600
what happened yesterday morning.

71
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,520
I hate Zheng Nan.

72
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,840
I did all this for her.

73
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,480
Really?

74
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
I know she's in charge of many contracts in the company.

75
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,920
I want to get the contract and mess with her.

76
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
and kick her out of this company.

77
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,960
Get rid of her.

78
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Dad.

79
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,799
What did you call me?

80
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
I hate Zheng Nan.

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
She always gets between us.

82
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,159
She doesn't want us to be together.

83
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,640
If we can kick her out,

84
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,400
we can really be together.

85
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,360
Our family?

86
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
You still call me dad?

87
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Then you know everything

88
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,160
what happened between me and your mother.

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
Do you mind?

90
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,760
To be honest, I do.

91
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,600
But I can't change what happened in the past.

92
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,960
I have half of your blood.

93
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
That won't change anything.

94
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,280
I also thought

95
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,760
I also thought about it.

96
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,000
But instead of thinking about the past that can't be changed,

97
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,800
you should cherish the present.

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
After all, in the past 20 years,

99
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,680
I sincerely hope

100
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
I can have a father.

101
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,040
Do you know?

102
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,720
That's what I mean.

103
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,880
Let bygones be bygones.

104
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,160
Just remember

105
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I love you.

106
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Of course.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
I love your mom too.

108
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,600
Here.

109
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
Good boy.

110
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
It would've been nice if you had listened to me.

111
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,440
I'll prepare a nice place for you.

112
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
to keep you by my side forever.
