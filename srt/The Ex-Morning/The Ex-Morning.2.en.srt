1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,073
If this jerk is still on the show,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,046
I’m out!

3
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:06,206
The footage of you throwing coffee on Tae is everywhere.

4
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:08,200
The whole country is cursing you out.

5
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,486
You have to create a new show.

6
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:13,813
I’ll have you meet the producer for your new show.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,633
If I have to work with him,

8
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,106
I’d rather quit.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,650
I heard the sponsor
is going to sue you for tens of millions.

10
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,153
If you sell your sports car and condo,

11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,576
you should be able to fight the lawsuit.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,973
I’ve decided.

13
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:27,600
I’ll agree to work with him,

14
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,140
but I have one condition:

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,973
We’ll only talk about work.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Oh.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,646
Hello, Professor.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,866
Have a seat.

19
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:40,886
Thank you.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,726
In the class that you missed the other day,

21
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,913
I asked everyone to pair up to make a news report clip.

22
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:51,366
All your classmates have already paired up.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,993
Does that mean I have to work alone?

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,366
No, another student was also absent that day.

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
Who?

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,260
That’s your partner.

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,226
You’re in the same faculty.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,920
You might know him a bit.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,433
Shall we sit over there?

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah.

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,840
So, any ideas yet, Nai?

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,793
You’re calling me Nai?

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,486
You don’t have to be so polite.

34
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:39,600
That’s too formal.

35
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:40,346
Polite?

36
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,373
I just called you Nai.

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
I think

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,720
I want to do an on-site news report.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,836
I want to go to a location and do interviews

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,493
about a topic that students are currently interested in.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,953
Great idea.

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,586
We could discuss the education curriculum.

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,840
Let’s discuss ghosts in classroom buildings.

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,873
I heard

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,546
the one at the Thai House on campus is really scary.

46
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,936
People are really into that right now.

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,053
No!

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,286
That’d be too much like a ghost show.

49
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:16,280
Let’s do this instead.

50
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:18,373
We’ll bring students in for interviews at a studio.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,926
Mmm.

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,320
Let’s talk about deep-rooted problems in education.

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,393
What?

54
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,413
How nerdy.

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,940
No, your topic is too serious.

56
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,926
We’re journalists.

57
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:33,753
We have to tackle serious issues.

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,180
Your topic is too lighthearted.

59
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,026
We can make an entertainment news report.

60
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,726
People want to know if there are really ghosts there.

61
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:42,320
Discussing the education system in depth?

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,636
Three words about that and people will fall asleep.

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,740
Have you ever seen a ghost?

64
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,500
No.

65
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:48,526
See?

66
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,373
We need to do a deep dive and find out if they're real.

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,420
We can talk about this later.

68
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,446
Let’s go.

69
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,810
Where are we going?

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,200
To eat. I’m hungry.

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
Let’s think about it while we eat.

72
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,226
Come on.

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,093
Hi.

74
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,526
Can I have five grilled pork skewers with fat?

75
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,153
Have you ever had them here?

76
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,273
This place is so good.

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,380
I only eat the ones without fat.

78
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,433
How can you even eat the ones with fat?

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,460
They’re so greasy.

80
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,200
What do you know?

81
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:29,926
The ones without fat are just dry meat.

82
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,140
The fatty ones are way better.

83
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,933
The ones without fat taste way better.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,346
And they’re healthier too.

85
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,549
The ones with fat are better.

86
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:37,420
The ones without fat.

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,326
The ones with fat are better.

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,389
The ones without fat are better.

89
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:40,066
The ones with fat.

90
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:40,673
The ones without fat.

91
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,533
The ones with fat are better.

92
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:42,000
The ones without fat.

93
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,633
The ones with fat are better.

94
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,100
The ones without fat are better.

95
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:43,446
The ones with fat.

96
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,306
Let’s go with my idea.

97
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:45,266
Mine is clearly better.

98
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,193
What’s good about your idea?

99
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,460
What’s good about yours?

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,760
The info is too serious.

101
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,646
Mine has in-depth information.

102
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,700
That kind of depth will make people fall asleep.

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,773
Hey!

104
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:54,793
Stop.

105
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,933
What’s going on here?

106
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,120
We’re proposing ideas for the new show.

107
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,720
I want to do interviews on topics people care about

108
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,546
by going on-site and interviewing the locals.

109
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:09,733
Ah.

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,173
That’s interesting.

111
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,313
Tell me more.

112
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,553
There’s nothing to tell.

113
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,140
He’s just going to interview the locals
like every other channel.

114
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,480
Let me ask you.

115
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,973
Does interviewing farmers about environmental issues

116
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,382
in a studio sound interesting to you?

117
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,549
That’s like a university assignment.

118
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:22,780
My topic is much clearer.

119
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,693
So what?

120
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,386
He wants to interview…

121
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,406
Stop.

122
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,066
Figure it out between yourselves and let me know.

123
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:30,873
Okay?

124
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,880
But Yong, trust me.

125
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:32,946
His idea is so boring.

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,966
Enough.

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,466
I’ll give you a week to settle this.

128
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,586
If you can’t, then just go your separate ways.

129
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,075
You won’t listen to me.

130
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,180
How is your idea better than mine?

131
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,035
Why don’t you trust me at all?

132
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:45,575
In-depth info?

133
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:46,375
What?

134
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,508
There are so many cups.

135
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,311
- Why are you taking mine?
- Just give it to me.

136
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:50,335
Trust me for once.

137
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,285
What’s wrong with you?

138
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,468
I told you it’s not going to work.

139
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,641
Why didn’t you agree with me first

140
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,068
before talking to Yong?

141
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:01,895
We were both standing there, arguing.

142
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,315
Phi, don’t be stubborn.

143
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,095
“Phi, don’t be stubborn”?

144
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,108
Tell me honestly.

145
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,135
Hmm?

146
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,545
Why did you come back?

147
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,281
To work, of course.

148
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:27,368
That’s a weird question.

149
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,905
There are so many other news stations.

150
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,748
What do you really want?

151
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,148
Who am I talking to?

152
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,525
Huh?

153
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:48,415
Why do you want to know about me?

154
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,225
I thought we’d only talk about work.

155
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,148
This is about work.

156
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,101
You’re the reason my job is a mess.

157
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:57,975
If it weren’t for you,

158
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,035
I’d have filmed 10 episodes of my new show by now.

159
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,628
Think what you want.

160
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,448
But if your idea is bad,

161
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,335
I won’t let it slide.

162
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,121
I won’t let yours slide, either.

163
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,775
Here.

164
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:10,875
Two spoons of coffee,

165
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:12,421
two and a half sugars, and one cream.

166
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,755
You’re the only one this picky.

167
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,275
(You’re watching Good Days.)

168
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:47,768
(I’m Tae. Let me help you with the forecast.)

169
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:50,055
(The weather is so hot right now.)

170
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:52,528
But don’t let your head

171
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:55,321
get as hot as the weather, guys.

172
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:56,408
Hot, my ass!

173
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,335
Ah, it’s hot!

174
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,588
You want to work separately?

175
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,201
Yes, Professor.

176
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,148
We don’t really see eye to eye.

177
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,495
Let each of us work on our own.

178
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,521
Yes.

179
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:04,068
But you’ll be evaluated on teamwork for this subject.

180
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,021
I have an idea.

181
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,288
If you can’t come to agreement,

182
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,575
why don’t you settle it my way?

183
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:37,355
What’s up?

184
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,241
I want to talk about work.

185
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:47,088
Okay.

186
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:51,065
If we can’t come to an agreement,

187
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:54,915
why not settle it Professor Jui’s way?

188
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,181
Professor Jui?

189
00:10:58,305 --> 00:10:59,035
Are you saying you want to…

190
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,068
Yes.

191
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:01,921
You and me…

192
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,775
Let’s each make a demo for the show to settle it.

193
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,155
That’s fair.

194
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:14,828
Whose demo Yong chooses, we’ll go with their idea.

195
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:17,701
One more thing.

196
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,628
Whoever loses

197
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,641
will have to do everything the winner says.

198
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:33,895
Hey.

199
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:44,921
What?

200
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:46,521
Are you scared of me?

201
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,095
You should keep up your image, Mr. Reporter.

202
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:58,985
Deal.

203
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:01,448
You and me…

204
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,255
This should be fun, don’t you think?

205
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:11,855
ST PERMSIN MARKET

206
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,941
Okay. We’re just in time.

207
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,075
We’re almost late, thanks to someone.

208
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,948
Stop whining.

209
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,315
My car’s in the shop.

210
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,755
Besides, we were heading the same way anyway.

211
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,548
How much longer are you going to keep reversing?

212
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,301
Stop complaining.

213
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:39,735
This is not my car.

214
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,881
It’s Yong’s.

215
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,095
Where’s your car?

216
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:47,701
It’s in the shop.

217
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:49,581
You’re a bad liar.

218
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,755
You sold it to survive, didn’t you?

219
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:53,615
What do you mean?

220
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,135
I told you we wouldn’t talk about anything personal.

221
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:01,401
Done.

222
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:02,765
Let’s go.

223
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,168
Have you read the script?

224
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,201
Yes.

225
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,475
I think we should touch on capitalism too.

226
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,421
It’s better than just asking how well they sell.

227
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,275
I just asked if you’ve read it.

228
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,515
I didn’t ask for your opinion.

229
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:42,821
Let’s go.

230
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:43,848
Hold on.

231
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,735
You haven’t had breakfast, have you?

232
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,575
You don’t want to get ulcers again.

233
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:48,885
Here.

234
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,128
Just take it.

235
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,815
I’m doing my job as your producer.

236
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,768
Only two skewers have fat.

237
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,308
That’s all I could find.

238
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,341
I don’t eat fat anymore.

239
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,508
It’s unhealthy.

240
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:28,925
Hello, Ju?

241
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,208
Okay.

242
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,961
Hurry up and eat.

243
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,335
Everyone inside is ready.

244
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:47,995
Hurry up and follow me.

245
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:51,601
Hey, wait!

246
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:52,615
I’m scared.

247
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,728
Junior.

248
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,328
Yes?

249
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,608
Is the equipment ready?

250
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:00,468
Yes.

251
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:01,835
Have you briefed the locals?

252
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,155
Yes, I have.

253
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,788
Are you sure you’ve briefed them properly?

254
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:25,741
Yes.

255
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,735
You can go in.

256
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:41,101
So, let’s ask how the sellers feel right now.

257
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,581
How’s your business?

258
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,908
No interview!

259
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:44,655
I’m here to sell stuff!

260
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,015
Stop blocking my stall!

261
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:46,588
Go!

262
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,461
Shoo!

263
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,268
Get out! You’re scaring my customers away!

264
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,035
Why are you still here?

265
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,501
Get out!

266
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:54,475
What do you sell?

267
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,761
I’m here to buy.

268
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,788
Oh.

269
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,248
Are the economic problems

270
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,245
making stuff more expensive?

271
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:02,675
Yes.

272
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,381
And how do you feel about that?

273
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,401
Bad.

274
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,055
What kind of support do you need?

275
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,788
Just make the economy better.

276
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,508
How’s business today?

277
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Let’s go.

278
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,655
Did she not hear what I said?

279
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,501
How’s business?

280
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,648
How can my business be good?

281
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:34,595
The market is so quiet.

282
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,361
You think my business will be any good?

283
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,475
Hey!

284
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,215
You’re the reporter who threw coffee on someone, right?

285
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:41,775
Huh?

286
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,508
Why are you so violent?

287
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:44,601
Leave!

288
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,621
Leave!

289
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:46,935
Leave!

290
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,408
Get out!

291
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:49,155
Leave!

292
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,081
You’re not helping my business!

293
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,355
How did you even brief them?

294
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:00,948
I did brief them.

295
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,201
Did you tell them

296
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:04,588
I was coming to help with the slow economy?

297
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,575
Oh, I had to tell them?

298
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:16,435
- How could you not tell them?
- Phi.

299
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,195
That’s basic information.

300
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,341
We didn’t get any usable footage.

301
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:20,355
How are you going to take responsibility for that?

302
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,501
- Hey, Phi.
- I’m sorry.

303
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,181
Calm down.

304
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,248
He didn’t know.

305
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:25,581
Go get ready.

306
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:26,944
We have a lot more to shoot in the afternoon.

307
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:27,545
Go.

308
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:29,895
In the meantime, go talk to them more, Ju.

309
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:30,921
Hurry.

310
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:33,811
If any stall doesn’t want to cooperate,

311
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,055
then we just won’t film them!

312
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:36,541
What’s with their freaking stern faces?

313
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,201
I’m here to help.

314
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,195
Why do they even care about my scandal?

315
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,975
They should care about their own lives.

316
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,428
I’m not surprised this is all they have in life.

317
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:45,741
(Phi!)

318
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,045
What?

319
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:06,715
I’m sorry!

320
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:07,275
I’m sorry!

321
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,408
I’m sorry!

322
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,435
Go away!

323
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,635
I’m sorry!

324
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,081
Go away!

325
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:30,828
Get out!

326
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,881
Hold on!

327
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,875
What’s wrong with you?

328
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:37,048
Let’s talk nicely.

329
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,168
I thought you were better than this,

330
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:41,165
but you really turned out to be a jerk.

331
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,021
It’s not like that.

332
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:43,535
I…

333
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:44,911
So what if this is all we have in life?

334
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,041
You bully reporter!

335
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,245
Here!

336
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:54,905
Take this!

337
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,615
Serves him right!

338
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:58,688
Right, guys?

339
00:18:58,715 --> 00:18:59,841
Hmph!

340
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:06,881
Easy.

341
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,635
Please calm down, guys.

342
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:09,675
I’m sorry.

343
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,928
I’m sorry, everyone.

344
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,208
I’m the show producer.

345
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,888
If my reporter said anything bad, I’m sorry.

346
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:20,855
I’m really sorry.

347
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,341
I’ll be more careful next time.

348
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,515
He has hives.

349
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,241
When he’s moody, he doesn’t think before he speaks.

350
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,341
I’m sorry.

351
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,501
I’m really sorry.

352
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:32,528
I’m sorry.

353
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,888
He’s all emotion!

354
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,045
Let’s go, guys.

355
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,475
Here.

356
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,315
I’ve already washed this.

357
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,335
You can use it.

358
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:34,828
I’m fine.

359
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:35,848
You should wipe yourself.

360
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,355
I didn’t ask you to do that.

361
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,801
I haven’t said anything.

362
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,621
I was just doing my job as your producer.

363
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,068
Go take a shower and leave.

364
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,128
I don’t want to owe you for too long.

365
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:23,868
Hold on.

366
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,868
Whose condo did you bring me to?

367
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,548
Mine.

368
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:36,708
Why are you still standing there?

369
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:37,735
Come on!

370
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:11,995
Did you just move in?

371
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,515
This place looks empty.

372
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,135
That’s none of your business, Mr. Producer.

373
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:19,981
Go take a shower.

374
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,055
The bathroom is upstairs.

375
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,001
Sorry.

376
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,068
I’m used to not wearing clothes right after a shower.

377
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:44,421
You don’t mind, right?

378
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:47,695
Why would I mind?

379
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,161
What would I mind?

380
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:50,655
You worry too much.

381
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:52,665
Good.

382
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,441
It’s probably all in my head.

383
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,115
I saw your ears turn red.

384
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,441
What do you mean?

385
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,055
Why would my ears turn red?

386
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,701
You’re the one whose ears turn red when you get shy.

387
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,901
How much longer are you going to stay like that?

388
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,015
Give me some clothes then.

389
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:21,845
Hey.

390
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:25,941
This is our anniversary T-shirt.

391
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,015
I can’t believe you still have this.

392
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,295
Yeah.

393
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,615
I was going to throw it away today.

394
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:36,455
Take it. It’s cluttering my closet.

395
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,455
Do you have plans to sell this place?

396
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,301
You should get a good price.

397
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:20,648
Hey!

398
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,868
What are you doing?

399
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:22,561
Give me that!

400
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,608
Give me a moment.

401
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,555
Let me see the view.

402
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,275
You don’t need to.

403
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:25,895
Give me that!

404
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:26,928
What’s the problem?

405
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:37,248
What?

406
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,548
Don’t get the wrong idea.

407
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:41,295
I bought this place because I like it.

408
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,581
It had nothing to do with you.

409
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,661
I haven’t said anything.

410
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:51,495
Give me that.

411
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:04,028
TAE TREENAT JARUSAKKUL
WEATHER REPORTER

412
00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:08,508
I should go.

413
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:11,661
Let’s talk about my demo on Monday.

414
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:16,355
Wait.

415
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,495
Are you free tomorrow?

416
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,365
I want you to work on your demo right away.

417
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:38,015
FACULTY OF JOURNALISM AND MASS COMMUNICATION

418
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:45,695
There are so many studios out there.

419
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,701
Why are we using this one?

420
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,335
We’re making two demos

421
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:51,835
on just a 10,000 baht budget.

422
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:54,421
We can’t afford to rent, only borrow.

423
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,035
We’re lucky Professor Jui let us use this place.

424
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,285
It’s still the same as before.

425
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:16,441
The education system,

426
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:17,904
FIRST YEAR OF UNIVERSITY
which focuses on making Thai kids memorize

427
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:19,201
rather than apply what they learn,

428
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:23,208
has been in place in Thailand
from primary school through university.

429
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,941
Today, we’re discussing these issues

430
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,201
and interviewing a student to get his opinion.

431
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,261
Phi.

432
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,085
Phi.

433
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,988
First, please introduce yourself.

434
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,968
Hi. I’m Phubet Hongfuengfa.

435
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:45,748
I’m studying at the Faculty of Liberal Arts.

436
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:51,141
And this is the voice of

437
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,768
one of the directly affected farmers.

438
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:57,101
Thank you, Mr. Kornprom and Dr. Prachaya

439
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:59,095
for the discussion today.

440
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:00,148
Thank you.

441
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,268
We’re out of time.

442
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,568
See you next time.

443
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:05,595
Bye.

444
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:09,128
Cut!

445
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:10,155
Perfect!

446
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:17,315
Today’s footage is so good.

447
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:19,001
I think Yong will like it.

448
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:21,915
You think?

449
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:23,775
Of course.

450
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,185
The copying will be done in half an hour.

451
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:45,035
Hey, Phi.

452
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:46,221
Huh?

453
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,248
Come and see this.

454
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:50,361
What?

455
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:52,608
Just come.

456
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,268
It’s the legendary Thai House.

457
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,288
Remember it?

458
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,895
Alright, everyone.

459
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:12,928
Follow me.

460
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:17,181
We’re at the Thai House on campus.

461
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:20,115
Many students are saying

462
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:22,301
they’ve seen a Thai dancer at night,

463
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:26,755
coming out to dance
and scare the students walking by.

464
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,137
Today, we’re finding out the truth together.

465
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,101
I’m Padtaphi Sinan.

466
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:32,141
Let’s go.

467
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:37,595
It’s so eerie here,

468
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,181
but I haven’t seen anything unusual yet.

469
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,681
Let’s go inside.

470
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:50,235
Hey!

471
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:51,415
What’s that?

472
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:52,448
What?

473
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:53,545
It’s a plant pot.

474
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,361
I was scared.

475
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,895
Come on. Let’s keep going.

476
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,008
There’s a shadow!

477
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:13,675
I’m not falling for it this time.

478
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,075
It’s just the shadow of another tree.

479
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:18,588
Oh, shit.

480
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:19,615
That’s a security guard!

481
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:27,108
Did he see us?

482
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:57,135
Come on!

483
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:00,175
He’s gone.

484
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:01,495
He’s gone.

485
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:03,415
Damn.

486
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:05,325
That was close.

487
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:09,701
Hey.

488
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:11,281
Hey.

489
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:11,808
Hey.

490
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:12,835
Shit.

491
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,655
Who’s dancing?

492
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:16,888
Someone’s dancing outside.

493
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:17,915
I’m serious.

494
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:20,308
There she is!

495
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:21,068
There she is!

496
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:21,895
- Look!
- What?

497
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,041
Just look!

498
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,515
She’s not a ghost.

499
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:25,881
It’s all in your head!

500
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:27,728
It’s not!

501
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:28,875
Damn it!

502
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:30,295
Let me see.

503
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:30,955
Look!

504
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:31,975
There!

505
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:34,281
Am I right?

506
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:34,941
Who’s dancing?

507
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:35,508
Let’s find out.

508
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:36,535
Wait!

509
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:37,855
I’m scared now.

510
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:39,308
You can’t stay here forever.

511
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:39,695
Let’s go!

512
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:40,081
Hold on!

513
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:40,915
I haven’t braced myself.

514
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,075
Just do it now!

515
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:43,441
Are we really doing this?

516
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,041
Yes! Aren’t we here for this?

517
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,141
Alright, let’s do it.

518
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:47,688
Good.

519
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,268
I’ll count to 3.

520
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:50,648
Once I say 3, run.

521
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,101
Okay.

522
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:51,588
Good.

523
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:52,235
1.

524
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,625
2.

525
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,065
3.

526
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:55,675
Go!

527
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:56,455
Run!

528
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,595
Run!

529
00:30:57,845 --> 00:31:00,341
It turned out to be a student dancing to fulfill a vow.

530
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:03,175
I told you ghosts weren’t real,

531
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:04,621
but you didn’t believe me.

532
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:05,848
Such a chicken.

533
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:08,681
You’re so annoying.

534
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,241
Hey!

535
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,281
What the hell was that?

536
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:14,508
Is the door broken again?

537
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,135
Oh.

538
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:22,441
Let go of me.

539
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:23,908
Oh, sorry.

540
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:28,961
You two seem as close as ever.

541
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:36,588
What happened was quite serious.

542
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,995
But I trust you no matter what, Phi.

543
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:43,501
I’ve been telling your juniors at the faculty

544
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:45,268
that you’re not like that.

545
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:46,601
Oh, Professor.

546
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:48,795
He’s not like that.

547
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,795
He’s even worse than that.

548
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:54,255
Just kidding.

549
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:59,908
You know, I still keep the file you sent me.

550
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:00,655
Do you want it?

551
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,655
Oh, Professor.

552
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,621
You should throw it away.

553
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,981
How could I?

554
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,455
It’s the work of my famous student.

555
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:09,508
I’m blushing.

556
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:14,761
I’ve always thought you two are so successful

557
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:17,955
because you fill in what each other is missing.

558
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,688
You should love each other a lot.

559
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,061
Don’t separate.

560
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,375
This is cool.

561
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,741
The professor gave us the clip we sent her.

562
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:52,755
I miss it so much.

563
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,808
Do you want it?

564
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:55,841
If so, I’ll…

565
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:57,855
Are you okay?

566
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,395
I don’t want it.

567
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:02,775
You keep it.

568
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:05,905
You sure?

569
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,515
Then we can split up here.

570
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:12,175
No need to give me a ride.

571
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,208
I’ll go now.

572
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:14,435
Wait.

573
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,605
You still remember our deal, right?

574
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:36,795
That the loser must do everything the winner asks?

575
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,815
Yes.

576
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,077
You’re taking it that seriously?

577
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:46,148
If you lose,

578
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:54,645
can you resign from Good News?

579
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,595
Because if my demo gets the green light,

580
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:07,935
that means I can work on the show myself.

581
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:12,755
I won’t need you.

582
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:22,575
Okay.

583
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,468
If I lose,

584
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:36,915
you’ll never see my face again.

585
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:43,401
Are you okay with that?

586
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,115
FINAL PROJECT - PADTAPHI X TAMTAWAN

587
00:35:57,515 --> 00:36:01,235
FINAL PROJECT - PADTAPHI X TAMTAWAN 2.MOV

588
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,808
Actually, both of your demos

589
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:58,935
are good in different ways.

590
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,735
So whose work are you going to choose?

591
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,395
Mmm.

592
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,135
Tam.

593
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:10,955
What?

594
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,508
Your demo is backed up with lots of information.

595
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,375
But…

596
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,828
Your presentation is so boring.

597
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:21,035
Sit down.

598
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,735
You see, news programs these days

599
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:28,621
are almost like TV dramas.

600
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,288
The audience wants the truth,

601
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,441
but it has to be more entertaining than that.

602
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:36,108
As for you, Phi.

603
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,141
Yes?

604
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,228
Going on-site is an interesting idea.

605
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,675
Oh, thank you so much.

606
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:45,141
But it’s no different from what the other channels are doing.

607
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:47,275
Sit down.

608
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,148
You didn’t get all the footage

609
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,931
and you even got chased away by the locals.

610
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:53,861
If you keep going like this,

611
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,695
would the locals even let you interview them?

612
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:57,505
Got it.

613
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:00,901
So neither is good.

614
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:01,548
Mmm.

615
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,288
Whose work are you going to choose then?

616
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:06,941
I’m choosing this one.

617
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:08,761
Look.

618
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:13,501
Right now, we’re at a place
rumored by the students to be…

619
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:14,521
Hold on.

620
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,295
Did I accidentally send you this file?

621
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:19,275
Yes.

622
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:22,928
Thank you for showing me something.

623
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:34,668
Right now, we’re at a place rumored by the students

624
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:37,495
to be haunted by a really scary ghost.

625
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:42,321
They say a worker died here

626
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:44,715
and that you can see the shadow of their soul

627
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,415
walking around at night.

628
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:48,561
So, today,

629
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,475
I, Padtaphi Sinan,

630
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:55,935
am going to find out if this place is really haunted.

631
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:57,468
Come on. Let’s go.

632
00:38:58,965 --> 00:38:59,748
Hey!

633
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:00,208
What?

634
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:00,755
What?

635
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:01,361
What is it?

636
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:01,988
I saw a shadow.

637
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:02,741
What shadow?

638
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:03,315
I don’t know!

639
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:03,901
Where did it go?

640
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:04,701
That way.

641
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:05,141
Come on.

642
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:05,881
Let’s go.

643
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:06,901
Let’s go.

644
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:11,988
Guys, I saw a shadow.

645
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,288
I think it went into that room.

646
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:15,721
Who knows?

647
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:19,928
That might be the shadow
of the construction worker who passed away.

648
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,395
Come on.

649
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,275
Hey!

650
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,361
The door is open.

651
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,695
It must be in this room.

652
00:39:33,535 --> 00:39:35,268
Come.

653
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,068
There’s a shadow inside.

654
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:42,881
There really is.

655
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,375
Hey.

656
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,675
What do we do?

657
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,421
There really is a shadow in there.

658
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:48,355
Are we going in?

659
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:49,388
We are?

660
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,375
Let’s go!

661
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:59,735
There’s a shadow there.

662
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:00,908
Come on.

663
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,361
Hey.

664
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,108
What shadow is that?

665
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:14,481
What shadow is that?

666
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:15,281
What should we do?

667
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:16,495
Do we keep going or stop?

668
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:17,995
Should we leave?

669
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:19,515
We should keep going?

670
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,281
Let’s go.

671
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:26,295
What?

672
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:27,415
What’s wrong?

673
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,775
What?

674
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:44,288
So the shadow we see late every night
is not a ghost,

675
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,368
but a group of students coming in
to use the computer for editing?

676
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,475
That’s right.

677
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,115
We’re really sorry for scaring you.

678
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:55,175
Can you tell us why you do that?

679
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:58,481
Uh, we don’t have personal computers to work on,

680
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,708
and the university computers are always fully booked.

681
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:07,881
That means the university doesn’t have
enough computers to meet students’ needs.

682
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:14,555
This is another reflection of a problem
that needs to be solved at the university.

683
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:18,245
(Cut!)

684
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:19,681
(Wow! Amazing!)

685
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:28,181
This clip has shown me

686
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:32,008
that both of you are good in different ways.

687
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:38,781
You made the right decision to make a third clip.

688
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:42,141
It’s clear you’re good in different ways.

689
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:46,361
One of you is good with the information,

690
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,201
strong in in-depth details.

691
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,815
The other is strong in on-site presentation.

692
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:54,761
The rest is just combining your ideas together.

693
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:57,301
Let’s use Tam’s ideas

694
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,461
to present the farmers’ problems

695
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,455
in detail and with intensity.

696
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:05,788
As for the presentation,

697
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:07,681
use Phi’s ideas.

698
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,701
Okay.

699
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:12,148
Go into the field, on location,

700
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:13,301
and talk to the locals.

701
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:14,255
That way,

702
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,815
you two can make perfect work.

703
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,395
Don’t you think so?

704
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:23,268
That’s your new format of the show.

705
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:27,315
I hope you won’t disappoint me.

706
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,455
We won’t.

707
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:37,495
Mmm.

708
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:55,145
Hmm?

709
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,135
What?

710
00:42:58,168 --> 00:42:59,168
My treat.

711
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:01,968
You’re acting weird.

712
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:04,835
Hey.

713
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:07,108
I only eat the ones with fat.

714
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,848
Look carefully.

715
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:10,688
Any more fat than that,

716
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:12,115
you might as well be drinking lard.

717
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:15,228
You know me so well.

718
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,175
Do you want to team up with me?

719
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:23,201
Huh?

720
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:24,945
What did you say?

721
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,188
Do you want to team up with me?

722
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:30,248
Oh.

723
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,941
No wonder you’re acting weird.

724
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,248
You’re trying to buy me with pork skewers, huh?

725
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:35,835
Does it work?

726
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:36,861
No.

727
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,208
Give me that too.

728
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:50,495
So sweet.

729
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:57,665
Good idea.

730
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:58,815
But…

731
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,815
I’m looking for a partner
to make clips for contests.

732
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:04,435
If you really want to team up with me,

733
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,665
do you want to work together long-term?

734
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:09,585
Sure.

735
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:11,528
I’ll help you.

736
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,461
So cute.

737
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,595
You’re so cute.

738
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:20,148
You’re exaggerating.

739
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:28,005
Here.

740
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:33,541
The ones with fat sold out,

741
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:35,535
so I bought the ones without.

742
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:38,195
But I heard you don’t eat fat now.

743
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:44,395
Here.

744
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:50,615
Are you going to eat it or not?

745
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:52,348
If not, I will.

746
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,235
Mmm.

747
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,388
Hey!

748
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:01,655
So much for pretending you didn’t want it.

749
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,241
Tell me honestly.

750
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:24,615
Why did you come back?

751
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:32,015
I thought we’d only talk about work.

752
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,821
This is about work.

753
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:37,481
If I had to work with you long-term,

754
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:39,261
I’d need to know.

755
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:47,341
I want my show up on a billboard like that.

756
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:53,724
You want your show to be on a billboard?

757
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:54,748
Yeah.

758
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,521
And I only want you

759
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,028
to be the one who makes it happen.

760
00:46:02,995 --> 00:46:03,995
Good.

761
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:06,335
We have the same goal.

762
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,301
But first,

763
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:25,135
you should take Tae’s face down.

764
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:29,245
Agreed.

765
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:31,388
He’s not even handsome.

766
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,535
He looks like a mountain goat, don’t you think?

767
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:36,648
Are you bullying him?

768
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:37,995
No, I’m just stating facts.

769
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,028
Look at his face.

770
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:44,015
I’m going to take his face down no matter what.

771
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:32,541

DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

773
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:41,041
Thank you, Tamtawan.

774
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:44,388
Whoa, if you're going to call me by my full name,

775
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:45,431
why don't you say my father's name too?

776
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:46,295
Suradech.

777
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,321
Chaowalit.

778
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:48,521
Somsak.

779
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:48,941
Somchai.

780
00:47:48,968 --> 00:47:49,968
Tam.

781
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,081
That’s not my father’s name.

782
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:53,541
Tam is my nickname.

783
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:56,975
No.

784
00:47:58,305 --> 00:47:59,895
I’m going to call you Tawan.

785
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:02,875
Whatever you want.

786
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:03,948
You can call me anything.

787
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:06,348
Cheers.

788
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:09,921
Here’s to teaming up.

789
00:48:10,275 --> 00:48:11,028
Go.

790
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:11,535
Cheers!

791
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:12,175
Hey!

792
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,428
You splashed it on me!

793
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:15,441
Sorry.

794
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:17,001
I’ll go clean myself.

795
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,021
Wait.

796
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:20,175
Come here.

797
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:25,715
Doraemon’s magic item.

798
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:28,461
Let me wipe it off.

799
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:04,188
I heard that

800
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:06,995
one reason no one wants to work with Padtaphi

801
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:08,688
is that someone turned them against him.

802
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:09,828
How about this?

803
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,295
If he agrees to work under me for a week,

804
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,248
I’ll let my team help him.

805
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:16,215
How is it?

806
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:18,335
Does it still taste the same as before?

807
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,041
It’s late.

808
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,201
Wanna do something fun?

809
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:25,285
Ouch!
