1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:01,697
That’s just who Phi is.

2
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:04,053
He loves his things and he’s possessive.

3
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:05,443
Once he loves something,

4
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:07,013
he doesn’t change his mind easily.

5
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:08,353
Tam,

6
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:10,344
don’t let go of Phi’s hand.

7
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,381
Then…

8
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,733
why are you helping me?

9
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,733
I just want to return the favor to Yong.

10
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:17,443
Helping his sister

11
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,559
is one way I can repay him, right?

12
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,675
Tomorrow, I’ll tell my mom the truth

13
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:23,166
that we broke up.

14
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:24,188
I already knew.

15
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,526
Does pretending to be together

16
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,508
mean you want to get back with him, son?

17
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:30,999
The coals are ages old.

18
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:32,124
How could they start a fire?

19
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,973
If you really don’t have feelings for me,

20
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,104
next week when we edit this work,

21
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,235
you can sleep over at my place.

22
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:39,973
Why not?

23
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,333
Hold on.

24
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,773
Do you remember what we promised?

25
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:57,304
Come on.

26
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,773
I know.

27
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,832
Your mom is coming home on Saturday.

28
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,952
Today, we’re here to work on our assignment.

29
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,243
So while we’re here,

30
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,795
the only thing we’ll do is work.

31
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:11,973
Very good.

32
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:15,552
Just work and nothing else.

33
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,290
TAWAN

34
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,952
Hey, come in.

35
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,039
Or do I have to carry you in?

36
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:27,973
There you are, Phi.

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,926
Would you like a snack?

38
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:30,075
I bought it for you.

39
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,046
Oh.

40
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,075
What are you guys doing here?

41
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,046
Yong said

42
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,235
the board wants to see the first episode by Monday.

43
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,621
So I thought if all of us helped edit,

44
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:41,403
we could get it done as soon as possible

45
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:43,373
I tried booking the editing room,

46
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,028
but it was fully booked.

47
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:46,839
So Tam suggested we come here instead.

48
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,693
Ah.

49
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:50,417
It’s for the best.

50
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:52,413
It’s annoyingly crowded over there.

51
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:58,933
Smile.

52
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,457
You look disappointed.

53
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:05,501
Why? Did you think you’d get to be alone with me?

54
00:03:05,973 --> 00:03:08,883
Oh, Tam, you’re home?

55
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,606
I didn’t realize.

56
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:14,599
You’re getting on my nerves.

57
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,083
How’s it going?

58
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,679
Can I see this part?

59
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,533
Here.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,373
I picked out the best shots.

61
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:31,664
Thank you.

62
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,075
And here’s the transcription I made from the interview tape.

63
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,097
Thanks.

64
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:39,537
Let me put everything together.

65
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:41,093
You can take a break.

66
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,130
Okay.

67
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:47,799
By the way,

68
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,333
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

69
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,479
Why is your sofa this color?

70
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,101
It really stands out.

71
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,108
It used to be a wooden bench.

72
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,584
But then a puppy…

73
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,599
Huh?

74
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:08,963
I mean, someone.

75
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,817
He said it was uncomfortable to sit on,

76
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,068
so I changed it to a sofa.

77
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:16,541
Changing it isn’t the problem but you could’ve matched the theme.

78
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,753
You buy furniture to use it, right?

79
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,730
If it’s uncomfortable to sit on,

80
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:23,766
why would you buy it?

81
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:26,273
Huh?

82
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,497
Sorry.

83
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,588
Did you pick this sofa, Phi?

84
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:33,223
Hmm?

85
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,639
Uh, no.

86
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:42,003
I was just guessing what he was thinking.

87
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:47,304
Oops, I bet this sofa

88
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,828
used to be your love nest, Tam and Phi.

89
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:56,279
You two must have…

90
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,846
watched movies here together.

91
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,032
Really?

92
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:03,501
No!

93
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:04,843
Hmm?

94
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:08,039
Are you not going to work, guys?

95
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,370
Let’s get back to work.

96
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:12,083
Can I see that?

97
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,603
This side of you is cute, Phi.

98
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,046
I ship you two.

99
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:32,068
Let’s lower the brightness in the salt farm part

100
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:37,363
and insert the local interview clips in between to make it more engaging.

101
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,083
Okay.

102
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:43,421
Do you have COVID?

103
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:45,835
No, I’ve already taken the test.

104
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:46,723
Are you okay?

105
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:47,886
You can take a break.

106
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,210
I’m totally fine.

107
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:51,821
I guess the AC is too cold.

108
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,977
Alright. Can you open it on this screen?

109
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,337
I want to see it in one take.

110
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,783
Okay.

111
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:01,079
I’ll export it and leave it open for you.

112
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,461
Excuse me for a moment.

113
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,555
I’ll be right back.

114
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:11,228
Hey!

115
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:12,955
Ta!

116
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,046
He’s burning up!

117
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:51,268
Phi, Tam, how’s Ta?

118
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,199
The doctor said he has a cold.

119
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,570
Tam and I drove him home.

120
00:07:58,923 --> 00:07:59,923
So,

121
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,833
what are we going to do with the editing?

122
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,017
Did what you checked look okay?

123
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:11,697
Um, yes.

124
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,912
We just need to add some CG and it should be fine.

125
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:17,766
Phi.

126
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,533
Say it.

127
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,423
You’re not happy with it, are you?

128
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,193
Right.

129
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:28,039
You wouldn’t be satisfied with just the first draft, Phi.

130
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:29,663
Tell us.

131
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,864
Or do you want me to ask Ta?

132
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:35,864
Well…

133
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:43,690
I actually think that many of our cuts

134
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,595
aren’t clear yet.

135
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,683
So we need to shoot more insert shots?

136
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:50,733
Yes.

137
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:53,748
That’s it.

138
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:55,188
I’m on it.

139
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,850
Are you going alone, Gie?

140
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,213
Who said I’m going alone?

141
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,039
The co-producer is coming with me.

142
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:03,783
That’s right.

143
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,566
Hmm?

144
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,583
Me?

145
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:07,793
Huh?

146
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,113
No way!

147
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,183
Phi!

148
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,453
Huh?

149
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,733
Why are you smiling?

150
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,915
I just think it should be fun.

151
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,017
How could it be fun?

152
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,323
How did I go from peacefully editing

153
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,737
to filming insert shots?

154
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:40,737
But it’s okay, Phi.

155
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,563
For you, I will.

156
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:45,283
You don’t really sound okay.

157
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,803
I’ll leave it to you then.

158
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,253
Please handle it, Gie.

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,573
Yeah, don’t worry.

160
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,028
You two do your best here.

161
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:53,639
Yeah.

162
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,073
You can do it.

163
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:56,453
Bye-bye.

164
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:00,963
Oh.

165
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,497
Looks like you got your wish.

166
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,493
Or are you going to run home?

167
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,693
What do you mean I got my wish?

168
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,766
And why would I run home?

169
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:13,195
Because it’s just the two of us left.

170
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,086
I’m afraid you won’t be able to

171
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,766
control yourself.

172
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,832
Oh, yeah?

173
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,181
You’re the one who won’t be able to control yourself.

174
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,524
Ever since we walked into the house,

175
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,857
your focus has only been on me.

176
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:25,843
No, it’s you.

177
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,461
No, it’s you.

178
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,006
No, it’s you.

179
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:27,479
No, it’s you.

180
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:27,864
Not me.

181
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:28,795
Don’t think I don’t know.

182
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:29,275
What?

183
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:30,686
I know what you’re thinking.

184
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,646
I know what you’re thinking too.

185
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:32,308
I know what you’re thinking.

186
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,377
I can see it in your eyes.

187
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,257
So can I.

188
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:34,970
What can you see?

189
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,066
Ever since we walked into the house,

190
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,353
- Why? - You’ve been staring at me.

191
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:38,075
- You think I don’t know? - Why?

192
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,933
- Please. - It’s you.

193
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:39,406
No, it’s you.

194
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:39,806
It’s you.

195
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:40,330
- No, it’s you. - It’s you.

196
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,366
No, it’s you.

197
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:52,223
Here.

198
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,133
I made it for you.

199
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:55,853
How’s it going?

200
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,468
Thank you.

201
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,941
Hold on, can I look at this?

202
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,646
Are you secretly watching me?

203
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:28,073
Huh?

204
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,039
Yes, I am.

205
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,715
I wonder when you’ll stop doing that.

206
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,628
You think you’re being sexy?

207
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:35,246
Huh?

208
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,210
If you’re not helping, just back away.

209
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,583
Good.

210
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:41,821
I’ll leave it to you then.

211
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,173
Hold on.

212
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,210
Do you watch too many dramas?

213
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,723
What are you doing?

214
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,123
Why not? This is my house.

215
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,664
I’m just going to take a shower.

216
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,469
Do you usually take off your shirt and put it over the computer?

217
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:16,493
Take it back!

218
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,072
Phi!

219
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,232
Can you get me the salt scrub?

220
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,233
It’s in the cabinet above the stove.

221
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:33,341
Come and get it yourself.

222
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:34,839
I’m not your errand boy.

223
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,243
Phi!

224
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,693
Phi!

225
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:24,875
What?

226
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,373
Come here, please!

227
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:27,297
What is it?

228
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,650
Come on, Phi!

229
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:29,693
Fine!

230
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:31,093
What is it?

231
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:33,973
What is it?

232
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,039
That’s salt from my home.

233
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,075
Yeah, your mom gave it to me.

234
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,333
How do I use it?

235
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:45,835
Seriously?

236
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,079
You don’t know how to use it?

237
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,904
No, I don’t.

238
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:53,653
I wouldn’t have called you otherwise.

239
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,886
You’re trying to seduce me, huh?

240
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,235
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:04,533
You’re overthinking it.

242
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,637
I really don’t know how to use it

243
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,435
and it’s from your home.

244
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,763
If not you, who else would I ask?

245
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:24,593
Fine.

246
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:46,548
Turn around.

247
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,053
You don’t know how to scrub it, right?

248
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,650
Fine.

249
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,272
Ouch!

250
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,039
That stings!

251
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,173
Be gentle!

252
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:13,515
Be more gentle, Phi.

253
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,537
It stings!

254
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,013
The salt from my mom’s home smells nice.

255
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:36,497
I’m her son but I don’t even really use it.

256
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,090
Come on.

257
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:43,126
Let me scrub it for you.

258
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,424
No, you don’t have to.

259
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:24,753
Oh.

260
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,046
Sosay!

261
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,166
Great job today.

262
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:44,752
Here’s your reward.

263
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,232
The doctor will give you a massage.

264
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,726
You’re acting weird

265
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,450
but that feels good.

266
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,933
We said we’d only work.

267
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:15,793
This is work.

268
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,093
How is it not?

269
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,593
Hmm?

270
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,130
My boyfriend smells nice.

271
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,512
Can’t I do this a little?

272
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,323
Did you make a cat sound?

273
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,633
It’s not me.

274
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:51,624
Then where did that come from?

275
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,213
Where did you wander off from, little one?

276
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,330
You interrupted our moment.

277
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,053
She’s making a fuss.

278
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,308
She’s probably from around here.

279
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,519
There’s no collar.

280
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,661
Shall we keep her for now

281
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,035
and find her an owner later?

282
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:20,955
I guess so.

283
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:28,257
Oh, Sosay.

284
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,573
Mmm.

285
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,744
I thought you’d find a new owner.

286
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,555
How come you became her owner?

287
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:40,686
I couldn’t find one.

288
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:41,799
What can I do?

289
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:44,313
Anyone can raise her.

290
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,432
I told you not to give her a name,

291
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:48,803
because once you do, you feel a bond.

292
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,857
Please, I’m not the only one.

293
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,533
You’re no different.

294
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,253
Sosay, don’t do that baby!

295
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,061
Oh!

296
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:02,512
Sosay!

297
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,059
You’re going to get an electric shock!

298
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,043
Sosay, don’t scratch the curtains!

299
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:07,850
Sosay!

300
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:08,446
Sosay!

301
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,195
Sosay!

302
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:11,193
Okay!

303
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:12,977
This is annoying.

304
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,664
I can’t focus on my work at all.

305
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,857
I’m sorry.

306
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:18,875
I tried to make her stay still but she just wouldn’t.

307
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:21,653
- Sosay! - Fine.

308
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,675
I’m going to take a break.

309
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,061
Stay still, Sosay.

310
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:55,312
Phi, look.

311
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:56,943
What?

312
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:01,943
Is she staying still?

313
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:03,073
Yes.

314
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,330
Oh.

315
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,944
You could’ve told me you liked the sound of the guitar.

316
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:28,992
I’m not that attached.

317
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,323
Please, you’re totally whipped for Sosay.

318
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:35,159
Every time you come here, you play the guitar for her.

319
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,013
There.

320
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,061
Aww.

321
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:38,723
See?

322
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,053
Your boss is calling you.

323
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,233
Aww.

324
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:56,424
Are you really not going to play it for me, servant?

325
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:58,570
I want to hear it now.

326
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,443
No.

327
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,592
I’m lazy.

328
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,593
Really?

329
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:06,075
Alright, look at your boss’ face again.

330
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,497
Fine.

331
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:17,450
I’m only playing for you so you don’t bother me when I work.

332
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,046
Pa dee da pa da

333
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:47,959
Pu pu pup pup pu

334
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:52,344
Pa da dap pu, yeah

335
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:56,664
I don’t know where else to find

336
00:21:56,693 --> 00:22:01,813
Someone who truly gets me

337
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:07,028
I know tomorrow you'll be waiting

338
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,657
That gives me peace of mind

339
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:20,832
Pa dee da pa da pu pu pup pup pu

340
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,373
And just like that, you fell asleep.

341
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:57,341
Uh, I’m just…

342
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,377
Hey.

343
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:02,395
I’m so sleepy.

344
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:06,315
Can you bring Sosay back to the room?

345
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,166
Your room?

346
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:10,283
Mmm.

347
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:13,813
Sure.

348
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:14,992
Come on, baby.

349
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:16,388
Let’s go to sleep.

350
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:56,803
Phi.

351
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:58,273
Hmm?

352
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,883
I’m going to sleep now.

353
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:09,763
Thanks for today.

354
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:12,933
Mmm.

355
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:19,843
See you later.

356
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:44,483
You got me so confused

357
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:47,588
I don’t have a clue

358
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:51,035
What you've done, was it love?

359
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:54,213
I just want to know the truth

360
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,046
I hate myself every time

361
00:24:56,068 --> 00:25:00,744
I give in and let you take all that’s mine

362
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,315
No matter how much it breaks me inside

363
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,777
I still say I'm fine

364
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,373
I consent to the pain

365
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,533
It’s great just to know you've been

366
00:25:16,563 --> 00:25:19,770
There to break my heart again

367
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:25,828
Even knowing you're heartless

368
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,653
I still love you no less

369
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:34,730
Keep loving you like this

370
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,112
Come on.

371
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:02,686
Your face shows you’re upset that Phi’s not here.

372
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:03,828
Of course.

373
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:05,610
I didn’t want to come with you.

374
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,304
No one wanted to come.

375
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,399
Let’s go get this over with and leave.

376
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,686
What’s wrong with my bike?

377
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,715
No!

378
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,104
The chain is broken.

379
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:35,813
Of course, this would happen to me.

380
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:38,912
Nhudee.

381
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:39,955
Huh?

382
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:42,173
Come on.

383
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,017
Whoa, you’re quite heavy.

384
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,883
I’m not heavy—the bike is.

385
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,243
Hi, I’m Ake De Maeklong.

386
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,272
I created this cafe

387
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:58,359
inspired by my love for Maeklong.

388
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:08,999
Gosh, I’m so tired!

389
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,246
I’m hot, exhausted,

390
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:13,319
and the stuff is heavy!

391
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,090
Keep your energy up.

392
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,886
We only have one or two shots left to film.

393
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:18,908
Let’s go.

394
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:21,188
Fine.

395
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,584
Wait, why is your temperature so high?

396
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:25,813
Hey!

397
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:27,315
I must have been in the sun too long.

398
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:28,403
Let’s go.

399
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:30,875
Hey, Gie!

400
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:31,897
No!

401
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,543
Why is it always me?

402
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:38,313
Oh!

403
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:41,043
Wake up, Gaogie!

404
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,283
I told you you’re burning up.

405
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:50,733
Tam!

406
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:54,504
Hey, Tam!

407
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,788
What are you doing?

408
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,293
Are you still sleeping?

409
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:03,079
I think I’ve clearly said no.

410
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:06,061
I have to go.

411
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,959
What?

412
00:28:12,163 --> 00:28:13,163
What were you doing?

413
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:16,315
Talking to Sosay.

414
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,650
Why?

415
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:21,726
Don’t tell me you’re jealous even of the cat now.

416
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,406
Hmm, Sosay?

417
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:24,693
Look at your Papa.

418
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:28,683
Nonsense.

419
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,672
Let’s get to work.

420
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,995
YOU MUST’VE CAUGHT A FEVER FROM TA. PHI’S MOM BROUGHT YOU MEDICINE. -NHUDEE.

421
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,061
What are you doing?

422
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:55,435
Why are you even asking?

423
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,433
I’m covering for you.

424
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:00,701
Since when do you know how to use cameras?

425
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,050
Do you really not remember?

426
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,664
Please, sis.

427
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,533
Please teach me.

428
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:18,046
I don’t know how to teach.

429
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,166
Ask someone else.

430
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,868
I want to know how to use cameras.

431
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:22,873
Please, pretty Gie.

432
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,061
Alright.

433
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:29,152
I’ll teach you the basics for now.

434
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,726
Do you know about depth of field?

435
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:33,101
Deep and shallow.

436
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:37,108
Hmm, don’t we just have to turn the focus ring?

437
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:42,788
Most people think it’s just that, but actually,

438
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,297
you also need to turn the F-stop to the lowest setting

439
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,199
to focus on the subject and blur the background.

440
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,417
Now, we focus on the subject like this.

441
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,788
Hmm.

442
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:53,824
Alright.

443
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:56,393
Try it.

444
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:57,479
Now?

445
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:58,515
Mm-hmm.

446
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:06,657
Give it a try.

447
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:07,964
It might be a bit hard at first,

448
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:09,028
but you’ll get used to it.

449
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:13,137
Oh, I can do it now.

450
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:14,883
Hmm?

451
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:15,777
Here.

452
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,232
Your face is in sharp focus, sis.

453
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:18,268
Wow.

454
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,813
You’re a talented kid.

455
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:23,755
Are you interested in this field?

456
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:26,063
No.

457
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:29,850
My brother said camera operators don’t really have time for their partners.

458
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:30,886
Is that true?

459
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:32,563
Stop talking.

460
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:42,432
No one had ever complimented me like that in my life.

461
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:44,883
After you did,

462
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,061
I secretly set a goal to become a camera operator like you.

463
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,323
Then why…?

464
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,046
Because you dumped my brother.

465
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:58,970
Ever since that day,

466
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:00,973
I didn’t want to touch cameras again.

467
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:06,853
Tell me honestly.

468
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:09,304
Why did you leave him?

469
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:15,304
I just want to know how I should feel about you.

470
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,923
I’m sorry I asked.

471
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:34,817
I forgot you wouldn’t answer anyway.

472
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,301
It’s my fault.

473
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:49,712
I wasn’t good enough for Yong.

474
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:51,777
I had just graduated.

475
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,192
I still wanted to have fun,

476
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:56,861
but he was ready to start a family.

477
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,028
At first, I thought I could change,

478
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:05,799
but as the wedding got closer,

479
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:09,195
I realized I couldn’t.

480
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:12,061
So I decided to break up with him.

481
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,075
You didn’t cheat on him?

482
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:18,283
No.

483
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,021
You didn’t get bored with Yong?

484
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,613
Hey, if I were really bored with him,

485
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,999
we wouldn’t still be able to work together.

486
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,090
That’s true.

487
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:33,803
Thank you for being honest with me.

488
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:37,021
Now I can finally get back to enjoying using cameras.

489
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,333
Hey.

490
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:49,035
Why did you take a photo of me?

491
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,526
No reason. I just wanted to.

492
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:53,923
Smile.

493
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:54,628
Seriously?

494
00:33:54,672 --> 00:33:55,672
Hey!

495
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:57,850
Wait for me to pose first!

496
00:33:57,893 --> 00:33:59,064
Alright.

497
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:02,593
I thought you didn’t want to have your photos taken.

498
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,373
If I have to, I might as well look pretty.

499
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:08,686
Do I look pretty now?

500
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:10,613
Not bad.

501
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:15,108
I’m pretty, right?

502
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:41,312
Okay. I’ve added the extra insert shots Gie filmed for us.

503
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,348
What do you think?

504
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:44,363
Is it okay?

505
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:53,713
Yeah, it’s okay.

506
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:55,312
Okay?

507
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:56,993
Really?

508
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,283
If you like it, just say so.

509
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:00,272
Huh?

510
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:02,523
Show me how you feel.

511
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:05,384
You don’t have to act cool and keep a straight face all the time.

512
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,413
What?

513
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:08,973
Don’t act like you know me so well.

514
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:12,046
If I didn’t know you, who would?

515
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:14,926
I might have changed.

516
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,923
If you’ve changed, you could change back.

517
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:19,646
Right?

518
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:20,675
I don’t know.

519
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,593
Done.

520
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:30,803
It’s a wrap.

521
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:37,823
Let me send the file to Yong now.

522
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,755
Whoa, it’s this late already?

523
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:48,061
I haven’t had dinner.

524
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,417
Eat up, baby.

525
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,068
I’m back.

526
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,475
I bought a lot of stuff.

527
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:16,504
It’s so heavy.

528
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:24,308
Where’s the one I asked you to get?

529
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:26,193
Oh.

530
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:29,523
I forgot. Sorry.

531
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:32,221
What kind of boyfriend are you?

532
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,450
You don’t pay attention to me.

533
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:39,690
Ta-da!

534
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:42,032
Just kidding. I wouldn't forget.

535
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:43,573
Hey,

536
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,079
this is the wrong scent.

537
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:48,366
I asked for sakura, not plum.

538
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:51,435
Sorry. I really forgot that.

539
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:52,999
It’s okay.

540
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:54,035
I’ll try this one.

541
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:04,273
Hey.

542
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:06,657
This actually tastes good.

543
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:08,163
Do you want to try it?

544
00:37:08,513 --> 00:37:09,513
It smells nice.

545
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,033
Sure.

546
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:19,581
I’ve been wanting to taste it.

547
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,653
But I prefer to taste it here.

548
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,793
Mmm.

549
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,777
It’s good.

550
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:41,712
You won’t know the flavor from just a little taste like that.

551
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:44,192
You’re right.

552
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:06,403
Well, you still haven’t moved on.

553
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:16,024
What do you mean I haven’t moved on?

554
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,755
I’m not using the same scent anymore.

555
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:21,753
This is the new cherry scent.

556
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:24,504
It tastes good.

557
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,999
Wanna try it?

558
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,428
Haha.

559
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:28,933
No.

560
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:31,253
What’s wrong?

561
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,763
Just a small taste should be fine, right?

562
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:43,573
You think I don’t know

563
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,552
what you’re thinking?

564
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:49,937
Ever since you came back to work…

565
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,417
Why are you quiet?

566
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:56,153
Where’s your sharp tongue now?

567
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,243
What am I thinking?

568
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,039
I told you I’m not thinking anything.

569
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:05,552
If you say so.

570
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:07,393
Great.

571
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:09,115
It’s your call.

572
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:20,650
Mr. Tam, I’m here to see you!

573
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:25,953
Tae?

574
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:40,483
Sorry, Mr. Tam.

575
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:43,355
I just couldn’t wait to hear your answer.

576
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:44,693
About what?

577
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,388
Oh, sorry.

578
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:51,043
I forgot you guys are editing your work.

579
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,835
I invited Mr. Tam to work on my new show.

580
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:03,937
Mr. Tam, about what I asked…

581
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:06,075
I think I’ve clearly said no.

582
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:08,584
Can you please reconsider?

583
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,497
I already gave you my answer.

584
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:13,843
I have to go.

585
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:16,273
Tam!

586
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,833
What?

587
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:26,730
I just couldn’t wait to hear his answer.

588
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:28,493
But it’s okay.

589
00:40:28,653 --> 00:40:29,493
Mr. Tam,

590
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:32,621
once you finish editing your work,

591
00:40:33,353 --> 00:40:34,519
call me.

592
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:38,272
There’s a restaurant I want to take you—my treat.

593
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,977
Oh, so when you said you were talking to Sosay this morning,

594
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,232
you were actually talking to him?

595
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:54,926
Phi, listen to me.

596
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,003
Save it.

597
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,937
You said you’d help me take him down,

598
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:00,046
but now you’re siding with him?

599
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,075
Why?

600
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:03,210
Do you want to be on billboards that bad?

601
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:03,544
Phi!

602
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,428
You never change!

603
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,513
At the end of the day, you’re still the same asshole.

604
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:09,057
Just get lost!

605
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:10,086
Yeah!

606
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,039
I’m still the same asshole!

607
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,206
Are you happy now? Huh?

608
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:16,948
You want me to go with that Mr. Tae so bad?

609
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:18,633
I’m going!

610
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:27,726
Oh, Mr. Tam.

611
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:31,283
Shall we go now?

612
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:33,406
You can take me anywhere.

613
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:37,857
Don’t worry.

614
00:41:38,673 --> 00:41:40,046
I’ll take care of him.

615
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:18,643
Hey!

616
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,803
Why didn’t you close the door?

617
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,744
I forgot. I’m sorry.

618
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:25,741
I told you to close the door when you come in.

619
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,239
Sosay could walk out.

620
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:29,283
Sosay!

621
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,766
Come on.

622
00:42:30,788 --> 00:42:31,788
Sosay, baby?

623
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:33,421
Come on.

624
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:35,464
Sosay might have already gone out.

625
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:39,159
She’ll come back.

626
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:39,981
Let’s keep going.

627
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,326
What the hell?

628
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:44,403
I’m telling you the cat is missing!

629
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,050
How can you still be thinking about that?

630
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:48,563
Come on!

631
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:50,097
She’s a stray cat.

632
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,799
She can take care of herself.

633
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,912
Why are you so worried?

634
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,737
You’re not worried about the cat, I get it,

635
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:56,733
but you don’t care about my feelings at all.

636
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,581
Did you only come to my house

637
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:01,312
because you wanted to sleep with me?

638
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:02,763
What a jerk!

639
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:05,573
Sosay!

640
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:08,366
Sosay!

641
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:22,443
Sosay.

642
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,435
Sosay.

643
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,433
Hey.

644
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:42,803
Sosay.

645
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:44,795
There you are.

646
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:45,973
Come to Papa.

647
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:48,046
Mmm.

648
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:50,913
It’s alright.

649
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:53,406
Aww.

650
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:55,864
Mmm.

651
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:49,486
YOU AND I WILL BECOME JOURNALISTS! I MISS YOU SO MUCH. TAM

652
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,210
I asked for sakura, not plum.

653
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:06,817
I’m not rushing you or anything,

654
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:11,188
but us having a meal like this

655
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:16,504
means you’re interested in producing my new show, right?

656
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,912
No, it’s not that.

657
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:22,046
I just want to teach him a lesson.

658
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:27,043
Sorry?

659
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:29,493
Just kidding.

660
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,995
I wanted to say no in person

661
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,530
so it wouldn’t be rude.

662
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:38,533
Thank you for the offer,

663
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,839
but I’ve already chosen my path.

664
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:43,563
Thank you for the meal too.

665
00:46:44,813 --> 00:46:46,032
I have to go.

666
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:50,253
Mr. Tam.

667
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:59,246
What can I do to convince you?

668
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,537
I’m willing to do anything.

669
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:06,715
Sosay!

670
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,033
Sosay!

671
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:13,173
Sosay!

672
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:17,363
Sosay!

673
00:47:33,406 --> 00:47:34,406
Phi.

674
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:36,475
He’s my producer.

675
00:47:38,846 --> 00:47:40,843
I won’t let anyone steal him.

676
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,624
Please help find her.

677
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:55,903
I’ve looked near my house but couldn’t find her.

678
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,033
Yeah.

679
00:47:58,513 --> 00:47:59,697
She’s a Siamese cat.

680
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:01,719
She’s two years old.

681
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:03,593
Her face has already darkened.

682
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:05,159
Her collar is green and orange.

683
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,553
Phi!

684
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:12,068
Where have you been?

685
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:18,424
I’m sorry

686
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:21,639
I didn’t care about your feelings.

687
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:23,748
Forget that.

688
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,144
What did you do?

689
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:26,253
I’m fine.

690
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,632
Go check on the cat.

691
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:29,733
Hey, Phi!

692
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:30,748
Phi!

693
00:48:31,353 --> 00:48:32,395
Phi!

694
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,141
Let go of me.

695
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:35,312
I can walk by myself.

696
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:42,068
Now will you tell me

697
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:43,479
how you knew I was there?

698
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:46,264
I’m a reporter.

699
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:49,930
I know where my producer went.

700
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,166
Excuse me.

701
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:53,595
Who’s your producer?

702
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,028
Didn’t you kick me out?

703
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:57,113
So what?

704
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,297
You kicked me out of your life,

705
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:01,450
but you still keep those things.

706
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,483
What things?

707
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:07,821
The things in your room.

708
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,413
I saw everything.

709
00:49:12,803 --> 00:49:16,039
So what? You think I keep them because I’m still in love with you?

710
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:19,463
I keep them because there are my photos on them.

711
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:21,373
Really?

712
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:26,061
Is your photo on this thing?

713
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,348
Why do you still keep

714
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:35,913
the lip balm I bought you?

715
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:40,032
I think the person who’s still hung up

716
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:42,068
and refuses to say it is you.

717
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:43,857
What are you talking about?

718
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:46,032
It might be a new one.

719
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,217
Don’t get the wrong idea that it’s the one you got me.

720
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:55,493
Are you sure?

721
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,312
I have to taste it then.

722
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:30,963
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

723
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,283
So you didn’t get hit by a car,

724
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,283
but ducked into the bush after Sosay?

725
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:39,086
Yeah, that’s how I got her.

726
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:40,257
It hurts so bad.

727
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:41,552
I’m still feeling dizzy.

728
00:51:42,123 --> 00:51:43,253
Aww, come on.

729
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:44,483
Let me dress your wounds.

730
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:53,366
Done.

731
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,483
That’s not enough.

732
00:51:59,193 --> 00:52:00,193
What?

733
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,279
Can I get a reward?

734
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:04,744
What reward?

735
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,873
You know what I mean.

736
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,570
Your cat wants you to go to bed.

737
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:25,792
Just follow her.

738
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:36,650
What I have found with you today

739
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:40,417
Is better than dreams in every way

740
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:44,250
Every minute with you by my side

741
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,253
Loving you with our hearts intertwined

742
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,897
What I understand today is how

743
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,803
It feels so good to love you now

744
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,621
Thank you for making me realize

745
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,606
Love's better than what I imagined in life

746
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:16,017
Are old flames about to burn bright?

747
00:53:16,053 --> 00:53:18,148
Tam and Phi. Phi and Tam.

748
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:20,657
Everyone really loves your demo.

749
00:53:20,686 --> 00:53:22,533
But we have no sponsors.

750
00:53:22,555 --> 00:53:24,192
I’m going to find one.

751
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,970
Sorry. My meeting ended late.

752
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:29,810
Paul.

753
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:33,297
Paul’s face doesn’t age at all.

754
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:35,704
Now he has his own company.
