1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
That’s like a university assignment.

2
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,000
My topic is much clearer.
You and me…

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,220
Let’s each make a demo for the show to settle it.

4
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:05,370
Whoever loses

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,520
will have to do everything the winner says.

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,853
I didn’t ask you to do that.

7
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:12,686
I want my show up on a billboard like that.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,093
I’ve always thought you two are so successful

9
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,986
because you fill in what each other is missing.

10
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,773
This clip has shown me

11
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:26,720
that both of you are good at different things.

12
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:29,460
And I only want you

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,826
to be the one who makes it happen.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,373
Hi.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,506
Hi.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,746
Hi.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,173
Hi, Yod.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,946
How’s the backdrop Yong asked you to fix?

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Sorry.

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,460
I haven’t fixed it.

21
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,813
My son got sick yesterday.

22
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,260
Oh, that’s okay.

23
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:57,473
I hope he gets better soon.

24
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:58,340
Thank you.

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,780
Hey, Phi.
Come here.

26
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:03,980
Yes.

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,233
Is this CG okay?

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,466
Uh, according to Yong’s brief,

29
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,370
isn’t Good Days supposed to be in blue?

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,140
I remember it was red.

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,800
Wait a second.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,513
Here’s the message I sent you.

33
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,333
The brief says it should be blue.

34
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,486
Oh, why did I think it was red?

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,826
It’s too late to fix it now.

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,366
Let’s just stick with red.

37
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,680
It’s okay.

38
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,079
I can fix it myself.

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,480
Okay.

40
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:35,546
Thank you.

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,060
Once again,

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,393
I’m the one who has to help you.

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,106
Aww.

44
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,173
Thank you.

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,120
Here.

46
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,880
I bought pork skewers without fat

47
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:53,140
just for you.

48
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:54,153
Stop it.

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,613
Go ahead and eat them first.

50
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,113
I’ll leave them here.

51
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,220
You’re not in school anymore.

52
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,220
If you keep being this kind,

53
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,340
the others will always take advantage of you.

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,520
I’m choking.

55
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:14,546
Can you pass me the water?

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,033
Hurry.

57
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,306
Are you okay?

58
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,320
You okay?

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,013
Are you feeling better?

60
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,106
I’m okay now.

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,840
See?

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,960
Even if everyone else is mean to me,

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,700
you’re kind to me, Tawan.

64
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,166
I miss doing news reporting with you.

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,366
We’ve been here for over a year,

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,853
but we haven’t gotten near the camera.

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,646
How could we,

68
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,246
if we still have to work for others like this?

69
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,740
Should I quit?

70
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,493
My mom asks me to go home and help with her salt farm every day.

71
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:15,473
Mmm.

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,666
Oh.

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,206
Hello, Yong.

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Oh, the CG is almost ready.

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,853
Huh?

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,193
What did you say?

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,393
Yes. Of course!

78
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,910
Thank you.

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,400
What?

80
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:34,973
What?

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,213
I’m going to do field reporting.

82
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:39,333
Really?
Yes!

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,280
Did he tell you that?

84
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,960
He didn’t lie, did he?

85
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,173
No, he didn’t lie!

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,006
- We’re at work! - 	Yes, yes, yes!

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
We’re at work!

88
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:50,940
I’m Padtaphi Sinan.

89
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:53,106
Today, I’m reporting…

90
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,920
Auntie,

91
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:57,986
this year, we’ve had the worst flooding in 10 years.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,293
How has it affected you?

93
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,240
I’ve been working at my durian farm

94
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,673
since my grandparents’ time.

95
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,480
It’s been around for almost 100 years.

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,033
Just one week of flooding took it all away.

97
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,346
Everything I’ve worked for my whole life is gone.

98
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,446
It disappeared in the blink of an eye.

99
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:25,693
I’m sorry.

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Everyone, let’s give it up for

101
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,133
our rising star reporter of the year.

102
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,560
You’re amazing, Phi!

103
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:43,560
This award is definitely not mine alone.

104
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,713
I want to share it with everyone

105
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,426
who helped me get here.

106
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:50,266
Thank you so much.

107
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,306
Let’s give him a big hand!

108
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,820
Awesome!

109
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,380
We’re creating a new show.

110
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,206
So I’d like to invite your team

111
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,373
to be our cameramen.

112
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,273
Oh?

113
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,540
What about the team that filmed your demos?

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,986
I’m not sure.

115
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,300
After they did that for us, they quit.

116
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,480
I’m not surprised.

117
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,166
This time, it has to be you,

118
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:27,020
because you made this clip.

119
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,440
You’re the one who filmed this clip

120
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,306
and made Phi go viral.

121
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,353
Do you remember?

122
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,726
Hey.

123
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,713
What are you doing?

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,166
Ask Phi

125
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,326
if he remembered me when he was famous.

126
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,753
Phi said himself

127
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,966
that you’re the only CG guy we should work with, Pap.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,186
But he always makes me redo my work from scratch.

129
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,566
Oh.

130
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,900
That’s because you never follow the briefs.

131
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
I want to help

132
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:01,000
but my plate is full.

133
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,533
And it’s not like editing work for Mr. Phi

134
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,520
is easy to get approved.
Hey.

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,720
I promise that this time,

136
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,180
I’ll be the one approving the work.

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,120
I’m really busy.

138
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,953
I’ll ask my team to edit for you.

139
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:12,726
Hey.

140
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,986
Where’s everyone?

141
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,260
Please help me, Yong.

142
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,540
What did you do

143
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,540
to make them not want to work with you?

144
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,853
How would I know?

145
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:33,853
You’re their boss.

146
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,420
Just order them to help me.

147
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:36,300
No.

148
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,413
I take care of my team like family.

149
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,410
I can’t even order you to do anything.

150
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,786
How am I going to order anyone else?

151
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,486
If the internal team won’t help us,

152
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:48,906
can we outsource the work?

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,133
Where would you find the money for that?

154
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,353
We’re lucky they even gave us

155
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,853
a budget to create a new show.

156
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:58,106
What are we going to do,

157
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:00,100
working with just the two of us?

158
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,240
Who says it’s only the two of you?

159
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:04,186
There are three of you now.

160
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,913
I just hired a co-producer.

161
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,200
Hi, Phi!

162
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,253
My name is Nhudee.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,250
I’m Yong’s younger sister.

164
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,593
And your fan.

165
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,966
Here’s the less sweet pink milk.

166
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,240
Your favorite, Phi.

167
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:25,813
Thank you.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,146
Hold on, Phi.

169
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,606
Can I get your autograph?

170
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,246
Sure.

171
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,380
Thank you.

172
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:33,986
Here.

173
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,220
Ever since I saw your viral debut clip

174
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,393
where you got emotional and cried during the interview,

175
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:45,040
I’ve sworn to be your fangirl for life.

176
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,086
Are you helping us

177
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,480
or making your sister’s dream come true?

178
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,720
Not everyone can be a co-producer.

179
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,266
Ah, ah, ah.

180
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:59,033
You’re Tamtawan, Phi’s classmate.

181
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,773
One day, you were put on a project together.

182
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,833
Then you started catching feelings and got together.

183
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,966
But on the day Phi did his first interview…

184
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:10,960
Please stop.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,660
I believe you’re good at researching now.

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,733
Is she the co-producer or Conan?

187
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,166
Alright.

188
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,306
You have your co-producer.

189
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:21,406
As for the other team members,

190
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,960
make sure you win them over.

191
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,340
How am I supposed to win them over?

192
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,706
What can I do?

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,286
I don’t know.

194
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,626
How would I know?

195
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,260
Just do whatever you can to make them want to work with you.

196
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,529
I’m rooting for you, Phi.

197
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,533
Thank you.

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,360
Hey, Mr. Tam.

199
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,726
You’ve agreed to be the producer of my show, right?

200
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,786
I knew it.

201
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,473
I heard

202
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,640
one reason no one wants to work with Mr. Padtaphi

203
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,986
is because someone turned them against him.

204
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,980
Come on, Mr. Tam.

205
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,873
I’m just a small-time reporter.

206
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,980
I don’t have the power to force anyone.

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,940
A rising star reporter who’s carrying the channel’s ratings

208
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,726
doesn’t seem that small to me.

209
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,346
Oh, please.

210
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,693
These days, everyone wants to work with someone who has a future.

211
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,733
You should think like that too.

212
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,966
If you think Mr. Padtaphi has no future,

213
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,846
you won’t mind lending him a few crew members, right?

214
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:47,213
Or are you actually afraid of him?

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,313
I’m not afraid of him.

216
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,246
The fact that one wants to work with him

217
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,560
has nothing to do with me.

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,766
It’s because of his behavior.

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,066
How about this?

220
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,280
If he agrees to work under me for a week,

221
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,670
I’ll let my team help him.

222
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,273
You just want to get back at him, don’t you?

223
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,213
I want to make him realize

224
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,613
how it feels

225
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,806
to be bossed around.

226
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,973
Would he even dare?

227
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,813
Let’s do it.

228
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,693
Why wouldn’t I dare?

229
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,653
We have a deal.

230
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,680
I’ll work under you for a week

231
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,470
and then you’ll give me your crew members.

232
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,906
Are you sure you don’t want my help?

233
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,866
It’s alright.

234
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,520
I’m working for him now.

235
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,486
I have to do it myself.

236
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,053
Oh!

237
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,773
My bias is so cool!

238
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,753
If you really want to help me,

239
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,806
can you get me a cup of coffee?

240
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,160
Of course.
Great.

241
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,853
Nhudee,

242
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:27,726
get him two spoons of coffee,

243
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,580
two and a half sugars, and one cream.

244
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:30,666
Okay.

245
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,766
Don’t act like you know me so well.

246
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,866
Are you sure about this?

247
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,540
Of course.

248
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,573
Why not?

249
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,246
I used to write scripts like this.

250
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,100
You know Tae doesn’t care.

251
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,726
He just wants to bully you,

252
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,386
to get back at you.

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
You think I don’t know that?

254
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,720
If you know, then why are you doing this?

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,013
That last incident is still hanging over you.

256
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,373
If you slip up again,

257
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:17,206
even Yong won’t be able to help you.

258
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,000
You think I’m going to lose my patience too?

259
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,986
Just wait and see.

260
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,286
I’ll show everyone I can win them over.

261
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,640
This is done!

262
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,440
I’m so tired.

263
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,500
No need to do that. I’m fine.

264
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,340
That actually feels great.

265
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,733
Press a bit harder, please.

266
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,553
Enough.

267
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:23,666
You can stop now.

268
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,480
You don’t need to comfort me.

269
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:28,840
Comfort you, huh?

270
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,860
When have I comforted you?

271
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,940
You’re doing it now.

272
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:33,673
There’s no need.
Let me pack up.

273
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,426
I just like the smell of your perfume.

274
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,866
Hey!

275
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,246
Why do you have to be this close?

276
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,106
Get away from me!

277
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,380
Go!

278
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,813
Are you shy?

279
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,140
Go!

280
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,093
Keep going.

281
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,220
I don’t see anything.

282
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey!

283
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,600
Can I have that coffee?

284
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,546
Of course.

285
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,920
Mmm.

286
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,173
Mmm.

287
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,293
The concept is good.

288
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,160
The script is not bad.

289
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,920
Mmm.

290
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,633
And there’s no typo.

291
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,853
Because Ku—

292
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,753
I mean, I proofread it many times.

293
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,660
I wouldn’t expect anything less from Prince Phi.

294
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,120
But…

295
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,973
I don’t like this font.

296
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:54,620
And I don’t like this format either.

297
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,720
But we’ve always used this font.

298
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,160
Come on, Mr. Phi.

299
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,220
It’s Mr. Tae’s order, so fix it.

300
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,320
Okay.

301
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,973
I’ll fix it.

302
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,786
Hey.

303
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,180
I get you.

304
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,966
Normally, you’re the one ordering people around.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,353
I bet you’re not used to this.

306
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,200
It’s alright.

307
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,560
I’ll ask the intern to be your mentor.

308
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:32,650
Sound good?

309
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,493
Yeah?

310
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,006
Junior.

311
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,866
It’s okay.

312
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,646
I’ll fix it myself.

313
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,626
What font do you want?

314
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,406
Font?

315
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:46,686
How about “front”?

316
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,920
What about the size?

317
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,100
The size?

318
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:56,286
Mmm.

319
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,753
The size of my body.

320
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,573
Yong, Phi accepted Tae’s challenge,

321
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,493
but I don’t think Tae will actually let his crew work with us.

322
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,800
I think we can handle it by ourselves.

323
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,110
We’re only missing cameramen.

324
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,693
No one’s going to agree to help.

325
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,726
Hmm.

326
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,560
Actually, there’s one team that just became available

327
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,326
and Tae won’t be able to influence them.

328
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
There is?

329
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,353
They just got back from filming a documentary in the Galapagos Islands.

330
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,060
Their team leader is a rising star camera operator who’ve won countless awards.

331
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,353
Hey.

332
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,746
Don’t tell me…

333
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,313
Yo, Yong.

334
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,646
I got you a souvenir.

335
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,406
Hey, Tam.

336
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,973
When did you come back?

337
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,593
A while ago.

338
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,606
I’m back to produce a show for Phi.

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,626
Are you serious?

340
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,760
You’re back to work with your ex?

341
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,020
Come on, Gie.

342
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,486
Don’t say that.

343
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,393
Even you and I can still work together.

344
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,046
Oh, you’re right.

345
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,713
I almost forgot we hooked up.

346
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,220
Whoa.

347
00:18:27,113 --> 00:18:27,960
Oh.

348
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,566
I have work to do.

349
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:30,526
See you around.
Mmm.

350
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,233
Hello?

351
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,206
Even though she’s a big deal,

352
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,273
if it’s a show she’s interested in,

353
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,270
she’d work on it no matter how small.

354
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,746
I’m not sure about your case, though.

355
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:49,840
Why not?

356
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,333
You think because we’re close to you,

357
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:53,700
she’ll feel uncomfortable?

358
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,833
Hey.

359
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,833
She and I are the type who can work with exes.

360
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,966
The problem is with your ex.

361
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:12,840
Hey, Gie.

362
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,626
Gie?

363
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,453
She’s not here.

364
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,113
She’s probably on set.

365
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,933
Look, Tam.

366
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,930
Is there really no one else?

367
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,353
Instead of begging Gie,

368
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,350
I’ll be your camera operator.

369
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,386
Why?

370
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:31,680
Are you holding a grudge against her for your brother?

371
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,946
Yong doesn’t even have a problem with this.

372
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,173
My brother put it behind him, but I haven’t.

373
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,966
Do you know how many months he cried

374
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,660
after the breakup before he could move on?

375
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,953
I think that’s normal for any couple.

376
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:44,753
Really?

377
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,026
She broke up with my brother the day before their wedding.

378
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,220
You still think that’s normal?

379
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,206
Hey.

380
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,493
Can you go and gossip somewhere else?

381
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,920
I want to sleep.

382
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,986
I’m jetlagged.

383
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,066
I’m sorry, Gie.

384
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,600
I just wanted to invite you to work on Phi’s new show.

385
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,986
Hasn’t Yong told you?

386
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,800
He has,

387
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,280
but only that when Phi was popular,

388
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,140
everyone wanted to work with him,

389
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,080
except you.

390
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,360
I want a real collaboration,

391
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,193
not with someone heartless like Phi.

392
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,380
Gie, be honest with me.

393
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:36,150
Phi wasn’t always like this.

394
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,086
You probably remember.

395
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,960
What changed him so much?

396
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,420
I should be the one asking you.

397
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,940
Since the day you disappeared,

398
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,573
Phi suddenly changed

399
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,146
and became this person.

400
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,890
It’s like someone took his heart away.

401
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:31,473
Oh?

402
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,453
Hey.

403
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,540
Why isn’t it coming out?

404
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,073
Hey!

405
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:40,466
Hey, hey, hey!

406
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,640
What are you doing?

407
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,180
You’re going to break the machine.

408
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,526
Yes!

409
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,740
I’ve been working here for over a year.

410
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:06,206
Finally, I get to be on camera!

411
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,780
Woo!

412
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,620
What’s wrong?

413
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,726
What?

414
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,920
Nothing.

415
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,626
Why don’t you look happy at all?

416
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:19,913
Don’t tell me you’re upset

417
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,426
that I’m getting on camera before you.

418
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,920
No.

419
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,406
I told you I prefer working behind the scenes.

420
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,953
Besides, I have such a handsome boyfriend.

421
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,893
I should let him be in front of the camera.

422
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,306
Mmm.

423
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,153
Stop it.

424
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,800
Don’t butter me up.

425
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,746
Did you do something wrong?
Huh?

426
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,813
Did you do something wrong?

427
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:46,360
I didn’t do anything wrong.

428
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,913
I’m just hoping to get something in return.

429
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,980
What?

430
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,700
Do you have a pimple?
Let me pop it.

431
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:00,426
Funny.

432
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,980
You see the CCTV over there?

433
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,113
We’re in the office and you want me to do that?

434
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,240
Are you crazy?

435
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,220
It’s late.

436
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,220
The camera won’t catch us.

437
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,333
Wanna do something fun?

438
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Ouch!

439
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,840
You wanna do this, huh?

440
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,000
You wanna do this?

441
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,946
Come here.

442
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,260
Come here.

443
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,013
You think I won’t dare?

444
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,720
Huh?

445
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,920
Oh.

446
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,786
Oh?
Oh?

447
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,473
Hey!

448
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,173
How do I stop it?

449
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,606
What are you doing?

450
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,693
You’re going to break it.

451
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,086
Here.

452
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,180
You’re amazing, little puppy.

453
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,113
You see?

454
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,206
I’ll always need your help.

455
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,300
Where’s my gift?

456
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,013
Give me a reward.

457
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,746
Woohoo!

458
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,593
I’m finally going to be on camera!

459
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,226
Okay.

460
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,840
I’ve fixed it.

461
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,840
Anything else I can help you with?

462
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,820
No.

463
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,546
You can go.

464
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:09,766
Both of us being here doesn’t get work done any faster.

465
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,440
At least I can make you smile.

466
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,440
Smile?

467
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:27,726
Is he crazy?

468
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,520
Is this my smiling face?

469
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,186
DON’T LET ME CATCH YOU SMILING.

470
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,420
Here.

471
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,413
And this is the CG you asked me to fix.

472
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,386
I’ve already fixed it.

473
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,966
Is it okay?

474
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,206
I told you to change the font color to make it easier to read, didn’t I?

475
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,340
I fixed it according to the brief.

476
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:36,133
It’s red now.

477
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,493
Mr. Tae told you to make it dark red,

478
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,053
but this is medium red,

479
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,513
leaning toward the lighter side.

480
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,093
Go fix it.

481
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
Okay.

482
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,633
What about the costume?

483
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,713
The costume?

484
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,046
The crew said they wanted to go with the Moo Deng theme.

485
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,433
These are some examples.

486
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,940
This is not Moo Deng.

487
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,286
This is a hippo!

488
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,346
Her name is Moo Deng.

489
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,660
Stop talking back.

490
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,393
Mr. Tae means

491
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,613
a real pig that jumps.

492
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,666
Don’t you understand that?

493
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,140
And this script about the relative humidity…

494
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,166
All the information is correct.

495
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,660
I’ve double-checked many times.

496
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,446
I know.

497
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,120
I have eyes.
I’m not stupid.

498
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,260
But…

499
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,720
I have a bit of a sore throat.

500
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:46,093
I don’t really want to pronounce the “s” sound.

501
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,246
Can you remove all the words with “s.”

502
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,660
Aww.

503
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:58,520
I’m just kidding.

504
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,466
I’ll ask the intern to handle it.

505
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,173
Someone like Prince Phi

506
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,713
can only do one thing.

507
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,120
Can you make me coffee?

508
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,400
My coffee has gone cold.

509
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,166
Wipe this too.

510
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,540
Oh, and don’t make it too hot,

511
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,253
so when you throw it on someone,

512
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,086
it won’t sting too much.

513
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:39,733
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

514
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,453
He’s angry now.
He’s angry now.

515
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,813
Throw it.

516
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,946
Throw it on me.

517
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,646
Come on.
Throw it.

518
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,026
So this time, you’ll be out of the industry for real.

519
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,140
I’ll make you a new one.

520
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,206
Okay. Cut.

521
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,200
Thank you so much, everyone.

522
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
We’re doing all this

523
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,606
because we just want you to know

524
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,980
how we’ve been feeling.

525
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,720
Honestly,

526
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,486
I didn’t expect you to actually change.

527
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,460
Well done.

528
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,900
I understand.

529
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,593
Does this mean I pass?

530
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,313
Mmm.

531
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,073
The company’s New Year party is this Saturday.

532
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,070
We’ll be dressing up in themes.

533
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,113
Mr. Tae wants to invite you to join our team.

534
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,913
Since you’ve proven yourself,

535
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,910
I want to keep my promise.

536
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:06,440
My team

537
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,213
is now your team.

538
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,673
We’re on the same team now.

539
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,306
Thank you.

540
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:24,300
Do you need anything?

541
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:25,806
Just go get some rest.

542
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,106
Phi.

543
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,406
You’ve finished filming?

544
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,760
Yeah.

545
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:01,566
Why?

546
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,166
Did you think I was going to run away?

547
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,840
So this means Tae will let his crew help us.

548
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:07,553
Yes!

549
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:18,690
Why are you searching for restaurants?

550
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:20,226
To celebrate?

551
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,780
There’s a New Year party this Saturday.

552
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,020
They want each department to cook and bring their own food.

553
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,533
But I think that’s too boring.

554
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,866
So I’m going to order from my usual restaurant.

555
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:39,380
Oh, that’s your go-to restaurant?

556
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,400
Let me note it down.

557
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,100
Stop it, Phi.

558
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,113
They want us employees to cook and bond,

559
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,646
not use money to solve problems.

560
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,980
I can only make omelets.

561
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,026
Do you want to eat that?

562
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,873
You can only make omelets?

563
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,960
Let me note that down.

564
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,113
I’ll teach you how to cook.

565
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,300
Hey.

566
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,733
This isn’t about work anymore, Mr. Producer.

567
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,073
If you call me Mr. Producer,

568
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,086
you should listen to me, Mr. Reporter.

569
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,653
See you tonight at your place.

570
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,813
“See you tonight at your place?”

571
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,913
I’ve started a fandom for you, Phi.

572
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,910
Fandom?

573
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,006
What fandom?

574
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,453
Braised mackerel again?

575
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,666
Can’t we make something else?

576
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,813
This is a great chance to win everyone over,

577
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,713
so I want you to pick a dish that represents you.

578
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,746
I thought a cold-hearted guy like me

579
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,600
should make Bingsu.

580
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,766
This is the most suitable dish, trust me.

581
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,273
You have a backstory with it.

582
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,300
I’m hungry.

583
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,700
Oh.

584
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,853
There’s only braised mackerel again.

585
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,500
This is so boring.

586
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,800
Hey.

587
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,213
What are you doing?

588
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,306
You know

589
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:00,300
that without you next to me,

590
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,393
I can’t really sleep, Phi.

591
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,206
I’m hungry.

592
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,200
I’ll just eat the braised mackerel.

593
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:12,113
Here.

594
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Can you please reheat it for me?

595
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,673
When you want me to do something for you,

596
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,980
you suddenly get all sweet.

597
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,413
If I can’t be sweet to my boyfriend,

598
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,926
who else would I be sweet to?

599
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,980
Nice one, huh?

600
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,540
Just you wait.

601
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,506
If I get famous one day,

602
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,300
I’ll say goodbye to braised mackerel.

603
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,173
Stop complaining.

604
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,240
Without your mom’s braised mackerel,

605
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
we wouldn’t survive until the end of the month.

606
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,380
More importantly, there’s no tastier one

607
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,973
than the one your mom makes.

608
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,826
You’re right.

609
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
My mom makes the most delicious one.

610
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:07,046
It’s a secret recipe she only shares with our family.

611
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,000
Do you want to join our family?

612
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,055
Do you think…

613
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,963
we’ll get there one day?

614
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,427
Get where?

615
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,150
Marriage?

616
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,283
Of course, we will.

617
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,944
My mom knows we’re together.

618
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,301
I mean,

619
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,880
will you be able to afford to propose to anyone?

620
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:44,701
Please.

621
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,563
Don’t underestimate me.

622
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:46,620
Just you wait.

623
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:49,156
I’m going on camera tomorrow.

624
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,932
Once I’m famous,

625
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:57,587
how about I book IMPACT Arena for our wedding?

626
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:00,260
And I’ll make braised mackerel

627
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,996
the star dish at our Chinese banquet.

628
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,458
Mmm.

629
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,566
I’m hungry.

630
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:14,560
-Hey. -	Hmm?

631
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,621
Tomorrow,

632
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,295
no matter what happens, you have to keep going.

633
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,667
Mmm. I know.

634
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,083
Of course, I’ll keep going.

635
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:30,769
Phi.

636
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,036
I’m serious.

637
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,206
Promise me.

638
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,960
Alright.

639
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,553
I know.

640
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,452
I have you by my side.

641
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:54,701
I have nothing to be afraid of, right?

642
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,535
But right now, I’m hungry.

643
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,993
Is it hot yet?

644
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:01,335
I can’t wait any longer.

645
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,975
Braised mackerel.

646
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:05,433
Braised mackerel.

647
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,704
Whoa!

648
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,895
What are you lost in thought about?

649
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,729
Come help me

650
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:25,298
so you know how to make it.

651
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:33,710
Add a bit more ginger.

652
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:41,729
That’s enough.

653
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:44,147
Now add salt.

654
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,286
Do you remember how much to add,

655
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:50,553
like in your mom’s recipe?

656
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,344
If I did, I’d do it myself.

657
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,440
I wouldn’t need you to teach me.

658
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,535
That’s enough.

659
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,532
Mmm.

660
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,187
This should be ready.

661
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,984
Here, try it.

662
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:27,624
Try it.

663
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,904
How is it?

664
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,120
Does it still taste like before?

665
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:49,895
No.

666
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,861
Nothing is the same anymore.

667
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:05,476
Do you think people will like the food I make?

668
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,483
Of course.

669
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,483
At least, everyone will know how much you care.

670
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,289
Hello!

671
00:40:34,313 --> 00:40:35,193
Come on!

672
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:37,113
Make some noise, everyone.

673
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:41,833
Welcome to GN’s annual party!

674
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:43,433
Woohoo!

675
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:46,400
We have a lot of food today.

676
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,246
Enjoy it.

677
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,421
It’s not from any restaurants.

678
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:50,603
It’s our own cooking.

679
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,806
Check out my food.

680
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:55,138
I made Som Tam.

681
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,529
- Walk around and take a look. - 	Wow!

682
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:57,649
This is so good.

683
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:59,175
Did you really make it yourself, Phi?

684
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,723
Well, you could say that.

685
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,224
Amazing.

686
00:41:05,815 --> 00:41:06,541
It’s delicious, right?
Yeah.

687
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:08,313
Then eat up.

688
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,704
By the way, why are you dressed like that?

689
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,741
I went with this theme

690
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:15,520
because you used to be a hazer.

691
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,246
Oh.

692
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,892
Let him be.

693
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,624
He’s with Tae’s group today.

694
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,304
Oh?

695
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,086
Come on.

696
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,246
I’m just trying to blend in with them

697
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:28,280
so my work can go smoothly.

698
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,886
Ah.

699
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,707
There you are,

700
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,541
Prince Phi.

701
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,424
What’s this?

702
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,187
Our team costume.

703
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,107
If you want to be a part of our team,

704
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,116
you have to wear it.

705
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:51,975
That’s right.

706
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,335
Oh, wait.

707
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:56,830
Are you offended and too scared to wear it?

708
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,600
I think you’re going too far.

709
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah. How could you do this?

710
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,975
Hey, I just love this costume

711
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:17,944
because it got me here.

712
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:25,003
Oh, because Mr. Padtaphi wore this costume while he threw coffee on you, right?

713
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,076
Exactly.

714
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:30,880
So?

715
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,987
Are you going to wear it or not?

716
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,950
If you don’t wear it,

717
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:39,563
it means you don’t want to be on our team.

718
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,310
Okay.

719
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,615
I’ll wear it.

720
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,264
Phi!

721
00:42:50,646 --> 00:42:52,640
Are you really going to work with these people?

722
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,276
Can you find a better team?

723
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,990
I just have to wear it, right?

724
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,412
Yes.

725
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,313
Oh, I think I forgot to mention something.

726
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,516
You have to perform on stage, Mr. Padtaphi.

727
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,107
Oh.

728
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,323
Perform what?

729
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,566
Don’t worry about that, Mr. Phi.

730
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,000
You just need to stand on stage and look handsome.

731
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,409
My two friends and I will take care of the rest.

732
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,590
Oh?

733
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,363
Tam!

734
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,815
Here.

735
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,326
Enjoy your food.

736
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,043
I will.

737
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,929
Take it.

738
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,150
Hey.

739
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,363
Hmm?

740
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,956
Please help our juniors.

741
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,556
No.

742
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,950
Phi has realized his mistakes.

743
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:01,563
I think he’s changed.

744
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,978
Yong, if you don’t stop pestering me,

745
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:08,350
I’ll report your power harassment to HR.

746
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,950
Come on, Gie.

747
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:10,553
No.

748
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,058
It’s sexual harassment if you touch me.

749
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,332
I’ll report it to HR.

750
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,532
Come on, Gie.

751
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,055
Hey!

752
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,504
Stop pestering her.

753
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,627
I can be your camera operator.

754
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,560
You know how?

755
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,003
Kind of.

756
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:37,784
Look, even though Gie is like that,

757
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,907
she has a lot of influence.

758
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,766
If she agrees to help us,

759
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:44,030
other teams will think twice

760
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,298
before saying no to our requests.

761
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,236
I don’t get it.

762
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,138
She did all those things to you.

763
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:51,130
How can you still be friends with her?

764
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,603
We dated for a long time

765
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,320
and went through a lot together.

766
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,396
She probably knows me best.

767
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,950
You talk like I don’t know you.

768
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:03,852
It’s not just about me.

769
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:06,707
Remember that ticket to see LYKN,

770
00:45:06,732 --> 00:45:08,700
the band you’re so crazy about?

771
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,236
Gie was the one who queued up to get it for you.

772
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:14,129
You know that?

773
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:28,307
Yeah.

774
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,283
And now it’s time for fun!

775
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,381
Woo!

776
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:42,160
Each team will come up to perform,

777
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:43,803
starting with this one.

778
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,126
This is so exciting!

779
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,710
The first performance is by Good Days.

780
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:52,000
A reunion of two reporters.

781
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,138
If you’re ready, please enjoy!

782
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:04,295
Alright.

783
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,366
Move a little forward.

784
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,116
Okay.

785
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:07,556
Are you ready, everyone?

786
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,212
3, 4!

787
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:11,987
*Rain, why are you falling?*

788
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,627
*Rain, why are you falling?*

789
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,738
*The reason why it’s raining*

790
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:19,636
*Is because the frogs are crying*

791
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,470
*Why are the frogs crying?*

792
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,246
*Why are the frogs crying?*

793
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,166
*The frogs are crying ​​*

794
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,264
*Because the rice is undercooked*

795
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:31,021
*Why is the rice undercooked?*

796
00:46:31,046 --> 00:46:33,538
*Why is the rice undercooked?*

797
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,827
*The rice is undercooked*

798
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:39,581
*Because the coffee’s spilling, look*

799
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:43,292
Woo!

800
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,630
Woohoo!

801
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,812
Woo!

802
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,538
Make some noise!

803
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,643
Woo!

804
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,526
I warned you, didn’t I?

805
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,680
But people liked it.

806
00:48:05,704 --> 00:48:06,873
I didn’t!

807
00:48:06,904 --> 00:48:08,356
Why do you care?

808
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,240
Huh?

809
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,332
Why do you even care?

810
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,975
The reason I became this person

811
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,227
is because of you, isn’t it?

812
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,966
Huh?

813
00:48:30,793 --> 00:48:32,190
Where are you?

814
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:34,510
Hey, Phi.

815
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,636
Are you ready?

816
00:48:35,661 --> 00:48:37,101
The woman has been waiting for a long time.

817
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,676
Okay.

818
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,507
Come on.
Hurry up.

819
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:40,787
Okay.

820
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,280
On the most important day of my life,

821
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,476
I’ve been working here since my grandparents’ time.

822
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,436
The person I wanted by my side the most…

823
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:03,341
TAWAN: LET’S BREAK UP.

824
00:49:03,372 --> 00:49:05,340
He left me.

825
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,673
He left me to get through that day by myself.

826
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,772
But I have to thank you.

827
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,818
You taught me

828
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:47,212
that being kind to someone

829
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,538
doesn’t mean they’ll return the kindness.

830
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,098
Why not use the time you're making excuses to actually fix the info?

831
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,424
Why are you still standing here?

832
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:02,763
If I want work to turn out well,

833
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,329
I have to put all my feelings aside.

834
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:06,750
Fake news, huh?

835
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,824
And I have to thank you.

836
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,723
Because of you,

837
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,129
I became Prince Phi.

838
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,581
I’m sorry.

839
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,304
I don’t want your apology.

840
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:44,630
I just want to know

841
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,615
why you did that to me that day.

842
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,332
Huh?

843
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,033
Why did you leave me?

844
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,455
LET’S BREAK UP.

845
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,190
Didn’t we agree

846
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,523
to only talk about work?

847
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:43,969
Phi.

848
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Phi.

849
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,800
I’m sorry.

850
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:00,363
I promise that when I’m ready,

851
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:03,261
I’ll tell you everything.

852
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,138
Oh?

853
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,969
I thought Tae agreed to let you borrow some of his crew.

854
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,366
Come on.

855
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:35,360
How can we work with people who treated Phi like that?

856
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:39,981
Please.

857
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,707
You must have seen that Phi has changed.

858
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,264
Yes, Phi has changed.

859
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:51,050
But so has his popularity.

860
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:57,347
When we choose a project to work on,

861
00:52:57,378 --> 00:53:00,953
we want it to be worth our while.

862
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,098
You understand that, right?

863
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,686
Hey, guys.

864
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,406
No!

865
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,726
What should we do?

866
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,972
If we borrow six months’ worth of my salary,

867
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,716
we should be able to hire a subcontractor team for a few episodes.

868
00:53:26,147 --> 00:53:27,218
Knock knock.

869
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,587
I’m applying to be your camera operator.

870
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:30,461
Am I still in time?

871
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,326
You’re too late.

872
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,076
We’re going to hire a subcontractor team.

873
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,824
Are you sure?

874
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,944
If you let me help,

875
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:44,289
I can get the others to fill other roles too.

876
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,993
If you don’t want my help, it’s okay.

877
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,240
Alright.

878
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,409
Fine.

879
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,910
I’ll let Tam decide.

880
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,750
This is for Phi’s sake.

881
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,455
Why did you change your mind?

882
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,920
My previous show just ended.

883
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,486
I don’t want to sit around doing nothing.

884
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,907
Besides, Phi’s braised mackerel is good.

885
00:54:13,926 --> 00:54:14,867
I want to eat more.

886
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,860
Just because of the braised mackerel?

887
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,892
Hey, Phi.

888
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,178
I know you’re still mad at me.

889
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,553
I just want to tell you that

890
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,658
Gaogie has agreed to help our team.

891
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,390
If you’re still not ready to talk, I understand.

892
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,409
Wait.

893
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,027
I’m choking.

894
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:21,526
What’s wrong?
Hey!

895
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,206
Are you okay?

896
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,618
Are you okay?

897
00:55:35,649 --> 00:55:36,726
Thanks.

898
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,424
No worries.

899
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,756
I mean, thanks for getting us help.

900
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,446
Have you stopped being mad at me?

901
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,126
No.

902
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,446
But I’m a little less mad.

903
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:26,978
You’ve been eating that for days.

904
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:28,276
Don’t you get tired of it?

905
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,203
No.

906
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,738
Some food tastes better the longer you keep it.

907
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,470
It’s even better than when it’s freshly cooked.

908
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,904
Does it taste as good as it did back then?

909
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,350
I guess not.

910
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,596
But the current taste is not bad.

911
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:05,889
Here.

912
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,956
Yong asked me to give you this.

913
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,947
I waited like a month to get mine.

914
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,760
Take good care of it

915
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:26,470
and don’t leave me again this time,

916
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,430
Mr. Producer.

917
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,775
(What I have found with you today)

918
00:57:32,793 --> 00:57:36,590
Okay.
*Is better than dreams in every way*

919
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:40,498
*Every minute with you by my side*

920
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,089
*Loving you with our hearts intertwined*

921
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:46,387
*What I understand today is how*

922
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:50,270
*It feels so good to love you now*

923
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:54,147
*Thank you for making me realize*

924
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:59,390
*Love's better than what I imagined in life*

925
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:10,547
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

926
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,510
Your family works in salt farming.

927
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:13,950
Your mom is the community leader.

928
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,132
Trust me.

929
00:58:15,163 --> 00:58:15,920
Let’s cover your family’s story.

930
00:58:15,963 --> 00:58:17,913
You have to do one thing I say.

931
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:19,655
How long have you been with my son?

932
00:58:19,686 --> 00:58:20,892
8 years, Mom.

933
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,052
You haven’t told her we broke up?

934
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:24,830
Make it convincing.

935
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,070
Don’t let go of Phi’s hand.

936
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,015
Once he loves something,
