The only way you can make a comeback

is by creating a new show.

The Ex-Morning is about

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,640
the changes in the relationship between two people

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,600
who were in love with each other but broke up.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Will they be able to get back together or will they break up again?

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Something like that.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,960
These two have been close since they were young,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,680
since they were in school.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,280
They dated.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,080
They had a dream of becoming news reporters.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,160
They wanted to cover news and work in the news industry.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,080
They lived their lives together until they graduated.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
They got their dream job as reporters.

But suddenly—

They broke up.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,320
As you see, they broke up

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,360
and disappeared from each other’s lives.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,600
They didn’t know if they’d see each other again
or in what way.

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,760
How would they feel about each other then?

The trailer shows that someone has returned.

Tell me honestly.

Why did you come back?

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,200
It all started from P’Sing joining GMMTV again.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
They thought about KristSing’s relationship—

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,840
how we used to be together every day,

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,560
then separated to do our own things,

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,320
and then reunited.

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,960
That inspired this story.

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,200
It’s like being in a relationship, breaking up,

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,920
and getting back together.

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,320
It’s something that can apply to the series.

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,360
So they wanted to tell a love story from those perspectives.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
These two characters are really based on KristSing.

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
They’re based on who we really are.

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,320
They based many things about the characters on Krist, Singto,

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,280
and our relationship, and put them into the series.

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,720
It might not be that accurate, but everything relates to KristSingto.

I feel like this show is a comeback for KristSing

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840

everything just clicks.

one of them is an extrovert and the other is an introvert.

Actually, he’s very sensitive when it comes to love.

but in practice, I can’t do it 100%.

and so am I.

180
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Anyway, Tamtawan works as a producer

181
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,800
but I don’t have a clear picture in my head yet

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,160
of whether I can be a producer.

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,520
I think I prefer working with still and moving images or videos.

184
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
Third, Tamtawan is competitive,

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,640
and honestly, I’m like that too.

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,160
In the series, Tamtawan seems composed.

187
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,440
From my point of view, he observes everything and thinks.

188
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,640
He thinks about how he should respond

189
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,680
if Tae approaches him a certain way.

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Every scene I’m in with P’Sing,

191
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,800
his character Tam is always ahead of mine.

192
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,960
He goes along but actually,

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
he’s always one step ahead.

194
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah.

195
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Tamtawan is a composed character.

196
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,160
He seems to care for Padtaphi

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,680
but he always says the opposite of what he means.

198
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,680
He’s a bit stubborn.

199
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,080
He’s observant, but only when it comes to a certain someone.

200
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,400
He really pays attention to Padtaphi

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,720
and since he’s his ex,

202
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
he knows better than I do when Padtaphi isn’t okay with something.

203
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,960
He knows what Padtaphi likes.

204
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,400
He does a great job portraying a character who’s composed

205
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
but pays close attention to Padtaphi.

206
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,360
Tamtawan is polite

207
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
and nice.

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
He’s a talented producer.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
Gaogie wants to work with him.

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,560
She’s seen him since he first started.

211
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
He’s strategic.

212
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Padtaphi is hotheaded

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
but Tamtawan is like cold water that calms him down

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,880
and keeps the work going.

215
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
From what I’ve noticed,

216
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,640
Tamtawan is calm and collected.

217
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,280
There’s something about him that gives his character impact.

218
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,040
P’Sing does a good job portraying his character,

219
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,240
just as P’Krist does with his.

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,160
I’m so glad.

221
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
They’re really amazing.

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,000
I don’t know why you two broke up,

223
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
but from what I’ve seen,

224
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,640
your bond can never be broken.

225
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,000
The footage of you throwing coffee on Tae is everywhere.

226
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,600
The whole country is cursing you out.
SHOW HOST: TAE TREENAT JARUSAKKUL

227
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,080
I don’t like this font.

228
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,920
If I tease you, you won’t get mad.

229
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
I won’t.

230
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
No matter what I do, you won’t get mad.

231
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
I won’t.

232
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,400
Even if I do this, you still won’t get mad.

233
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,320
I won’t.

234
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,400
Oh.

235
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
You’re so cute.

236
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,000
Tae’s personality?

237
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,520
From the initial interpretation with the director, P’Krist, and the others,

238
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
we wanted him to be

239
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,080
this guy who has plans in his head

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,920
and is a bad guy,

241
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
always looking for Phi’s weaknesses

242
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,680
and coming up with ways to damage his reputation.

243
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
But after discussing it more, we thought that’d be too mean.

244
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
So we toned him down and added a bit of comedy.

245
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,040
He’d still come up with plans

246
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,520
but those plans would fail.

247
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,240
My character in this series is very challenging to play.

248
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,360
If you ask what we have in common,

249
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,440
it’s probably what it’s like when I’m with P’Krist.

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
When P’Krist and I are together, we tease each other.

251
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,840
The director wanted that kind of chemistry in the series.

252
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,200
So we added that playfulness between P’Krist and me.

253
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,360
It’s very challenging for me because I’ve never been a reporter.

254
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,880
I feel like it’s something very far from me.

255
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,280
Obviously, I’ve never been a reporter

256
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,760
and I’d never played one.

257
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,160
I didn’t know what the character would be like,

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,080
so that’s challenging for me.

259
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,080
Plus, I have to make Tae mean, but not too mean.

260
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
I didn’t know how to portray him at first.

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
I think it’s so fun that we have Aou in this series.

262
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,360
I feel so good about having talked to P’Backaof that,

263
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,800
if we’re looking for someone who can play the villain,
handle me,

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,520
and is from the younger generation,

265
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,280
only Aou could pull off this character.

266
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,720
Because if it were someone else younger,

267
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,280
they might not dare slap my head,

268
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,000
play with me, tease me, or get on my nerves—

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
and the character wouldn’t feel as complete.

270
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,040
Aou is perfect for the role.

271
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,200
He’s not afraid to play with me at all,

272
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
partly because we’re close in real life.

273
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,160
Aou is my dear brother. He’s a really sweet kid.

274
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Acting with Aou lets us be much more creative.

275
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
We can improvise, add dialogue,

276
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,040
and bring in different emotions.

277
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,880
We fight a lot in the scenes

278
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,040
and we usually don’t follow the script.

279
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,200
We just use the script as bullet points

280
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,520
and perform in our own way.

281
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,840
It’s so much fun to be able to do that in acting.

282
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,160
Aou was the right choice for the role.

283
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,360
He portrays the character of Tae really well.

284
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Hi.

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,640
Hi.

286
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,480
I’m the rain-prevention doll B2.

287
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,360
I’m the rain-prevention doll B1.

288
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,560
We’re here to push the rain away.

289
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
Yay!

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
When Aou is with Krist, they fight all the time.

291
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
They playfully fight,

292
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,960
which makes me wonder if they really love each other.

293
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,400
N’Aou is nice.

294
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,880
I’ve known him since before The Ex-Morning

295
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,560
because he’s close to Krist

296
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,280
and Krist would bring him to see me all the time.

297
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,800
We’d hang out together, and I happened to run into Aou.

298
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,960
We’ve gotten to know each other before this series.

299
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
He’s really sweet.

300
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
Aou? He’s funny.

301
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,320
He’s a nice brother who makes people smile all day.

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
He’s funny.

303
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,920
When we’re tired or stressed on set,

304
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,160
he can always cheer us up.

305
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,840
P’Aou nails making his character so annoying.

306
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,360
In the series, my character Nhudee is on a different team,

307
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,560
but Tae keeps bullying my bias, Padtaphi.

308
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,320
He doesn’t like my bias,

309
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,920
so I don’t like him either.

310
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,040
I’m clear about whose side I’m on.

311
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,240
In the scenes where Tae comes to mess with Padtaphi,

312
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,720
I’ll be like, “Hey, why is he doing this?”

313
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
I want to help Padtaphi.

314
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,640
I play Suvit.

315
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
I’m Tae’s producer and assistant.

316
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
He’s serious and a perfectionist at work.

317
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,680
He always follows Tae, played by Aou, around

318
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,160
to mess with Padtaphi.

319
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,960
They’re rivals.

320
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,920
P’Pod plays Suvit.

321
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,080
He’s the producer of my show.

322
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,960
P’Pod would always help me get back at Padtaphi.

323
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,640
Yeah.

324
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,080
It’s so fun working with P’Pod.

325
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,400
When I crack jokes at him,

326
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,360
even though he doesn’t joke back, he always laughs for me.

327
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,440
He doesn’t really joke back, but he always smiles.

328
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,200
He’ll always smile.

329
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,600
P’Pod plays Tae’s duo.

330
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,320
Since one of them is a producer and one of them is a reporter,

331
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,040
they work together.

332
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,000
They’re a duo who support each other.

333
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,200
They work together to mess with Padtaphi,

334
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,720
plotting together.

335
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,440
Yeah.

336
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,080
Pod plays Tae’s producer.

337
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,760
I think I saw a scene where Pod’s character and Tae

338
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
are plotting something and messing with Padtaphi.

339
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,920
He’s one of the villains I’ll probably deal with later.

340
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,160
I see Pod a lot.

341
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,840
We’re close.

342
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,400
We hang out in real life,
but we’ve really never worked together before.

343
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Because I know him, I call him Pa Pod.

344
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
I think he’s such a gentleman.

345
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
He’s very kind to me.

346
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,120
He takes very good care of me.

347
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,120
But he plays a villain on this show

348
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
and I’m like,

349
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,520
He plays a villain?

350
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
Can he play a villain?

351
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Because in real life, he’s like a male lead

352
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,920
straight out of a TV series.

353
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,640
I doubt if he could play a villain

354
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
but once we hear “Action!”,

355
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
I’m like, why is he so mean?

356
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
Why is he so good at playing this role?

357
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,600
His voice totally changes.

358
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
His heartwarming mood and tone he always has for me

359
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,600
changes to something completely different in the series.

360
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,240
Stay tuned.

361
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,080
He’s cheeky.

362
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,280
I don’t want to see P’Pod in that version.

363
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,080
I don’t want anything to take away the image I have of him.

364
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,840
I prefer the male lead Pod in my memory.

365
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah.

366
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,040
It’s been a while.

367
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,080
Today is fun. It’s my first scene and first day.

368
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,040
(You get to be a DJ.)

369
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,320
I get to be a JD—wait!

370
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,200
(DJ.)

371
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,000
DJ. You got it right.

372
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
I’m Ohm Thitiwat.

373
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,880
I play Paul.

374
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,840
Paul is a senior of Krist’s character,

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Padtaphi.

376
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,640
He’s always supported Padtaphi

377
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,320
from his university days through graduation.

378
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,720
After graduation, as Paul is quite well-off,

379
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,040
he supports Phi and becomes a major sponsor of his show.

380
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,520
Paul is friendly,

381
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,120
approachable, and quite extroverted.

382
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,760
He connects people

383
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,040
and is always ready to help everyone.

384
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
The differences between us are quite clear

385
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,240
because I’m very quiet

386
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,040
and introverted.

387
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
So this character is totally different.

388
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,200
I did a lot of homework on the character Paul

389
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,800
because he’s someone who approaches people—

390
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,960
while I’m not good at that.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,160
It's good to play a character that’s different from me.

392
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,120
Hey, you!

393
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,320
Me?

394
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,080
(Paul, you need to come here.)

395
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,320
Oh, so I see him and I walk over right away?

396
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,280
(Yes.)

397
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,480
I just want to know how I should feel about you.

398
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,280
(How do tough people sleep?)

399
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,240
They sleep like this.

400
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
(Your hair is messy now)

401
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,800
(Your hair won’t look pretty if you sleep like that.)

402
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
I play Gaogie.

403
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
My character is a cool girl

404
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,520
who’s ready to roll

405
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,600
and very sincere when it comes to work.

406
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,840
Gaogie is a photographer,

407
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,640
but not just any photographer.

408
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,360
She films award-winning documentaries.

409
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
She’s passionate about making documentaries,

410
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,080
filming animals, and covering in-depth news stories.

411
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,880
The challenge is I’m quite soft

412
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
but this character isn’t.

413
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,560
She’s straightforward.

414
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,640
Her body language isn’t that of a soft girl.

415
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,680
She’s a talented woman who can handle things on her own.

416
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,840
She’s tough, hands-on, and cool.

417
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,480
I don’t have those qualities, so playing her is a bit of a challenge.

418
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Gaogie is a cool girl.

419
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,840
At first, I was like, P’Jamie is a pretty girl,

420
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
but she’s playing this cool photographer role?

421
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I wasn’t sure how she was going to portray that.

422
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,400
But once P’Jamie got into her character, she’s really cool.

423
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I looked at her and I was like, that’s Gaogie.

424
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,520
P’Jamie plays a character that’s cool,

425
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,720
composed, but caring—

426
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
and that makes her even cooler.

427
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,320
Whenever I look at her,

428
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,160
I think she’s really cool as Gaogie.

429
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,480
P’Jamie and I spend a lot of time together.

430
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,440
We always go to the set on the same days.

431
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,400
We always have scenes together.

432
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,880
That got us so much closer.

433
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,560
We absorb each other’s personalities.

434
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Before, Jamie had a very strict diet

435
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,160
while I didn’t have any discipline at all when it came to eating.

436
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
But since we’ve spent time together, she’s relaxed.

437
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Talking to P’Jamie…

438
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,720
If you look at her face, she might seem composed and quiet,

439
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,480
but once you get to know her, she’s very talkative.

440
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,240
Talking to her is so much fun.

441
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,480
I worked with Jamie on Girl Next Room.

442
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
She played my love interest.

443
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,560
She’s still the same. She’s really nice.

444
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,840
Her acting skills are just as amazing as before.

445
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,440
I’ve seen and worked with Jamie before in Who Are You.

446
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,360
How do I say this?

447
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,920
She’s like an elite.

448
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,280
We can use that word.

449
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,320
She’s very well-mannered and reserved.

450
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,800
Even the way she tilts her neck, it’s very classy.

451
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,760
But her actual lifestyle is very down to earth.

452
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,960
She’d walk to the set if it’s nearby.

453
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,720
She’d walk to the GMMTV building.

454
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Like today, Jamie is walking home after filming this.

455
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,280
The team told her to dress up beautifully and bring her own outfit today,

456
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,480
so she brought a very beautiful black dress.

457
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,400
But when we’re done,

458
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,680
she’ll change into sneakers and walk home in that dress.

459
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,840
Isn’t this cutesy?

460
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,640
(Very cutesy.)

461
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,480
Look at the details of the necklace.

462
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,040
The details.

463
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,400
Your body temperature is high. Ugh!

464
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,240
You should lose some weight!

465
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,240
(Cut.)

466
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Nhudee is a cheerful character.

467
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,960
She’s very energetic.

468
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
Most importantly, she’s a BL girl.

469
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,360
She’s a fangirl

470
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,160
so she wants her bias to succeed in both work and love.

471
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah.

472
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,920
So she tries to help him with everything ผ

473
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,400
I have a position in this series.

474
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,760
I’m the co-producer.

475
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,440
I’m on the same team as Gaogie,

476
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,720
so we work together a lot.

477
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
Nhudee has to help Gaogie work.

478
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,880
I think Nhudee is similar to me, probably when it comes to energy.

479
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,200
Nhudee is very energetic in the series.

480
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,160
She’s so full of energy all day.

481
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,480
I think what we have in common is that we smile a lot,

482
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,240
but she has more energy than me.

483
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,920
Nhudee is an eager rookie.

484
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,440
She’s just become a co-producer.

485
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,920
She has big reactions.

486
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,720
No matter what happens,

487
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,440
she’ll be like “Huh? What’s going on?”

488
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,120
She’s sweet.

489
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,440
Gaogie is composed but Nhudee is cartoon-like.

490
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,440
She’s a little BL girl who’s a fan of Padtaphi.

491
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,840
Yes, she’s a cute character in the series.

492
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,840
Earn’s character helps Padtaphi.

493
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,840
She sees my true colors as a bad guy,

494
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,480
so she helps Padtaphi.

495
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,400
This is actually the first time I’ve worked with Earn,

496
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,040
but she’s so nice.

497
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,760
As for P’Jamie, this is the second time we’ve worked together.

498
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,040
My first series with her was Hidden Agenda.

499
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,560
Yeah. Those two are very lovely.

500
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,920
Actually, I’m still a little afraid to talk to them

501
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,360
but I try during breaks on set.

502
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,320
I wanted everyone on set to interact

503
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,040
so I invited them to film a TikTok clip together.

504
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,840
You probably have already seen it on GMMTV’s account.

505
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
It’s my first time working with N’Earn and she’s so sweet.

506
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,400
I’d seen her around in the company for a while,

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
but had never worked with her before.

508
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,200
This is the first time we've worked together.

509
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,520
She’s a great actor, singer, and dancer.

510
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,960
She’s talented at everything.

511
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,520
I’d never worked with N’Earn before.

512
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,200
This is the first series I’m in with her.

513
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,680
Now that we’ve worked together, I realize she smiles all the time.

514
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Talking to her really brightens my day.

515
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,000
She’s the definition of someone you talk to, and flowers bloom behind.

516
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,920
That’s N’Earn.

517
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
I want everyone to watch her in this series

518
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
because she’s so good.

519
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,640
She really represents Peraya.

520
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Her character is my fan.

521
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,960
She’s a BL girl in the series.

522
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,880
She applies for a job, then meets me and fangirls in secret.

523
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,840
She totally nails her role.

524
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,960
She’s really cute in the series.

525
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,720
Tune in to see this couple.

526
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,960
You need information to present the news!

527
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,560
The audience is going to fall asleep!

528
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey.

529
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,760
What’s going on?

530
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,160
My nostrils were flaring just now.

531
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,880
Let me ask you this.

532
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
He wants to interview farmers about environmental issues.

533
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
Wouldn’t that be boring?

534
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,440
It’s just like what any other channel does.

535
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,520
Besides…

536
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,840
Hold on.

537
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,040
My coffee has spilled.

538
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,800
Make a decision between you two.

539
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,680
I’m sorry.

540
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,240
I couldn’t reach over there

541
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,720
so I grabbed this.

542
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,720
Why did you dump my brother?

543
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,520
I’d never worked with P’Pai before.

544
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
It’s my first time working with him

545
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,240
and I think he’s very mature.

546
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,600
His acting is charming.

547
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,320
I have scenes with him, and he plays the boss.

548
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,640
His character would be very flat if he were serious all the time,

549
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
so P’Pai designed his character.

550
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,280
Watch the series to see what that’s like.

551
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,200
His character has so many dimensions that I feel like

552
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,800
that’s what comedy is supposed to be.

553
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,400
He had to add something to his character to make it funny,

554
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
cute, and easy to approach—

555
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,200
easy enough for Padtaphi to be stubborn around him.

556
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,480
If he were all serious, strict, and bossy,

557
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,960
Padtaphi would never dare be stubborn with him.

558
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,800
That’s why he had to design a new character, one that was very funny.

559
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,360
When you watch, you’ll fall in love with this character.

560
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,640
It’s all about less is more.

561
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,640
The character is so minimal.

562
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
(Take a selfie.)

563
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,560
(Go.)

564
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,520
(Take a selfie.)

565
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,280
(1, 2, 3.)

566
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,120
Are you ready?

567
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,120
What?

568
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
This is a video.

569
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,800
I won’t tell you what the character Yong is like.

570
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,160
I can only say that P’Pai is very handsome.

571
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,760
Just imagine.

572
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,160
P’Pai is quite a bit older than me

573
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,440
but when I see him in the scene.

574
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,840
There’s this scene where he’s dressed so handsomely.

575
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,600
He walks out of the dressing room and I’m like,

576
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,120
“You should be the male lead.”

577
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,440
It was really like that.

578
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
I really had that moment.

579
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,480
His character is a senior whom Padtaphi and Tamtawan highly respect.

580
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
We won’t talk about the respect part right now,

581
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,440
but let’s talk about how handsome P’Pai or Yong is.

582
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,680
His handsomeness is unmatched.

583
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Yong is a very nice boss.

584
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,360
He’s mature

585
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,520
and open-minded.

586
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,920
When Padtaphi makes a mistake,

587
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,160
he gives him the chance to create a new show.

588
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,240
He’s someone I feel comfortable being honest with

589
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,160
because he’s open and willing to give people chances,

590
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,840
but at the same time, I can joke around with him

591
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,560
because he’s humble.

592
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
Yong is played by P’Pai.

593
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,920
In the series, Yong is Nhudee’s older brother

594
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,680
and he’s like the big boss of the team and the company.

595
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,360
He supervises the work processes.

596
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,640
In my opinion, P’Pai is playful and talkative in person.

597
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,800
He’s one of the people who helps break the ice on set.

598
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,880
I’ve noticed that he really loves talking about fish.

599
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
Anyway, once he’s in the scenes,

600
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,400
he becomes more calm and collected.

601
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,640
He really gets into his character Yong

602
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,640
but there’s a child side to Yong

603
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,840
when it comes to his love life.

604
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,840
I’m actually a boss too.

605
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
P’Pai is another boss.

606
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,080
He’s a funny guy in real life.

607
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,560
Talking about how he plays Yong,

608
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,160
I think he does a great job interpreting the character.

609
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
He’s a veteran actor, after all.

610
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,240
His portrayal of the character is cute and charming.

611
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,480
Krist and I laugh all the time when we talk.

612
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,240
We really have to focus when doing scenes together.

613
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,840
P’Pai is a senior who has taught everyone on set.

614
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,760
He’s sweet.

615
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,080
(Turn your face this way.)

616
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
(Wait.)

617
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
(You wonder what’s going on.)

618
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,760
P’Godji plays Rita who’s Yong’s secretary.

619
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,600
She’s such a lovely character.

620
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Mama Godji is lovely herself

621
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,320
and it feels like she’s playing herself in this role.

622
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,760
She’s funny and energetic.

623
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,720
Her costumes are fabulous.

624
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,120
More importantly, she’s also a BL girl.

625
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,880
Rita is like an energetic little girl.

626
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,680
Yeah.

627
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,360
She’s that kind, big sister in the office.

628
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,600
She’s the MC for parties.

629
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
She’s an entertainer who organizes things for us.

630
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,920
She’s like a facilitator for everyone.

631
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,520
In the series,

632
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,400
P’Godji is like the catalyst.

633
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,600
There’s almost nothing to be said,

634
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,600
because Mama Godji’s acting is natural.

635
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,160
It feels like she’s just hanging out on set

636
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,600
and once we hear “Action!”, we wonder if we’re really filming,

637
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,560
because she approaches the scenes differently in each take.

638
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,040
She’d just improvise.

639
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,440
If they don’t say “Cut!”, she’d just keep going.

640
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,240
If we leave the camera there and go eat,

641
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,600
she’d just keep acting on her own.

642
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,320
She has many different ways of performing.

643
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,200
She’s a true professional.

644
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,400
Yeah. Tune in to watch Rita.

645
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,560
She’s the employee who always wants to know

646
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,720
what’s going on with everyone in the office.

647
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Are those two secretly dating?

648
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
Are these two secretly in a talking stage?

649
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,960
What’s going on with these two?

650
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,960
She’s always spying on people.

651
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
She’s the office gossip.

652
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,320
Something like that.

653
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,680
Tune in to see Mama Godji’s acting.

654
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,600
I can say it’s really fun.

655
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
That’s just who Phi is.

656
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Once he loves something,

657
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,960
he doesn’t change his mind easily.

658
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,960
I’ve worked with Mommy Ngek on Teenage Mom The Series.

659
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,960
That was a very long time ago.

660
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,640
That was my first series with GMMTV that wasn’t SOTUS.

661
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,520
Working together again, she still looks as pretty as ever.

662
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,080
She’s a mature woman who takes good care of herself.

663
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,320
She’s so pretty.

664
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,440
She plays a kind mom,

665
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
a local salt farmer.

666
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
Her character lives a simple lifestyle

667
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,920
while she’s so fierce in real life.

668
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,800
She’s really pretty and young-spirited in person.

669
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,440
I think this character is quite different from her personality.

670
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
She has to wear sarongs

671
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,120
and sun hats.

672
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,520
She works as a salt farmer.

673
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,920
It’s a very down-to-earth character.

674
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,280
She’s so lovely.

675
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
She’s really lovely.

676
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,600
I’ve had the opportunity to work with her in many series before.

677
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,200
She even played my mom in another show.

678
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,680
But in this series, she plays Padtaphi’s mom.

679
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,000
As for P’Kwan, I’ve worked with her in many series as well.

680
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,280
We’ve worked together a lot

681
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
and we’re definitely close.

682
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,680
We play mother and son in this series

683
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,240
and we definitely make it look real.

684
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,080
The cat!

685
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,440
That cat’s real name is Chaonang.

686
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Her name in the series is Sosay.

687
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,280
She’s a cat that I pick up and raise.

688
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,440
Is it hard being in the scenes with Sosay?

689
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,160
Very hard.

690
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,840
Because Sosay never stays still.

691
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,400
She keeps walking around.

692
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,840
As soon as we put her down, she starts walking.

693
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,160
She walks out right away and never stays still for us.

694
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,280
It’s hard to get scenes where Sosay looks at the camera,

695
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,680
turns the right way, or walks in at the right moment.

696
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,680
It takes a lot of takes.

697
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,520
Sosay is very important to the storyline,

698
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,760
especially in Padtaphi and Tamtawan’s relationship.

699
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,680
But just how important is she?

700
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,720
Tune in to find out.

701
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
What I can say is, she’s really important.

702
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,840
♪ What I have found with you today ♪

703
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,600
♪ Is better than dreams in every way ♪

704
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,520
We definitely have several songs in the series.

705
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
Mainly, there are solo songs and duets.

706
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,720
Definitely.

707
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,320
Stay tuned to find out how many songs there are and what they are.

708
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
I’ve heard some of them and they’re really good.

709
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,480
If you don’t care about them, that’s your choice.

710
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,480
But you don’t care about my feelings at all.

711
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,960
I’ll cut off…

712
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,560
Cut off feelings.

713
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,040
Cut, as in editing?

714
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,960
Cut ties with him.

715
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,120
The vibe on set is great.

716
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,680
There’s my brother, Krist Perawat,

717
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,240
and P’Sing whom I’ve gotten close to lately.

718
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,760
Everyone is friendly.

719
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,840
All the other cast members too.

720
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,960
That makes it fun being on set.

721
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,480
The director is amazing and talented.

722
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,720
Normally, I work with friends my age,

723
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,560
but here everyone is of different ages.

724
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,880
Some are older, some are younger.

725
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,040
There aren’t any friends my age.

726
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,080
Everyone is nice.

727
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,920
P’Lit, the director,

728
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,640
all the crew members,

729
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,720
and all the coordinators.

730
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,560
They’re all nice.

731
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,320
We’re like a family and we play together.

732
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
It’s fun.

733
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,640
This series is about journalists,

734
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,000
so we mostly film at the office,

735
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,000
except for when we go on site

736
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,720
to show how real reporters work in the field,

737
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,440
covering the news.

738
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,240
The locations are stunning.

739
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
We go to the salt farm and the beach.

740
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,080
The beach they chose is so beautiful.

741
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,080
When I went there, I was blown away by the places they scouted.

742
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,200
The location team is very talented.

743
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,640
And the vibe on set is happy.

744
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,760
The team is funny.

745
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Everyone is.

746
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,400
I laugh so much on set.

747
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,960
We film a lot in the office because that’s where our story is based.

748
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,160
But we’re field reporters

749
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,840
who work on documentaries and on-site scoops

750
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,800
so we also have to go outside a lot.

751
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,800
One day, we went to a salt farm.

752
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,440
There was also a cafe at that salt farm.

753
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,480
It was so beautiful but also very hot.

754
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,400
At the salt farm, there were water channels,

755
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,360
making it a bit hard to find spots to place the cameras.

756
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,520
The cameramen had to go into the salt farm to film.

757
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,200
I felt really bad for them. One of them fell into the water

758
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,360
and the camera almost went in too.

759
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,560
That was us truly going into the field to work on a news scoop

760
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,440
during filming.

761
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,760
Oh, and at the salt farm, there’s a warning sign that says,

762
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,840
“A little guy named Peter lives here,

763
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,040
but don’t be afraid of me. I don’t bite.”

764
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,960
Peter might sound like a dog’s name, but it’s actually a snake.

765
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,880
Yeah.

766
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
I was a bit scared during filming

767
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,800
because I didn’t want to see Peter.

768
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
He’s a non-venomous snake, though.

769
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,360
He’s a salt farm snake.

770
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,880
Move our hands in circles.

771
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,840
Keep going.

772
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,800
He challenged you, so you want to get back at him.

773
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,000
He challenged you, right?

774
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,800
Turn the chair this way.

775
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,680
Turn the chair.

776
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,360
P’Lit.

777
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,240
Lit Samajarn.

778
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,400
P’Lit is very kind.

779
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,600
He’s really nice.

780
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,160
He really indulges our ideas.

781
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
He really does.

782
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,120
I like this way of working

783
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,000
because I think it’s important to share our inputs

784
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,600
and learn from each other.

785
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,920
No one spends more time with us than we do ourselves.

786
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,400
So if he wants to get information to develop characters that truly relate to KristSing

787
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,360
it’s worth listening to both of our opinions.

788
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,160
It’s such a great way to work.

789
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,280
He’s not too strict.

790
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,080
He doesn’t make us feel like he’s against things.

791
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
He’s very flexible with us.

792
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,960
That makes us feel confident to act in our own way,

793
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
suggest how we want to perform,

794
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,720
incorporate parts of who we are here and there,

795
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,720
and adjust how our characters talk.

796
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,120
P’Lit is not strict about the script at all.

797
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Many of you might not know what the actual script is.

798
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
The things we said or acted,

799
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,520
a lot of it is our own ideas.

800
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,120
Yeah.

801
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,440
We let P’Lit take care of the overall of the series.

802
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,520
As for the acting part, he talks to us.

803
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah.

804
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,360
That’s you!

805
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,120
That’s you!

806
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,000
That’s you!

807
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,160
It was going well!

808
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
It was going well!

809
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,160
(“That’s you!” and look at each other’s faces.)

810
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
What makes this series fun is,

811
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,720
first of all, the comedy.

812
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,320
We all know that with KristSing, comedy can be expected.

813
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:44,280
There’s also the fun bickering between Padtaphi and Tamtawan

814
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,360
and the storyline about ex-lovers—

815
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,520
exploring why the ex comes back to help,

816
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,440
Tamtawan’s guilt, and the reason behind his return.

817
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,600
We’ll find out the story behind the series name.

818
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,120
What “Because Exes Change Often” comes from.

819
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,760
First of all, you’ll feel a wave of happiness.

820
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,080
This series is heartwarming.

821
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,080
While it’s a story about two people

822
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,920
who were once a couple but broke up,

823
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,720
experienced some wounds, and reunited,

824
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
when I read the script, act in the scenes, or watch it,

825
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,120
it gives me joy.

826
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,840
We get to see how journalists work.

827
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,680
How they cover news out in the field.

828
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,280
Yeah.

829
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,960
I think it’s fun.

830
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,400
Everyone will get more than just swoon-worthy moments

831
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,600
because we all know the return of P’Krist and P’Sing

832
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,520
will definitely bring something beyond what we’ve seen before.

833
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,600
The chemistry is guaranteed to be great, along with the comedy

834
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,000
and the knowledge.

835
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,160
Being a part of this series,

836
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,040
I’ve learned more about news, journalists,

837
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,720
and their work environment.

838
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,720
Everyone will get swoon-worthy moments,

839
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,600
knowledge, and humor from this series.

840
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,960
It has it all.

841
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,560
You’ll definitely see aspects of love,

842
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
because when people break up with their exes,

843
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,480
many have different ways of thinking.

844
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,840
You’ll get to see the perspective of exes after reuniting to work together

845
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,800
You’ll definitely see each of their perspectives

846
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,960
- and the people around them….
- 	It’ll definitely be relatable to your life.

847
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah.

848
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,440
Some people might not have experience reuniting and working with their exes,

849
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,560
but you’ll get to experience that in this series.

850
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,120
If it were you, would you give your ex a second chance

851
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,120
if they asked to get back with you?

852
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,120
This time, I think the romantic scenes are something really new

853
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,720
for a BL series.

854
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Just stay tuned.

855
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
Something fresh and amazing.

856
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,960
Something you’ve never seen before

857
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,840
and you wonder if that’s even possible.

858
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,840
But nothing too explicit.

859
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,760
Please check out The Ex-Morning

860
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,520
and my character Suvit.

861
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,640
Don’t hate me or throw durians at me yet.

862
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
I might seem like a bad guy in the beginning,

863
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,880
but I’m still a good guy like always.

864
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,400
KristSing’s fans won’t be disappointed with this series.

865
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,960
You’re in for a treat and it’ll definitely be worth the wait.

866
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,760
See you.

867
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,640
The Ex-Morning is another series that has everything.

868
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,960
I think it has it all—

869
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,440
from sad, to lonely, to funny.

870
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,120
It has all the feels and everyone has worked really hard.

871
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,640
Please support the work of everyone—

872
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,640
by P’Krist, P’Sing, and all the others.

873
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,960
I guarantee it’ll be fun.

874
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,320
Stay tuned. I play Tae.

875
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
This character is different from what I’ve done before.

876
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,440
Please support P’Krist and P’Sing too.

877
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,200
Their comeback definitely won’t disappoint you.

878
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,360
As “old” actors, they’ve done a great job with their acting on this show.

879
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,400
Please also support all the other cast members too.

880
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,800
Everyone has given it their all.

881
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,680
Don’t forget to check out The Ex-Morning.

882
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,840
Please watch my character Gaogie.

883
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,800
This role is really challenging for me to play.

884
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,840
Tune in to The Ex-Morning.

885
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,040
All of us have given it our all.

886
