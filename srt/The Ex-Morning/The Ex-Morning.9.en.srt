1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
They say

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,710
you usually end up with what you hate.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,210
Where do you want to go on our date?

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,740
In bed.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,490
How did you win over Gie’s mom?

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,230
You made me like you.

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,020
You can make my mom like you too.

8
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,440
It’s me in the clip you all saw.

9
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,368
Tamtawan and I are really in a relationship.

10
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,728
It feels like the two of us are in a romance movie.

11
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,120
We fight. We break up.

12
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,248
Even though we didn’t have the best start,

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,128
we’re getting a happy ending, don’t you think?

14
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,024
The first good news for you is

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,968
Tae has been removed from Good News.

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,424
Arin is replacing him for now.

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,480
Whether Tae gets fired or not
depends on the board.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,368
What goes around comes around.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,888
What’s the second one?

20
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,380
The even better news is

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,032
they want you

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,712
back on Good Days.

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,880
Same position, same place,

24
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,064
and same time

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,928
as the Forecast Prince.

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,050
Do you want to go back to that?

27
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,440
What challenges are you facing right now?

28
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:21,288
Please share them with us.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,344
We fish in a simple way.

30
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,976
How can we compete with the capitalists’ fishing nets and boats?

31
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,680
They even use tight-mesh nets.

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,392
Whenever they drag those nets,

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,336
they destroy the fishing grounds
we depend on to make a living.

34
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:32,704
Right.

35
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,000
The fish escape

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,208
and we can’t survive

37
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,704
because we can’t catch any fish.

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,200
That’s very sad to hear.

39
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,144
These are the challenges
the locals are facing right now.

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,328
Gaogie.
Hmm?

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,224
I heard a rumor that Phi is being asked
to return to Good Days.

42
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:57,248
Is that true?

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,184
Think about it.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,232
Yong is on set
even though he’s never come before.

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,496
And we got to travel so far
to film this episode.

46
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,568
Isn’t it obvious?

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,760
This is the farewell episode.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,296
Really?

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,784
I’m so happy.

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
I’m finally getting to work
in an air-conditioned studio.

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,456
You wish.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,776
They have their own team.

53
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,408
They only want Phi.

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,960
What? Why?

55
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,128
It’s just a rumor, Nhudee.

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,696
And even if it’s true, Phi won’t leave us.

57
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,128
He’s changed.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,584
Who knows?

59
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,864
If Phi gets to return to Good Days,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
he might go back to his bad habits.

61
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,480
If this show doesn’t get cancelled,

62
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:45,000
they’ll change the host.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,136
The rest of us just need to
keep our heads down and work.

64
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,320
We have no choice.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,232
Hey, you finished packing up, right?

66
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,336
Shall we head to the hotel?

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
I’ve booked rooms for us.

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,984
Come on.

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Thank you.

70
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,270
Here.

71
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:09,768
Thank you.

72
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,344
Hey.

73
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,088
What? Is our honeymoon phase over?

74
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,850
That’s so fast.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Is something wrong?

76
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,536
No, I’m fine.

77
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:24,568
Let’s go.

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,072
Thank you.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,592
I’m sure of it now.

81
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,500
He booked us such a nice hotel.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,440
This is definitely the farewell episode.

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
Here you go.

84
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,848
This is for Phi and Tam’s room.

85
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:53,448
Thank you.

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,128
This is for Gaogie.

87
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,488
Nhudee, you’ll share the room with me.

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,736
Let’s put our stuff in our rooms
and go eat together.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,440
Got it.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay. Let’s go.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,648
The hotel is so fancy, Yong.

92
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:08,792
Why not?

93
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,952
Wow.

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,520
The hotel set this up like it’s for newlyweds.

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,304
I heard they host weddings here all the time.

96
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:25,168
They probably think we’re here for ours.

97
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,460
Turns out it was a good thing you were sick

98
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,072
and we didn’t get to go on that date yet.

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Let’s consider this our honeymoon.

100
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:38,752
What’s wrong?

101
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,352
You’ve seemed off since earlier.

102
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,960
I’m just wondering why Yong is here.

103
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,344
It’s not like he usually comes on set.

104
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:58,272
He probably just took the chance
to come on a beach trip.

105
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:00,848
Look at this.

106
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,528
The hotel is so fancy.

107
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,416
Is it over budget?

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,288
Don’t beat around the bush.

109
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:10,990
What’s on your mind? Tell me.

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,960
What do you think it is?

111
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
Give me a second.

112
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,704
Hello, Yong?

113
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,328
Sure. We’ll come down right away.

114
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,944
Yong wants us downstairs for dinner.

115
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,936
Let’s talk about
what you’re worried about later, okay?

116
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,760
And since we’re in a suite,

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,056
don’t think you can get away from me.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Got it?

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,000
Aren’t you obsessed?

120
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,976
I’ll get changed.

121
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,960
Alright.

122
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,960
We’re going all out.

123
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,616
Thank you so much, Yong.

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,000
Sure.

125
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,624
Be honest,
did you win the lottery or something?

126
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:08,800
Or did you win a girl over?

127
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,832
I’m sure it’s the latter.

128
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,968
That makes more sense.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,064
You won over a girl, right?

130
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,240
No.

131
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
What?

132
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,904
Aren’t you overreacting?

133
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,624
I just brought you to eat good food.

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,944
Do you really have to cry?

135
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,576
Tell me! This is the farewell party, isn’t it?

136
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,064
What farewell?

137
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:31,976
You came on set, put us in a fancy hotel,

138
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,024
and even treated us to amazing food.

139
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,240
You’re cancelling our show, right?

140
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:37,912
What?
Am I right?

141
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,760
It’s weird because you joined us on set.

142
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,048
What? I have to come on set sometimes.

143
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
It’s actually my treat.

144
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Oh.

145
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,488
Paul.

146
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,840
I’m a co-owner of this hotel.

147
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,382
Welcome, everyone.

148
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:59,216
I heard you guys were filming a new episode nearby, so I asked Yong to bring you here.

149
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,360
If I had invited you guys myself, you wouldn’t have wanted to inconvenience me.

150
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,416
Especially Phi.

151
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,304
You would’ve worried about Tam’s feelings.

152
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,976
Yes, Paul wanted to treat us
as the main sponsor of the show.

153
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,232
It’s his wish

154
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,936
so I just made it happen.

155
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,504
Alright, guys?

156
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,350
Let’s eat up!

157
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,464
I thought this was your treat, Yong.

158
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
It’s the same thing.

159
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,592
Make yourself at home, everyone.

160
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:34,744
I really recommend the seafood here

161
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:37,296
because we source it directly
from the fishermen.

162
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,144
We support the locals in the neighborhood.

163
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,672
Not only are you handsome and rich,

164
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,984
but you’re also eco-friendly.

165
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:43,896
You’re amazing.

166
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:44,928
Great.

167
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,960
If anyone wants fresh seafood,
you can contact him.

168
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,888
Oh, hi.

169
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,856
Is that the guy we interviewed today?

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Mm-hmm.

171
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,240
Phi. Tam.

172
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,392
Our hotel holds weddings often.

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,672
If you two are interested in

174
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,300
getting married here, just tell me when.

175
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
I’ll give you a special discount.

176
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Thanks.

177
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,784
This hotel is really pretty.

178
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,528
If you like it, you should come here often.

179
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,432
Just call me. I’ll take special care of you.

180
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:45,984
Hey. Can I join you?

181
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:58,544
I’m not giving up.

182
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,440
What’s wrong?

183
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Wanna have some?

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Squid?

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,648
Oysters? You don’t like oysters.

186
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Shrimp?

187
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:19,488
Want some shrimp?

188
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,650
Well…

189
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,984
If you don’t say something,

190
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:29,344
I’ll think you’re jealous of me and Paul.

191
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,904
Yeah, right.

192
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:34,800
How could a small-time producer like me

193
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:37,688
hold a candle to a beachfront hotel owner?

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,952
You have a point.

195
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,536
Just kidding. Aww.

196
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,136
But you know what that hotel owner
can’t beat this producer at?

197
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:54,104
He doesn’t have anyone
to peel shrimp for him like this.

198
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,728
And besides not having someone
to peel shrimp for him,

199
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,472
he has to peel it himself
and get his hands dirty,

200
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,104
while the producer’s hands stay clean.

201
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,096
Nom.

202
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,368
Come on. Eat this.

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,370
It’s landing now.

204
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,104
Please take a bite.

205
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,816
So sweet.

206
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:29,190
Not the shrimp. We are.

207
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,984
Whoa, oh!

208
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,760
Oh, what kind of shrimp is that?

209
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
I’ve never seen it before.

210
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,992
I guess we can only find it here.

211
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,432
I promise you’re the only one
I’ll ever peel shrimp for, okay?

212
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,864
There, you’re smirking.

213
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:55,904
There you are.

214
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,200
He wants you to try the squid.

215
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,256
It’s so good. Fresh from the sea.

216
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,016
Wow!

217
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,020
It looks really good. Thank you.

218
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Tam,

219
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,296
earlier,

220
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,696
I was just teasing Phi.

221
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,168
Don’t mind me.

222
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,088
Phew, I almost became a homewrecker.

223
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,976
It’s good, though.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,184
Now you know

225
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:25,720
how much Phi loves you, Tam.

226
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,232
Right? I’m so envious.

227
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:30,592
Yeah.

228
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,160
Okay. I won’t take up any more of your time.

229
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,400
I should get back to work.

230
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:37,144
Okay.

231
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,168
Please take care of them.

232
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:46,496
Arin, how’s filming Good Days?

233
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,512
Really? I’m rooting for you.

234
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,128
If you need anything, just call me anytime.

235
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,832
Okay. Bye-bye.

236
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,208
Was that Arin?

237
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,640
What’s going on with you and her?

238
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:05,820
Nothing.

239
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:08,496
We just cheer each other on at work.

240
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
It’s normal.

241
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,896
Stop it.

242
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:15,112
Arin told me she likes you.

243
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,224
Oh, you’re not surprised at all.

244
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,976
She must’ve told you already, right?

245
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
I’m happy for you.

246
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,544
What do you mean?

247
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,064
Why don’t you go public?

248
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,424
These things are all about timing, right?

249
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,390
And there’s a big age gap between us.

250
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,824
People might say I’m crossing the line
with a young coworker.

251
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:43,200
Now I believe you’re really worried
about the age gap.

252
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:45,980
You really sound like an old man.

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,736
Come on. Cheers.

254
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,176
Congratulations.

255
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Can I join you?

256
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,610
Come in.

257
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,140
Do you want me to scrub your back?

258
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,864
Don’t tell me you brought the salt from home.

259
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:18,176
Of course.

260
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,824
How could I not bring such good stuff?

261
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:21,848
Come on.

262
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
I’m ready.

263
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Ah!

264
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,552
I’m curious.

265
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:51,544
How do single people scrub their backs?

266
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,792
I’m your boyfriend.

267
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,200
Why are you bragging?

268
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,768
No, this is me being lovey-dovey.

269
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:02,792
Don’t you know that?

270
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,712
You know nothing.

271
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,448
How’s that lovey-dovey?

272
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,032
Hey!

273
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:21,030
You’re drunk. Go to bed and stop talking!

274
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:21,800
I’m sorry.

275
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:22,824
Go to bed!

276
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
What’s wrong?

277
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,328
I’m curious about what the fisherman said.

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,408
There must be more to it.

279
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,384
I’m sure it’s nothing.

280
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,120
You should stay out of it.

281
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,376
But I have a feeling that…

282
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,544
What do you want?

283
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,832
Do you still want to be on our honeymoon?

284
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,536
Aren’t you going to scrub my back anymore?

285
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I am.

286
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,256
* La la la la la la la la la la *

287
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,696
* La la la la la la *

288
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
What’s wrong with you?

289
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,952
What’s wrong?

290
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,728
Hey! Stop it!

291
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,216
Gie, let me stay with you tonight.

292
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,568
Do I have to set up a tent and sleep outside?

293
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,192
Come on.

294
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,008
Are you fighting with Yong?

295
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,232
No.

296
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,664
I’m just annoyed.

297
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,776
He’s video calling Arin all the time.

298
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:44,144
Oh, they’re in their honeymoon phase.

299
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,840
It gets better once that’s over.

300
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,936
It’s never over for him.

301
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,680
They’re always broken up before it happens.

302
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,912
You’re the only one
who’s tolerated my brother the longest.

303
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,256
Oh, no.

304
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,096
Yong has a soft spot for girls like Arin.

305
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,072
Hmm, looks like I have to
teach Yong a lesson.

306
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
You can take a shower and go to bed first.

307
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,624
Really?

308
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,208
Thank you.

309
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,488
I’ve looked everywhere for you.

310
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,936
Here you are, playing a sad MV.

311
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,560
Can I get a can?

312
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,232
Am I too late?

313
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,696
Did she dump you already?

314
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,016
Not yet.

315
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,808
Then why are you sitting here all sad?

316
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,560
I’m uncomfortable.

317
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,232
I don’t know how to reject Arin.

318
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,360
Whoa, sounding like a real handsome guy.

319
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,432
Why are you breaking up with her?

320
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,430
She’s perfect for you.

321
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,968
Like I said, our age gap is too big.

322
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,448
Your previous ex was way younger.

323
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,584
My family likes girls
with a Chinese background.

324
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,408
I didn’t exactly check that box.

325
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,944
Seriously, what’s holding you back?

326
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,288
Hey, don’t tell me
you’re still hung up on your ex.

327
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,010
Yeah.

328
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
I don’t know.

329
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,080
We joked that if I were still single at 40,

330
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,952
we’d get married.

331
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,384
Deep down,

332
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,192
I’m still waiting.

333
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:28,510
Yong, going from exes to friends
wasn’t easy at all.

334
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Now,

335
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,328
going back from friends to partners?

336
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
That just won’t work.

337
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,320
What if it’s possible?

338
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,288
Do you want to stop wondering?

339
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Yeah.

340
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
What do I have to do?

341
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,272
I don’t think I feel anything.

342
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,688
Me neither.

343
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,696
It’s clear to you now, right?

344
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,408
Excuse me.

345
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,448
Mmm.

346
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,536
I’m taking this call.

347
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:03,568
Mmm.

348
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,832
Hi, Arin.

349
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh, yeah. How are you?

350
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Really?

351
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,552
Oh, shit!

352
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Tam!

353
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,808
I knew you were going to do this.

354
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,500
The ideals you had back in school

355
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,408
The ideals you had back in school
are still the same today.

356
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,672
You haven’t changed either.

357
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:43,336
You ended up following me.

358
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,360
I came to take you back.

359
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:44,632
Let’s go.

360
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:45,656
Wait!

361
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,472
Trust me. Something fishy is going on.

362
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,528
My journalist’s instinct is spot on.

363
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,768
Like I said, I don’t know about that.

364
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,208
I just know you should
leave this to the experts, not you.

365
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,232
Wait!

366
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,580
Let me go up there and check it out for a bit.

367
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,256
Leave.

368
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,792
No!

369
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:12,856
What?

370
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,424
If my instinct is wrong,

371
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,136
I promise I’ll leave right away.

372
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:49,152
Come on.

373
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Come on.

374
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,256
How do we open this?

375
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,712
I told you there’s something fishy.

376
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:19,728
Someone’s coming.

377
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,984
Let’s go and look around.

378
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,416
I think we’re not too far from shore.

379
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,184
We can swim and get there.

380
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,576
Are you crazy? That’s too risky.

381
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,424
It’s riskier if we stay on the boat.

382
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,472
Hey!

383
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:29,744
Hey, stop the boat!

384
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,136
We have intruders!

385
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,090
Let’s go!

386
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:38,256
Hey, go block them over there.

387
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Hey!

388
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,656
Who the hell are you?

389
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,472
Uh, well…

390
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,210
Well…

391
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,728
Hey!

392
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
You!

393
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,616
Get the boat back to shore. Go tell Boss!

394
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,648
Go!

395
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Phi!

396
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Phi!

397
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,370
Phi!

398
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,616
Tam! How are you?

399
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:37,160
Are you okay?

400
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:38,352
I’m fine.

401
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,032
Don’t tell me we’re…

402
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,456
We’re not dead.

403
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:46,984
We’re still alive.

404
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,952
Come on. Can you get up?

405
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Let’s go.

406
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:54,840
Ouch!

407
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:55,864
What’s wrong?

408
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
What’s wrong?

409
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,208
No!

410
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,992
It’s not that bad. Let’s go.

411
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,080
Come on.
Are you sure you’re okay?

412
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:12,816
Yeah.

413
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Are you okay?

414
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:28,184
Ouch!

415
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
What?

416
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Just kidding.

417
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,968
This will have to do for now.

418
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:35,360
Once we get out of here,

419
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,472
we can get you to a doctor.

420
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,928
Do you think anyone will find us?

421
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,810
Yong and the others will be looking for us.

422
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,968
We just have to survive
and wait to be rescued.

423
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,720
It’s like we’re in the movie Cast Away.

424
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:58,384
I told you to stay out of their business.

425
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,728
Who asked you to follow me?

426
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,944
If I hadn’t, you’d be a dead body.

427
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,984
You’d be gone by now.

428
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:06,608
Whatever.

429
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,592
This is not the time to argue.

430
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,544
I think we need to see what we can use.

431
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,630
Hey.

432
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,352
Come on.

433
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,376
Oh.

434
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,016
Look at that.

435
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,024
How many hours was it in the water?

436
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,192
Will it even turn on?

437
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
It’s over.

438
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,730
Do you have anything?

439
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:30,704
Hey!

440
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,984
What?

441
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,832
Lip balm.

442
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,392
Good. My lips are dry right now, idiot.

443
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,576
How is this useful?

444
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,424
At least it keeps your lips from cracking.

445
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,008
But I’ll break your brow.

446
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,568
Are you sure you’re okay?

447
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,024
I’m fine.

448
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I watched this JoCho YouTube channel.

449
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,960
He said if you’re stuck on a desert island,

450
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,168
the one thing you need is water.

451
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,512
Mmm.
Otherwise, you wouldn’t survive.

452
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,072
Mmm.

453
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,432
But if we have to look for a water source
all over the island,

454
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:14,128
Mmm?

455
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:15,904
Your leg will give out.

456
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:21,040
I think the nearest water source
we can see is probably just…

457
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,350
Hey!

458
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Hey!

459
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,730
Coconuts!

460
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,152
Go. We’re safe now.

461
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,490
Me?

462
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,528
I can’t even walk properly.

463
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:34,840
Do you want me to climb the tree?

464
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:35,776
You want me to climb it?

465
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Yes.

466
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Just you wait.

467
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Ah!

468
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,976
Oh!

469
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,200
Do you need help?

470
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:49,632
What can you do? Do it.

471
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
Hey!

472
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,024
Hup!

473
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,800
Ouch! It got into my eyes.

474
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:55,648
See?

475
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:56,832
You hit, I’ll shake.

476
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,976
Hey!

477
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:00,016
Hup!

478
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,272
Hup!
Ah!

479
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:02,600
Are they falling yet?

480
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,768
Ah!

481
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,464
Almost there.
Almost what?

482
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,416
Almost out of energy.

483
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:07,552
I can’t do this anymore.

484
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,992
Then there’s only one way left.

485
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,016
I’ll do it.

486
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,672
I think we’re hopeless.

487
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
I’m hungry. What should I do?

488
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,968
I can’t get hold of them.

489
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,552
Come on, turn on your phones! Both of you!

490
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,480
I’ve looked everywhere but I can’t find them.

491
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,928
Come on, don’t make me worry like this!

492
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,712
Oh!

493
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:48,710
Is something wrong, Yong?

494
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,912
We can’t get hold of Phi and Tam.

495
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,264
We don’t know where they’ve gone.

496
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,200
Oh, maybe they’re hanging out somewhere.

497
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,736
I don’t think so.

498
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,740
Their stuff is still in their room.

499
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,944
I asked the hotel to check the CCTV.

500
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,160
They were last seen

501
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:09,544
going to the pier last night.

502
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
The pier?

503
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:11,992
The pier?

504
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,768
Where are they now?

505
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:15,328
I can’t get hold of them.

506
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,032
Please calm down.

507
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,976
This is my area. I can help you.

508
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Mind your legs.

509
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,392
Do you think they’re worried about us?

510
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,984
Just worry about yourself for now.

511
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:48,080
It’s getting dark.

512
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,912
Let’s build a fire.

513
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,168
Have you watched JoCho’s channel?

514
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,552
He said it’ll get cold when it’s dark.

515
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,944
A fire will keep you warm and safe.

516
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,088
Help me build it.

517
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Mmm.

518
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,048
Oh, forget it!

519
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,368
You watched JoCho’s channel, huh?

520
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,192
Does it work?

521
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,584
You do it then.

522
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:29,832
Please.

523
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,940
I was the leader of
the Wild Boars scout troop.

524
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,528
Leader of the Wild Boars troop?

525
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,384
Let me see it.

526
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:41,104
Start, baby!

527
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,808
Start!

528
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,272
Screw it!

529
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,296
Forget about building the damn fire!

530
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,710
Leader of the Wild Boars troop, huh?

531
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:56,420
Let’s take turns keeping watch tonight.

532
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,832
Wait.

533
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
What now?

534
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,490
Nothing.

535
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,660
Let me stay like this for a little while.

536
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,744
You know what?

537
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:28,144
Even without the fire, we can find warmth.

538
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,888
And there’s the sunset view.

539
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,400
Are you asleep yet?

540
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Mmm.

541
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,144
I thought you’d find it too cold to sleep.

542
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,552
I’m fine.

543
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,336
You tore off your shirt sleeve to wrap
my leg. This is in return for that.

544
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:41,968
You can use my shirt
to keep you warm while you sleep.

545
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,976
Who would’ve thought the only thing

546
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,910
I brought with me
would be this lip balm.

547
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,312
I guess it’s our lucky charm.

548
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:21,208
Then I want you to have it.
It might be your lucky charm.

549
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
For both of us.

550
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,210
But I don’t think it’s that powerful yet.

551
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,232
Really?

552
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Mmm.

553
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
Let me bless it.

554
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,792
Here, I already blessed it.

555
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:50,280
It’ll definitely be powerful now.

556
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:52,540
This is the ultimate charm lip balm

557
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,352
across the realm. Isn’t it cool?

558
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,120
I don’t believe you.

559
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,352
It’s true.

560
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,590
Do you want to try it?

561
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,384
I’m sorry

562
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,968
for causing you all this trouble.

563
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,560
It’s not the first time.

564
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,704
We also got in trouble

565
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,648
when we worked on the drug scoop
for the contest.

566
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,680
But no matter what we face,

567
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,900
things always work out for us in the end, don't they?

568
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,540
I really can’t live without you.

569
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,976
Let’s start over tomorrow, okay?

570
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,728
Can you do it?
Have you reached it?

571
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,648
Hup!

572
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,090
Have you reached it?

573
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,512
Hup!

574
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:27,952
Hey!

575
00:36:27,984 --> 00:36:28,984
It fell!

576
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,008
Yay!
* What I have found with you today *

577
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,456
* Is better than dreams in every way *

578
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:39,776
* Every minute with you by my side *

579
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,560
* Loving you with our hearts intertwined *

580
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,752
* What I understand today is how *

581
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:49,600
* It feels so good to love you now *

582
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,416
* Thank you for making me realize *

583
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:58,608
* Love's better than what I imagined in life *

584
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,992
Do you think this will stay in place?

585
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:03,504
I think it’s strong enough now.

586
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,216
What?
I’m itchy.

587
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:07,272
Something bit me.
Is it an ant?

588
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,008
Can you check?

589
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,792
Oh, no. Take off your shirt.

590
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:11,400
Is it a lot?

591
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:12,424
It’s all over your body.

592
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,304
I’m going to wash myself then.

593
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,984
Yes, go wash in the sea.

594
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:19,016
Go.

595
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,512
* What I have found with you today *

596
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:27,336
* Is better than dreams in every way *

597
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:31,216
* Every minute with you by my side *

598
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,968
* Loving you with our hearts intertwined *

599
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:37,144
* What I understand today is how *

600
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:41,024
* It feels so good to love you now *

601
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:44,864
* Thank you for making me realize *

602
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:50,104
* Love's better than what I imagined in life *

603
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:55,712
Add fuel to the fire.

604
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,584
That girl is a bad person.

605
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:00,672
Stay away from her. She’s a jerk.

606
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,136
She’s done so many bad things.

607
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,928
I wouldn’t be friends with her if I were you.

608
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,568
I meant literal fire.

609
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,260
- I could smack you with this stick!
- Oh.

610
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,312
Here you go.

611
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,768
Trust me. This time it’ll work.

612
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
Let’s go.

613
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:15,608
Hup!

614
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:16,632
There it is!

615
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:18,272
Blow it out!

616
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,496
Now take that off.

617
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,864
Usually around this time,

618
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,976
we’d be discussing work
in the meeting room.

619
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,448
We’ll have cool AC and order yummy food.

620
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,768
And we’d probably argue
about the show concept.

621
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,256
That’s true.

622
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,552
Then Nhudee and Gaogie
would try to stop us.

623
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,648
Mmm.

624
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:54,920
Then Yong would push for a conclusion.

625
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:56,552
Right?

626
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,300
Just talking about that stresses me out.

627
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,350
Being stranded on this island
is not so bad after all.

628
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,630
Right now, we’re just

629
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,384
Tamtawan and Padtaphi. No one knows us.

630
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:19,850
No, when you go back, you’ll be
Padtaphi Sinan, the Forecast Prince.

631
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,530
That’s what you’ve been worried about,
isn’t it?

632
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,320
I understand you.

633
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,992
Don’t worry about me.

634
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,544
I can find something else to do.

635
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,264
I might not go back to that show.

636
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Why not?

637
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,568
If I do, I want to earn my comeback,

638
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,624
not because Tae shot himself in the foot.

639
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:20,416
I want people to see my talent.

640
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,992
Especially you.

641
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I want you to be proud of me.

642
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,368
It’s getting cold.

643
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,960
Let’s go sit by the fire.

644
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,120
No.

645
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:44,096
Let’s go to the fire. It’s cold.

646
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:46,208
I’ll make it hot.

647
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,128
What are you talking about?

648
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,904
Phi!

649
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Hey, Phi!

650
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,370
Phi!

651
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Phi!

652
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,216
I found a rocky nook full of oysters.

653
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,528
We’re safe now.

654
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,976
You’re still not up.

655
00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:52,168
Are you okay?

656
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,952
Why are you burning up?

657
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
This will hurt a bit.

658
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Ouch!

659
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,744
Your wound is infected.

660
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Hang in there.

661
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,976
Wait for me here.

662
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,600
I’m going to the other side of the island.

663
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,740
Maybe I can find people
or something to help you.

664
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,936
Let’s go together.

665
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,864
I won’t leave you.

666
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,510
Ouch!

667
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,728
Ouch!

668
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,030
Phi!

669
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,296
How are you feeling?

670
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,032
Are you okay?

671
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,056
Yeah.

672
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,540
I’m fine.

673
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,248
We’ve reached the other side of the island.

674
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,408
I found a boat.

675
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,960
Is it working?

676
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,552
You should see for yourself.

677
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,504
Can you get up?

678
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Yeah.

679
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,048
Watch out for the rocks.

680
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,824
Where is it?
Over there.

681
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:50,728
That’s the boat I told you about.

682
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:53,960
Wait.

683
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,192
It’s the same boat.

684
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,728
We need to hide.

685
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Let’s go.

686
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,952
What’s that?

687
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,456
Welcome, sir.

688
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,008
Thank you, sir.

689
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,032
Come on.

690
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
Tam.

691
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:43,752
A casino chip.

692
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,568
Remember what the fisherman said?

693
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,336
He seems to be working all the time.

694
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:49,272
When does he rest?

695
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,000
That’s how a businessman is.

696
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:52,368
Time is money.

697
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,520
Of course, he’s busy.

698
00:44:56,544 --> 00:45:01,368
He takes clients on so many yacht trips
to the island every day.

699
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:04,440
All the big spenders.

700
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,480
The casino chips and the money

701
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,984
we found on the boat.

702
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,536
This means

703
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,900
the owner of the boat and the hotel…

704
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,860
The one behind all of this…

705
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,656
I’m so sick of people
with good instincts like you guys.

706
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
Paul.

707
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,256
I brought you on a nice trip

708
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,272
and this is how you repay me?

709
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,800
Let’s make a deal.

710
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,504
Pretend you don’t know anything about this
and I’ll take you back.

711
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,272
How can I be sure you won’t kill us later?

712
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,544
We’re senior and junior
from the same uni, Phi.

713
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,112
Don’t forget that I’m the main sponsor
of your show.

714
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,632
It survives because of my money.

715
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,936
I don’t want your dirty money.

716
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,288
You should clean up your act.

717
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,140
There are so many
good businesses out there.

718
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,968
Why are you involved in this shady one?

719
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,000
Have you heard the saying,

720
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,320
“Once you ride a tiger, you can’t get off?"

721
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,576
Then you and I have different opinions.

722
00:46:32,152 --> 00:46:36,432
In that case, I’ll have to do
what I want to avoid the most.

723
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,088
Hey!

724
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,112
Tam!

725
00:46:42,456 --> 00:46:43,456
Let go!

726
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,888
Let’s go!

727
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,450
Hey!

728
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,810
Ouch!

729
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:03,992
Yong.
Phi!

730
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,256
The police.

731
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:06,296
Phi!

732
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,490
Let go!

733
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,184
How are you guys?

734
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,800
We’re fine.
Hey!

735
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,200
Your hand, Tam!

736
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,380
No!

737
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Tam!

738
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,560
No!

739
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Phi!

740
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,540
Phi! Phi!

741
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:34,048
Phi!
Phi!

742
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,592
Police!
Phi!

743
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:37,648
Someone’s been shot!

744
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,480
Hang in there, Phi.

745
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:40,400
Stay with me.

746
00:47:40,432 --> 00:47:41,472
- Phi!
- Don’t fall asleep!

747
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,920
Phi!

748
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,608
Phi, stay with me!

749
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:45,320
Don’t fall asleep!

750
00:47:45,352 --> 00:47:46,496
Phi, don’t fall asleep!

751
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,960
Phi, stay with me!

752
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:48,496
Phi!

753
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:49,744
Phi, stay with me!

754
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:50,960
Phi!

755
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:56,552
(I really can’t live without you.)

756
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,256
(I won’t leave you.)

757
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:02,992
Phi!

758
00:48:03,104 --> 00:48:04,400
Phi, don’t fall asleep!

759
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,568
Phi, stay with me!

760
00:48:05,608 --> 00:48:06,616
Don’t fall asleep! Phi!

761
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:07,048
Police!

762
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:08,320
Phi!

763
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Police!

764
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,056
Phi!

765
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,184
Hurry, police!

766
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,112
Phi!

767
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:14,296
Wake up!

768
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Phi!

769
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:21,976
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

770
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,952
You also watch my face after sex.

771
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,760
So much for scolding me.

772
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,090
Do you think we’re in a romantic movie?

773
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,240
No,

774
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,384
I think that was

775
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,272
more like an action movie.

776
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:02,570
They don’t do what we just did
in action movies.

777
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,704
Will you marry me?

778
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,420
What?

779
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,576
Tamtawan,

780
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,416
will you marry Padtaphi?

781
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,210
Mmm, yes.

782
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,460
I’ll marry you.

783
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,168
If we make it out alive,

784
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,888
I’ll change this to a real ring.

785
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,232
Do you think you’re the main character or something?

786
00:50:33,256 --> 00:50:34,968
Why are you always acting like a hero?

787
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:37,392
My boyfriend is this cute.

788
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:39,144
I won’t let anyone take him that easily.

789
00:50:39,176 --> 00:50:41,256
I have good news and bad news.

790
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,480
Which one do you want to hear first?

791
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:46,880
This year’s Journalist of the Year Award goes to…

792
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,392
Who’ll present the weather forecast then?

793
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:51,800
The mission to get you back on that thing

794
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,904
is close to succeeding.

795
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:55,040
I’ve kept my promise to you.

796
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
Can we have “The End” show up here?
