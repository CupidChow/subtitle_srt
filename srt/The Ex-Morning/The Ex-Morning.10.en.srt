1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
They both went to the pier last night.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,430
We have intruders!

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,980
When you go back,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,200
you’ll be the Forecast Prince.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,440
I want to earn my comeback.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,130
The casino chips and the money we found on the boat.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,520
The one behind all of this…

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,526
I’m so sick of people with good instincts like you guys.

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,980
Hey!

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,010
Tam!

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,490
Phi! Phi!
Phi!

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Phi!

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,300
Phi!

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,330
Phi, don’t fall asleep!

15
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,779
Phi, stay with me!

16
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,110
Phi!
Don’t fall asleep!

17
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,250
The police are now taking the suspects
into custody for further investigation.

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Hey.

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,900
What?

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Phi!

21
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,590
Don’t leave me.

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,500
I’ll be fine.

23
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,606
My boyfriend is this cute.
How could I leave you?

24
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,920
How could I leave you?

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,370
This is not the time to be funny.

26
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,960
Please wait outside.

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,940
Phi.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,140
Phi.

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,850
Phi, you said you wouldn’t leave me.

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,280
Phi, don’t be still.

31
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,020
No, don’t do this. Wake up, Phi.

32
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,810
Don’t be still like this, Phi.

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,940
Wake up, Phi.

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,970
Boo!

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
What are you doing?

36
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,160
Aww.

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,310
It’s not funny, Phi.

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,180
My boyfriend is this cute.

39
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,910
How could I leave you?

40
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,336
- I’ve been so worried about you.
- Ouch! That hurts.

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,220
It hurts so bad. Can you get the doctor?

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,580
Let’s go!

43
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,620
Let’s go.

44
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,210
No!

45
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,630
Do you think you’re a main character
or something?

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Why are you always acting like a hero

47
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,070
Stop lying still.

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,700
I know you’re pretending to be asleep.

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,220
You’re pranking me again, aren’t you?

50
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,570
Why?

51
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,310
Do you like seeing me worry?

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,120
Too bad for you.

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,120
I can just find someone new.

54
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
I’ll find someone who isn’t a show-off,

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,460
doesn’t snore,

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,930
isn’t stubborn,

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,490
and doesn’t play the hero like you.

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,740
Phi, if you don’t want me to leave,
then wake up already.

59
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,830
Wake up.

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,950
If you don’t want me to leave,

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,740
wake up and scare me now.

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,580
Boo!

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,090
Phi.

64
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Phi.

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,910
Phi, you woke up.

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,340
My boyfriend is this cute.

67
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,330
I won’t let anyone take him that easily.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Here you go.

69
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,750
I don’t have the energy
to sponge-bath myself.

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I’m sore.

71
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,230
I want to sleep.

72
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,350
What should I do?

73
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,450
Huh?

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,650
I’ll help you.

75
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Ouch!

76
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,140
No. Easy, young man.

77
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,350
This is my little bro.

78
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,570
I can take care of him myself.

79
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,220
Right on the spot.

80
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,380
Don’t be too much.

81
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,970
Your little bro is basically mine.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,110
No.

83
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,850
Lean back.

84
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
Don’t be too much.

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,530
Move down a bit.

86
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,210
Be gentle.

87
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,750
I’m being gentle.

88
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,180
I don’t think he’s little.

89
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,040
He is.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Now he’s still my little bro,

91
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,560
but if you don’t stop, he’ll become a big bro.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
What if there’s a reaction?

93
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:25,980
Lower.

94
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,120
Hey.

95
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:32,984
Hi, there.

96
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,096
Hi, Yong.

97
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,456
What’s up?

98
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:36,184
Hi.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,776
You don’t look any better.

100
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:39,800
Your face is red.

101
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,304
Oh, no. The AC isn’t very good.

102
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,640
It’s hot in here.

103
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:43,672
Yeah?

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,432
I have good and bad news.

105
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,000
Which one do you want to hear first?

106
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,080
Can you share both at the same time?

107
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,304
Hmm?

108
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,872
How can I say both at the same time?

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,296
Let’s hear the good news first, then.

110
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,312
Mmm.

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,576
Paul probably won’t get away with it.

112
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,320
The netizens have dug up
a lot of his shady businesses.

113
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,704
It has reached the police and the courts.

114
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,176
He’ll probably be in jail for a long time

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,944
and won’t be able to
bother you guys anymore.

116
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,968
Great.

117
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,552
What’s the bad news?

118
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,328
The bad news is

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,696
your lovey-dovey time
with your boyfriend is over, Phi.

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,360
You have something important waiting.

121
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,032
What is it?

122
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,256
When we went to rescue you,

123
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,936
I recorded a clip.

124
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,128
The news scoop about capitalists
fishing and damaging the environment

125
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,664
led to exposing a shady business.

126
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:41,448
Plus, you showed next-level journalist spirit.

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,032
Your sacrifice has been recognized,

128
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,200
and you’ve been nominated for this year’s Journalist of the Year Award.

129
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,112
What?

130
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,688
Yay!

131
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,920
Alright, here comes the moment
you’ve all been waiting for.

132
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:17,016
This year’s Journalist of the Year Award
goes to…

133
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,360
JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR NOMINEES
PADTAPHI SINAN,
NICHAYA BOONSIRIPAN,
TANAKRIT KHEMASUNAN,
PANUPONG CHAIYO

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Ahem.

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,576
What’s this?

136
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,600
The scoop from the popular journalist
was up for an award,

137
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,984
but why is his producer sitting here all alone?

138
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,104
There was an issue with the footage
due tomorrow, so I had to go fix it.

139
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,960
Don’t you want to know if I won or not?

140
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,968
I didn’t need to watch to know that you won.

141
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:07,312
Why? Couldn’t you go up there
and receive the award without me?

142
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,728
Exactly.

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
I couldn’t have done this without you.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,160
JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR:
PADTAPHI SINAN

145
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,192
Hey!

146
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,400
Thank you for the award.

147
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,784
Many of you probably know
what happened about a year ago.

148
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,424
I honestly didn’t think
I’d make it back to this point.

149
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I actually thought

150
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,896
I’d never get a chance or a place
in this industry again.

151
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,176
But thanks to everyone.

152
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,968
Thank you to the management
for giving me a second chance.

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,232
Thank you to all the crew
for still believing in me.

154
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,928
And thank you so much to everyone
for not leaving me.

155
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:29,768
Lastly, I want to thank one person

156
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,576
who’s stood by me all along.

157
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,336
When I had no one left, not even myself,

158
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,672
and when I didn’t believe in myself,

159
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:42,584
he still believed in me

160
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,928
and helped me find my confidence again.

161
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,648
I want to share this award with him,
my producer.

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,888
Thank you, Tawan.

163
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,120
I’m glad I wasn’t there.

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Otherwise, I’d have to pretend to be touched.

165
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,050
Hey.

166
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,930
The board asked me to return to Good Days.

167
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,848
Last time, you said no
because you wanted to prove yourself.

168
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:32,260
I guess nothing is holding you back now.

169
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
There’s one thing.

170
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,568
The only thing holding me back is that

171
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,312
if they want me back on Good Days,

172
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,368
they have to take my trusted producer too.

173
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,296
The mission to get you back on that thing
is close to succeeding.

174
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,928
Remember what I told you?

175
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:09,344
Because he wanted to wake up
and see his face on the billboard every day.

176
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,930
Yeah.

177
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,424
Actually, I was just kidding.

178
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:16,368
The only one who thought that
and did it was me

179
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,920
because I promised you I’d make it happen

180
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,920
so both of us could wake up
and see our faces there.

181
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
What a talk.

182
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,528
If this were a movie, you’d be kneeling
and asking me to marry you by now.

183
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,904
What? Phi, I’m just kidding.

184
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,770
I’m keeping my promise to you.

185
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,936
Tawan, will you marry me?

186
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
Yes.

187
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,210
Is this the moment I’m supposed to cry?

188
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,928
I’m not going to.

189
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,584
You already are.

190
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Can we have “The End” show up here?

191
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,168
Not yet.

192
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,736
There are still many challenges ahead.

193
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,448
You’ve never invited me back to visit.

194
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,130
We know you’re busy,

195
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,140
so we didn’t want to bother you, right?

196
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:26,232
Mmm.

197
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
That’s all?

198
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,808
What?

199
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,368
Well, Mom…

200
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,656
Well…

201
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,592
Tam wants to tell you something.

202
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Oh.

203
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,184
I want to tell you that

204
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,776
I just realized

205
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,792
it’s time for Sosay to go for a walk.

206
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me take her out.

207
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,408
You can talk to Phi.

208
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:13,992
Yeah.

209
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,256
Uh, Mom, this is braised mackerel.

210
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:20,224
Tam made it for you.

211
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,912
You two are getting married, aren’t you?

212
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,688
There can’t be many things
Tam is scared to tell me directly

213
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,400
because he knows I won’t allow it.

214
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
Mom,

215
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,872
I know I’m not the kind of person
you hoped Tam would end up with,

216
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,928
but I believe I love him
no less than anyone else does.

217
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:55,424
Will you allow me to take care of him
for the rest of my life?

218
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,550
What happened?

219
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,920
Is Mom not okay with it?

220
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,264
You can start thinking about the date.

221
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:24,288
Oh?

222
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,144
But why do you look upset?

223
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,120
I’m okay.

224
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
Seriously, is something wrong?

225
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:33,936
Why did my mom give in so easily?

226
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,536
Actually, she asked me not to tell you,

227
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,400
but if we’re going to get married,

228
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,592
I don’t think
we should keep secrets from each other.

229
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Mom.

230
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Hmm?

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
What?

232
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:08,400
Can I stay with you tonight?

233
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,664
No, I can sleep alone.

234
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,280
Go be with your boyfriend.

235
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,648
Forget him.

236
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,376
I’ll stay with you tonight.

237
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,600
I don’t think I want to get married anymore.

238
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,480
I’m tired of this place.

239
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,980
I want to move back to Australia
to live with you.

240
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,540
Phi told you, didn’t he?

241
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Your mom is losing her vision.

242
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,460
Her eyesight is getting worse and worse.

243
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:09,464
And she can’t move back here because
her regular doctor is in Australia.

244
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,264
Is there any way to cure her?

245
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,472
The only way is to wait for a cornea donor,

246
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,270
but we don’t know when that will happen.

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,176
This is serious. Why didn’t you tell me?

248
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,600
Even if I did, there’s nothing you could do.

249
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,168
Of course, there is.

250
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,960
I could move back with you
and take care of you.

251
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,944
Then once you recover,
I could come back here and get married.

252
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,808
Do you know why your dad and I broke up?

253
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,688
Because he cheated on you.

254
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,880
Because I had to move away for work.

255
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:11,440
When you’re apart, things change.

256
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:17,448
Long distance relationships aren't easy at all.

257
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,940
I don’t want you to go through what I did.

258
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,072
But you need someone to take care of you.

259
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:30,016
Oh, don’t worry about me.

260
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:33,208
I have so many people
to take care of me over there.

261
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:38,820
I’ve planned everything.

262
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,264
Tam…

263
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,504
Can I see you on your happiest day?

264
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,424
Hmm?

265
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:03,920
Don’t be a crybaby.

266
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,856
I love you.

267
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:12,552
I love you too, Mom.

268
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,784
And you’re back with us

269
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,780
just like every morning.

270
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:45,704
Wait, but you’re sitting next to me today.

271
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:48,392
Who’ll present the weather forecast then?

272
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,390
Why don’t you guess?

273
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:53,904
Here’s a hint. It’s someone
you’ve all been waiting to see again.

274
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:56,136
You want me to make a comeback in this costume?

275
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:57,536
Are you pranking me?

276
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,540
This is the most suitable costume.

277
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,304
Just don’t throw coffee on anyone again.

278
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,448
I know.

279
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:10,152
Don’t you have to go see your mom off?

280
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,128
No.

281
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,272
She asked to go by herself
and will come back right before the wedding.

282
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,720
He’s nicknamed the Forecast Prince

283
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:23,168
and just won Journalist of the Year.

284
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,440
Meet our Forecast Prince, Padtaphi!

285
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,408
See? I told you
it’s better to have me take care of you.

286
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Tam!

287
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Tawan.

288
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:06,552
Hmm?

289
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,480
Thanks.

290
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,576
This is nothing.

291
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,152
I mean, thanks for getting me back here.

292
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,040
Please go take care of your mom.

293
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,920
I know you’re worried about her.

294
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,504
I’m fine now.

295
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,640
Phi.

296
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,224
I can wait.

297
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:43,100
I waited for you for three years.

298
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,632
At least I know the reason this time.

299
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,008
Thank you.

300
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,944
We still have many challenges ahead.

301
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,232
We have to fight, don’t we?

302
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,392
I know you don’t want me to end up like you,

303
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,904
but I want you to know that

304
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,840
Phi is not like Dad.

305
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,480
Speaking of.

306
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,760
(The previous rainy seasons left many
dealing with floods and hopelessness.)

307
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,808
FORECAST PRINCE

308
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,780
They’re too scared to grow anything again.

309
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,896
(But I believe that if we don’t give up, )

310
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:40,984
Isn’t he cool?

311
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,256
- He’s my boyfriend.
- (and learn from the past, )

312
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,176
One day, rain will bring the dry,
barren land back to life.

313
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,960
Let’s fight together.

314
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,488
You’re brave.

315
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,450
You know what?

316
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,520
Long distance can make or break
a relationship.

317
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:07,184
Many couples don’t make it.

318
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,792
Yeah, he and I also broke up
when I went abroad.

319
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,528
I also broke up with my ex

320
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,912
who went abroad as an exchange student.

321
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,432
Thank you.

322
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:19,096
You guys are being really helpful.

323
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,944
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

324
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Come on.

325
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,048
I know you can do it.

326
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I think.

327
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,440
Oh, you’re not making me feel better.

328
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,992
2 YEARS LATER

329
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,560
Out of the blue, I feel so strange

330
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,344
Can’t seem to keep my heartbeat tamed

331
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:59,928
I tried to fight, ignore the signs

332
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,624
But your face keeps running through my mind

333
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,720
It’s kinda strange

334
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,016
How I keep hiding from your gaze

335
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,248
I don’t wanna admit it, but I must say

336
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:13,000
I think I’ve fallen all the way… um

337
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,408
Each morning, I rise and shine

338
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,960
But you’re the only thing on my mind

339
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:20,288
Just one soft whisper in my ear

340
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:22,968
And I’m lost in dreams right here

341
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:26,376
Good morning, good, good, good morning

342
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,120
Thank you.

343
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:29,232
It's you so I won't fight anymore

344
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:30,752
Oh, hi, Praew.

345
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:32,144
Here’s food support from the Prince fandom.

346
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,368
Oh!

347
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,472
We have a new member in our fandom.

348
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:37,944
Hope you two stay healthy.

349
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,600
Thank you.

350
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:39,624
Alright.

351
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:43,940
Camera 2 and 3, please check the lenses.

352
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,608
They were replaced yesterday.

353
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,360
News team, is our news clear today?

354
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:50,616
Make sure you all have the info.

355
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:51,648
Hi, everyone.

356
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,272
Thank you.

357
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,304
Thank you.

358
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,152
How’s the CG I asked you to fix?

359
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,264
Here it is.

360
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:01,144
Hmm.

361
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,200
It’s amazing.

362
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,490
Well done.

363
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,928
You’ve gotten so much better.

364
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:06,424
Thank you.
Thank you.

365
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:08,224
Let me see.

366
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,360
There’s still a mistake.

367
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,136
I’m sorry.

368
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,776
It’s okay, but please pay more attention
to the details next time

369
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:19,920
Our job affects how people live.

370
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,184
We can’t afford to make mistakes.

371
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:21,704
Got it.
Keep going.

372
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Thank you so much.

373
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,608
Come on, everyone.
Let’s do it.

374
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Let’s go all out.

375
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,936
Let’s go all out, guys.

376
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,670
Come on!

377
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,712
Let’s get set and
start the countdown to going on air.

378
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,768
This is the new format of the show.

379
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,296
I’ve come up with four options.

380
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,050
Please choose.

381
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,736
Only four options?

382
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,020
They gave us a chance to make a comeback

383
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:44,656
If we don’t do it right,

384
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,400
how can we take back the throne from Phi?

385
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
I like the one on the right.

386
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,992
Me too.

387
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:53,552
Right?

388
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,568
Yeah.

389
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,110
Hey!

390
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,776
What?

391
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,224
I came to make coffee.

392
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,832
Do you want some?

393
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:03,904
I’ll make it for you.

394
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,250
Uh…

395
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:08,632
Is this your cup?

396
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,150
I’m not going to throw coffee on you.

397
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah, it’s my cup.

398
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:24,392
He showed up without making a sound.

399
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,416
Tae.

400
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,104
I’m sorry for anything bad
I may have done to you in the past.

401
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,928
I was a bit too cocky.

402
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,296
Okay.

403
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:43,912
I’m sorry too.

404
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,088
But this doesn’t mean I’m backing down.

405
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,350
Good.

406
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,352
From now on,

407
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,872
let’s make it a fair fight for the viewers.

408
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,704
For the viewers.

409
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,400
I put in 10 spoons of sugar, you know?

410
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:10,736
What?

411
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:11,744
Are you serious?

412
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,776
Just kidding.

413
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:17,912
Sorry.

414
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,816
I’m exhausted.

415
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,048
After I finished filming Good Days,

416
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:25,072
I had to get ready for The Ex-Morning right after.

417
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,608
Who told you

418
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,408
to work on two shows at the same time?

419
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,120
The Ex-Morning is a show
we came up with together.

420
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,664
I can’t leave it.

421
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,032
By the way, Phi,

422
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,936
for our anniversary this year,

423
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,080
I think I can finally come back.

424
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Really?

425
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Yes!

426
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Phi.

427
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Hmm?

428
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,072
Can you play the guitar for me?

429
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,728
What’s gotten into you?

430
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:55,000
Does Sosay want to hear it?

431
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,864
His dad wants to hear it.

432
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Okay.

433
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,008
Someday, there might be times
when we are apart

434
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:44,352
Sometimes, it’s just the distance

435
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:48,648
Separating us, despite the miles between

436
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,768
But never our hearts

437
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,240
Remember, through the years,
you're still my someone

438
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:05,376
Your importance is clear,
no need to question

439
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,672
When we meet, with just a gaze,
no need to say anything ‘cause

440
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,880
This is perfect.

441
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,536
The aquarium just welcomed
a new baby turtle called Baby King.

442
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:21,944
He’s viral right now.

443
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:23,288
Really? He’s cute, right?

444
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,232
But I look like a kappa wearing this.

445
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,584
No, you don’t.

446
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,568
By the way, the setup today is extra.

447
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,392
Be careful not to fade into the background.

448
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,952
Please. I’m Prince Phi.

449
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:38,968
I’ll never fade into the background.

450
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,064
Great.
Let’s do it.

451
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Go!

452
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,888
This is perfect.

453
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,032
TAWAN: HEY, I NEED TO CANCEL SATURDAY. I’M NOT COMING BACK.

454
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:57,030
SORRY.

455
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,456
And that’s all for our morning news today.

456
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:08,568
Next, let’s get the weather report
from the Forecast Prince,

457
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,570
Padtaphi!

458
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,776
Peekaboo!

459
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,104
Hi, everyone.

460
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:21,952
FORECAST PRINCE
I had to turn myself into Baby King
because he’s so popular that I couldn’t resist.

461
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:25,952
Let’s check today’s weather
and see if it’s hot like Baby King.

462
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,464
Let’s see it.

463
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,928
Hi, everyone.

464
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:35,488
I’m Tamtawan, Padtaphi’s former producer.

465
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:38,808
Let me take over the weather report today.

466
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,944
The sky is bright and clear today,
with no storms at sea.

467
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,410
It’s perfect for long distance travel.

468
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,416
I even moved up my trip to today.

469
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:19,584
What a grand gesture.

470
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,224
My mom has been treated
and her vision is back to normal now.

471
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,360
Do you want to pick up the conversation where we left off?

472
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,680
About what?

473
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,376
If this is about replacing my show’s producer,

474
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:35,936
Nhudee is already doing that.

475
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,944
I think you know what I want to talk about.

476
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,895
Oh, I totally forgot. What is it about?

477
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,280
I have no idea.

478
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,144
Will you marry me, Padtaphi?

479
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Yes.

480
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:55,400
You’ve been eating so much abroad,
you’ve turned into a chubby baby.

481
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,400
Once I take off this belly, I’ll be slim again.

482
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,832
Excuse me,
can you roll the end credits now?

483
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:05,472
You want this to end already?

484
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:06,912
Maybe not.

485
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
Stop it!

486
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:11,930
Stop it!

487
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:13,250
Wait.

488
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,350
Congratulations.

489
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,208
Hold on, did you all know?

490
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,970
- Everyone knew.
- You planned this?

491
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,120
You guys knew too?

492
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:21,144
It wouldn’t have been fun if you’d known.

493
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,840
So sneaky.

494
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:23,920
Woo!

495
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:28,944
Wow!

496
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,944
Thank you. That’s so pretty.

497
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,664
It’s pretty, but…

498
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:36,808
Hey!

499
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,450
What?

500
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,296
The stage is several centimeters
smaller than what we agreed on.

501
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:44,272
And I asked them to
put two more speakers on stage,

502
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,904
but they haven’t.

503
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,912
And the food. Have you tasted the food
after they made the changes for us?

504
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:51,910
Have you?

505
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,576
Come on. Take it easy, Mr. Producer.

506
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,216
You’re even more serious now
than when you’re working on a show.

507
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,760
I have to be. This is once-in-a-lifetime.

508
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:00,776
What about you?

509
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,216
Have you prepared the script
to say on stage?

510
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Why would I have to?

511
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,000
I’m Journalist of the Year. I can improvise.

512
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:06,940
No!

513
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:08,296
You can’t improvise!

514
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:10,160
This is once-in-a-lifetime, Phi.

515
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I don’t care.

516
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,983
If you don’t let me review your script,

517
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,024
I won’t marry you

518
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,176
Did I just get scolded?

519
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,912
What was that?

520
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,736
Oh, is it too late to change my mind?

521
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,152
This is exciting, right, Mom?

522
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:41,296
Hey, it’s time!

523
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:42,752
Everyone, get ready!

524
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,688
Are you ready, Phi?
Yes.

525
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:45,128
Are you ready, Mom?
Yes.

526
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:47,504
Shall we go now?

527
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,544
Wait! Wait! Wait!

528
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:50,552
Wait! Wait! Wait!

529
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:52,296
Come on!

530
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:53,240
What time were you supposed to arrive?

531
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:54,320
Come on, help us with these.

532
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,176
Yeah.

533
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,928
Go stand in front.

534
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,376
Move a bit away from each other. Yes.

535
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,288
Make room for walking.

536
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,392
That’s right.

537
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,760
The desserts should be at the front.

538
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,072
Then the fruits and the trays.

539
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,400
You guys are good right here.

540
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,072
Oh, I’m so excited!

541
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,776
Banana trees at the back, please.

542
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:10,696
Long drums are ready.

543
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,888
Okay, very good.

544
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,336
Get in line and take your positions, everyone.

545
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:15,888
Oh, are you ready, Tam?

546
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,744
Yes.
Tam’s mom, are you ready?

547
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:18,170
So ready.

548
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,192
Okay.

549
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,456
Everyone, get ready to start the procession!

550
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,712
Woo!

551
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:25,632
Ho!

552
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:27,480
He-ho, he-ho, he-ho, he-ho, he-ho…

553
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:29,328
Ho!

554
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:31,552
Hew!

555
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:32,928
Ho!

556
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,672
He-ho, he-ho,

557
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:39,936
He-ho, he-ho, he-ho, he-ho, he-hoooy

558
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:43,896
Hew!

559
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Hey!

560
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:54,136
Whoa.

561
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,640
We need to pay now, Mom.

562
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:58,920
Thank you.

563
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,150
Here.

564
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,144
Here.
Thank you.

565
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:07,344
Will you let us through now?

566
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Yes.

567
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,360
Watch out!

568
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:12,392
Hey!

569
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,960
Hey, hey, hey!

570
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,208
Mom, money alone isn’t enough
to get you through this gate.

571
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:18,656
Oh?

572
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:22,112
Phi needs to answer questions
to prove he really knows Tam.

573
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:24,960
If you get the answers wrong,
you won’t be able to pass this gate, Tam.

574
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh.

575
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,952
Bring it, Gaogie.

576
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,352
What’s the first movie you watched together?

577
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:33,384
SOTUS The Series.

578
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,024
Not a series. I’m asking about a movie.

579
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:38,280
Oh, right.

580
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:41,120
What did you eat on your first date?

581
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,736
I remember it clearly.

582
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,544
Bingsu. He hasn’t even paid me for it.

583
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,184
Correct.

584
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,448
I invited Tam to my room to watch
our first movie together, About Time.

585
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh.

586
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:52,320
Last one.

587
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:53,952
This is a killer question.

588
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:57,200
What’s Phi’s all-time favorite song?

589
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,200
His favorite song?

590
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,680
I’m not sure.

591
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:01,696
Give me a second to decide.

592
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Oh!

593
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,488
“Decide” by B5.

594
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:05,920
That’s correct!

595
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,032
His favorite song…
No one knows.

596
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,208
“No one knows” by Peck Palitchoke
is correct!

597
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,200
How did you get that right?

598
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,456
He’s always right.

599
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,928
You may pass through.

600
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,448
Thank you.

601
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,288
What? You’re doing this, Mom?

602
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Are you up for it?

603
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,320
For this last gate,

604
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,416
you must get the moms’ approval
to pass through.

605
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,216
Would you like cash or a bank transfer?

606
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,592
Whoa!

607
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:57,776
Show the QR code.

608
00:38:57,808 --> 00:39:00,208
Let’s start with Tam’s mom.

609
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,704
You never knew
how much Phi loves him, right?

610
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,104
That’s right.

611
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,608
How much do you love him?

612
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:09,632
I love him so much, Mom.

613
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,200
We didn’t hear that, right?

614
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,112
Phi, can you go on stage?

615
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,488
Go up there

616
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,872
and shout how much you love Tam.

617
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:20,536
I can do it.

618
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,152
I can even run 54 laps.

619
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,840
Whoa!

620
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,232
I think Phi watched SOTUS too much.

621
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,384
Let’s hear it!

622
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:31,448
What’s the question again?

623
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:34,248
How much do you love Tam?

624
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,176
I love Tamtawan the most!

625
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,648
I love Tamtawan so much!

626
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,104
I love Tamtawan so damn much!

627
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
Okay.

628
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,520
Thank you, Mom, for giving us a chance.

629
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,328
I once told Phi that when he gets married,

630
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:35,544
I’d
tell him my secret braised mackerel recipe.

631
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,032
Actually, besides the salt I make myself,

632
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,784
I do the rest like everyone else.

633
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:46,592
Oh? But your braised mackerel
tastes better than anyone else’s.

634
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,920
When you come home after a run to
a hot meal, of course you’d find it delicious.

635
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,920
That’s the secret.

636
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,968
Make your home the place where ordinary
food feels special when you eat it together.

637
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,264
Thank you, Mom,

638
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,896
for giving Tam to someone like me.

639
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It’s alright.

640
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,952
To make your marriage last,

641
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,576
when one of you is fire, the other must be oil.

642
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,592
Do you mean water?

643
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,664
Oil is correct.

644
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,704
Many couples are afraid of fighting.

645
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:40,408
When there are problems,
they only want to put out the fire.

646
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:43,280
In the end, the problems don’t get solved,

647
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,280
and they become indifferent to each other

648
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,940
Just like your dad and me.

649
00:41:56,032 --> 00:42:01,136
You have to keep the fire burning
in your marriage. Don’t let the coals go cold.

650
00:42:01,176 --> 00:42:03,680
If you don’t feel the spark
when you see each other’s faces,

651
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:05,456
then what’s the point of
staying together, right?

652
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,384
Totally, Mom.

653
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,240
Don’t worry about the spark.

654
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,600
Just hearing you talk about this makes me
want to skip to the wedding night already.

655
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,580
We still have the water blessing ceremony.

656
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,912
Oh.

657
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,280
I was in too much of a hurry.

658
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:19,272
Let’s hug our moms.

659
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
Come on.

660
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:23,464
Come on.

661
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,688
Wishing you lots of happiness.

662
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,168
- Thank you.
- Wishing you happiness.

663
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,060
You said the weather
would be good today, Prince.

664
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,928
I heard it from Tae.

665
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,128
Wait, what does that have to do with me?

666
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:50,224
Just kidding.

667
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:53,550
The weather is always changing.

668
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,800
No matter how hard we try
to take care of things, there can be mistakes.

669
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,792
What should we do?

670
00:43:59,824 --> 00:44:01,184
Should we go in and start drinking beer?

671
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,840
I’ll tell them to let us into the Thai house.

672
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:05,152
You already had warm-up drinks
this morning.

673
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,112
Just a little.

674
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,072
Do I smell?

675
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
Hey.

676
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,624
Your favorite movie is About Time, right?

677
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,296
Are you thinking about
the same scene I am?

678
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Let’s go.

679
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:36,752
Hey!

680
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:37,776
What?

681
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:49,272
What do we do, Yong?

682
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,040
Let’s go!

683
00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:52,480
Oh, alright!

684
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,784
It’s like the rain knew exactly when to stop.

685
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:58,760
Next up,

686
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:04,152
our grooms will share their heartfelt words
with each other.

687
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:08,720
Let’s welcome Mr. Tamtawan
and Mr. Padtaphi.

688
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,944
Come on up.

689
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,904
Woo!

690
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,344
Both are handsome!

691
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,848
Well, I tried to prepare my script all night

692
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,904
because he said if I improvised,
he wouldn’t marry me.

693
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,088
But I don’t think I can use it anymore.

694
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,712
The two of us are actually so different.

695
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,440
Phi is always ready to charge ahead,

696
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,960
while I prefer to make sure
everything is ready first.

697
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,920
I get scared easily.

698
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,560
That’s why I don’t like change,

699
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:10,970
even though I keep changing myself.

700
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,424
But now I know that
no matter how much we prepare,

701
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:19,344
it’s still not enough.

702
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,912
I even prepared souvenirs
to chase the rain away.

703
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:33,944
Today, I realized that
the best way to deal with change

704
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,088
is having someone

705
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,672
who will walk with you through every change.

706
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,520
For me, that person is Phi.

707
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,664
Woo!

708
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,544
So sweet!

709
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Um…

710
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,064
I have to thank my ex

711
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,936
for always changing

712
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,920
and turning me into a very adaptable person.

713
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,632
But from now on, no matter what changes,

714
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,160
one thing will never change.

715
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,888
That’s my love for Tamtawan.

716
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,360
Well said, right?

717
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:41,832
Thank you.

718
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,632
The moms are swooning.

719
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,536
So sweet! Now kiss!

720
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,280
Come on!
Kiss!

721
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:50,680
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

722
00:48:50,736 --> 00:48:52,264
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

723
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,432
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

724
00:48:53,456 --> 00:48:55,272
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

725
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:56,296
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

726
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,328
That’s crazy! Who would do that?

727
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:06,656
Can you please do it though?

728
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,832
Can you hold the mic?

729
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,120
Let’s see it!

730
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:29,112
Woo!

731
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,152
And now,

732
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:47,856
the next part is
what the girls have been waiting for.

733
00:49:47,912 --> 00:49:51,632
Our grooms will throw the bouquet.

734
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:53,840
Don’t you want to join them?

735
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,672
Please. Love is an illusion.

736
00:49:56,688 --> 00:49:58,312
Food is real.

737
00:49:58,930 --> 00:49:59,648
I’d rather eat.

738
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,184
Go ahead.

739
00:50:01,224 --> 00:50:02,024
Go catch the bouquet.

740
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:03,236
Do you think it’s a good idea?

741
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,112
Yeah. Come on.

742
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:05,190
Ah!

743
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:07,190
Whoa!

744
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,960
Throw it once, Phi, Tam.

745
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:12,896
Just once.

746
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:15,200
No rehearsals.

747
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:17,200
Ready, everyone?

748
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,864
1, 2.

749
00:50:19,904 --> 00:50:20,904
Hold on.

750
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,696
Let’s this coach get in on the action too!

751
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,912
Come on!

752
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:30,104
I’m ready! Here I come!

753
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:31,832
Ready?

754
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:34,416
1, 2, 3!

755
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Ah!

756
00:50:52,864 --> 00:50:54,144
Here you go.

757
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,792
Hey, Yong!

758
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,216
Will things change with another pair of exes?

759
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,544
Take care of her.

760
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:04,624
Don’t be crazy.

761
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,024
You’re next.

762
00:51:08,056 --> 00:51:09,136
For sure.

763
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,144
Finally, it’s over.

764
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,576
It’s been a long day.

765
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:23,616
Yeah.

766
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,064
Wait.

767
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,744
You’re not tired?

768
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,176
You’re impatient, aren’t you?
What?

769
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:39,552
What are you doing?

770
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:40,792
Don’t be funny.

771
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,472
I’m going to take a shower.

772
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:44,216
I’ve been in the rain all day.

773
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,250
What are you thinking about?

774
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,200
Wait.

775
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,816
I don’t want to take a shower yet.

776
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,888
Why not? Do you want to do it here?

777
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,860
Let’s open the curtain and show everyone.

778
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,720
You think I don’t dare?

779
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,410
Phi.

780
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,432
You’re speechless, aren’t you?

781
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,656
The fans pooled money to congratulate us.

782
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:05,904
Finally, our dream came true.

783
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,608
From two kids watching photos of others
on the billboard from the garden,

784
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:13,368
we’ve come so far.

785
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,700
True.

786
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,350
Thank you.

787
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:25,976
For coming back.

788
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,272
Thank you too.

789
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,936
For not forgetting me.

790
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,200
Thank you for making me realize

791
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,708
Love's better than what I imagined in life

792
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:55,296
I'm still not used to

793
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,552
seeing the photos the fans choose.

794
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:09,220
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

795
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,696
You two came to
register your marriage, right?

796
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

797
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,510
Did you bring witnesses?

798
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,860
Witnesses?

799
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,208
Do we need them?

800
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,760
Without us,

801
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:27,160
Hey.

802
00:54:27,192 --> 00:54:29,160
What would you do, huh?

803
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:30,496
How did they know about this?

804
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,336
We only need two witnesses.

805
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,160
Count me in.

806
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:37,928
I’m the leader of the fanbase.

807
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:38,920
Give me one spot.

808
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,400
You two figure it out.

809
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,032
I brought Tam back to him.

810
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,048
- Whoa.
- He’s taking credit for it.

811
00:54:46,088 --> 00:54:48,784
Did you bring your ID card?

812
00:54:48,816 --> 00:54:49,816
Oops.

813
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:51,000
Is that required?

814
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:52,048
Yeah.

815
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,888
Can I go and get it?

816
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:55,792
It’s too late.

817
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:56,876
It’s time to make their love official.

818
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,230
No!

819
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:58,824
- It’s settled then.
- We’re ready.

820
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,008
These two, please.

821
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:00,872
Okay.

822
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:01,912
Here you go.

823
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:03,824
Alright.

824
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:04,896
Okay.

825
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,088
Mr. Padtaphi.

826
00:55:07,128 --> 00:55:08,168
- Please sign here.
- Okay.

827
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:20,792
Are you sure about this?

828
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,552
Think carefully.

829
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,920
Once you sign it, you can’t change anything.

830
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,016
I won’t change this time.

831
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,096
Are you sure?
Yes.

832
00:55:30,736 --> 00:55:31,736
Okay.

833
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:41,752
Thank you.

834
00:55:41,768 --> 00:55:44,184
Now, witnesses.

835
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:45,568
Please sign here.

836
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:47,600
Here are your IDs back.

837
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:48,624
Thank you.

838
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
Yes!

839
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:06,220
Here are your marriage certificates.

840
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,776
Congratulations.

841
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:09,808
Thank you.

842
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,568
That’s it?

843
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:12,776
We’re done.

844
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,888
It’s not just “That’s it.”

845
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:17,760
We’ve been through so much to get here.

846
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,792
You’re right.

847
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:20,830
Yes!

848
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,760
Should we take photos together?
Yes.

849
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:22,632
Let’s go!

850
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:24,472
It’s pretty on the rooftop right now, let’s go.

851
00:56:24,496 --> 00:56:25,952
- Come on.
- The lights!

852
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,656
- Lead the way, Gaogie.
- Come on, everyone.
Hurry, Gie!

853
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,000
You missed out on being a witness.

854
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,512
- You missed out on being a witness.
- But I was here.

855
00:56:30,536 --> 00:56:31,608
Oh, okay.

856
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:33,320
Come on, everyone.

857
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:34,944
Let’s take some photos for the memories.

858
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,540
The lighting is perfect right now.

859
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,728
- Come on, let’s take some photos.
- Everyone, stand here-

860
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:39,232
Come on.

861
00:56:39,248 --> 00:56:40,296
Our couple of the year.

862
00:56:42,328 --> 00:56:43,344
I’ll stand here. Oh!

863
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,616
Hey.

864
00:56:44,656 --> 00:56:45,952
Are you messing with me, bro?

865
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,768
Okay.

866
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:49,264
Okay. 10 seconds.

867
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,056
Come on, everyone. 10 seconds.

868
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:51,784
9.
8.

869
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,616
7.
Right?

870
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:55,896
That’s your partner.

871
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,456
You’re in the same faculty.

872
00:56:57,488 --> 00:56:59,144
You might know him a bit.

873
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,928
No, your topic is too serious.

874
00:57:01,976 --> 00:57:03,416
We’re journalists.

875
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:04,784
We have to tackle serious issues.

876
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:06,592
We can make an entertainment news report.

877
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:09,624
People want to know
if there are really ghosts there.

878
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:10,648
Tawan.

879
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,030
Mmm.

880
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,344
TAWAN: LET’S BREAK UP.

881
00:57:29,936 --> 00:57:31,152
Tell me honestly.

882
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,432
Why did you come back?

883
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,320
I won’t give up this time.

884
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,976
I’ll fight to win you back.

885
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Yes.

886
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,480
Tamtawan and I are really in a relationship.

887
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,480
I’m keeping my promise to you.

888
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,860
Thank you.

889
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,592
For coming back.

890
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,952
Thank you too.

891
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:55,424
For not forgetting me.

892
00:57:55,448 --> 00:57:56,144
4.

893
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:57,152
3.
2.

894
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:58,800
1.

895
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,256
Yay!
