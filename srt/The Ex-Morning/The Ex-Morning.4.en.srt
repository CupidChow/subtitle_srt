1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,679
If he agrees to work under me for a week,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,839
I’ll let my team help him.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,040
Phi accepted Tae’s challenge.

4
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:08,825
I think we can handle it by ourselves.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,896
I’m applying to be your camera operator.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Am I still in time?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
Yong asked me to give you this.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,880
Take good care of it

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,680
and don’t leave me again this time,

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,680
Mr. Producer.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
Okay.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Phi.

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,120
Phi, how did we end up here?

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Can I have one more glass?

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Tam.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Tam.

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,760
Tam!

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,040
What?

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,120
What were you daydreaming about?

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
I was trying to think of
a location for your show.

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,600
Nowhere would let us film
once they find out it’s your show.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,160
Ugh.

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Is there really nowhere we can film?

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Hey, Nhudee.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,456
What did the village
near the factory in Bang Kruai say?

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
I checked twice.

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,560
They said they’d rather
smell polluted water than see your face.

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
We can cross that place off then.

30
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,520
Hey, Gie.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
What about the fruit farm
affected by saline soil?

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,479
They said they’d rather deal with
saline soil than you, Phi.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,599
Oh.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
Am I really that bad?

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Tam,

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
what should we do?

37
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,200
At this rate, we’re going to miss
the deadline for the episode.

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Guys!

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,200
The owner of the coffee farm
who rejected us has changed their mind.

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
See?

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,320
There are kind people out there.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
But they want to throw coffee on you first.

43
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,240
So no one really will forgive me?

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Don’t give up hope just yet.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,800
How about I ask them
to throw cold coffee instead?

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Make sure they don’t put ice in it.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Got it.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
Will we make it?

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,400
Actually, there’s one place.

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
But I don’t know if you’ll agree.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where?

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
Right now, I’d go anywhere.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Your home.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
No way.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
I’ll never agree.

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,800
There’s no topic we can cover at my home.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
There are people in trouble
all over the country.

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Well…

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
No.

60
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
I won’t go there.

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
Are you fighting with your mom?

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
No.

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,759
Then there’s no problem.

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Think about it.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Your family works in salt farming.

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Your mom is the community leader.

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
The people who know things

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,280
inside out are your family.

69
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Even if the whole country hates you,

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,680
people from your home really love you.

71
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,080
No, it’s…

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
What?

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
You don’t understand.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
Trust me.

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
Let’s cover your family’s story.

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Phi,

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,536
the coffee farm owner called and asked

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,016
if you’d let them throw coffee at you.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,640
What do you say?

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
Please wait a second.
I’m asking him now.

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,880
Would you let them do it?

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Fine.

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
My home it is.

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,656
Cancel their appointment, Nhudee.

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Okay.

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
No throwing coffee.

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,280
Seriously?

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
What now?

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
If you really want to go to my house,

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Yeah.

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
I have a condition.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
You have to do one thing I say.

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Okay.

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Deal.

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Is this really his show?

96
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
BANGKOK-SAMUT SONGKHRAM

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,680
I miss you, Mom.

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
I’m going to visit you at home.

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
There’s dust in my eyes.

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,320
I’m not crying.

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
It’s true.

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
See you soon, Mom.

103
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Okay.

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
Hey, do you think
my mom knows I’m crying?

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,560
Am I convincing?

106
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, you’re good.

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,680
Perfectly convincing.

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,080
She doesn’t know.

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Here, blow your nose.

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
You can keep it.

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,640
Thank you so much, bestie.

112
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,400
What would I do without you?

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,560
Those of you with tickets can board now.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,880
We’re leaving soon.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Let’s go.

116
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,760
What?

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
I lost my ticket.

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,599
I couldn’t even take care of one ticket.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,280
No wonder Paul doesn’t want me.

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,159
I kept it for you.

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
I knew you’d lose it
if you kept it yourself.

122
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,040
Here.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,320
Oh, buddy.

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,280
You’re the best.

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,240
You really pay attention to me.

126
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
Sorry.

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Thank you so much for coming with me.

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
It’s alright.

129
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Your home is still the same.

130
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,056
It reminds me of when I first came here.

131
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Why are you being emotional?

132
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
There you are!

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,079
Hi, Mom.

134
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Hi.

135
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,800
I told you to call when you arrived so I’d
have a car pick you up from the main road.

136
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,000
I’ve been walking home since I was a kid.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,920
I’m used to it.

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,376
- Let me hug you.
- You’re used to it,

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
but Tam would find it hot.

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,479
Come on, Mom.

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,320
I’m right here!

142
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,440
Finally, we meet.

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Phi often told me about you.

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,640
He told me about you too.

145
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
So we’re close now.

146
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,119
Let’s go inside.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
- Okay.
- Come on.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh.

149
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,600
Even my mom doesn’t love me.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
I haven’t seen you in so long, Tam.

151
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
I missed you.

152
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
How are you?

153
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
I’m good.

154
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
How are you?

155
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,279
We’re good, Mom.

156
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,360
It’s been so long.
We missed you so much.

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,719
We didn’t come here alone.

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,199
That’s Gaogie and Nhudee.

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

160
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,880
Hello.

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Let’s go in.

162
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,200
I’ve cooked for you.

163
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,800
I missed you.

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Stop it.

165
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,320
You didn’t hug me earlier.

166
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,440
Oh, I missed you.

167
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,520
Be careful.

168
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

169
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,800
The tripod is expensive.

170
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
Okay, great.

171
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,560
Did you bring all the equipment?

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
Of course.

173
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
I completed the equipment checklist too.

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Where’s the wireless mic?

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Right here.

176
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,760
Camera charger?

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Over there.

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Lenses?

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Right here.

180
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,200
Gie, I’m not a child.

181
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,600
I wouldn’t make any mistakes.

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Really?

183
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
Where’s the camera memory card?

184
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
It’s here.

185
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Wait.

186
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,800
Where is it?

187
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Hey.

188
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
It’s here.

189
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,680
I saw you left it on your desk.

190
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
I knew you’d forget it.

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
I’m sorry.

192
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,680
I won’t forget it next time.

193
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,000
It’s okay.

194
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,760
Come on.

195
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,360
Let’s carry our stuff inside.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,320
This place is still the same.

197
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,000
Right?

198
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
Everything is still
just like when you were here.

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,160
So,

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,640
how many years now?

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
27.

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,600
Not your age.

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,680
I’m asking how long
you’ve been with my son.

204
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,080
Oh.

205
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,440
8 years, Mom.

206
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,520
What a relief. I thought
you wouldn’t survive the 7-year curse.

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Come on, Mom.

208
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,240
There’s no curse.

209
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,120
I don’t believe in such a thing.

210
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,120
It depends on the two of us.

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,319
Let me get you some fruit.

212
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,400
Okay.

213
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,760
You haven’t told her we broke up?

214
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,840
Well, I just said
you went to study abroad.

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
What?

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
Come on.

217
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,639
Just make it convincing.

218
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,520
No, Phi.

219
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,480
You’re asking too much.

220
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,800
How am I asking too much?

221
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,239
I let you come here to film.

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,680
Now keep your promise.

223
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
You have to do what I want.

224
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
We’re adults.

225
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
Yes, we are.

226
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,400
I don’t want to hurt my mom.

227
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
You know how much she loves you.

228
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,559
No, I don’t want to lie.

229
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
Trust me, if you tell her,

230
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,800
she’ll be okay with it.

231
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
No, just do as I say.

232
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,880
No.

233
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,640
Do as I say.

234
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,040
No.

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,640
Do as I say.

236
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,080
No.

237
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,600
Do as I say.

238
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,040
I said no.

239
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
Do as I say.

240
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,200
No.

241
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,720
Do as I say.

242
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,080
No.

243
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Do as I say.

244
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,320
Here’s some fruit, kids.

245
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Doesn’t it look good?

246
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,440
What were you saying? I heard “No.”

247
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Oh.

248
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
No…

249
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
No sleeping in separate rooms, Mom.

250
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Right?

251
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
Right?

252
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Of course, no sleeping in separate rooms.

253
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
Why would we do that?

254
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,839
Aren’t you shy in front of Mom?

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
How could you say these things?

256
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Why would I be shy?

257
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
We’ve been together for 8 years.

258
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,000
Right, Mom?

259
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Yes.

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
What?

261
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,560
Hey, the fruit looks so good.

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
Let me have some.

263
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Have some fruit.

264
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,440
Is that sweet?

265
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
So sweet.

266
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Great.

267
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,799
Here you go.

268
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Wow, that looks so good, Mom.

269
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Here’s fried pork.

270
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,120
Aren’t those three coming to eat?

271
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
Oh, they’re setting up the camera.

272
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
We’ll interview you in the afternoon.

273
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
What do I have to say?

274
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Actually, there are a lot of questions.

275
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
Let’s ask Tam.

276
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,120
Hey!

277
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,281
Come brief Mom on the script.

278
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,680
Babe!

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
Yes?

280
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,639
Please brief Mom on the script.

281
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,639
She wants to know the questions.

282
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,800
You got it, babe.

283
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,160
You’re so cute.

284
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Ouch!

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,080
Babe,

286
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,680
please talk slowly

287
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,760
so Mom can understand.

288
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,680
Okay.

289
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,120
Come on.

290
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Let me be the only single one here.

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
Oh, Mom.

292
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,760
Aren’t you used to it?

293
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,360
Right, babe?

294
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,560
Mainly, Phi will ask you
about the history of the salt farm.

295
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,440
Here’s the detailed script.

296
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,160
I made the font extra large
so it’s easier for you to read.

297
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,840
Oh.

298
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,800
My producer is the best.

299
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,280
I need to give him a reward.

300
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,120
Here.

301
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,600
What, babe?

302
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Oh.

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,560
I can eat after work.

304
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Hey, don’t say no.

305
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,280
We want Mom to see
how cute we are with each other.

306
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,280
Let me care for you.

307
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
Oh!

308
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Be careful.

309
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,200
It’s hot.

310
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,560
Oh, it is?

311
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Let me get something to cool you off.

312
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
You can see it, right?

313
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Well…

314
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Here.

315
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,320
The food will go well with this drink.

316
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,040
Will you serve me,

317
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,120
boyfriend?

318
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,960
Of course.

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,800
I only have one boyfriend.

320
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,959
How could I not take care of him?

321
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Right, Mom?

322
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
So cute.

323
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,680
Do you want one, Phi?

324
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,480
I’ll grab it for you.

325
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,896
- That’d be great.
- It’s okay, Mom.

326
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,200
No worries at all.

327
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
We can share the bottle.

328
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
We’re boyfriends.

329
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
We don’t mind, right?

330
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Right?

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,840
Absolutely.

332
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,640
Something this tasty tastes even better when I’m drinking it with my boyfriend.

333
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
Mmm.

334
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Let me go get something.

335
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,760
I really can’t see anything.

336
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
Oh, okay.

337
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,320
What are you doing?

338
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,520
It’s not convincing at all.

339
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,960
You started it.

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,760
I don’t care.

341
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,680
I don’t want to do this anymore.

342
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Phi!

343
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Yes?

344
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,520
Have you seen my glasses?

345
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,200
What are you looking for again?

346
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
My glasses.

347
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,360
- They’re right there.
- Where?

348
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,600
On your head.

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,519
Oh, they’re on my head.

350
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
My own.

351
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,320
Exactly, Mom.

352
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh, no.

353
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,520
I’m too old now.

354
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,200
What are you not sure about, Mom?

355
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,960
Here.

356
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,560
I’m confused about this part.

357
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
Do I have to say it exactly like this?

358
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,000
This is a voiceover, Mom.

359
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh.

360
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Salt used to be very valuable in the past.

361
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,640
They said having salt was like having gold.

362
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,120
Working in salt farming
could lead to a better life.

363
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,720
Okay.

364
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,720
Now, we’re barely surviving

365
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,880
because big capitalists
compete with the local producers,

366
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,760
not to mention the unstable weather.

367
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,960
But we’re trying our best.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,199
We turn salt into products,

369
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,279
focusing on cleanliness

370
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,160
and taste.

371
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,600
I don’t want it to disappear.

372
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
I want to preserve our local wisdom.

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,520
So this means that not only the government has to see the problem,

374
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,360
but we also need to highlight
the strengths of our salt farm, right?

375
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,520
I think the flower of salt from our farm
tastes better than anything on the shelves.

376
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,679
Oh, then we have to try it.

377
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,320
Go ahead.

378
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,719
Alright, guys.

379
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,040
I’ll try the salt from both cups.

380
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,440
Let’s see if I can guess
which one is from the salt farm

381
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,360
and which one is regular salt.

382
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,959
It’s definitely the left cup, Mom.

383
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,040
It’s tasty and mellow.

384
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,440
It’s not too salty, Mom.

385
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,120
You’re right.

386
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
See?

387
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,080
Wait.

388
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,480
Or is it the right cup?

389
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
Did they get swapped?

390
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,720
I’m not sure. Let me try it.

391
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,959
Uh, cut.

392
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
Cut.

393
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,919
Let’s take a break.

394
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Your mom might be tired.

395
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,640
It’s okay, Mom.

396
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,320
Let’s take a break.

397
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,840
Okay.

398
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,200
Hmm.

399
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,760
Phi guessed right.

400
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,320
I’m the forgetful one.

401
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
I saw on the news that
you can get married now.

402
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,520
Hmm?

403
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Have you two thought about it?

404
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
Phi and I…

405
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,400
I think we need to talk about it first.

406
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Hold on, I’m not pressuring you.

407
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,040
It’s just that
you’ve been together since school.

408
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,360
It really has been a long time.

409
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
Anyway, Phi really holds onto things.

410
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,000
I’ve seen him use that water bottle
since we were in university.

411
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
That’s just who Phi is.

412
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
He loves his things and he’s possessive.

413
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,800
Once he loves something,
he doesn’t change his mind easily.

414
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
You know that, Tam.

415
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,600
Otherwise, he would’ve
thrown it away a long time ago.

416
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I feel bad for him though.

417
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,360
About what?

418
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
The scandal about him throwing coffee.

419
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,400
I’m so worried about him,

420
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,520
but I’m scared to ask him directly
because that’ll worry him.

421
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,960
It’s tough

422
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,040
but I’m trying to help him.

423
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
I’ll help him make a comeback.

424
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,960
Thank you.

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,480
You realize how much you love each other

426
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,360
when one of you is in trouble, right?

427
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,360
This is sadness

428
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
This is what sadness feels like

429
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,800
How am I not good enough?

430
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,839
Let me drink to comfort myself!

431
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Here’s to sadness!

432
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
Cheers!

433
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,840
Cheers!

434
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Look at him.

435
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
He’s acting like
he’s never been heartbroken before.

436
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,440
He’s probably really hurting this time.

437
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,560
That guy doesn’t want Phi

438
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,040
because he doesn’t have it together.

439
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
He doesn’t get along with anyone
and he always acts so smug.

440
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Who would want him as a partner?

441
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,320
They probably haven’t seen the real him.

442
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
He’s actually a nice guy.

443
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,960
But they have to get closer to him first before he shows his cute side.

444
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,879
And although he has quite a sharp tongue when working,

445
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,520
he has a good heart.

446
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,240
It’d be nice if someone
could see what you see, Tam.

447
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,800
That way, I can stop worrying.

448
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Tam,

449
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
don’t let go of Phi’s hand.

450
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,200
What’s going on, Mom?

451
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,799
The water in the bathroom is not running.

452
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
There’s only one tub of water left.

453
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,160
Let the girls use it.

454
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,960
You boys can wash outside.

455
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,440
Do you want to go first?

456
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,280
No, you go ahead.

457
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,680
I’ll wait in front of the house.

458
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Hey, wait.

459
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
What?

460
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,400
Since we’re doing this,

461
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,600
we might as well wash together.

462
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,896
We’re playing boyfriends, right?

463
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
We have to make it convincing.

464
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,240
Or are you scared?

465
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Why would I be scared?

466
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Ooh!

467
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Oh!

468
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Can I use the soap?

469
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Here you go.

470
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Hey,

471
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,600
I can’t believe they still make this.

472
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,040
This is such an old brand.

473
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
A rare item.

474
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,719
Ah!

475
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,840
My eyes sting.

476
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
My eyes sting.

477
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,600
My eyes sting.

478
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,280
Move over here.

479
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
My eyes sting.

480
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
My eyes sting.

481
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Are you okay now?

482
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
There’s no need.

483
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
I’ll rinse it off myself.

484
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
What are you looking at?

485
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
I’m going now.

486
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,400
No gecko, check.

487
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
No cockroach, check.

488
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,760
Oh, why did you come in?

489
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,280
There’s only this room left.

490
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,456
Where else do you want me to sleep?

491
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Huh?

492
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
I thought we’d have separate rooms.

493
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,000
It’s okay. I can sleep outside.

494
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,000
Wait, but how are you going to…?

495
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,000
I’m a camper.

496
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I’ll be fine.

497
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Ah!

498
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Uh…

499
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,959
Actually, you should sleep here with me.

500
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,800
We have a lot more work tomorrow.

501
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
I’ll share the bed with you.

502
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
Okay.

503
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,920
I should sleep well,

504
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
so I can work well, right?

505
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Mm-hmm.

506
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,120
Nhudee.

507
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Huh?

508
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Oh.

509
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,520
I’m going to take a shower.

510
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
Can you back up the files
to the hard disk?

511
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Okay.

512
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,360
I’ll hurry back.

513
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Hey!

514
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,959
Where’s the memory card?

515
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
Oh, no, Nhudee.

516
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
Where is it?

517
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
What?

518
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,240
No! I’m in trouble!

519
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,800
Are you sure you can
sleep in the same bed as me?

520
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,999
There’s only one bed.

521
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,360
Do you want to sleep on the floor?

522
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Huh?

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No.

524
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,840
Don’t be too much.

525
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,520
We can sleep in the same bed.

526
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Why?

527
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
Are you scared?

528
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,680
Scared that you
won’t be able to control yourself?

529
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,400
Stop being too much.

530
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Don’t be delusional.

531
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,200
Why are you talking about
something impossible?

532
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,520
Really?

533
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
Is it impossible?

534
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Yeah.

535
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
You never know.

536
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Old habits die hard, right?

537
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,240
You’re right.

538
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
Old habits die hard.

539
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Right?

540
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,159
Just die!

541
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,720
Just die!

542
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,040
Old habits, huh?

543
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,960
Old habits, huh?

544
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
Old habits, huh?

545
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
What do you want?

546
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,160
What do you want?

547
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,480
Oh!

548
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,640
Am I interrupting?

549
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
No.

550
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,239
Here, I picked it up this afternoon.

551
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
It smells nice from the sun.

552
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,520
I remember you like it, Tam.

553
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,240
Oh, thank you for remembering, Mom.

554
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,759
Your son is sitting right here.

555
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,000
Why do you keep spoiling him?

556
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,800
You don’t care about your son.

557
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,080
I have to take good care of
the one who takes care of you.

558
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,160
I get older every day.

559
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,800
When I’m gone someday,

560
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,520
I need to know
someone can take care of you.

561
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,800
Where are you going? No!

562
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,880
Don’t say things like that.

563
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,960
Who else would I eat
braised mackerel with?

564
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,679
I’ll make it for you.

565
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,040
Stop acting like a kid.

566
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
I get to hug her.

567
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
What is it?

568
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Every time something’s on your mind,

569
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,400
you pick your nails like that.

570
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,960
Tell me what’s wrong.

571
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,800
I’m just thinking about my mom.

572
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,480
I’m just thinking about what I’d do
if she’s really gone one day.

573
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I haven’t repaid her anything.

574
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,080
Then do it.

575
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
You still have time.

576
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,760
It’s not that easy.

577
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,640
I’ve seen her working in the sun and wind
at the salt farm since I was a kid

578
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,560
and she was able to afford
sending me to a good university.

579
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,240
But now that I have a good life and career

580
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,040
she won’t agree
to move to Bangkok with me.

581
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,640
You have to understand her.

582
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,120
She’s been living like this all her life.

583
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,400
You can’t expect her to
change easily just because you mean well.

584
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,640
Maybe you need to
let her choose her own path.

585
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,640
I know.

586
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,680
I just want her to be more comfortable.

587
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,360
Being more comfortable

588
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,200
might not be what your mom wants.

589
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,760
She might be happy working in
salt farming. I think she’s cool.

590
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
True.

591
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,720
My mom is so cool.

592
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,160
I grew up on a salt farm

593
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,120
but honestly, when I tried her salt today,

594
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,200
I couldn’t even tell the difference.

595
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,280
Because you’re such a loser.

596
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,040
Please.

597
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,560
You’re not even that good.

598
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,440
I’m better than you.

599
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:14,800
Try the salt tomorrow and tell them apart.

600
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,760
I can do that. Why else
would your mom love me so much?

601
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
No, that has nothing to do with it.

602
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,560
Where is it?

603
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
You’re in big trouble, Nhudee.

604
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,200
What should I do?

605
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
If I can’t find it, we’ll definitely have to reshoot.

606
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,240
No!

607
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,360
Who’s there?

608
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,800
I’m asking, who’s there?

609
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,400
Calm down. It’s me.

610
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,920
What are you doing here?

611
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Well…I…

612
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,160
What’s wrong?

613
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Hey, Gie.

614
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,680
I’m sorry.

615
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,280
This is all my fault.

616
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,280
I knew you’d lose it.

617
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,360
Then why are you helping me?

618
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,600
When I first started working,

619
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,600
I was just like you.

620
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,080
I once lost a memory card for a show.

621
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,280
Back then,

622
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,280
Yong helped me.

623
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,760
He didn’t just help me find the memory card but with many other things too.

624
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,559
Without him,

625
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,680
I wouldn’t have it together today.

626
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
I just want to return the favor.

627
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Helping his sister is one way
I can repay him, right?

628
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,640
Come on. Let’s keep looking.

629
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Ah!

630
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,240
Gaogie, wait for me!

631
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
You know, I really love
the smell of the blankets at your home.

632
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,239
This one still smells just like
it did the first day I came here.

633
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Of course.

634
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,000
It hasn’t been washed since.

635
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Really?

636
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
Just kidding.

637
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
You’re exaggerating.

638
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:19,280
How can it smell so good?

639
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,160
The smell really gives me nostalgia.

640
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Huh?

641
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,640
It makes me feel nostalgic.

642
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,296
If you’re feeling fatigued, just go to sleep.

643
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,360
I said nostalgic.

644
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,600
It means longing for the past.

645
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,816
Oh, is that a word
people who studied abroad use?

646
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,160
Yeah.

647
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,920
International.

648
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,040
That’s right.

649
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,240
Oh.

650
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,600
You’re so slow to catch on.

651
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,400
How can it smell so good? Honestly.

652
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,880
Smell it if you don’t believe me.

653
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,040
Mmm, it smells good.

654
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,080
Do you want to share the blanket?

655
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
No!

656
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,600
Stop it.

657
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,879
Time’s up.

658
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
Let’s sleep.

659
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,160
Fine.

660
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,920
Good night.

661
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,279
Great, we can share this blanket.

662
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,720
You can hug yours like a bolster.

663
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
You jerk! Give it back!

664
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I’m going to sleep now.

665
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
I’m burning them all!

666
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,280
- Get in there!
- Hey, what are you doing?

667
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Hey, hey!

668
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
What are you doing?

669
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,120
The way to forget

670
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
is to erase everything!

671
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,480
You’re so dramatic.

672
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,120
I’m burning everything about him!

673
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,760
But I’m scared.

674
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,480
Oh?

675
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,880
Can you burn them for me?

676
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,880
Fine, what are these?

677
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,200
The name tag
he wrote for all the juniors.

678
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,960
Just dump it.

679
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Dump it.

680
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,120
The photo you took with him.

681
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,960
Dump it.

682
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Dump it.

683
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800
The doll you won from the claw machine
and wanted to give him.

684
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,440
Dump it.

685
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Dump it.

686
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,760
Your audition file to be a DJ
at the same show as him.

687
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,760
Just dump it!

688
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Dump it.

689
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,840
Just dump everything.

690
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,200
This is the last one.

691
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Your signature book
that he was the first to sign.

692
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Dump it.

693
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,400
No, don’t dump it!

694
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,880
What?

695
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:51,200
Don’t dump that!

696
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,960
It’s already burning.

697
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,240
No!

698
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,640
Don’t burn!

699
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Enough.

700
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,240
That was close.

701
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,200
Ouch!

702
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,640
It’s hot!

703
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,800
I go from being heartbroken
to almost burning my heart.

704
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,520
NICE TO MEET YOU. I’M B.
WELCOME TO OUR FACULTY, PHI.

705
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,959
NICE TO MEET U.
LOVE YOU.

706
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,919
Why are you so hung up on it?

707
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,880
It’s just a signature book that he signed.
TAMTAWAN IS PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

708
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,200
I’m not.

709
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,960
You said you’d move on.

710
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,560
How can you do that if you’re like this?

711
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,800
One day, I’ll be able to let go of him.

712
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
I just wanted to keep this book

713
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
because it has your signature in it.

714
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,520
My signature?

715
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,520
How is my signature important?

716
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,000
You’re important to me.

717
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,080
You help me with everything

718
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,080
without me even asking.

719
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,920
Thank you so much

720
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,560
for helping me with everything.

721
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,800
Let’s drink!

722
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,520
Come on!

723
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,040
Let’s drink to numb my heart!

724
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,760
Screw it all!

725
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,760
Yeah.

726
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,600
This is sadness

727
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,080
This is what sadness feels like

728
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,800
Get that right

729
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,800
Cheers!

730
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,080
I cry from pain, nothing to hide

731
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:01,279
Struggling hard, losing my mind

732
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Looking back on all this time

733
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:14,120
I regret my tears sometimes

734
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,720
But this pain makes me realize

735
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,560
My tears this time

736
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,520
They’re worthwhile

737
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Phi.

738
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,720
Phi, how did we end up here?

739
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,440
Can I have one more glass?

740
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Phi.

741
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Tawan

742
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Mmm.

743
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Tomorrow, I’ll tell my mom the truth

744
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,480
that we broke up.

745
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,679
Oh, you’re awake.

746
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Mmm.

747
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,000
I’m sorry.

748
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,160
I don’t know when I passed out last night.

749
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Mmm.

750
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,080
It’s morning now and we can’t find it.

751
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,639
But it’s okay if we lose it.

752
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
We can reshoot.

753
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
What? Reshoot?

754
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,440
Padtaphi will stress out.

755
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,559
Tam will scold me.

756
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,799
Everyone will blame me

757
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,320
and I’ll be stressed, pressured,

758
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,080
and a problem for society.

759
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,000
Then I’ll go to jail.

760
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,040
Then what will I do next?

761
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,920
I’ll lose my job!

762
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
Oh, I’ll lose my job!

763
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Stop.

764
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,000
Calm down, Nhudee.

765
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,480
Stop feeling down.

766
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,560
I’ll tell them I lost it.

767
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,800
No one would dare scold you.

768
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,480
Let’s go back to the house,

769
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,520
take a shower, and get ready to reshoot.

770
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,280
Reshoot…

771
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
Nhudee.

772
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,120
Hmm?

773
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,040
What?

774
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
Hey!

775
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,920
Found it!

776
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,600
You’re right!

777
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,960
Yay, Gaogie!

778
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,280
We found the memory card!

779
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,680
The memory card!

780
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Yay!

781
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
We found it.

782
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Check carefully next time.

783
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
Mmm.

784
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,960
Don’t forget to tell your mom.

785
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,840
I know.

786
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,880
Good.

787
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,560
I just wanted to remind you.

788
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,839
Where did the girls go for a walk
so early this morning?

789
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,599
I didn’t see them when I woke up.

790
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,840
Here.

791
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,520
Phi’s favorite braised mackerel.

792
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,479
Come on, let’s eat.

793
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,600
Thank you, Mom.

794
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
Thank you.

795
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,440
How was last night?

796
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,520
You two drank until late.

797
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,400
I didn’t think you’d wake up.

798
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,360
Oh, we’re fine, Mom.

799
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,840
It’s nothing.

800
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,280
Very good.

801
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,079
It’s your friend’s first time at our house.

802
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,840
I was worried he wouldn’t be able to sleep.

803
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,040
I could sleep.

804
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,480
I slept very well.

805
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,880
I love your blanket.

806
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,480
It’s so soft and smells so nice.

807
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,840
I wash and dry it in the sun.

808
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,000
If you like it, you should come here often.

809
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,440
Come on, let’s eat.

810
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,199
Here’s Phi’s favorite braised mackerel.

811
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,280
Wow.

812
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,040
I eat this every day.

813
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,320
I believe you really love it.

814
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Believe it or not, Tam.

815
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,080
Phi eats it all the time.

816
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,359
He eats it when he fails his exams,

817
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,520
when he’s sick,

818
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,520
when he’s sad, when he’s happy,

819
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,800
and even when he’s heartbroken.

820
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Sorry.

821
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,360
Come on, Mom.

822
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,400
That teasing hurts.

823
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,560
I was really heartbroken

824
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,400
but I feel better now.

825
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,880
Tam helped me a lot.

826
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Mom,

827
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Tam is a really good guy.

828
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,440
So good that I wanted
to bring him to meet you

829
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,960
and show you that you don’t have to
worry about me when I’m in Bangkok.

830
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,360
I feel really lucky to have Tam.

831
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,800
So much that I think…

832
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,160
I want to be with him

833
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,160
as boyfriends.

834
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,440
Would you be okay with that, Mom?

835
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,480
Let’s eat!

836
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
My braised mackerel!

837
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,160
Your food looks as amazing as ever.

838
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,080
By the way, Mom…

839
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,400
I want to tell you something.

840
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,400
Well…

841
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,800
I want to ask you
about the braised mackerel.

842
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,600
Yes, because, uh,

843
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,599
yours is really delicious.

844
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,720
It still tastes as good as when I was a kid.

845
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,800
So I want to know

846
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,360
if you can share the recipe
in case I want to make it.

847
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,239
Uh, you need to use the salt from my farm.

848
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,800
Your late father taught me the recipe, Phi.

849
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
Now this makes me miss him.

850
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,000
I don’t want to leave this place, I guess

851
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,440
because I still want to feel close to him.

852
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,880
You have Tam to take care of you
in Bangkok and I don’t have to worry.

853
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,000
You might want to worry.

854
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Mom, the thing is,

855
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,800
we actually…

856
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
If you’re going to tell me
you broke up, you don’t have to.

857
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,120
I already knew.

858
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Oh?

859
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,880
How did you know?

860
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,280
I’m your mom.

861
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,760
Of course, I knew.

862
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,800
I’m sorry, Mom.

863
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,560
I didn’t want you to worry, so I lied.

864
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,200
I have to apologize too.

865
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,520
It’s alright.

866
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,679
It’s not my business if you love
or break up with each other.

867
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,640
You’re adults now.

868
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,960
You can make your own decisions.

869
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,400
But does pretending to be together
mean you want to get back with him, son?

870
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,800
What are you talking about, Mom?

871
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,920
No way. I’ve moved on.

872
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,000
Really?

873
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,480
Yes.

874
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Hmm?

875
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Since you knew,

876
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,320
I guess we can stop pretending.

877
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Huh?

878
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,840
I’m moving here

879
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:31,273
so you know we’re just colleagues, Mom.

880
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,280
Give me the omelet.

881
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,320
I want to eat it.

882
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,399
Colleagues? If you say so.

883
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Come on, let’s eat.

884
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,000
Why are you doing this?

885
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,880
You didn’t forget anything, right?

886
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,920
No.

887
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,960
Thank you so much.

888
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,560
I’ll pick the angles
where you look your best.

889
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,000
Come back to visit again, girls.

890
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,000
I’m definitely coming back

891
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,160
because your food is amazing.

892
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,599
Wait, I forgot I made
a big pot of braised mackerel.

893
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,000
Let me reheat it.

894
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,800
It’s okay. I got it.

895
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,559
Use the charcoal stove
to make it smell nice.

896
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,560
Okay.

897
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,720
Your braised mackerel is so good.

898
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,816
Can you share the recipe with me?

899
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
You mean it?

900
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,840
You have to use the salt from my farm.

901
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,559
Go wait outside.

902
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,560
Hmm…

903
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,520
What if I say I want to stay here?

904
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,960
Just in case you need my help.

905
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,160
So, can I help you with anything?

906
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
Good.

907
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,600
Don’t tell me you’re thinking about
what my mom said at the dining table.

908
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,080
What?

909
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,120
I haven’t said anything.

910
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
There.

911
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,440
This means you’re thinking
about the same thing.

912
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,120
See? You really are thinking about it.

913
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,400
Don’t listen to my mom.

914
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,200
It’s nonsense.

915
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,320
But now that I think about
what your mom said,

916
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,800
sometimes I feel like

917
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,240
your acting is real.

918
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,960
Don’t you think so, Phi?

919
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
Hey!

920
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,560
The coals are ages old.

921
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,560
How could they start a fire?

922
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,959
Read my lips.

923
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,640
I don’t feel anything for you anymore.

924
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
Great.

925
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,680
If you really don’t have feelings for me,

926
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
next week when we edit this work,

927
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,840
you can sleep over at my place.

928
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Why not?

929
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
Deal.

930
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:24,080
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

931
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,560
Remember our promise?

932
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,720
Keep it strictly work.

933
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,816
What are you guys doing here?

934
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,920
Smile.

935
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,200
You look disappointed.

936
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,376
Ever since we walked into the house,

937
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,080
your focus has only been on me.

938
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,319
You think I don’t know what you’re thinking?

939
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,040
So much for scolding me.

940
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,840
You’re no different.

941
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,680
I’m so sleepy.

942
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,320
Can you bring Sosay back to the room?
