1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
It’s just the two of us left.

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:02,936
I’m afraid

3
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:05,304
you won’t be able to control yourself.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,300
You’re the one who won’t be able to control yourself.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,792
Ever since we walked into the house,

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,790
your focus has only been on me.

7
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:12,208
Phi.

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,040
He’s my producer.

9
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,260
I won’t let anyone steal him.

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,048
Who’s your producer?

11
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,340
Didn’t you kick me out?

12
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,128
You kicked me out of your life,

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,592
but you still keep those things.

14
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,984
Don’t get the wrong idea that it’s the lip balm you got me.

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,752
I have to taste it then.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,952
Were you secretly watching me?

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,496
Phi, please!

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,784
Waking up and secretly watching
your boyfriend’s face after sex?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,720
You act like this is a romance movie.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,200
Look who’s talking.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Why?

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,632
Didn’t you also act like
it was a romance movie last night?

23
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,560
What did I do?

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,568
“Can you kiss me
while looking into my eyes?”

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,070
Stop exaggerating!

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,136
“I want to see your eyes when we kiss.”

27
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,376
You want to do this, huh?

28
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:24,808
Oh!

29
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:25,688
You want to do this, huh?

30
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:27,080
It's so romantic.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,448
You want to do this, huh?

32
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,768
Someone said this last night:

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,568
“Your lips are so soft.”

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,168
“I’ve never felt anyone's lips this soft.”

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,000
They really are soft.

36
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,336
I wasn’t lying.

37
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,088
And your eyes are really beautiful.

38
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,512
Then I guess…

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,768
we should call the professor.

40
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,296
Hello, Professor Jui.

41
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,200
Phi and I might be a bit late today.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,744
We have something important to do.

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,336
We have to go.
We’re in a hurry.

44
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,410
You’re going to get it!

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,192
What are you doing?

46
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,704
Stop it!

47
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,064
Gotcha!

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,288
Don’t tell me

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,192
you woke up just to stare at my face.

50
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
Why not?

51
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,896
I just feel like

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,808
you look a lot older.

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,848
Shut up.

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,630
You should find time to see a doctor.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,952
But I feel like

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,192
we still have it.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,768
Even though you say we’re older,

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,952
last night was pretty fire.

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,480
Then…

60
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,352
we should call Yong.

61
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,664
Hello, Yong.

62
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:27,280
Phi and I are taking the day off today.

63
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,496
I meant we should call him about work.

64
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:32,520
Ask for feedback on our first episode.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,896
Don’t tell me you got carried away.

66
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,776
We’re adults.

67
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,568
It’s a win-win for both of us.

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,192
Think of it as a celebration of our show.

69
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:52,312
That’s it.

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,464
I’m going to take a shower.

71
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Here.

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,824
Hey!

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,952
Why did you come in?

74
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,008
To take a shower.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,560
I have to go to work too.

76
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,912
I’m already in the shower.

77
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:07,328
You should wait.

78
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,288
Well, you didn’t lock the door.

79
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,864
If I were an overthinker,

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,616
I’d think you’re trying to seduce me.

81
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,032
Luckily, I’m not.

82
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,570
You don’t mind, right?

83
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,360
Hand me the towel.

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
If you’re not an overthinker,

85
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,312
we could shower together.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,264
You can look.

87
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,048
It’s a win-win like you said.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,704
Shall we shower together?

89
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,976
I’m already done.

90
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,336
That thing of yours isn’t much to look at.

91
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,816
What?

92
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,472
My car broke down.

93
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,470
I need a ride to work today.

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Why?

95
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,976
If you don’t feel anything for me,

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,760
this shouldn’t be a problem, right?

97
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
It’s stuck.

98
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,448
Can you help me put it on?

99
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,480
Seriously?

100
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,504
Fine.

101
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,624
I’ll put it on for you.

102
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,560
You don’t know how to do it, huh?

103
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,584
Mmm.

104
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,936
Hmm.

105
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:21,096
Is it tight down here?

106
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,304
(We’re back with Talk to Top.)

107
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,088
(We’re with a rising young businessman)

108
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,528
(who owns a lot of major real estate.)

109
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,790
(Paul Puttipat Issariyakul.)

110
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,264
(He’s here with us now.)

111
00:08:59,288 --> 00:08:59,760
(Hi, Paul.)

112
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:00,720
Paul.

113
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:01,408
(Hi.)

114
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,312
(Hi, everyone listening.)

115
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,400
(Your interview with us last year received even better feedback than we expected.)

116
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,390
(With your trustworthy image and…)

117
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,320
So, have you found a club
you’re interested in?

118
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,320
Let me guess.

119
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,320
You want to join the journalism club.

120
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,760
Since you know me so well, why don’t you move to the same club as me?

121
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,736
I’m telling you, if you want to find a partner,

122
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,320
find someone
who knows you as well as I do.

123
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Hey.

124
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,768
Have you joined a club yet?

125
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,088
Oh, not yet.

126
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,824
That’s great.

127
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,800
I heard your voice.
It’s really good.

128
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:45,696
Are you sure?

129
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,848
Yeah.

130
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,032
That’s what I’m talking about.

131
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:48,712
Thanks.

132
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,536
I’m in the broadcasting club.

133
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,064
Wanna give it a try?

134
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,328
Sure, why not?

135
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,616
Wow, your voice is so good.

136
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:56,520
You could totally be a DJ.

137
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,976
Can I try?

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,688
Come on.

139
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:59,512
Careful, it’s raining.

140
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,536
Thank you.
Come on.

141
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,352
Give it a shot.

142
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:06,840
This is the controller.

143
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,070
Oh, okay.

144
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:09,096
Got it.

145
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
I’m here!

146
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,376
Sorry I’m late.

147
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:31,952
It’s alright.

148
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:35,376
The broadcasting club asked me
to help with their new jingle.

149
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,920
It’s for Paul’s show.

150
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,072
It’s starting.

151
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,936
Is this what you recorded?

152
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:42,984
Yeah.

153
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,488
Hold on.

154
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,090
Let’s put on earphones.

155
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Here.

156
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,016
(We’re in our second hour.)

157
00:10:57,048 --> 00:11:01,736
(Let’s hear from some teens
going through relationship problems)

158
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,208
(and give them space
to vent their feelings.)

159
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,552
I made this jingle.
Isn’t it cool?

160
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:06,992
This one?

161
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:07,880
Yeah.

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,536
(Our first call is with Kao.)

163
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,424
Hi, Kao.

164
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:19,072
What do you want to share with us today?

165
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,544
(Hi, Paul.)

166
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:27,584
(Actually, I just wanted to call
and tell my best friend that I like him.)

167
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:33,232
(But I can’t say it to him directly
because he’s also a man.)

168
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:34,824
(I’m scared I’ll lose him.)

169
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,096
(Oh.)

170
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,128
(Listen to me, Kao.)

171
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,672
No best friend would stop being friends with you because you’re gay.

172
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,800
(And if he’s open enough, your confession might lead to a happy ending.)

173
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,848
(Love is too pure to be judged by gender.)

174
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,390
(Do you understand?)

175
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,112
(Just leave your fear behind.)

176
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,096
(No matter what you choose to do, )

177
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,496
(things will work out.)

178
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,696
(Give it a try, Kao.)

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,540
Didn’t Paul give such a good answer?

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,952
He’s so cool.

181
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,110
Phi…

182
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,260
If something like that happened to you,

183
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,710
what would you do?

184
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,608
I’d do what Paul said.

185
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,568
Love is too pure to be judged by gender.

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
That’s really amazing.

187
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,872
What do you think?

188
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,768
Well… I agree with you.

189
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,752
It’s true, right?

190
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:52,776
Yeah.

191
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,176
Tam!

192
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Huh?

193
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,670
What?

194
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,464
I’m getting out now.

195
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:04,808
You can follow me later.

196
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Okay.

197
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:39,824
Phi.

198
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:40,856
Hmm?

199
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,160
You forgot your badge.

200
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,792
Thank you.

201
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,256
You’re going to forget it again.

202
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,856
Why don’t you wear it?

203
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,400
Here, wear it.

204
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,580
Otherwise, you’ll forget it again.

205
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Got it?

206
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,280
You’re nagging me like a mom.

207
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,304
Oh!

208
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:12,952
I’m swooning!

209
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,712
Are you having a moment?

210
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,864
Sorry to interrupt, old flames.

211
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,840
What old flames?

212
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,080
Come on, Rita.

213
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,744
Tam, I think he’s acting weird.

214
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,200
How?

215
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,040
Usually, Phi would play along with jokes,

216
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,936
but whenever someone talks about you,

217
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:52,400
he gets really serious.

218
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,784
Hey, does this mean…

219
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,032
old flames are about to burn bright?

220
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,208
Tam and Phi. Phi and Tam.

221
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:04,232
Oh!

222
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,536
Nothing is going on.

223
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:07,944
He and I…

224
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,656
We’re just working together.

225
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,050
Okay.

226
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,032
Work?

227
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,392
Then why did you smile?

228
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,840
Actually, everyone really loves your demo.

229
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,312
Yes!

230
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,730
But…

231
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
But…

232
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,872
we have no sponsors,

233
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,870
so the board isn’t sure about it.

234
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I knew it.

235
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,600
If the show doesn’t go on air,
how will the sponsors see it?

236
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,440
I’m sure once they do,
it’ll be easy to get their sponsorship.

237
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,072
If no one sponsors us, does that mean

238
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,840
our show will be put on hold?

239
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,312
You have to understand,

240
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,392
making a show isn’t cheap.

241
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
It’s okay.

242
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,376
Phi.

243
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:10,936
Oh, Phi?

244
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,448
Wait, Tam.

245
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:15,400
Where are you going?

246
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,384
I have something urgent.

247
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,680
Please take care of things here.

248
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,848
I’ll post to let Phi’s fans know that

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,864
Phi has a new show coming out,

250
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:41,008
but the sponsors are calling Phi
a fallen star and refuse to fund it,

251
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:44,280
which is why it’s been put on hold.

252
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:47,912
Once the fans find out, they’ll come together and start trending to support Phi.

253
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:52,064
Then Phi will be back in the spotlight
with the hashtag #SupportPhi.

254
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,992
Once Phi is in the spotlight again,
we’ll get sponsors

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,544
and the show can go on.

256
00:16:57,552 --> 00:17:00,640
And when the show goes on,
Phi will be happy!

257
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,064
Does that sound good?

258
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,504
I’m glad you’re trying to help

259
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,048
but not like this!

260
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,312
You can’t set up an operating base
to trend for Phi in my office.

261
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,328
Shh!

262
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,728
Stop complaining.

263
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,368
You have to help us get this trending.

264
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,800
And you have to get your team to help too.

265
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,352
Sound good? Yes.

266
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,112
Because I’ve already told the fans.

267
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,624
Hey!

268
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,480
I have something to do.

269
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,416
I have something to do.

270
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,456
I have to go.

271
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,496
Hey!

272
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:33,656
Good.

273
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,624
I’ll use your phone to help us trend.

274
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:37,648
Huh?

275
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,136
Two badges?

276
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,310
Yes.

277
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Thank you.

278
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,728
Why are you here?

279
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,088
I heard you couldn’t
convince other companies.

280
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,944
So what?

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,192
Are you here to help?

282
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,830
Just in case they don’t like you,

283
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,350
I’ll be the one to convince them instead.

284
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Thanks.

285
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,472
Damn, what’s going on

286
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,144
We’ll be fine.

287
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,312
We still have time.

288
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,456
We don’t have time.

289
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,192
We’re here to ask for their money.

290
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,424
We can’t keep them waiting.

291
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,472
There’s only one option left.

292
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,930
Let’s go.

293
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,016
Phi, it’s on the 24th floor.

294
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,104
Come on!

295
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,024
Excuse me, you’re Mr. Padtaphi, right?

296
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:24,200
My boss asked me to let you know
something urgent came up.

297
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:26,520
He’ll need to reschedule your presentation.

298
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,248
We’re so sorry.

299
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,848
It’s alright.

300
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,232
We can reschedule.

301
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:38,424
Okay.

302
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,592
Thank you.

303
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,632
Thank you for coming to help, Rita.

304
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,630
We really need your support
as a big account.

305
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,648
Don’t worry about it.

306
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,120
I’m in Phi’s fandom too.

307
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,184
Let’s help each other out.

308
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,872
Then let’s get this trending on X today.

309
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,560
What are you guys doing?

310
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,288
Where’s Yong?

311
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,776
I was asked to come here.

312
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,064
He went to see a girl,

313
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:18,808
so we asked you to come instead.

314
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,416
Here.

315
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,904
Hmm?

316
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,360
The hashtag is #SupportPhi.

317
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,448
Let’s start tweeting.

318
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,464
Yes, Gaogie.

319
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:30,744
The main fanbase account
wants 400k tweets.

320
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,576
Hold on.

321
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,456
What hashtag? What tweets?

322
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,328
We’re helping Phi find sponsors.

323
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,728
Without sponsors,
the show won’t air.

324
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,912
Then we’ll be out of jobs,
Phi will be sad,

325
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,640
and the earth fandom will be upset.

326
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
Nonsense.

327
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,830
Just posting isn’t enough.

328
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,216
There’s a better way.

329
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,470
What’s that?

330
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,824
Phi used to encourage us.

331
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,824
Today, Phi needs our encouragement.

332
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:03,820
Are we just going to do nothing?

333
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,136
Everyone, we need all your support.

334
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,912
We need all your energy.

335
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:11,336
We need all of you to come back.

336
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,288
Yes, let’s reunite.

337
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,216
Let’s come home.

338
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,648
Let’s help our Prince Phi

339
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,280
make his comeback.

340
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,008
We got this!

341
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:25,808
Sis!

342
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,344
We can do it!

343
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
We can do it!

344
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,440
We can do it.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT.
SUPPORTPHI EARTHFANDOM

345
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,390
I believe we can do it.

346
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,728
(Please help us.)

347
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:37,512
(The hashtag is #SupportPhi.)

348
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,504
What?

349
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,024
We only got 9,000 views.

350
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,176
And what’s this?

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,072
The comments are full of spam ads.

352
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:47,424
What should we do?

353
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,144
We’ve already done so much.

354
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,528
Let it go.

355
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,992
I guess we can’t bring the fandom back.

356
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:54,990
No, I’ll keep going.

357
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,024
Let’s come up with a new campaign, Rita.

358
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,712
Well, I want to help,

359
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:03,208
but I’ve skipped work all day.

360
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,032
Are you going to leave me?

361
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,200
I’m not leaving you.

362
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:09,336
I’m not.

363
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:10,616
Not at all.

364
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,648
I’m not leaving you.

365
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,736
But I have to make a living.

366
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,728
- I’m rooting for you.
- Sis!

367
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,488
- I’m rooting for you.
- No!

368
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,384
Believe in yourself.

369
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:19,400
- Sis!
- You can do it.

370
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:20,064
You can do it.

371
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,088
I’m rooting for you.

372
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,064
Sis!

373
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:24,296
No!

374
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:26,328
What should we do?

375
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,424
Keep trying.

376
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,536
I have to get back to work.

377
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:30,440
Hey.

378
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Hey.

379
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,856
Gie!

380
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,848
Why am I the only one left?

381
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Let’s post more.

382
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Thank you.

383
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:52,296
Ouch.

384
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,728
Oh, no.

385
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,464
Wear my shoes.

386
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,256
You still have many places to go.

387
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,160
It’s alright.

388
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:18,420
I really want to help you.

389
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,344
Don’t be so hard on me.

390
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,510
Wear these.

391
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Take those off.

392
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,872
Thank you for the shoes.

393
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,584
They’re much more comfortable.

394
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:09,680
Next time, before you accept anyone’s appointment, screen them for me first.

395
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:11,944
If we sponsor that kind of reporter,

396
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,488
we’ll get canceled too.

397
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,016
I’m sorry, Boss.

398
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,576
You heard that, right?

399
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Mmm.

400
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,776
It’s alright. If they’re not interested,

401
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
we can go somewhere else.

402
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,208
Put the shoes on.

403
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,208
Our show is doing

404
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,448
a new kind of marketing for farmers

405
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:56,450
and addressing the root causes
of their problems.

406
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,864
We improve, encourage,
and build on their strengths

407
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,856
using our journalism experience

408
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,592
to solve the right problems.

409
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,280
Mr. Padtaphi, Mr. Tamtawan,

410
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,992
you can come inside in 5 minutes.

411
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:14,016
Okay.

412
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,810
Am I good to go?

413
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
You forgot the shoes.

414
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
Oh, right.

415
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,816
I don’t know how many times I’ve told you

416
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,728
that you’re amazing.

417
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,288
After everything said about you,

418
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,392
the old you would’ve gotten mad,

419
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,600
lost your temper, or given up.

420
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,624
But now you’re smiling at me.

421
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,770
Phi,

422
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,600
don’t let anything distract you.

423
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,472
You can always get a second chance.

424
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,696
Look at me.

425
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,488
Someone gave me a second chance
to be a producer.

426
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
No matter if they say yes or no today,

427
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,288
you’ll always be a true journalist to me.

428
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,768
Well…

429
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:36,088
If I get sponsorship today,

430
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,950
let’s have a meal together.

431
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,830
Sure.

432
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,584
Mr. Padtaphi, Mr. Tamtawan,
please have a seat.

433
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,168
Thank you.

434
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,192
Hello.

435
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
Hello.

436
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,128
Sorry, my meeting ran late.

437
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:08,540
You had to wait for a long time, Phi.

438
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Paul.

439
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:24,650
Some stickers are so hard to remove.

440
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,376
Sorry, I’m just too popular.

441
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,472
I really tried not to be.

442
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,944
Maybe they just gave you leftover stickers.

443
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,280
Hey!

444
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:41,832
What are you doing?

445
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,200
You can’t remove this one.

446
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:43,920
Why not?

447
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:46,856
It’s from Paul, okay?

448
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,608
Stay away from it.

449
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:50,144
Remove the other ones.

450
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,056
I’m possessive of it.

451
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,096
Yeah?

452
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,336
He’s just Paul.

453
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:55,464
Who are you?

454
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Papa.

455
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,656
You really are strict.

456
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,640
I think I’m into him.

457
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,288
It’s been so long.

458
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,608
It really has.

459
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,792
Thank you so much, Paul,

460
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:29,984
and sorry for wasting your time.

461
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:32,312
I’ll make a new deck

462
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:34,800
and come back to present it to you.

463
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,664
Actually, I think everyone likes your show,

464
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,496
but my boss…

465
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,528
I understand.

466
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,920
No one wants to sponsor

467
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,256
someone with a bad image like me.

468
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,840
Come on.

469
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:52,120
People will forget.

470
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,440
Don’t be upset. Come on.

471
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:57,848
Keep your energy up.

472
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,064
Don’t be upset.

473
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:00,096
You got this.

474
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Listen.

475
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,464
You need to smile at yourself, okay?

476
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:04,640
No matter what happens.

477
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,072
Okay.

478
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:06,928
Yes.

479
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,056
That’s it.

480
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,768
This is the Phi I know.

481
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,770
Hold on.

482
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,984
Actually, I have another company

483
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,960
I own with my friends.

484
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:20,528
I think your show is right for that.

485
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,168
You can make a new deck

486
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
and present it to my friends.

487
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,336
I’ll help talk to them for you.

488
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,184
Really?

489
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,208
Yes.

490
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,104
Have I ever lied to you?

491
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,232
Thank you so much.

492
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:37,824
No worries.

493
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,160
I’ll see you soon.

494
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,736
Mmm.

495
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,776
Bye.

496
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Let’s go.

497
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,440
Hey, hey, hey!

498
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,768
Eat slowly.

499
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,210
Drink some water.

500
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,432
I ate too fast.

501
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,360
I just want to finish this
as soon as possible.

502
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,240
Look.

503
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,080
Paul’s face doesn’t age at all.

504
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,216
Really?

505
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Yeah.

506
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,848
I knew he’d be successful one day.

507
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,032
He’s a business owner now.

508
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,704
I thought you said you were in a hurry.

509
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,728
Why are you talking so much?

510
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:45,730
Oh.

511
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:47,056
Why not?

512
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,472
Hey, can you take a look?

513
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,712
Which color do you like for this page?

514
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,480
Dark red.

515
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,016
Right? I think Paul will definitely like
dark colors more than pale ones.

516
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,664
Help me choose.

517
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,424
Which one should I wear?

518
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,664
Dark or light?

519
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:16,144
Just wear whichever.

520
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,208
How about this one?

521
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,400
This one? Really?

522
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,480
Wait, but the leather jacket is cool.

523
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,888
Won’t it be too extra though?

524
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,752
I’m just going to walk past his room.

525
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,664
What did you say?

526
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,960
I’m going to walk past his room.

527
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,000
Gosh, I don’t know anymore.

528
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,264
Help me!

529
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,576
Just pick whichever color you want.

530
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,424
It’s your choice.

531
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:36,832
Why are you irritated?

532
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,384
If I were an overthinker,

533
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,860
I’d think you’re jealous.

534
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,472
You’re quite delusional.

535
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:54,620
Paul likes navy blue.

536
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,456
I saw him using a navy blue phone case.

537
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:58,504
Really?

538
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,808
Yeah.

539
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:00,848
Thanks.

540
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,880
It’s trending?

541
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:41,320
Wait, what’s with the spike
in engagement?

542
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,400
Forgiving someone isn’t a big deal,

543
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:50,400
but giving them a chance is hard.

544
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,296
Phi’s trying to ask for a second chance
with a guilty heart.

545
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:56,072
If you’ve forgiven him,

546
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,070
don’t forget to give him that chance too.

547
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,808
Let’s give someone
a chance to move forward.

548
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,608
PrincePadtaphi SupportPhi

549
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,232
(THANK YOU:)

550
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Oh.

551
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,224
There’s still a lot to do.

552
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,448
Hey.

553
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:57,016
- Shh!
- Morning, Gaogie.

554
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:00,128
Oh.

555
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,256
How was your date?

556
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,632
It was good.

557
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,560
She looks just like her pictures.

558
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:10,816
She’s cute.

559
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,192
The only downside is
she’s the same age as me.

560
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,024
Hey, don’t be picky.

561
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,020
You’re so old already.

562
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,824
You call me old?

563
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,120
You’re old too.

564
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,792
You should open your heart
to someone else.

565
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,736
Your youth and beauty won’t last forever.

566
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,776
Please.

567
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,200
How would I even find the time?

568
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,616
Taking care of this girl took up
all my sleeping time.

569
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
Well…

570
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,672
How do I say it?

571
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,810
My friends…

572
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
have agreed to sponsor your show

573
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,960
because of the over 500k posts
supporting you last night.

574
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,130
That’s amazing.

575
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,384
Really?

576
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:26,056
Yeah.

577
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,576
Thank you so much, Paul.

578
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,672
Thank you.

579
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,424
Do you want to have dinner
to celebrate tonight?

580
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Of course.

581
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,648
Well, if I get sponsorship today,

582
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,448
let’s have a meal together.

583
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,688
You two go ahead.

584
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,160
I have work this evening.

585
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Hey.

586
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,320
Then we don’t have to go.

587
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,464
I feel bad.

588
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,072
It’s like I’m stealing
your boyfriend for dinner, Tam.

589
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,232
Uh…

590
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:06,272
No.

591
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,992
We’re not together.

592
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:10,496
What?

593
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,496
Did I get it wrong all this time?

594
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:14,960
I thought you two were together.

595
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:19,728
Yeah.

596
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Oh.

597
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:26,616
In that case, I need to
choose a good restaurant.

598
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,520
See you later, Phi.

599
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:29,544
Okay.

600
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Thank you.

601
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,936
Finally!

602
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:46,672
Hey, do you think

603
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,968
Paul was acting weird?

604
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,840
Why would he want to know
if we’re together?

605
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:58,016
He was checking because he likes you.

606
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,064
Really?

607
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,600
That’s too bad.

608
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,350
What should we do if he likes me?

609
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,728
Nothing.

610
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,600
Isn’t that a good thing?

611
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,824
We came here to make him like you.

612
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,872
You got work done

613
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,864
and your dream came true.

614
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,824
Hey, wait, where are you going?

615
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:25,232
My car is over there.

616
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,240
I don’t want to be a third wheel.

617
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:29,696
I’ll get a taxi.

618
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,536
You’re bothering me so much!

619
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,944
No, I’m not.

620
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,112
No, I’m lazy.

621
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:03,088
Come on, don’t be lazy.

622
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:05,090
It’s not that hard.

623
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:06,832
Please.

624
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,744
Please record a clip for me.

625
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,872
I’m auditioning to co-DJ with Paul.

626
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:15,760
You can pretend to call
and ask for my advice.

627
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,880
Please.

628
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,104
Fine, but I won’t help you for free.

629
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,384
Give me one week of free meals.

630
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,672
I’ll give you two.

631
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Can we start now?

632
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,792
I think so.

633
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
Okay.

634
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,824
What do you want me to call you about?

635
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,208
Anything. Just improvise.

636
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Come on.

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,320
Fine.

638
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
Recording starts in

639
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,232
5, 4, 3, 2…

640
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,552
We’re in our third hour, guys.

641
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:53,552
Let’s answer some calls from our listeners.

642
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:56,232
Beep. Beep.

643
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,808
Beep. Beep. Beep.

644
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,840
Hi, there.

645
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:02,984
Hi.

646
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,208
Make a proper sound.

647
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,950
Hi.

648
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,784
Hi, may I know who I’m speaking to?

649
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020
Tawan.

650
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:17,304
Ah, Tawan.

651
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:20,408
What would you like advice on today?

652
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,256
It’s about…love.

653
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:27,520
Oh, love.

654
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,648
A teenage problem.

655
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:31,650
Tell the doctor your symptoms.

656
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,848
I have a crush on my best friend.

657
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,888
Mmm.

658
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:40,230
We didn’t really get along at first.

659
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,392
He was like a nuisance to me,

660
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:48,328
always causing trouble
and asking me to fix it.

661
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,448
But as we got to know each other

662
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,744
over time and I saw him grow up,

663
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:55,080
somehow I became happy.

664
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,224
Before I knew it,

665
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,072
I’d fallen for him.

666
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,232
But to him,

667
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:06,840
I’m probably just a friend
who supports him.

668
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,856
Do you think I should tell him how I feel

669
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,208
or keep my feelings to myself
and keep being a good friend?

670
00:43:21,984 --> 00:43:23,980
Whoa.

671
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,536
Hmm, I totally get it.

672
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:36,456
I believe many of our viewers have been through what you’re going through, Tam.

673
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,312
But if you ask me,

674
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,392
I think…

675
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,624
you should tell him.

676
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,080
Who knows?

677
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,790
He might be waiting to hear it.

678
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,192
Hey, Tam!

679
00:44:09,576 --> 00:44:11,580
I’m going to report you to the NGOs.

680
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,800
Go ahead.

681
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,728
Are you okay?

682
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,000
You're not in a very good mood.

683
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,264
I’m fine.

684
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:21,736
Can I help you with anything?

685
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh, I’m looking for Phi.

686
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:24,784
Just wanted to ask

687
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,780
if he was able
to get any sponsors for the show.

688
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,904
Yes, he did.

689
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:30,432
He’s out to celebrate right now.

690
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,288
Oh, then why didn’t you follow him?

691
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:37,490
I’m celebrating by myself.

692
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,824
I think he wants to
celebrate alone with the client.

693
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,820
They were senior and junior
in the same club.

694
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,520
They’re close.

695
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:10,672
Tam, I don’t know why you two
broke up or drifted apart,

696
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:12,064
but from what I’ve seen,

697
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,528
your bond can never be broken.

698
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,136
Why do you think so?

699
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:25,384
Think about it, Tam, if you had
no feelings for each other anymore.

700
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,144
When the other person
did something good or bad,

701
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,424
you wouldn’t care.

702
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,192
You’d be indifferent.

703
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,200
But from what I’ve seen,

704
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,200
you two still care about
the little things about each other.

705
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,592
You still want to scold

706
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,528
and smile at each other.

707
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,090
DON’T LET ME CATCH YOU SMILING.

708
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,840
He’s just an ex.

709
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,840
Yes, he’s just an ex,

710
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,640
but I want you to think carefully.

711
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,568
Deep down, how do you feel
about this ex?

712
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,840
DEMO: TEENAGE LOVE TROUBLES
BY PADTAPHI

713
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:33,864
Here you go.

714
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,730
What?

715
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,400
Nothing.

716
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,872
Root for me.

717
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,980
Yeah.

718
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:02,328
(You should tell him. Who knows?
(He might be waiting to hear it.)

719
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,330
Phi.

720
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Hey, Phi.

721
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,660
I have something to tell you.

722
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,590
Phi!

723
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
What?

724
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,672
Nothing.

725
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,070
Tam!

726
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,680
Tell me honestly.

727
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,144
Why did you come back?

728
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,230
Hey!

729
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,912
I want my show up on a billboard like that.

730
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,144
And I only want you to be
the one who makes it happen.

731
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:33,500
You can always get a second chance.

732
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,168
Look at me.

733
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,832
Someone gave me a second chance
to become a producer.

734
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:39,864
Here.

735
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,696
Yong asked me to give you this.

736
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,280
Take good care of it

737
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
and don’t leave me again this time,

738
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,024
Mr. Producer.

739
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,216
Okay.

740
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,270
Tam,

741
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,760
don’t get go of Phi’s hand.

742
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,000
Right now,

743
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,568
you’re the only one who can help him.

744
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,712
If you still love him,

745
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,560
come back.

746
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,864
I know he’s my ex.

747
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,280
But he’s the ex I want to
start over with the most.

748
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,112
Hello, Paul.

749
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,544
Yes, I’ve arrived.

750
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,840
I’m about to go inside.

751
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,540
Okay.

752
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Phi.

753
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,552
Oh, why are you here?

754
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
I…

755
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
Nothing.

756
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:18,640
Let’s talk later then.

757
00:50:18,664 --> 00:50:19,752
I’m going inside.

758
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,792
Don’t go.

759
00:50:28,504 --> 00:50:30,432
I know you’ve liked him for a long time

760
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:34,730
and I know you still like him now.

761
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,688
I know he’s better than me in every way.

762
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,648
He’s smarter than me.

763
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,650
He’s more handsome than me.

764
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,112
He’s freaking taller than me.

765
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,216
You know that.

766
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Yes.

767
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,024
If you know that, why are you here?

768
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,192
Because I know that
even though he beats me in every way,

769
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,656
he’ll never know you better than I do.

770
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,080
I know you snore.

771
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:20,680
I know you like the color red.

772
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:23,100
I know eating chocolate
puts you in a good mood.

773
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:25,512
I know your shoe size is 42.5

774
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:29,328
I know you always keep Do Not Disturb on because you don’t like anyone calling you.

775
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,432
I know you still can’t forget me.

776
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,808
I won’t give up this time.

777
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:47,490
I’ll fight to win you back.

778
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,624
I think there’s still one thing
you don’t know.

779
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:08,792
I told Paul I liked him.

780
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:19,620
And I told him

781
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:25,140
he and I can only be brothers.

782
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,410
Why?

783
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,592
Because I…

784
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,312
I guess I still can’t forget my ex.

785
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,616
Heard it many times, how love’s a beautiful thing

786
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:03,112
So full of meaning

787
00:53:05,136 --> 00:53:06,520
Having someone is good for the soul

788
00:53:06,544 --> 00:53:10,744
It fills the space and makes your heart whole

789
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:14,328
It makes you tremble, makes you shy

790
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,792
It paints the world so bright

791
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:20,184
Having someone who will always be there

792
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:23,832
It makes you smile, that's what they say

793
00:53:23,864 --> 00:53:25,328
LET ME HELP SO YOU CAN REST.

794
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:29,800
I only knew the truth when love led me to you

795
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,040
If you think you know me well,

796
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,856
then you should know that

797
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,240
ever since you came back,

798
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,880
my life hasn’t been the same.

799
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,296
But if you think you know me best,

800
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,848
I don’t think so.

801
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,640
I used to think that way.

802
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,992
I used to think I knew you best,

803
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,144
but I didn’t.

804
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,760
So, I want us to

805
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,128
keep getting to know each other.

806
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:29,940
Do you want to get back together?

807
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,480
I’ve been waiting to hear that, you know?

808
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:53,230
Damn, we’re funny.

809
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:57,840
It’s like we’re straight out of a romcom

810
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,736
about exes who hate each other.

811
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,992
But have to see each other again?

812
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,856
To prove that no one is better than

813
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,860
this ex.

814
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,960
I don’t think we’re like that.

815
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,856
If we really were in a romcom,

816
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,464
right now we’d be…

817
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,630
You’re right.

818
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,592
What are we waiting for?

819
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:50,010
Will there be a new ending for me to find?

820
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,176
Tell me now, be kind

821
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,256
Did you return to make it right?

822
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,912
A renewal

823
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,176
Tell me now, be kind

824
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,320
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN
Did you return to make it right?

825
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:14,680
What are you doing today?

826
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,400
Shall we take Sosay to the beach?

827
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:20,016
Someone sneaked a cat into the office, right?

828
00:56:20,056 --> 00:56:20,776
Where are you going? Come here!

829
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:21,544
-Sosay!

830
00:56:21,568 --> 00:56:22,200
LET’S BREAK UP.

831
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:26,104
Yong told me that Tam loves you very much, Phi.

832
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,272
When you were gone,

833
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:29,270
I had a question I always wanted to ask you.

834
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,744
I found out why you left me that day.

835
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,816
I hate you!
