1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
Does this mean

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,520
old flames

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,720
are about to burn bright?

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,080
Actually, everyone really loves your demo.
But we have no sponsors.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,840
I’m going to find us sponsors.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
Sorry, my meeting ran late.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,280
Paul’s face doesn’t age at all.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Do you want to have dinner to celebrate tonight?

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
But I want you to think carefully, Tam.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,280
Deep down, how do you feel about this ex?

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,720
Do you want to get back together?

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
TAWAN: LET’S BREAK UP.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
LET’S BREAK UP.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
That day,

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
I made the worst mistake of my life.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,480
No one would forgive me for that.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,440
Not even myself.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Let’s go home.

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Hmm?

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,160
Stay at my house tonight.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
You want to leave now?

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Now?

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Be patient. I can’t leave yet.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,840
I need to talk to Paul
about the sponsorship.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Come with me?

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
No.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
That’d hurt Paul too much.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,719
It’d be one blow after another.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,680
So you’re confident now?

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Your face was pale earlier.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,600
But if you want to show off
your boyfriend, then fine.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
Really?

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
You can head home.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
I’ll talk to him quickly

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
and catch up with you, okay?

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Wait.

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,760
You’re not going to see Paul
and ditch me, are you?

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,360
Like I said,

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,720
we need to
keep getting to know each other.

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Not funny.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,640
Come on.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
I’m going inside.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,479
I’m treating my junior friend to a meal.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
We’re celebrating our new project.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh, hey, Yong.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Phi.

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,160
What a small world.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,680
You two know each other?

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Yes.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
How do you know each other?

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Oh, it’s a long story.

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,320
We go way back
to when I first started working.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
My first sponsorship

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,760
was for Yong’s show.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,840
He sponsored his senior
and now his junior.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
Thank you, client.

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
You’re welcome.

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,200
So are you here alone?

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,960
Uh…oh.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes, I’m here alone.

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
I’m just bored.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Please.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,520
Why don’t you join us for dinner?

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,520
Oh, no, it’s fine.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
You two enjoy your meal.

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
I won’t take up any more of your time.

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
By the way, Phi.

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes?

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Congratulations on finally
getting your sponsorship.

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Thank you.

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
Enjoy, Phi.

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,920
Paul, can we talk about the deal now?

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,920
I have somewhere to be.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
Are you going to see Tam?

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes.

78
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Honestly,

79
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,360
I’d gladly be dumped if it’s for Tam.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Yong told me that

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,120
Tam loves you very much, Phi.

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
He’s just talking nonsense.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
It’s true.

84
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,800
Tam sacrificed everything for you.

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,920
I don’t even know
if I’d have the guts to do what he did.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,480
Sacrificed what?

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
Why are you eating so little now?

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,720
Your papa is coming back.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
You have to behave yourself, you know?

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
There he is.

91
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Phi.

92
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
What’s wrong?

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
Is there a problem with work?

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I found out

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
why you left me that day.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
You left me

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,600
because Yong chose you, right?

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,040
How many years
have you and Phi been working here?

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Almost a year.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,440
You guys haven’t done
on-camera reporting yet, have you?

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,040
Not yet. Why?

102
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
I’m sending you out on location.

103
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,056
You’ll get to show your face and work on
a scoop by interviewing the locals.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,960
Really?

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
You’ll let us do interviews
on camera already?

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Only you, Tam.

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
What about Phi?

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
You left me

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
because you wanted to sacrifice for me.

110
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,680
You think you’re a hero or what?

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,960
Should I thank you?

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,160
No, Phi.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I don’t think I’m a hero.

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,240
I’m a villain.

115
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,919
Why didn’t you choose Phi
in the first place?

116
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
He wants to be on camera more than me.

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,240
I know, but he’s not ready.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,536
But he’s been practicing
news reporting and writing all this time.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
He can work with others.

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,400
He’s won so many news awards,
reporting and writing.

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Because you’re always there to help him.

122
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,920
You think I don’t know that?

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
If you really love him,

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,000
you should let him grow on his own.

125
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
Do you get it now?

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Do you get why I say I’m a villain?

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,199
I’d been hurting you all that time.

128
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
What do you mean?

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,639
You left me

130
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
just because you wanted me to grow?

131
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
Then why are you back now?

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Oh.

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Right.

134
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
Because I’ve hit rock bottom!

135
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,560
Phi.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
What else?

137
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,640
If someday I can get my life back together,

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
you’ll leave me again, right?

139
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
You’ll just disappear again, won’t you?

140
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
Phi, calm down.

141
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,800
Be honest with me.

142
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Why didn’t you tell me directly
the day you left?

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,600
How could you just leave me all alone, completely in the dark?

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
I’m sorry.

145
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
But now you know everything.

146
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Yes.

147
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,920
But I don’t know
what I should feel bad about first.

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,320
How I was such a loser
that Yong didn’t choose me

149
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,520
or how I’m still such a loser
who needs your help even now!

150
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,720
Phi, let’s wait until you calm down
then we can sit down and talk.

151
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Sosay!

152
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Hey! Sosay threw up!

153
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
Sosay is old.

154
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,560
She usually has stomach problems

155
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,400
I haven’t seen any other symptoms.

156
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,600
I’ll give her some medicine
to take at home.

157
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,600
If there’s any problem,
come see me right away.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,616
You’ve given her medicine before, right?

159
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Yes

160
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,960
I haven’t.

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
Can you teach me, just in case?

162
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,640
Of course.

163
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,960
First, put your two hands

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,839
between her teeth like this.

165
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Ah.

166
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,880
Hold the medicine like this,
then put it in. Yes.

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
Push it to the back of her tongue,
then quickly close her mouth.

168
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Okay.

169
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,000
Then slowly pet her.

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
Right here?

171
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes.

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,240
That will help her swallow
the medicine more easily.

173
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,360
No!

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Oh, shit.

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
What are you doing, Phi?

176
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,600
Warming up the cat food.

177
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,280
What food?

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,520
The wet food in the bag.

179
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,240
You can’t warm it up in the bag!

180
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,600
How would I know that?

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
Do it yourself then.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Why didn’t you ask me?

183
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
Do it.

184
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,000
I’m going to wash the dishes.

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,840
Phi, before you wash the dishes,

186
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,400
clean the microwave first.

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,160
No, it’s hot.

188
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,400
The vet said we should monitor
her symptoms for a couple of days.

189
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,760
Then you should take a day off tomorrow.

190
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,280
Take care of Sosay.
I’ll handle the rest.

191
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,760
But we have a team meeting tomorrow.

192
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,880
You can stay with Sosay.
I’ll go to the meeting.

193
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,040
Why do I have to stay with Sosay
while you go to work?

194
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,641
There are a lot of decisions
to make tomorrow, so I think…

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
You think what?

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
You think I can’t lead the meeting
by myself?

197
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,000
No, it’s not that.

198
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,160
I’ll…

199
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I’ll stay home and take care of Sosay.

200
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,440
Okay. Everyone’s here.

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,960
Let’s start the meeting.

202
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,240
Shouldn’t we wait for Tam?

203
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,800
Tam is on leave today.

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
It’s just us for this meeting.

205
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,840
Are you sure this is a good idea?

206
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:29,479
Tam proposed the ideas for this episode, did the research,

207
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
and secured the location.

208
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,559
Nhudee, you forgot the script.

209
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Listen.

210
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,440
I’ll finish what he started.

211
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,280
Let’s start the meeting now.

212
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,480
Sorry.

213
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I’m here.

214
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,960
Tam?

215
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,800
What’s that?

216
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,800
Oh, it’s clear now.

217
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
So you’re Sosay?

218
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,599
You’re even cuter in real life than on IG.

219
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,239
It’s not that I don’t trust you,

220
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
but Sosay was getting better, so I…

221
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
She looks down.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Is she sick?

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,800
You know you can’t bring pets
to the office.

224
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Yong is allergic.

225
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,480
Just don’t let him find out.

226
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,400
Hey, are you hiding something?

227
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
Mmm.

228
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,200
Someone sneaked a cat
into the office, right?

229
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,960
No.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,080
Move, Nhudee.

231
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Wait.

232
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Where’s the cat?

233
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,920
Hey, it’s a cat!

234
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,319
Catch it! Quickly!

235
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Hey!

236
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Catch it!

237
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Quickly!

238
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,560
Sosay!

239
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Where’s it going? Look here!

240
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Sosay!

241
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
It’s here!

242
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,560
Sosay, baby!

243
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,160
Catch it quickly!

244
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Sosay, baby, come here!

245
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Sosay!

246
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
I got her.

247
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Where’s Yong?

248
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh, no.

249
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Hey.

250
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,440
Oh, shit!

251
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
How did this get on air?

252
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
You guys act like
you don’t know the company rules.

253
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,239
You were warned about your last mistake but instead of learning from it,

254
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,760
you created another problem for me.

255
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
It’s my fault.

256
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,800
Tam has nothing to do with it.

257
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,560
The cat is sick

258
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,480
so I asked him to bring her here.

259
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,240
Why did you do something so stupid?

260
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,480
Go apologize to everyone.

261
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,040
Okay.

262
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Ugh.

263
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Why did you take the blame for me?

264
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
How does it feel

265
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,120
when someone else has to cover
for your incompetence?

266
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
Take Sosay home.

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,320
I’ll take care of things here.

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
But I want to help.

269
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Can’t you trust me?

270
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
I said I’ll take care of things here.

271
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,200
Do you think Phi and Tam
will get punished?

272
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,960
I don’t know.

273
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
Worry about yourself.

274
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,320
How are you, Yong?

275
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Are you feeling better?

276
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,960
Someone has to take responsibility for this

277
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,680
I’ll…

278
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh.

279
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,840
We’ll talk about this later.

280
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,200
Since when has Yong
been acting this young?

281
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,519
Since he started seeing a college girl.

282
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,440
She gave him a makeover
to match her style.

283
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, for someone his age,

284
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,440
it’s good enough that someone wants him.

285
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,800
How is this any good?

286
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,520
I like the old version of my brother better.

287
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,640
If I’d known he’d be like this,

288
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,640
I’d rather put up with him dating you.

289
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,240
Wait, why does that sound like an insult?

290
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,320
Sosay.

291
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,360
How are you, baby?

292
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Come here.

293
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,960
Come to Papa.

294
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
Are you done with work?

295
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,720
How’s Sosay?

296
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,080
Is she feeling better?

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,240
I fed her medicine, but she wouldn’t sleep.

298
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,936
I guess that’s why she looks a bit down,

299
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
but I’m not sure.

300
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Oh, why wouldn’t you sleep?

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,760
Hmm? Are you having stomach pain?

302
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,200
Papa will play a guitar for you.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Come on.

304
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Phi.

305
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,200
You should go to sleep.

306
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,000
I’m playing a song to lull Sosay to sleep.

307
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,840
What are you talking about?

308
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,840
She can’t sleep while you’re playing.

309
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,520
I can’t sleep either. I’m excited.

310
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,840
See? She wants me to play.

311
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
I’m going to be on TV tomorrow.

312
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I’m excited.

313
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,480
You’ll mess up if you don’t sleep.

314
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Sosay, come here.

315
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,160
TAM

316
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Hey.

317
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,120
Honestly, I thought I was going to fail.

318
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Why?

319
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,880
I haven’t achieved
any of my goals this year.

320
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,920
Saving money, working out,

321
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,680
going to the beach,

322
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,560
or taking you to visit Mom.

323
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,880
But at least I’m achieving one thing.

324
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,520
I’ll finally be on camera.

325
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
I’m really happy for you.

326
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
When I’m done with filming,

327
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,560
do you want to go to the beach?

328
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Let’s celebrate.

329
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,440
No.

330
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,240
What?

331
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I’m lazy.

332
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Please.

333
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,440
Please.

334
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,800
Meow.

335
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,600
Stop it.

336
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,040
I want to go. Meow.

337
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Sleep.

338
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Ugh.

339
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,800
Actually, you’re exhausted but you were waiting for Papa to come home, right?

340
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
I’m sleepy.

341
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,240
Get well soon, baby.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I’m leaving.

343
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Hey.

344
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,080
If you’re that sleepy, you shouldn’t drive.

345
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,320
Just spend the night here.

346
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You can leave tomorrow.

347
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
You don’t have work, right?

348
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,400
Alright then.

349
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,520
I’m staying here.

350
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Okay.

351
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
Come here, baby.

352
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,240
Come with Papa.

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Let’s sleep together.

354
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I’m staying the night because of the cat,
not you.

355
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,720
Where are you going?

356
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,160
Let’s go to sleep together.

357
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,560
I want to stay with you because of the cat

358
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
and because of you too.

359
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,960
What, Sosay?

360
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
You’re awake.

361
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
How’s Sosay?

362
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,000
I think she’s feeling better.

363
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
She was able to eat earlier.

364
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,280
Sosay.

365
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Here.

366
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,320
You must’ve been tired last night.

367
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,560
Take this so you feel better.

368
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,960
I also prepared some clothes for you

369
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,840
in case you want to take a shower.

370
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Even if you’re mad at me,

371
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
you have to take a shower, Phi.

372
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,960
What are you doing today?

373
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,680
Nothing.

374
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Do you want to take Sosay
to the beach together?

375
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
Which one should I wear?

376
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,920
Oh, wow.

377
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,320
Is our company producing idols now?

378
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,000
So much for hiding here from Nhudee.

379
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,360
Sorry for coming to work on a holiday.

380
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Nhudee told me

381
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,960
someone’s smitten with a girl.

382
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,080
Seriously?

383
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Alright, just tease me.

384
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,520
I’m not going to.

385
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Actually, you look cool with this hairstyle.

386
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Stop it.

387
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,760
I mean it.

388
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,600
You look like a ’90s artist at a reunion.

389
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Sure.

390
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,120
She wants me to meet her friends.

391
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,360
I think it’s a bit weird.

392
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
No, it’s not.

393
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,000
You’re just not used to it.

394
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Come on.

395
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,040
I’ll help you.

396
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,920
Let me see.

397
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,440
This one.

398
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,559
Totally not. This is too much.

399
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,000
Here.

400
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,080
A nature theme.

401
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,800
It looks like a fishing net.

402
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Here.

403
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This one is good.

404
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,720
It has fur. It’s giving idol vibes.

405
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,480
I hope when I get used to it this time,

406
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,840
I won’t have to change it.

407
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,999
Stop complaining like an old man.

408
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Here.

409
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
This one?

410
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,200
I’m rooting for you.

411
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,240
Sosay, we’ve arrived at the beach.

412
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
Do you want to get down?

413
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
Wait, let’s take a photo together.

414
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,400
Let’s take a photo together. Come on.

415
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,679
Let’s take a photo together.

416
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,760
Come on, baby.

417
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,680
Take some rest, Sosay.

418
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
Are you hungry?

419
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,600
I have fried meatballs.

420
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
They’re still hot.

421
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I’m not hungry.

422
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,200
How’s the interview tomorrow going?

423
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,200
It’s been moved to the morning.

424
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,000
I’ve done all the research.

425
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,240
Don’t worry.

426
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,320
Everything is going fine.

427
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,920
I’m not worried about work.

428
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,760
I just wanted to talk to you.

429
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,800
When you were gone,

430
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I had a question
I always wanted to ask you.

431
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,080
You know the answer now.

432
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
No.

433
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
I just wanted to know

434
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,800
how you were doing.

435
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I was fine.

436
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,520
I lived in Australia with my mom.

437
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
I studied during the day

438
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
and worked at her shop at night.

439
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
The weather’s better than here.

440
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,120
I’m not surprised.

441
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
What about you?

442
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,600
How were you doing here?

443
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
How dare you ask me that?

444
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,280
They say people come to the beach

445
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
either to escape the heat

446
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
or to escape love.

447
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,320
So I came here that day.

448
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
Did it help?

449
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,280
A little.

450
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,519
Tam!

451
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
You left me!

452
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,240
Why did you do this?

453
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
I hate you!

454
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
It’s like they say.

455
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,720
Time heals everything.

456
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,480
It’s so cheesy, but it’s true.

457
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,880
I really wanted to tell you then.

458
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,280
But I was scared 4 YEARS EARLIER

459
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,960
you’d say something
that’d make me give in.

460
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,360
So I chose to do what I believed
would make you hate me the most.

461
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,640
BUT IF I STAY,
I MIGHT END UP DESTROYING IT…
I HOPE YOU WON’T LET GO OF YOUR DREAM. I’LL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU,

462
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,560
BUT IF I STAY,
I MIGHT END UP DESTROYING IT…
I HOPE YOU WON’T LET GO OF YOUR DREAM. I’LL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU,

463
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,200
LET’S BREAK UP.

464
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,039
LET’S BREAK UP.

465
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,280
TAWAN: LET’S BREAK UP.

466
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,720
PHI

467
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,360
But isn’t it funny?

468
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,960
I was the one who blocked you on every channel.

469
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,840
But whenever I got a message or a call,

470
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,200
I always hoped it was from you.

471
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,080
You said time heals everything,

472
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,880
but why is it that after the past four years,

473
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,920
just one call from Yong about you

474
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,120
took me right back to where I was?

475
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
Time doesn’t help you forget.

476
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,280
It makes you strong enough to remember

477
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
what we’ve been through.

478
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
My throat is so dry.

479
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,800
I want to drink something refreshing.

480
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,520
What should I do?

481
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,320
I can drink by myself.

482
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,920
Can’t I feed you?

483
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
You’re not mad at me anymore, right?

484
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Hey, Yong.

485
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,920
Why are you still here?

486
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,240
She dumped me.

487
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,400
What happened?

488
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,120
She said I’m boring,

489
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,440
that I don’t understand what she says,

490
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,880
and that I’ve never watched any BL series.

491
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,200
But you’ve watched all the adaptations of The Legends of the Condor Heroes.

492
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,720
I don’t get T-Pop music.

493
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,640
The lyrics sound like mumbling.

494
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,880
But you can sing all of Bird Thongchai’s

495
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,160
songs just by hearing the intro.

496
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,720
♪ Light mist and smoke ♪

497
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,960
Stop it.

498
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,440
I feel old enough as it is.

499
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,920
So what if you’re old?

500
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,320
It doesn’t matter.

501
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,080
You just need to find someone
who’s into the same things as you.

502
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,720
I’m trying to do just that.

503
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I don’t know if I’ll ever find

504
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,720
someone like that again.

505
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,600
There are so many out there.

506
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,800
I’ll help you.

507
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,320
You also said that on the day we broke up, remember?

508
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
And you challenged me.

509
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,440
You said if I’m still single when I turn 40,

510
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,080
you’d come back and marry me.

511
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,360
You still remember that?

512
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Yeah.

513
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,600
You’re almost 40, right?

514
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,001
That’s why I’m trying to
find someone as soon as possible.

515
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
I don’t know.

516
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,480
You have to take responsibility.

517
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,400
If we don’t finish these, you can’t leave.

518
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
What?

519
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,040
Only these?

520
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
These are not enough. Go get more.

521
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,680
Whoa.

522
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Come on.

523
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Come on.

524
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,600
Cheers.

525
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Cheers.

526
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,920
Do you want to stay here tonight?

527
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,640
Alright, just come in
to get something to eat.

528
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,840
No, I have an appointment
tomorrow morning.

529
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,480
I need to go home and get ready.

530
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,560
Okay.

531
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,400
Say bye to your papa.

532
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,480
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

533
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,520
Bye-bye. Hey!

534
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,800
What is it?

535
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,520
Sosay peed blood.

536
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
What?

537
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
No!

538
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I found a urethral stone.

539
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,136
We’ll probably need to perform
an urgent surgery tomorrow morning.

540
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
Will she be alright?

541
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,200
It’s actually common,

542
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
but we’ll have to wait for the X-ray results.

543
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,600
Please excuse me.

544
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,640
Thank you.

545
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Thank you.

546
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,320
Let’s do what the vet said.

547
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,200
I have to go.

548
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,560
I have work early tomorrow.

549
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,456
I can call and ask to postpone it.

550
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
No.

551
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,960
You stay with Sosay.

552
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
I’ll take care of work.

553
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Will you be alright?

554
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Yes.

555
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,360
Promise me, Tam.

556
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,000
If something happens to Sosay tomorrow,

557
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,000
just be honest with me, okay?

558
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Yeah.

559
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Okay.

560
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Ugh.

561
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,720
Wake up, bro!

562
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Seriously? Wake up!

563
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Ugh.

564
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,360
Hey.

565
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
Aren’t you embarrassed?

566
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,800
Your ex had to comfort you
over your broken heart.

567
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,319
Did you bring me here?

568
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
No. If it were me,

569
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,760
I’d leave you in the room.

570
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,480
Go thanks Gie.

571
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Oh.

572
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,320
DRINK THIS TO CURE YOUR HANGOVER, UNCLE.

573
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,200
At this rate, just get back with her.

574
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,600
You don’t hate her anymore?

575
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,800
I hate all your exes.

576
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,800
But at least, she’s a good person.

577
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
She’s comfortable to be around.

578
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,240
Even I want to find a partner like her.

579
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,640
Thanks.

580
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Hmm?

581
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,880
Uh…

582
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,960
Oh, I’m going to print the script.

583
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,600
Yeah, just go.

584
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Hey.

585
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,600
Are you okay, Uncle?

586
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,880
Oh, you’re such a heavyweight drinker.

587
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,040
Please.

588
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,720
Can you open this for me?

589
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,480
Promise me, Tam.

590
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,800
If something happens to Sosay tomorrow,

591
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,960
just be honest with me, okay?

592
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,680
Phi, the set is ready and so is our guest.

593
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Okay.

594
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,840
TAWAN: SHE’S IN SURGERY.

595
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,599
THE VET SAID SOSAY’S BODY
IS VERY WEAK

596
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,560
FOR THE WORST, JUST IN CASE.
AND WE SHOULD PREPARE

597
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Phi?

598
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Phi.

599
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,040
Can you hold this for me?

600
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,200
Okay.

601
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Alright.

602
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,216
Let’s go over the script one more time.

603
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Sure.

604
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,840
Right there.

605
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,720
We have to ask them how smart farming
is different from regular farming.

606
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
How’s it going?

607
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,360
The vet hasn’t come out.

608
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,720
Have you eaten anything?

609
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,440
You’re always like this
when you’re stressed.

610
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,480
You won’t eat anything.

611
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,800
I warmed up some food for you.

612
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Careful, it’s hot.

613
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,520
Thank you.

614
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,960
Don’t you want to know
how work went today?

615
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,080
I already asked Gie.

616
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to know how smart farming
is different from regular farming.

617
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,720
We can farm all year round.

618
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,080
Okay.

619
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,720
We don’t have to wait for the right season.

620
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,200
She said no one cried on TV today.

621
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,360
There was only one reporter,
and he did his job professionally.

622
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,360
Even without his producer there.

623
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,720
Actually, I was stressed today.

624
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,760
It made me realize

625
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,160
what “the show must go on” means.

626
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,200
Anyway, thank you so much for keeping your promise and being honest with me.

627
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Mmm.

628
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,920
Sosay’s dads.

629
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
Yes?

630
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,040
Sosay is safe now.

631
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,440
Let her stay here a couple more days
so we can monitor her symptoms.

632
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,440
Please excuse me.

633
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,440
Thank you.

634
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,280
Thank you.

635
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
No worries.

636
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,560
There’s nothing
to worry about anymore, right?

637
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah.

638
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,120
Can you stay here tonight?

639
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,600
No, thank you.

640
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Phi.

641
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I made braised mackerel.

642
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,640
Come help me eat it.

643
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,960
I can’t finish it by myself.

644
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Tam.

645
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,576
Actually, there’s no braised mackerel.

646
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,640
I know.

647
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,320
Then why did you come in?

648
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,360
I just

649
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,160
don’t want to leave

650
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,680
what’s right here.

651
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,960
Me neither.

652
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,519
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

653
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,360
They say

654
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,600
you usually end up with what you hate.

655
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,440
Do you still hate me?

656
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,000
Where do you want to go on our date?

657
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,359
We’re back together.

658
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,919
I’m happy for you.

659
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,480
You want me to say that, don’t you?

660
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,120
How did you win over Gie’s mom?

661
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,880
You made me like you.

662
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,800
You can make my mom like you too.

663
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,960
The sponsors are all pulling out of the show.

664
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,200
It’s like we’re in a romance movie.

665
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,720
We fight, we break up.

666
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,840
Even though we didn’t have the best start,

667
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,800
we’re getting a happy ending, don’t you think?
