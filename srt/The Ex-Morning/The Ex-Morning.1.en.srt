1
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:05,866
Come on, right here.

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,100
Okay.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,453
Let’s hide the camera here.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,653
Okay. How’s the sound?

5
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:13,440
Check.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,006
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,420
The Sangsila community

8
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:20,180
has been facing narcotics issues for over 10 years.

9
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:23,260
Right now, the main dealer is still at large.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,286
Our news team is here on the ground,

11
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:29,486
speaking with locals about the ongoing spread of drugs.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,846
Find out the truth with me, Padtaphi Sinan.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,413
Let’s go.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,546
Come on.

15
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,113
Excuse me.

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,946
Hello.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,493
I’d like to ask you about drugs in this community.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
Do you have any information on that?

19
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:48,540
Excuse me.

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,680
Excuse me. Hi.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,906
Can I interview you about the drug issues in this community?

22
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,593
Hold on.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,140
Why?

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,560
It seems like no one wants to talk about it.

25
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,200
I think something’s going on.

26
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,646
Is everything alright, young man?

27
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,293
Uh, well…

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,040
I’d like to ask you something.

29
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,940
Do you have any clues about drugs in this community?

30
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,660
I don’t know anything about that.

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,086
Stop asking already.

32
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:16,320
Why?

33
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,780
Why does no one want to talk about it?

34
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:18,393
I don’t know!

35
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,120
I said stop asking!

36
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:20,846
Hey!

37
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,426
Hold on.

38
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,540
Are you secretly filming me?

39
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,193
Please calm down.

40
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:24,720
Hey.

41
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:25,393
Get out!

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
Get out of here and stay away from this area!

43
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,840
Get out!

44
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,606
Let’s go.

45
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,506
Get lost!

46
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:33,946
Get out!

47
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,166
Don’t ever come back!

48
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,033
Damn it!

49
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,993
Are you okay?

50
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:47,866
Of course.

51
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,126
I’m just worried
we won’t have any footage to make the news.

52
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,580
No one would let us interview them.

53
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,166
Yeah.

54
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:57,860
Actually, everyone around here knows

55
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,413
but no one dares to say anything.

56
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,373
Really?

57
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:01,873
Can you tell us what’s going on?

58
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,913
Don’t tell anyone.

59
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,500
Of course not.

60
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,213
The dealer is actually a member of parliament

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,773
who lives in the next village.

62
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,486
Really?

63
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,906
Yeah.

64
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,846
No one here dares sell drugs.

65
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,680
Really?

66
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:13,380
Yes.

67
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,306
Are most customers local
or from outside the community?

68
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,260
Both.

69
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,920
Grandma!

70
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,126
Give me three of the light stuff.

71
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,573
What?

72
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,100
What’s the light stuff?

73
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,840
Are you buying drugs?

74
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,780
Is she selling drugs?

75
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,920
Hey! Wait!

76
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:29,420
Auntie!

77
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,580
Wait up!

78
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:31,313
Hey!

79
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,753
Wait up!

80
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,566
Wait!

81
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,886
Wait up!

82
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Guys, we just received important info
from the grocery store lady.

83
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,493
The main dealer might be

84
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,560
the member of parliament who lives in this area.

85
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:44,613
We’ve already coordinated with the police.

86
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,453
We’re tracing the suspects.

87
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,006
Ouch!

88
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,746
Damn it!

89
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,793
Phi!

90
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:54,566
Get on!

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Great!

92
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,980
Let’s go!

93
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,053
Follow him!

94
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,173
Park here!

95
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,026
Go block him over there.

96
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,526
I’ll go this way.

97
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,120
Go!

98
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,186
He was coming this way.

99
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,340
Hey!

100
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,086
Hey!

101
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,000
Ouch!

102
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,106
He’s not here.

103
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,080
Where did he go?

104
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:43,990
Ouch!

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,306
Hold him!

106
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:50,626
Let go!

107
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:51,166
Hold him!

108
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,400
- Don’t move!
- 	Let go of me!

109
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,046
Don’t move!

110
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,146
Let go!

111
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,340
You’re not getting away with this!

112
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:56,640
I’ll send you to the police!

113
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,120
Let go!

114
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,013
Let go of me!

115
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,460
Don’t move!

116
00:03:58,493 --> 00:03:59,066
Everyone,

117
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,006
the police have successfully arrested
the members of the drug ring in the area.

118
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,113
They’re now taking the suspects into custody

119
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,346
for further investigation.

120
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,426
I’m Padtaphi Sinan, reporting.

121
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,906
Hey.

122
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:15,526
Huh?

123
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,313
What?

124
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,720
Is everything okay?

125
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,560
Why?

126
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,326
What?

127
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,973
Damn!

128
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,266
That was so real.

129
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,720
Ouch!

130
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,853
Stay still.

131
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,586
Here, apply it yourself.

132
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,226
Hey, our work is so good.

133
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,360
Do you think we’ll win?

134
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,893
With all this effort,

135
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,066
we deserve to win, don’t we?

136
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,486
Right?

137
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:49,333
When you were bleeding, my heart almost stopped.

138
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,553
Hey.

139
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,693
If we succeed this time,

140
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,053
we’ll finally get to debut.

141
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,593
Like them.

142
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,566
TURN TRUTH INTO POWER
TURN NEWS INTO THE FUTURE

143
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,413
You know what?

144
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,206
Off bought a room at this condominium

145
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,846
because he wanted to see his face
on the billboard every day.

146
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,846
You’re exaggerating.

147
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,046
It’s true.

148
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,853
I really want to know

149
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:22,326
how it feels to have my face on there one day.

150
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,766
You’ll make it one day.

151
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:31,813
I believe so.

152
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,546
I won’t be the only one.

153
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,340
You will make it too.

154
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,813
You know what?

155
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,526
Your name is Tamtawan.

156
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,126
Yeah.

157
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,120
But why do I call you Tawan?

158
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,620
Why?

159
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,940
Didn’t you tell me you liked calling me that?

160
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,020
Yes,

161
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,260
but I call you Tawan

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
because you’re my sun.

163
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,506
Padtaphi means earth.

164
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,340
Tawan means the sun.

165
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
How could earth survive

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,353
without the light of the sun, right?

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,733
So, you have to keep being the sun
and shining your light for me, okay?

168
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,860
Sure.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,740
I’ll support you forever.

170
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,613
So cute.

171
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,546
Let me kiss you.

172
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,853
This is so good.

173
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,466
4 YEARS LATER

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,746
THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS CHANGING
LET THE FORECAST PRINCE TAKE CARE OF YOU
PADTAPHI SINAN

175
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,326
Cut!

176
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,413
It’s a wrap, everyone.

177
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,613
Good Days

178
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:10,633
is the highest-rated show on the channel!

179
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,446
Yes, Phi!

180
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,966
Phi, here’s food support from the Prince fandom.

181
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:35,966
Thank you.

182
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,053
Phi, could you please sign this poster?

183
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,100
Here you go.

184
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:45,646
Thank you.

185
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,773
I’m off to present the news.

186
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:48,786
Don’t forget to watch the live stream.

187
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,926
That’s cool.

188
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,846
Hey.

189
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,406
Go.

190
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,966
Where’s the CG I asked you guys to fix?

191
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:20,706
Here it is.

192
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:21,700
Here it is.

193
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,320
This?

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,826
I told you to change the font color to make it easier to read.

195
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,086
Is this easy?

196
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,666
How is this easy?

197
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,513
Do I have to do it myself?

198
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:34,033
Sorry.

199
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,120
Let me fix it.

200
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,100
45% humidity but rain?

201
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,033
How could you write a script like this?

202
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,613
Do you want me to use this script?

203
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,446
Sorry.

204
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,653
They sent over this info.

205
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,520
Why not use the time you're making excuses
to actually fix the info?

206
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,246
Do I have to do it myself?

207
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:03,206
Sorry.

208
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,453
Whoa.

209
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,346
You’re so harsh, bro.

210
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,200
If you go on like this,

211
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,526
your team is all going to quit.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,853
True.

213
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,600
I feel bad for them.

214
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Next time, can you tell the reporter on your team

215
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,513
to not go off script so often?

216
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,980
Where’s my costume?

217
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:26,970
The car delivering it broke down on the way.

218
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,780
We’re rushing to get it ready.

219
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,480
Why are you only rushing today?

220
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,366
I told you costumes need to be ready one day in advance.

221
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,213
Why are you still standing here?

222
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,900
Go rush them!

223
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,493
We’re almost live!

224
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,240
- Okay.
- Hey.

225
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,726
Calm down.

226
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,533
Calm down.

227
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,540
If your costume doesn’t arrive in time,

228
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,346
you can borrow one from my team.

229
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,346
Wow.

230
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,293
Not only are you handsome, Mr. Tae,

231
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,106
but you’re also kind.

232
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,413
Don’t bother.

233
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,766
My costume has been approved.

234
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,353
I need to wear that costume only.

235
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,886
Mind your own business.

236
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,173
Get ready to start the news.

237
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,780
In 3…2…

238
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:23,906
That’s all for Good News Morning today.

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,553
Yes, and now our Forecast Prince is waiting.

240
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,820
Let’s meet him!

241
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:38,466
FORECAST PRINCE

242
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,826
Hi.

243
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,140
You’re watching Good Days,

244
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,360
the Weather is Always Changing.

245
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:47,406
I’m your rain-repellent doll, Padtaphi Sinan.

246
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,080
I bet you’re wondering why I’m dressed like this today.

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,453
It’s related to the weather you’ll face today.

248
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,873
The Meteorological Department has warned of

249
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,986
heavy rain all over Thailand

250
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,093
due to the monsoon trough passing over

251
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:06,320
the northeast and central regions,

252
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:10,980
entering the low-pressure trough in the South China Sea.

253
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,566
The relative humidity is 85%

254
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:20,966
This means there’s a chance of heavy rainfall

255
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,820
in the central and upper central regions.

256
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,073
If you’re going outside,

257
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:28,980
don’t forget to bring an umbrella.

258
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,713
Can I ask you something?

259
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,913
I’ve been wondering for a while.

260
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,666
Where’s the upper central region?

261
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,166
The upper central region consists of

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,453
areas from Lop Buri to Nakhon Sawan, Tae.

263
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,053
I see.

264
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,393
If my mom’s place is in Ayutthaya,

265
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:56,066
which is next to Lop Buri,

266
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,693
on the 30th floor.

267
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,193
Is that “upper” enough?

268
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,200
It’s not that kind of “upper”, Tae.

269
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,693
Oh, really?

270
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,126
Yeah.

271
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:11,266
Come on. Don’t tease him, Tae.

272
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,560
Please continue, Phi.

273
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,186
Alright.

274
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,453
I hope this rain-repellent doll

275
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:21,926
can help you deal with the weather today.

276
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:23,760
Don’t forget to tune in to Good Days.

277
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:24,906
We’re out of time today.

278
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,713
See you tomorrow.

279
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,873
Bye.

280
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,526
Cut!

281
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,520
Hey, Tae.

282
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,146
Thank you.

283
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,073
What do you want from me?

284
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,433
What are you talking about?

285
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,846
You think I don’t know

286
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,353
you were trying to get on my nerves?

287
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,940
Huh?

288
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,406
I wasn’t trying to get on your nerves.

289
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,890
I was just curious.

290
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,273
That’s why I asked.

291
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,800
I mean, you keep saying it’s going to rain,

292
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:08,320
but it never happens.

293
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:10,320
Your news is fake,

294
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,673
so I had to double-check for the viewers.

295
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,173
What do you want?

296
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,880
Fake news, huh?

297
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,106
Calm down, bro.

298
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,533
Fake news, huh?

299
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:18,940
Fake news, huh?

300
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,100
Go tell Yong

301
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:30,340
that if this jerk is still on the show, I won’t do it.

302
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,933
If you’re in, I’m out.

303
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,060
What are you guys doing?

304
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,400
We’re still live!

305
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,373
Huh?

306
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:39,746
Here!

307
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,733
We’re still live!

308
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,780
It’s not my fault.

309
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
You saw that Tae was trying to get on my nerves.

310
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,326
That doesn’t matter anymore.

311
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,633
The footage of you throwing coffee on Tae is everywhere.

312
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,793
The whole country is cursing you out.

313
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,686
Who let the camera keep broadcasting live?

314
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
The staff said there was a system issue.

315
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,060
I’m going to meet with the board
and find a way to resolve this.

316
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,420
In the meantime, you should lay low for a while.

317
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,653
What do you mean?

318
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,650
Don’t tell me you’re suspending me.

319
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:35,680
That’s up to your interpretation.

320
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,713
Damn it!

321
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,926
What should I do?

322
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:06,780
A BULLY REPORTER.
SO DISAPPOINTED.

323
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:07,271
#BANPADTAPHI

324
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:07,900
NO WONDER HE’S SUCH A POSER.
I REGRET WATCHING HIM EVERY DAY.

325
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,440
FROM PRINCE TO BULLY.

326
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,206
SHOULDN’T HAVE SOLVED PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE.
I WON’T WATCH HIM AGAIN.

327
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:09,770
#BANPADTAPHI

328
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:14,886
FIRE HIM!

329
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:15,600
HIS COMPANY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH HIM!
BAD ROLE MODEL!

330
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,353
BAN HIM FROM SOCIETY!

331
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,933
THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS CHANGING
LET THE FORECAST PRINCE TAKE CARE OF YOU
PADTAPHI SINAN

332
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,540
TURN TRUTH INTO POWER
TURN NEWS INTO THE FUTURE

333
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,513
Alright.

334
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,700
Let’s see.

335
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,940
Go!

336
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,953
ANNOUNCEMENT:
WINNERS OF FRESH REPORTERS CONTEST 2020

337
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,093
We didn’t win.

338
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,766
Bummer.

339
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,760
No.

340
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,620
This is last year.

341
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,726
Huh?

342
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,346
Isn’t it this one?

343
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,693
Padtaphi.

344
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,160
Tamtawan.

345
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,666
First prize winners.

346
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,706
First prize?

347
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:12,726
First prize!

348
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,073
We won first prize!

349
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,460
We did it!

350
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,300
Finally!

351
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,913
Is this real?

352
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,540
I can’t believe it.

353
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:21,300
It’s true, right?

354
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,260
Of course!

355
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,260
First prize winners.

356
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,860
FAVORITE CONTACT: TAWAN

357
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,330
I tried my best to defend you.

358
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,120
The board greenlighted Good Days to continue

359
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,380
but there will be some changes to the format.

360
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,293
What changes?

361
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,826
See for yourself.

362
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,233
TAE TREENAT JARUSAKKUL

363
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,780
OBJECTIVES, LENGTH, GENRE

364
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:47,413
SHOW HOST: TAE TREENAT JARUSAKKUL

365
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,466
Yong?

366
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,366
This basically means he’s replacing me.

367
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I’m doing this to help you.

368
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,120
Right now, the public sympathizes with Tae.

369
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,046
If Tae gets compensated, it’ll help lower the temperature.

370
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,593
But Good Days is my show.

371
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,980
When will I get to work on it again?

372
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,600
When the public forgives you.

373
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,980
If I don’t go on TV at all,

374
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,980
when will the public forgive me?

375
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,306
There’s only one way.

376
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,800
You have to create a new show.

377
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:28,833
But you must promise to improve yourself

378
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,360
and stop being hot-headed.

379
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,093
Fine.

380
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,006
You gave me your word.

381
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,846
Good.

382
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,340
I’ll have you meet the producer for your new show.

383
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,333
Who?

384
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,766
He just graduated from Australia.

385
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,166
News major.

386
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:10,320
First class honors.

387
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,266
What use is the first class honors?

388
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,160
Does he have any actual work experience?

389
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Enough to supervise you.

390
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,793
There he is.

391
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,340
Come in.

392
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,933
Tamtawan.

393
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,580
What the hell is going on?

394
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,360
Why did you bring him back?

395
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,140
Do you think anyone else

396
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,733
would want to work with you right now?

397
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:01,086
But you know that…

398
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,493
I don’t care.

399
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
There’s no way I’m going to work with him.

400
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,906
In that case,

401
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,586
do you want to quit?

402
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,753
Hmm?

403
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,593
A reporter without a news program?

404
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:32,373
You think any company would hire you?

405
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,280
If you want to work here,
give Tam a tour of the office.

406
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,353
Go.

407
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,993
I need to get back to work.

408
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:46,120
Yong, I need you to sign this document.

409
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:46,633
Okay.

410
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,346
Oh, hey, Tam.

411
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:49,426
When did you come back?

412
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,686
Hi, Rita.

413
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,713
You’re back.

414
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,120
Wait.

415
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,120
Don’t tell me…

416
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,800
Phi asked you to come back and work with him.

417
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,980
Then why did you guys…?

418
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,740
Please excuse me.

419
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,013
So we’re going to see them work together?

420
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:25,860
It’s a dream I never even dared to dream.

421
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,346
Why did you come back?

422
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,066
I was born here.

423
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,206
Why couldn’t I come back?

424
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,460
Funny.

425
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,200
Why?

426
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,233
You couldn’t survive abroad?

427
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,920
That mouth of yours

428
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
is the reason you have to work with me now.

429
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,360
Go away.

430
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
A look back at Padtaphi Sinan’s career.

431
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,346
From Forecast Prince to Hot-Headed Prince overnight.

432
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,913
Padtaphi entered the industry

433
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,920
by winning the Fresh Reporters Contest
before debuting and joining Good News.

434
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:36,233
He rose to fame with a viral emotional interview clip.

435
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:40,800
After the scandal, hashtag #BanPadtaphi was created

436
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,800
with netizens commenting such as:

437
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,680
“Bullshit reporter.”

438
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,833
“Serves him right for being so full of himself.”

439
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,706
“My friends are in the crew.”

440
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,066
“They said the only good thing about him is his looks.”

441
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,480
Will you stop reading?

442
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,513
You’re annoying.

443
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,086
Don’t you have anything else to do?

444
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,480
Why?

445
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,713
You can’t accept the truth?

446
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,793
You did everything they said.

447
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:03,666
Look.

448
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,106
“Last I heard, no one in the company….”

449
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,613
Will you stop reading?

450
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,920
Hey!

451
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,533
Sorry.

452
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,220
Why are you apologizing?

453
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,680
I just didn’t want my trophy to break.

454
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,353
Your trophy isn’t broken,

455
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,353
but your laptop is.

456
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,180
What?

457
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,546
No!

458
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
How long are you going to keep ruining my life?

459
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,046
Ta-da!

460
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,033
I got you coffee.

461
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,800
Have you two talked it out?

462
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,493
Oh, I guess I came in at the wrong time.

463
00:26:14,513 --> 00:26:16,026
No, Yong.

464
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,913
I’ve made my decision.

465
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,910
If I have to work with him,

466
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,440
I’d rather quit.

467
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,406
I was just reading the news.

468
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,193
What the hell?

469
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,120
I already have enough problems.

470
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,660
Now I need to get my laptop fixed too.

471
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,106
Just scream.

472
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,266
Scream it out.

473
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,280
Don’t hold it in.

474
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,233
Hey!

475
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:55,273
What the hell do you want from me?

476
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,333
I don’t want anything.

477
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,766
I’m just going to get your laptop fixed.

478
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,086
Stay out of my business.

479
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
If you don’t want to go with me,

480
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,520
I can take it myself.

481
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,240
But if I find any unusual files on it,

482
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,360
I won’t take responsibility.

483
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,660
So?

484
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,000
Fine!

485
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,126
You’re tuning into the final part with your DJ.

486
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:48,126
This song goes out

487
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:50,406
to those who still can’t forget their exes.

488
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,700
Three Man Down’s “Dreaming of My Ex.”

489
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,100
33.

490
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:04,760
Hey.

491
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,360
Are you Phi?

492
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,020
Yes.

493
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,173
And you’re Tam?

494
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,686

Do you see anyone sitting there?

501
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,206
Have a seat.

502
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,953
Phi, right?

503
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,506

Hi.

516
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,333
Oh, hey.

517
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:49,713
What brings you here?

518
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,553
I saw you briefly on TV.

519
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,550
You’re a reporter or something, right?

520
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:55,550
I’m a weather reporter.

521
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,386
My office is just nearby.

522
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,713
My laptop won’t open.

523
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:00,580
Can you take a look?

524
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,626
Sure.

525
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,073
By the way,

526
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:12,346
you two have been together for a long time.

527
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,040
We’re not together anymore.

528
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,053
What?

529
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:16,260
Alright.

530
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,186
Go have a seat.

531
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,326
I’ll take care of this.

532
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,333
I’ll install Windows for you.

533
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,840
Go have a seat while you wait.

534
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:45,806
Alright.

535
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,146
Hold on.

536
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,366
I’ll set a new password for your Windows.

537
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,806
What password do you want?

538
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,560
1234 will do.

539
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,046
No, that’s too easy.

540
00:30:58,093 --> 00:30:59,786
Make it difficult.

541
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,780
But you have to be able to remember it.

542
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,553
My time of birth then.

543
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,026
1555.

544
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,246
But you told me it was 4 p.m.

545
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,760
It should be 1655.

546
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,280
Let’s go with my room number instead.

547
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,280
4407.

548
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,280
Your room is 4409.

549
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,353
Oh, I give up!

550
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:25,800
I’ll make it 1234 then.

551
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,166
Okay?

552
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,006
Hold on.

553
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,640
Let’s go with this number.

554
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,006
I’m sure I won’t forget it.

555
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,393
I’ve already fixed it.

556
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:45,390
The hard disk is just a little loose.

557
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,020
I’ll log in and check.

558
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:50,280
What’s your password?

559
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,266
I’ll write it down for you.

560
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,760
Do you have a paper?

561
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:02,520
No need.

562
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,433
Just tell me.

563
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,653
096

564
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,773
409

565
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,946
1623

566
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,080
What?

567
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:21,973
I can’t hear you.

568
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:22,800
Tell me again.

569
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,886
Say it louder!

570
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,013
Come on.

571
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,806
096

572
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:30,866
096

573
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,400
409

574
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:33,300
409

575
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,346
1623

576
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,373
1623

577
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:39,946
Wait.

578
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,080
This password seems familiar.

579
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,473
Is it your phone number?

580
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,340
It’s not his number.

581
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,846
Okay.

582
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
The hard disk isn’t broken.

583
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,393
It’ll just be 200 baht.

584
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,533
Thank you.

585
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,013
Can you give me your QR code?

586
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,640
- I’ll transfer the money.
- 	Hold on.

587
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,886
I’m not accepting bank transfers right now.

588
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,673
I’ve been scammed a lot.

589
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,006
Can you pay in cash?

590
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,613
Here’s 200 baht.

591
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:12,480
Oh.

592
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Thanks.

593
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,806
Give me your account number.

594
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,653
I’ll transfer you the money.

595
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,340
Hmm? What did you say?

596
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,926
I said give me your account number.

597
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,160
I’ll transfer you the money.

598
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,860
I don’t want to owe you.

599
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,133
Your laptop password

600
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,753
is my PromptPay number.

601
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,420
Your ex is a nice guy.

602
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:45,660
Even though you’re no longer together,

603
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:47,033
he still paid for the repair cost.

604
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Nice guy? Please.

605
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,886
He just had to take responsibility for what he broke.

606
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,953
He just wanted to feel less guilty.

607
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,366
Hey.

608
00:33:56,526 --> 00:34:00,180
Are you talking about the hard disk

609
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,793
or this heart?

610
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,926
Have you had a lot of customers lately?

611
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:08,893
Of course.

612
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:10,973
That’ll change soon.

613
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,673
Hey!

614
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,513
What’s wrong with you?

615
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,500
Yong, if you called me here

616
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:34,920
to tell me to work with Tam, I’m not doing it.

617
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,520
It’s not about that.

618
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,073
You know what?

619
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:41,500
The sponsor you're the brand presenter for

620
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:42,586
is going to sue you.

621
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,573
What?

622
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,720
Sue me?

623
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,993
Your current image doesn’t align with their brand’s.

624
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:56,353
Terminating the contract also cost millions.

625
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,840
If you really quit,

626
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
you won’t be able to afford it.

627
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:04,970
Think carefully.

628
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:08,346
How much longer are you going to keep being stubborn?

629
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,540
If I were you,

630
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,353
I’d hurry back to work.

631
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:28,500
I heard the sponsor is going to sue you for tens of millions.

632
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,380
So what?

633
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,680
I get it, though.

634
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,173
If you sell your sports car and condo,

635
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
you should be able to fight the lawsuit.

636
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,906
I’m rooting for you.

637
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,613
I’ve seen that often.

638
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,766
No need to show it off.

639
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:23,506
Oh, hey, Tam.

640
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:24,653
There you are.

641
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,873
You need the document, right?

642
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,226
No.

643
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,480
This is personal.

644
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:29,640
I’m curious.

645
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,826
Can I ask why you and Phi broke up?

646
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:32,820
Can you tell me?

647
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,153
Oh, Rita.

648
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:35,160
Please.

649
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,633
Tam.

650
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,440
Yes?

651
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,546
You brought the document, right?

652
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:40,853
Yes.

653
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:42,666
Go make three photocopies of it.

654
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,326
Okay.

655
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,466
Yong!

656
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,046
I was just about to get the tea!

657
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,506
If this is about why he broke up with Phi,

658
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,180
he won’t tell you.

659
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,486
The one who got dumped
doesn’t even know why.

660
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,460
If he doesn’t know,

661
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:06,326
that’s all the more reason for me to find out.

662
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,560
It’s not your job, is it?

663
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,853
Get back to work.

664
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,513
Okay.

665
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,200
Good.

666
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,706
Hi, Wee.

667
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:39,873
How’s it going?

668
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:42,210
It’s been a while since you last came to my bar.

669
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,666
Sorry.

670
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,773
I’ve been busy.

671
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,540
I saw the news.

672
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
If you’re having financial problems,

673
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,246
I can give you advice.

674
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,020
Or you can sell me your car.

675
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:54,146
I’ve been wanting it.

676
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:57,966
No, thank you.

677
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,866
I can still manage.

678
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,233
Okay.

679
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,440
Have fun.

680
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:03,400
Thank you.

681
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,980
Take care of my brother.

682
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,826
Hello, Mr. Phi.

683
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:07,813
Please come in.

684
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
No wonder your aura shines from afar.

685
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,300
You’re the famous Padtaphi.

686
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,633
Can I get a photo with you?

687
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,760
Of course.

688
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,706
I’m so glad.

689
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,593
I’m your fan, you know?

690
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:42,100
I watch your news every day.

691
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,806
You’re too kind.

692
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,000
I’m a fan of your channel, too.

693
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:50,473
I’m one of your 4 million subscribers.

694
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,060
What? Really?

695
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:52,420
Yes.

696
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,906
Now we’re talking.

697
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,480
I’m actually looking to

698
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,700
create a new channel and show.

699
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,500
It’ll be a news show.

700
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,213
Are you…

701
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,126
interested in becoming my host?

702
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:18,446
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

703
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,090
Why not?

704
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:25,286
I can tell

705
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:29,246
Good News is suspending you for a long time.

706
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,746
Not that long.

707
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:40,520
They said they’re creating a new show for me.

708
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,066
Really?

709
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,293
What a bummer.

710
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:49,253
I want to create an amazing new show.

711
00:39:49,293 --> 00:39:52,540
It could help rebuild your image too, Phi.

712
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,006
Alright.

713
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,386
Here.

714
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,760
If you change your mind, let me know.

715
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,826
I won’t take any more of your time.

716
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,160
Wait.

717
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,606
Yes?

718
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,340
Um…

719
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,366
What’s the concept of your new show?

720
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,033
Let’s talk in this room to keep it private.

721
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,853
Okay.

722
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
Have a seat.

723
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,033
Thank you.

724
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,926
Shall we pick up where we left off?

725
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,866
There’s no need to rush, Phi.

726
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,526
Let’s drink something first.

727
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:51,886
Here you go.

728
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,000
Alright.

729
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,820
By the way,

730
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:13,066
how old are you this year?

731
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,986
27.

732
00:41:16,046 --> 00:41:16,946
Mmm.

733
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,966
Guess how old I am this year.

734
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,973
30, I guess.

735
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:27,420
Oh, you’re such a sweet talker.

736
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,413
I’m 40 this year.

737
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,253
Compared to you,

738
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,846
I’m so much older, right?

739
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:36,393
Oh, not at all.

740
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,480
You don’t look old.

741
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,473
Are you uncomfortable with someone older?

742
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,426
Of course not.

743
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,193
Older people have more experience.

744
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:52,766
They’ll be able to give me good work advice.

745
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,053
Mmm.

746
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,573
What if it’s not about work?

747
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,633
I think we should talk about work.

748
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,253
Phi, think about it.

749
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,186
I heard your sponsor is suing you for millions.

750
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,333
Where are you going to find the money to fight the lawsuit?

751
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,466
You’re still young, Phi.

752
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,460
You have a long future ahead of you.

753
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,333
Are you going to let such a small thing like this

754
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:43,013
stop you from going forward?

755
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,073
If you say yes,

756
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:49,340
I’ll call everyone and help you settle it.

757
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:50,800
With just a call.

758
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,940
Uh…

759
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,020
Excuse me.

760
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:08,166
TAWAN

761
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,173
Phi, when you’re talking business,

762
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:14,753
you don’t play on your phone.

763
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,106
Let’s talk about us.

764
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,666
Uh…

765
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:29,706
Well…

766
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:30,953
Phi!

767
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,340
Who are you?

768
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,953
Oh.

769
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,546
I’m sorry,

770
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:42,386
but Phi is mine.

771
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,766
Come!

772
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,053
Why did you do that?

773
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,580
Why are you here?

774
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:06,326
Why not?

775
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,086
I’m your producer.

776
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,500
I know what my reporter is doing and where he is.

777
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,653
Can’t I step in?

778
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:13,706
You can’t.

779
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,340
Why are you sticking your nose in my business?

780
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,760
Tell me honestly.

781
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,780
Is what you’re doing really worth it?

782
00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:25,020
Is it better than working with me?

783
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,146
It’s not that great,

784
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,866
but I don’t care.

785
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,686
If I had to work with you,

786
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:36,100
it’d be my last resort.

787
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,666
Phi.

788
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,980
I believe we can still work together.

789
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,566
Really?

790
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,040
I’d rather not.

791
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,300
I don’t want to owe you.

792
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,346
Why?

793
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,826
I don’t think I have to explain

794
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,110
how you treated me like shit.

795
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,100
When you have the money,

796
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:39,100
you can buy it back, bro.

797
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,873
Thank you so much.

798
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,926
Don’t you want to sell your condo too?

799
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,606
That beautiful view will get you a good price.

800
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,780
No, thank you.

801
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:53,780
I really love this place.

802
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,660
I’m not ready to sell it yet.

803
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:56,600
Okay.

804
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,306
If you change your mind,
you can reach out to me anytime.

805
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,660
See you.

806
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,913
Cheers!

807
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:32,066
Yay!

808
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,553
Here’s to our success!

809
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,453
We got into Good News!

810
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,333
Now let me drink.

811
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,533
Your dream is getting closer and closer to coming true.

812
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,200
You said you wanted your face on the billboards.

813
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,946
From now on, it’s going to be hard for me,

814
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,546
because I won’t know how to pose.

815
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,893
Should I bite my lip?

816
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,160
Why would you bite it?

817
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:08,040
To look sexy.

818
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,666
Let’s think of a couple pose,

819
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:12,926
just in case we end up on billboards together.

820
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,626
Can we do a normal pose?

821
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,853
Are you sure that’s normal?

822
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,833
If that day really comes,

823
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,893
do you want to move in with me?

824
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:29,213
Huh?

825
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,340
Why not?

826
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,346
If both of our faces are on that billboard,

827
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,633
we could buy a place in this condo.

828
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:40,746
Then we’d wake up and see our faces every day.

829
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,686
Won’t you feel weird

830
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,046
seeing your face on the billboard every day?

831
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,620
No.

832
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,806
Because I want to see your face even more.

833
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,213
Well, I guess he’s not coming.

834
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,660
You should know how stubborn he is.

835
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:40,730
I’ll try calling him again.

836
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,673
Is he going to pick up?

837
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,346
He won’t even pick up my calls.

838
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,980
Hello?

839
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:48,660
What?

840
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:49,940
How come he picked up?

841
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,473
Where are you?

842
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I’m here.

843
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,853
I’ve decided.

844
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,353
I’ll agree to work with him,

845
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,240
but I have one condition:

846
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,926
We’ll only talk about work.

847
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,033
Nothing personal, okay?

848
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,820
After that incident, the hashtag #BanPadtaphi

849
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,820
has been trending on social media

850
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,466
and it’s unlikely to slow down.

851
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,806
Let’s follow this hot topic

852
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:53,726
and take a look back at Padtaphi Sinan’s career journey

853
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,020
from Forecast Prince to Hot-Headed Prince.

854
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,340
Hello?

855
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,260
Tam, it’s me.

856
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,326
You’ve heard the news about Phi, right?

857
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,306
I’ve heard a bit.

858
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
I’ll get to the point then.

859
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,826
Can you come back and help him?

860
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,813
You’re the only one who can help him right now.

861
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,606
If you still love him, come back.

862
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,046
Please. I beg you.

863
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,406
Deal.

864
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,140
We’ll only talk about work.

865
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,506
Nothing personal.

866
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,906
Tell me honestly.

867
00:52:33,926 --> 00:52:35,006
Why did you come back?

868
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,720
I want my show up on a billboard like that.

869
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,580
If we can’t agree on this,

870
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:42,346
let’s each make a demo for the show to settle it.

871
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,473
I didn’t ask you to do that.

872
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,046
I was just doing my job as your producer.

873
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:53,710
And I only want you

874
00:52:53,746 --> 00:52:55,953
to be the one who makes it happen.

875
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,960
This should be fun, don’t you think?
