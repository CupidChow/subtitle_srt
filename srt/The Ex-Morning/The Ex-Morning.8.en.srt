1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
What are you doing today?

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,640
Do you want to take Sosay to the beach together?

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,784
Yong told me

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,520
Tam loves you very much, Phi.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,064
When you were gone,

6
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,060
I had a question I always wanted to ask you.

7
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,992
I found out why you left me that day.

8
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,552
It’s been four years,

9
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:16,928
but just one call from Yong about you

10
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,656
took me right back to where I was.

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,320
Just spend the night here. You can leave tomorrow.

12
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,984
Actually, there’s no braised mackerel.

13
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:23,640
I know.

14
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:25,000
I just

15
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,032
don’t want to leave

16
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,624
what’s right here.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,464
Hello, Yong.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,336
Yeah, I’d like to take the day off today.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,616
Oh? What are you doing?

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,440
Don’t think I don’t know
you’re skipping work to sleep with me.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,056
No, I’m just tired.

22
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,312
I don’t really have the energy. I’m lazy.

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,432
But seeing your face
gives me a little boost now.

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,744
No, you can’t do this.

25
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,550
If you skip work, I’ll have to as well.

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,240
People will get suspicious.

27
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:33,336
Then let’s do it. Why do you care?

28
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:34,712
I don’t care who knows.

29
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:37,820
I said no.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,496
Yong teased me that I’d get back with you.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,784
But I told him

32
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,184
it’s impossible.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,824
I’d be embarrassing myself.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,936
Me too.

35
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,592
I also told Yong

36
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,560
I’d never get back with you.

37
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:59,440
And if I did, I’d hold a press conference exposing myself to the world.

38
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,232
I said that.

39
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,728
You hate me that much, huh?

40
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,384
Yes, I hate you very much.

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,896
But they say you usually
end up with what you hate.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Fine.

43
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:19,940
Then I hate you too.

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,632
I hate you too.

45
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,328
Do you still hate me now?

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,632
You hate me so much, huh?

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,600
Enough. We’ve arrived at work.

48
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,030
Let’s get to work.

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
(Hello.)

50
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,800
Shit. I pressed the wrong button.

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,264
(Where are you?)

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,736
I’ve arrived. I’m coming in right away.

53
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:01,712
Let’s go.

54
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:02,752
Ugh.

55
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,944
Why did you park so crooked?

56
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,264
Come on. I’m in a hurry.

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,480
Hey, go that way.

58
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:13,536
Let’s split up.

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,480
Hmm?

60
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:26,088
What should I eat?

61
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,112
Let’s try this one.

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,832
Come here.

63
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,368
No wonder you made me
leave the house first.

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,952
Are you going to Siam or something?

65
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:36,608
What?

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,784
Him acting weird like this
can only mean one thing.

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,384
He’s going to flirt with girls.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,632
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,728
This is how I usually dress.

70
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,408
Yeah, right.

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,416
It’s true.

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,384
Hi, Yong.

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,672
Hi.

74
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:00,952
Hi.

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,968
This is Arin.

76
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:06,440
She’s joining us as a reporter from today.

77
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,568
You probably have seen her before.

78
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,520
She’s so pretty, famous, and fabulous.

79
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,264
You’re too kind, Yong.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
Please excuse me.
I should go to the studio.

81
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:19,104
See you around.

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,048
Okay.

83
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:21,264
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

84
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,830
Ahem.

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,480
What’s going on, bro?

86
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,224
You’re smiling so much.

87
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,620
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,152
Are you scared she won’t know you like her?

89
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,272
You think so?

90
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,296
Yeah.

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,816
The next EP will be a special one

92
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:40,952
for the public holiday.

93
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,624
Tam said he wants to touch on

94
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,792
illegally dumping garbage into the sea.

95
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,488
But the accommodations are so expensive.

96
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,528
Phi,

97
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,984
do you know anyone who owns a resort?

98
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:52,856
Phi!

99
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Yes?

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,272
Oh, if we’re looking for beach accommodation, we can probably ask Paul.

101
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,136
But we’ve bothered him many times.

102
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,704
I think we should find somewhere else.

103
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,984
That’s it then.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,296
I’ll propose the idea to management.

105
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,128
Let’s call it a day.

106
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,176
Okay.

107
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,984
Mmm.

108
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,800
Where are you rushing off to?

109
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,980
Let’s talk.

110
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:37,104
About what?

111
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,536
Where do you want to go?

112
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,256
You mean the beach?

113
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,464
I mean where do you want to go
on our date?

114
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:47,208
It’s been so long
since I last took you out of town.

115
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,232
Or should we go abroad?

116
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,780
As if we have time for that.

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,288
There are 24 hours in a day.

118
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,464
If I want to make time for someone,

119
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,992
I definitely can.

120
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:02,720
Really?

121
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:03,752
Yeah.

122
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Where should we go?

123
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,000
Let’s stay home.
Just stay home?

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,720
Oh my god!

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Well…

126
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,760
Umm…

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,144
Am I interrupting something?

128
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,072
No, not at all.

129
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:20,264
We were talking about the beach.

130
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,936
It’s work.
That’s right.

131
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:22,904
I see.

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh, the tumbler.

133
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,824
This is Yong’s, right?

134
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:29,896
Please continue what you were doing.

135
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,064
We were talking about work.

136
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,104
Sure.

137
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,080
Yong is waiting.
Right, Yong.

138
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:36,696
Gosh.

139
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,616
He’s thirsty. Yeah.

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,576
I’m already out.

141
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,328
Wait, not yet.

142
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,368
Right.

143
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
She’s still there.

144
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,824
This is your fault.

145
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:53,848
No, it’s yours.

146
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,952
Who’d have known she’d come in?

147
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,064
I can’t open this.

148
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,670
Can you help me?

149
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Then don’t drink it.

150
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,880
Why do you have to kill my vibe?

151
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,248
Can’t I be a little lovey-dovey?

152
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,888
Fine, I can open it myself.

153
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,224
I’m thirsty.

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,192
Find something to drink yourself.

155
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,240
Why do you have to kill my vibe?

156
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,872
Can’t I be a little lovey-dovey?

157
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,480
I’ve been editing this work non-stop
since this morning.

158
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh.

159
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,264
Poor thing.

160
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,976
Here, drink this.

161
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,600
My hands are full.

162
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Can you feed me?

163
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,768
Okay, boyfriend.

164
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,968
Drink a lot. I’m going to feed you.

165
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:06,664
How is it?

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So good.

167
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,128
By the way,

168
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,536
I wish we had time
to be lovey-dovey with each other.

169
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,808
Not just in the office room like this.

170
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,488
What a bummer, isn’t it?

171
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,248
When I said we didn’t have time,

172
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,152
I meant not just you, but me too.

173
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,500
I’ve been so exhausted lately.

174
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,424
Aww, let me give you a massage.

175
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,840
How about this?

176
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:42,376
Let’s go on a date when we have free time.

177
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,440
We could go to Siam to walk around, shop,

178
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,968
watch a movie, and be lovey-dovey.

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,016
Siam?
Yeah.

180
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,200
Do you want to go there
and have the kids call us uncles?

181
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,416
How do adults go on a date then?

182
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,010
Hmm?

183
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,128
You want to know?

184
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Mmm.

185
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,576
In bed.

186
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,648
I didn’t quite catch that.

187
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,968
Say that again?

188
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
Ahhh!

189
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,856
Wanna drink this?

190
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,464
My hands are full.

191
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:27,528
Alright, I’ll drink it.

192
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,904
I’m such a bad person.

193
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,032
I came in at the right moment,

194
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,072
no, I mean, the wrong moment.

195
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,392
No, Phi was just briefing me on work.

196
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:35,736
Yeah.

197
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,740
Do you need anything, Rita?

198
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,480
Have you seen Yong?

199
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,984
This is my room.

200
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,544
Why would Yong be here?

201
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,840
Oh.

202
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,864
I’ve just been looking for him all over the office.

203
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,030
I don’t know where he’s gone.

204
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,952
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it,

205
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:54,136
but I wanted to see…

206
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,184
I mean, I didn’t see anything.

207
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,032
I was looking for Yong.

208
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,176
I should go.

209
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,840
I’m really curious what Rita’s work is.

210
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,960
It's clear she’s not doing it.

211
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,872
She always comes in at the right moment.

212
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:21,904
It’s so frustrating.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Wanna continue?

214
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,752
Sosay, we’re home.

215
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,040
Did you miss home, baby?

216
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,224
Come play with Papa.

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,832
Hey, Phi.

218
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Phi.

219
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,736
Go take a shower
before playing with your baby.

220
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,144
No, let me play with my baby first.

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,248
Up to you then.

222
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,368
I’m going to take a shower now.

223
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,720
Let’s play another day.

224
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:38,768
I have to go.

225
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,970
Aren’t you going to play with your baby anymore?

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
I’m lazy.

227
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,040
I’m bored of playing the guitar.

228
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,700
I’d rather give my boyfriend a scrub.

229
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:25,976
That feels great

230
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,504
but I don’t know why I’m feeling cold.

231
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,392
You could’ve just said
you wanted me to hug you.

232
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,512
I was editing work all day.

233
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,128
My body is so sore.

234
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Or maybe I…

235
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:46,792
Your temperature is a little high.

236
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,200
Hey, you’re really burning up.

237
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Hey.

238
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,304
You have dengue fever.

239
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:09,016
We need to admit you to the hospital tonight.

240
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,064
How did it come to this?

241
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,048
Go to work.

242
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,576
Don’t you have a meeting?

243
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,984
No, I’m staying here.

244
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,872
I’ll call Yong and tell him

245
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,640
I’m taking the day off to take care of you.

246
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,790
Let me call him now.

247
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:37,296
(Hello?)
Hello, Yong.

248
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,056
You really called him?

249
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,248
I’d like to take the day off.

250
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,960
Hello, Yong.

251
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
He means he has to go shopping.

252
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,240
He'll be back for the meeting.

253
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Yeah.

254
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,856
I’d feel bad if you took time off
because of me.

255
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,960
Go to work.

256
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,200
While I’m at the hospital, the doctors and nurses will take care of me.

257
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,710
Alright then.

258
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,400
Text me what you want to eat, okay?

259
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Can I eat you?

260
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,216
Don’t be funny.

261
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,630
I’ll come see you as soon as I finish work.

262
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,610
Don’t forget to take your medicine.

263
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,840
I want you to wear a beach outfit during
the interview, Phi, but you might not like it.

264
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,730
I will. Let’s do it.

265
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,128
Next, let’s discuss the location.

266
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,576
I’ve surveyed the area.
That rock is so pretty.

267
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,736
The only downside is it’s a bit too hot.

268
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,600
I’m not sure if you’ll be okay with that.
I’ll be fine. Let’s go there.

269
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:50,016
What?

270
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,984
As for the client clip,
I’ve come up with two options.

271
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:52,648
Let’s go with the second one.

272
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,650
Huh? Hold on.

273
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,728
Aren’t you going to hear me out first?

274
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:56,480
Not even a little?

275
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,416
I trust you. It’ll be good for sure.

276
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,384
We’ve covered everything, right?
Not yet!

277
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:01,832
We’ve been working so hard.

278
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:05,016
Let’s go eat grilled beef today!

279
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:05,776
Yes!

280
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,272
Count me out. I have to go.

281
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,296
What?

282
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,728
This is weird.

283
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,552
He’s never missed a grilled meat meal.

284
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,024
You’re weird.

285
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,920
What are you even wearing?

286
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:19,288
It doesn’t suit your age.

287
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,720
Why not?
Please.

288
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:22,968
T-Pop is in right now.

289
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:24,472
I want to keep up with the world.

290
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:25,504
Turn around.

291
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,740
Oh!

292
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,976
Please stop, bro.

293
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,552
How are you, patient?

294
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,400
Has your temperature gone down?

295
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,344
Once I’m done with these documents,
I’ll come see you as soon as I can, okay?

296
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,504
No rush. I think I’m going back to sleep.

297
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:40,656
I’m so sleepy.

298
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,344
I miss you.

299
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,488
Have you eaten?

300
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:47,992
Yes.

301
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,000
Let’s hang up

302
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,432
so you can get back to work.

303
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,008
Wait.

304
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
What did I say?

305
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,576
What do you have to say back?

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,000
Fine, I miss you too.

307
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,840
Hi, Padtaphi.

308
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:12,408
(Hi.)

309
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,072
(I just joined the company.)

310
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,808
So I came to say hi.

311
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,112
Here. These are cookies I baked myself.

312
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,544
I’m your big fan.

313
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,400
Can I get a selfie with you?

314
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,176
Of course.

315
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,690
Thank you.

316
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Who’s that?

317
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,120
(Oh, you’re on a call?)

318
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:43,568
Oh…
(I’m sorry.)

319
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,368
It’s okay.

320
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,128
(I’ll leave the cookies here.)

321
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,168
(Okay.)

322
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,064
I’m sorry again.
- Bye.
- No worries.

323
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:50,696
Thank you.

324
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,010
Who’s that?

325
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,968
Why? Didn’t you say you were going to sleep because you’re tired?

326
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,256
What’s with the harsh tone?

327
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,624
(It’s Arin, the reporter from another station who just moved here.)

328
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,992
Oh.

329
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,960
She just moved here
but you know her name?

330
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:17,248
What? She’s a reporter
who moved from another station.

331
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:18,784
Everyone knows her.

332
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:19,976
Why? Are you jealous?

333
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Really?

334
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,520
I’m going to sleep now.

335
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:26,288
Oh, you’re jealous.

336
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,288
You’re jealous, aren’t you?

337
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,416
Get back to work.

338
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
I have to go.

339
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,120
Here I come!

340
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,824
Did you miss me yet?

341
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,840
Why did you come so fast?

342
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,624
Oh, stop it.

343
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:56,856
I know you missed me
and wanted me to rush here.

344
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Who missed you?

345
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,288
I have something for you.

346
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,440
Here’s some pear, your favorite.

347
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,664
The hospital already gave me some.

348
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,720
It’s alright. I have something else.

349
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,960
Bird’s nest drink. It’s good for your health.

350
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,504
But I don’t like it.

351
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,744
It’s alright. I have something else.

352
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,384
I guarantee these will surprise you.

353
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,168
I don’t like them.

354
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,640
You haven’t even seen them yet.

355
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,672
Look!

356
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,200
Here are our matching phone grips.

357
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:43,216
The gift from when we had our first date,

358
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,600
but we were too shy to use them.

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But I’m brave enough now.

360
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,472
So we’re going to use them.

361
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:51,968
Here’s yours.

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,760
Where would we even use this?

363
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,760
We work in the office every day.

364
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,128
Shh!

365
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,872
Let’s not talk about work at the hospital.

366
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,488
Look. Isn’t it cute?

367
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,240
Let’s take a photo with it as a memory.

368
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
Come on.

369
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,896
One.

370
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:22,408
(Who’s there?)

371
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,136
Tam, I’ve come to visit you.

372
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,832
This is the outfit for filming.

373
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:27,400
Okay.

374
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,168
What about the location? Is this okay?

375
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,936
Yes.
Are you sure?

376
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:32,408
Phi, take it easy.

377
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,304
Tam just got to rest.

378
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,216
He keeps pestering me about work.

379
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,256
I already said I wouldn’t talk about it.

380
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:38,984
Really?

381
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,024
Yeah.

382
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,232
Really?

383
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,448
You have matching phone grips now.

384
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,360
Hey.

385
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:46,808
No, it’s not what you think.

386
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:47,760
Oh, oh, oh.

387
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:48,792
I saw that.

388
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
I caught you red-handed.
What’s going on?

389
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Well…

390
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,824
Hmm.

391
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,104
I’m glad you two finally got back together.

392
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,370
Phi,

393
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,728
you have to hold a press conference.

394
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,080
No, that’s crazy

395
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Are you serious?

396
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,728
Just kidding.

397
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:14,528
Look at him.

398
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,064
I’m leaving.

399
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:17,608
I don’t want to be a third wheel.

400
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,432
Get well soon.

401
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Thank you.

402
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:22,624
This is so good.

403
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,090
Can I take it home?

404
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,984
Come on.

405
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,360
Well, you keep it.
Bye, Yong.

406
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,984
I’m full now.

407
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:31,016
Bye-bye.

408
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,648
In the end, it’s Yong who ate it.

409
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,104
I’m upset.

410
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,504
Has the doctor told you
when you can go home?

411
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,968
I don’t know yet.

412
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,970
My blood results haven’t improved.

413
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,970
We’ll probably need to follow up day to day.

414
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,024
I’m sorry.

415
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,704
We talked about going on a date.

416
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
It’s alright. Just focus on recovering first.

417
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,410
But if we can’t go anywhere else on a date,

418
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,976
how about we do it here?

419
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Rawr.

420
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,504
Heard it many times

421
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,352
How love’s a beautiful thing

422
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,896
So full of meaning

423
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:29,328
Having someone is good for the soul

424
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,512
It fills the space and makes your heart whole

425
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:37,064
It makes you tremble, makes you shy

426
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:39,552
It paints the world so bright

427
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:42,848
Having someone who will always be there

428
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:47,976
It makes you smile, that's what they say

429
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:53,256
I only knew the truth when love led me to you

430
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,744
Loving you, and giving too

431
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:58,256
Means more than I ever knew

432
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,600
Aren’t you going outside?

433
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,632
Do you want me to hold it for you?

434
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,424
That’d be great.

435
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,976
I’m talking about the IV line.

436
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,384
Don’t be naughty when you’re sick.

437
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,784
(Actually, it feels like the two of us)

438
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:22,780
(are in a romance movie.)

439
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,152
(We fight. We break up.)

440
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:29,968
(Then we get back together.
(It keeps repeating.)

441
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,576
Even though we didn’t have the best start,

442
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
we’re getting a happy ending,
don’t you think?

443
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,080
Tawan, I’m glad I have you in my life.

444
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,696
Will you be my boyfriend?

445
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,824
Means more than I ever knew

446
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,936
What I have found with you today

447
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,816
Is better than dreams in every way

448
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Mmm.

449
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,744
I’d take that as a yes.

450
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,968
So we’re happy now.

451
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,104
But this isn’t the ending yet.

452
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,168
Is this the ending then?

453
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,952
Love's better than what I imagined in life

454
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:47,496
Phi.

455
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Hmm?

456
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,592
Go sleep on the sofa.

457
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,240
If the nurses see this, they’ll scold us.

458
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:55,240
No, I’m lazy.

459
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,672
Come on, before we get scolded.

460
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,496
You’re quite something.

461
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,968
Stop it.

462
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,088
Here comes the nurse.

463
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:17,560
Nurse, I think the patient has fully recovered.

464
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,120
He’s strong and can really fight back.

465
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,600
Who fights back?

466
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,456
Mom!

467
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Hello.

468
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,824
What brings you here?

469
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,016
You’ve been quiet for several days

470
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:39,640
and wouldn’t answer my calls.

471
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,976
So I called Yong and found out you’re sick.

472
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,696
Then you flew all the way here to visit me?

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,536
You’re too dedicated.

474
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,184
I have only one son.

475
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,360
Look at you.

476
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,968
You were doing well over there.

477
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
Why did you even come back here?

478
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,864
Not only did they make you
work so hard you got sick,

479
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,392
but you also have to work with a loser.

480
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:12,416
You mean me?

481
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,752
You were riding on Tam’s coattails in school,

482
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,472
and now you’re still doing that.

483
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,656
Honestly, when will you grow up?

484
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:20,688
Mom!

485
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,896
Phi isn’t doing that.

486
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,896
I flew back here because of him.

487
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,256
What do you mean?

488
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,104
He means we got back together.

489
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Really?

490
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,620
Yes.

491
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,968
I’m happy for you.

492
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh.

493
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,416
You want me to say that, don’t you?

494
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,544
No matter what, I’ll never let you

495
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,432
get back with this kind of person.

496
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,016
I came here

497
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:59,744
to take you back to Australia.

498
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:12,624
The doctor said you should be able
to go home tomorrow,

499
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:15,528
so he allowed me to take you outside
for some fresh air.

500
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,850
Okay.

501
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,672
Nice weather, isn’t it?

502
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,856
Hey, Mom.

503
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:30,512
Hmm?

504
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:32,232
I really want to eat cake.

505
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
Of course.

506
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,488
Where can I get it?

507
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,112
There’s a place near the front of the hospital.

508
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,384
Once you go out,

509
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:37,736
Mm-hmm.

510
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,184
Turn left, walk straight a bit,

511
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,056
then turn right twice.

512
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:41,800
Once you reach the junction,
take another left.

513
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:43,096
The shop will be on your left.

514
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,704
Oh, okay.

515
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:46,592
Let me go get it for you.

516
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,616
I’ll be right back.

517
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:48,184
Thank you.
Of course.

518
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,184
Turn left and right.

519
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,568
Turn left two times.

520
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,816
So, what did your mom say?

521
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,448
I tried to convince her but she wouldn’t listen.

522
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,688
I’m sorry.

523
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,672
Give my mom some time.

524
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,752
She broke up with Dad because he’s a loser.

525
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,208
She’s scared I’ll end up the same way.

526
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,720
Scared you’ll be with a loser like me?

527
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:25,720
I didn’t say that.

528
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,848
What do you think?

529
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:30,416
Do you think I’m a loser?

530
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,632
Do you think I’m with you now

531
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,672
because I see you that way?

532
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,952
Please, don’t try to be sweet.

533
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,512
Trust me.

534
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:03,290
You made me like you.

535
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,432
You can make my mom like you too.

536
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Mmm.

537
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,240
I just told Tam’s mom he’s in the hospital.

538
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,240
How did things turn out this way?

539
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,952
I don’t know.

540
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:28,728
You have to take responsibility.

541
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,840
Can I ask you something?

542
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,488
How did you win over Gie’s mom?

543
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,672
I can answer that.

544
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:39,208
Very good.

545
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:40,256
Help me.

546
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,470
Wait.

547
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,048
No need to hide it.

548
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:45,976
We know everything.

549
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
How did you find out?

550
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Yong!

551
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,672
You told them, didn’t you?

552
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,672
No.

553
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,416
He didn’t tell us.

554
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:59,952
Your phone grip is so obvious.

555
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:01,456
There’s no way we wouldn’t know.

556
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:04,216
Since everyone knows,

557
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:05,968
let’s get back to the topic.

558
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,888
You asked me how I won over Gie’s mom.

559
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,992
The answer is

560
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,848
I didn’t do anything.

561
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,144
I’m handsome with a good profile
and a rich family.

562
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:24,824
Anyone who sees me definitely wants to
give me their daughters.

563
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,792
On the other hand,

564
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,000
Gie was the one who had to
win over my family.

565
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:34,568
Whoa, you’re so confident.

566
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,400
But that was partly true.

567
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,880
Luckily, Gie tutored me
and helped me get into university.

568
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,720
That’s why my parents gave in.

569
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:47,048
Just tutoring?

570
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,320
It’s not only about that.

571
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,984
It’s about showing them
you can take care of their family.

572
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,952
That’s all parents want, right?

573
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,960
That’s true.

574
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,816
Thank you, Gie.

575
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,112
I think I know what to do now.

576
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,936
Thank you.

577
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,408
All set. I’ll get a taxi.

578
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,744
See you in the lobby.

579
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:23,768
Okay.

580
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,632
No need to do that.

581
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,352
I can give you guys a ride.

582
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Come on.

583
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,320
Careful. Are you okay?

584
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,968
Are you hungry?

585
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,736
A little.

586
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,016
I’ve already prepared lunch
for you and Tamtawan.

587
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,912
Where did you order from?

588
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,872
Here you go.

589
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,480
Please enjoy.

590
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:35,536
Here are the condiments.

591
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:38,136
Time to take your medicine.

592
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,210
I think you shouldn’t take a shower today.

593
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,960
I’ll just give you a sponge bath.

594
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,440
You don’t want to get a fever again.

595
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Okay?

596
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,152
Hey.

597
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,304
You don’t need to do it.

598
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,560
I’ll do it.

599
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,176
It’s very late right now.

600
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,416
Why are you still here?

601
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,824
I just want to take care of…

602
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,568
I should go, right?

603
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,768
If you need any help,
you can call me anytime.

604
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,520
Get a lot of rest.

605
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,040
I’ve already taken care of work.

606
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,584
I’m heading out now.

607
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:44,912
Please excuse me. Bye.

608
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:57,136
Mom.

609
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,704
Why are you being cold to Phi?

610
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,070
You see that he’s much more mature now.

611
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,472
Come on.

612
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,344
Everyone does that
when they want to make up with you.

613
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,848
Phi is a bit better than your dad, though.

614
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,120
Your dad never learned to cook for me.

615
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,304
Does this mean…?

616
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:23,300
YONG

617
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,104
Excuse me.

618
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,128
Mmm.

619
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:30,344
Hello, Yong.

620
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
What?

621
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,256
Now?

622
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Okay.

623
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,384
What’s going on, Tam?

624
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,264
LEAK! THE FORECAST PRINCE
IS SLEEPING WITH HIS PRODUCER!
#BANPADTAPHI

625
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,360
It’ll be fine, Phi.

626
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,792
The world is different now.

627
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,000
The feedback online is good.

628
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:02,300
I don’t think it’ll affect the show.

629
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,256
The sponsors are all pulling out of the show.

630
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,224
What? But our country legalized
same-sex marriage already.

631
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
I don’t get it.

632
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,448
Even though most people are okay with it, not everyone is.

633
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,600
Especially not the conservatives.

634
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,288
Most importantly,

635
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,664
they own the money.

636
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:29,704
Do you get it now?

637
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,736
What did the board say?

638
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,792
They said if you want Ex-Morning to go on,

639
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,320
there’s only one way.

640
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,248
How’s it going?

641
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,576
The board wants you to
hold a press conference to deny it, right?

642
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,176
That’s understandable.

643
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:17,980
If it were me, I’d ask for the same thing.

644
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:21,020
It’s the best solution.

645
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,860
The board isn’t forcing me.

646
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,840
They’re letting me make my own decision,

647
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,376
so I think…

648
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,790
Hey.

649
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,136
We’ve worked so hard to get here.

650
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,952
You’re about to make a comeback.

651
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,344
Don’t let it go so easily.

652
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,968
Food is ready.

653
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,480
Go eat so you can take your medicine after.

654
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,008
Let’s talk later.

655
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,664
Hello, Mom.

656
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,984
In the end, Phi really is the loser
I thought he was.

657
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
Mom.

658
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,632
I knew it. There’s something about Phi.

659
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,312
I heard it before.

660
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,336
I don’t think so.

661
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,960
It’s time.

662
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,500
Don’t forget that we agreed on this.

663
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,610
Hey.

664
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,976
Remove your phone grip.

665
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:21,968
We’re definitely getting big news today.

666
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Hi.

667
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,712
Hi to all the press

668
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:31,912
and my fans.

669
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,936
First of all, I’d like to thank everyone
for your interest in what happened.

670
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,140
Don’t say anything off script.

671
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,496
Don’t answer any questions from the press.

672
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,792
No matter how crappy their questions are,

673
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:52,456
don’t lose your temper.

674
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
Got it?

675
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:58,712
Yes.

676
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,472
It’s true. It’s me in the clip you all saw.

677
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:08,336
Whoa, it’s true!

678
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,824
It’s true!

679
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:10,848
Phi.

680
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,584
So I’d like to take this opportunity
to clarify everything.

681
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,368
The sponsors are all pulling out of the show.

682
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,304
We’ve worked so hard to get here.

683
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:39,984
You’re about to make a comeback.

684
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Zoom in!

685
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:21,976
Zoom in quickly!

686
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Zoom in!

687
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,968
Whoa!

688
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,736
Tamtawan and I are really in a relationship.

689
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,112
It’s true!

690
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,800
If anyone has any questions,
feel free to call me directly.

691
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,168
I’m ready to answer everything.

692
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,670
Thank you.

693
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,264
How many years have you been together?

694
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:46,448
Phi, come back!

695
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:47,712
Phi!

696
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,296
What a grand introduction.
YOUNG REPORTER
REVEALED HIS PARTNER

697
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,040
The famous reporter Padtaphi

698
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:02,248
went public about dating his producer.

699
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,440
Not only are his fans swooning,

700
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:09,928
I heard many sponsors
want to advertise on his show

701
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,520
because he’s such a hot topic right now

702
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,512
You wanted to see us. Is everything okay?

703
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:17,496
(What’s their relationship like? Let’s see the footage of Padtaphi’s press conference.)

704
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,712
I want to talk about Phi’s news.

705
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,832
Oh, this news?

706
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,088
I saw it. Amazing news.

707
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:30,752
It’s great that things turned out well.

708
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,544
But…

709
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,320
Only a few people knew
Tam and Phi were at the hospital.

710
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,080
I suspected that

711
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:41,288
the person who filmed the clip

712
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:43,280
was someone in our company.

713
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,544
So I asked Nhudee

714
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:52,200
to track the IP address from the post
and found that

715
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,104
they really used our company’s computer
to post it.

716
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,536
And that’s

717
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,496
your computer, Vit.

718
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,528
Hey! How could you do that, Vit?

719
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:11,504
How could you?

720
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:13,500
I know our team and Phi don’t get along,

721
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:15,040
but you shouldn’t have done that.

722
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,416
You went too far.

723
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,616
Yong, I really apologize
on my producer’s behalf.

724
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,312
How could you say that?

725
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,776
You asked me to film the clip.

726
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,690
Hey!

727
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,352
How could you say that?

728
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,528
You’re accusing me
and I can sue you for that.

729
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:39,008
Do you even have proof?

730
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,648
I wouldn’t have dared accuse you if I didn’t.

731
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,064
The Forecast Prince

732
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:57,240
is sleeping with his producer.

733
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,336
Mr. Tae, are you sure
it’s a good idea to visit our rival?

734
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,368
We’re here to poach him.

735
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,160
Think about it.

736
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:08,186
Phi has made Mr. Tam
work so hard that he got sick.

737
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,288
If we play our cards right,

738
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:11,952
Mr. Tam will want to join our team instead.

739
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:15,984
You seem to really like Mr. Tam.

740
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,344
No, I don’t.

741
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:21,704
The only thing I care about
is Phi’s downfall.

742
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Oh.

743
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,330
Hey.

744
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
Look.

745
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,720
Speaking of the devil, we came across something juicy.

746
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,048
Hey.

747
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Film them.

748
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,624
Huh? Me?

749
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,552
Yes, you. My hands are full.

750
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:47,370
If this clip leaks,

751
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,568
it’ll become the talk of the town.

752
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:53,520
The Forecast Prince
is sleeping with his producer.

753
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,336
The hashtag #BanPadtaphi will be back.

754
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,560
I knew it.

755
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,272
I knew you’d blame it on me one day.

756
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,984
Someone like you can’t be trusted.

757
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:09,350
You!

758
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:10,624
Hey, stop!

759
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,968
You two realize how badly your actions

760
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:16,400
could damage our station?

761
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,890
I’m taking this to the board.

762
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,352
I’m sure you know
there aren’t many solutions to this.

763
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,568
Ah! Don’t make coffee yet.

764
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:47,570
I bought you one.

765
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,000
Here you go.

766
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,360
Whoa, this place is trending right now.

767
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,520
Thank you so much.

768
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:56,552
You’re welcome.

769
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Uh…

770
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,568
Is Yong in his room?

771
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:02,570
I want to give him one too.

772
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,984
He is.

773
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,304
I don’t mean to meddle,

774
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:11,976
but I don’t think you should give it to him.

775
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,112
Why not?

776
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,112
He catches feelings easily.

777
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:18,152
I think

778
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,848
Arin likes me.

779
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:24,496
Last time you gave him a snack,

780
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:25,760
he thought you were into him.

781
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,864
She brought me chocolate from Belgium.

782
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:29,512
How could I not think so?

783
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:31,096
She gave me one too.

784
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,888
Same here.

785
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,368
What? So Yong knows?

786
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,608
I thought I was being subtle.

787
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,472
Wait, you like Yong?

788
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,456
Yes.

789
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,384
Then go give it to him.

790
00:45:58,416 --> 00:45:59,416
He’s in his room.

791
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,416
I’m going in then.

792
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,448
Mm-hmm.

793
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,192
Should I lock it now?

794
00:46:15,224 --> 00:46:16,224
Yes.

795
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,280
It’s stuck.

796
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,000
Why is it stuck?
Tam!

797
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:22,536
Hmm?

798
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,380
Tam!

799
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,832
Why are you shocked?

800
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
These are my luggage alone.

801
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,768
Wait, don’t tell me…

802
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Yes.

803
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,560
Mom let me stay here.

804
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Really?

805
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,384
Really, Mom?

806
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,184
Yes!

807
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:47,376
Yes! Yes!

808
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,992
Thank you, Mom.

809
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,472
Ever since I broke up with Tam’s father,

810
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,256
I’ve always been scared Tam would choose a bad partner like I did.

811
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,992
But this might be the first time
I’m proven wrong.

812
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,000
Now I believe

813
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,608
you won’t make Tam end up like I did.

814
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,464
Please take care of my son, Phi.

815
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,600
Yes, I promise.

816
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,240
My taxi is almost here.

817
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,920
Get plenty of rest, Tam.

818
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:32,544
I love you, Mom.

819
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:33,808
I love you too, Tam.

820
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:35,352
I’ll visit you often.

821
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:36,384
Okay.

822
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,280
Oh, gladly.

823
00:47:43,312 --> 00:47:44,832
Please let me join in on the love too.

824
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Any slower and I wouldn’t hug you.

825
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
What’s wrong?

826
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,640
You should go in first.

827
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,616
I’ll enter through the back of the building.

828
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,720
Come on.

829
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,056
No more hiding.

830
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,416
It’s time to go public.

831
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,500
I’d rather walk with you.

832
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:34,088
Let’s go.

833
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:46,288
(Hi.)

834
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:47,728
Phi! Tam!

835
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:52,936
Phi! Tam!

836
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:54,272
Here’s some food support for you.

837
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:55,328
Thank you.

838
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,312
Hey, I really love you two together.

839
00:49:00,344 --> 00:49:01,584
Can I get a selfie with you?

840
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:02,872
- Sure.
- Sure.

841
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:12,520
I’ve only worked behind the camera.

842
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:14,560
I’m not used to having fans like this.

843
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,576
Well, you’re dating a popular reporter.

844
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,016
You’ll have to live with it.

845
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,080
Let’s be lovey-dovey often
so they get sick of us.

846
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,320
Hey, people might see us!

847
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Fine.

848
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,792
DIRECTED BY PHADUNG SAMAJARN

849
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:46,456
They want you back

850
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:47,808
as the Forecast Prince.

851
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:49,168
Phi won’t leave us.

852
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:50,008
He’s changed.

853
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,010
Consider this our honeymoon.

854
00:49:52,064 --> 00:49:54,160
The two of them went to the pier at night.

855
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:55,504
I think something fishy is going on.

856
00:49:55,528 --> 00:49:56,968
My journalist’s instinct is spot on.

857
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,256
Right now,

858
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:03,344
we’re just Tamtawan and Padtaphi.

859
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,552
No one knows us.

860
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:05,864
When you go back,

861
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:08,840
you’ll be the Forecast Prince again.

862
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:11,048
I want to earn my comeback.

863
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:13,050
No matter what we face,

864
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:15,192
things always work out for us in the end, don't they?
