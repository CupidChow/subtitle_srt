00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:02,768
A student shouldn't smoke.

186
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,238
Is something wrong?

187
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,348
Ever since
we left the chairwoman's office...

188
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:16,678
Nothing's wrong.

189
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,724
Why the heck is he...

190
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,048
Hey!

191
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:27,088
Show some appreciation
for those who care.

192
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,228
Come with me. Let's have a drink.

193
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,138
It was Seo Myeong Ju...

194
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:42,008
who put me on this mission.

195
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,348
She wanted to find the gold,

196
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:49,408
and she used me to do so.

197
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,978
I was a pawn in a game she'd set up.

198
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,248
She has someone within the NIS.

199
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,388
There's no one I can trust.

200
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:15,338
I'm not sure
if this will console you.

201
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,508
I don't want you to think
you're alone.

202
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,948
Suspecting every person
around you...

203
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,788
That's too painful.

204
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,988
Once you find
the one person you can't trust,

205
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:36,858
the others will all be on your side.

206
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:41,198
And...

207
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,268
there's me too.

208
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,238
Here.

209
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,348
You can drink.

210
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:55,808
Cheers.

211
00:13:56,678 --> 00:14:00,418
Who do you think
is suspicious or odd?

212
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,648
It'll be one of the people
who knows about this operation.

213
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,428
Don't worry.
I'll help you find them.

214
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,498
You have to be in school
all day every day.

215
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:18,338
Starting within the NIS
would be too daunting.

216
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,238
Why not spy on the chairwoman?

217
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:23,654
Tracking her movement, tailing her,

218
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,078
pulling phone records.

219
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,278
Can't NIS agents do that?

220
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,878
To a certain degree.

221
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,948
How did you know we can do that?

222
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,718
I'm a fan of spy movies...

223
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:38,358
Is it just me?

224
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,528
You dropped the honorifics
to speak casually.

225
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,964
We're the same age.

226
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,264
Are we?

227
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,128
When did we share personal details?

228
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:47,568
In elementary school?

229
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,728
Back then?

230
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,268
In elementary school?

231
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:59,438
We were in second grade to be exact.

232
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,278
Why am I your sworn enemy?

233
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:08,848
You kind of look like him.

234
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,018
Who?

235
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:12,758
Just someone.
Someone who's like my sworn enemy.

236
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,338
Why did you change your name?

237
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,108
I prefer Bong Ja.

238
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,608
And one more thing.

239
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,948
I live over there.

240
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:53,398
You're Si Hyun...

241
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,998
- You mean you're Jeong Si Hyun?
- Yes.

242
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,498
You lived close by...

243
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,638
and until now,
all I thought about...

244
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,478
How come? Goodness.

245
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,448
"Jeong Hae Seong."

246
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,688
Why are you "Hae Seong?"
Did you change your name too?

247
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,358
I did when I joined the company.

248
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,758
I can't use my real name
in the field.

249
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,328
Okay, then you stay Hae Seong.

250
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:26,058
Don't call me "Bong Ja,"
or I'll kill you.

251
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,498
I think that name is prettier.

252
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,638
Oh Su A it is.

253
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,838
Multiple shocks in a row.

254
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,354
If there's anything else
I should know, tell me now.

255
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,624
There isn't.

256
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,284
Are you sure? There's nothing else?

257
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:43,708
There isn't.

258
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,318
It's late. Go on home.

259
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,518
See you.

260
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,458
- Hae Seong.
- Yes?

261
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:06,238
When you transferred schools
without a word in second grade,

262
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,338
I was really upset.

263
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,578
I heard later on that you'd left...

264
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:14,578
because your father went missing.

265
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:20,618
I read this somewhere.

266
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:24,188
Hope only exists for people
who believe in it.

267
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,058
You'll find your father.

268
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:30,858
I should and will.

269
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:41,408
Get to bed early.
You'll be busy from now on.

273
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:29,908

went way up this semester.

274
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:31,754
You're the best, Dad.

275
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:34,148
- And the science essay contest?
- Don't.

276
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:35,994
You know who I am.

277
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,388
Of course, you got it.

278
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:38,918
It's not just the essay contest.

279
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,958
You'll find your name
on many winners lists.

280
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,328
There are many things to check,
so go through them.

281
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:47,828
- Okay.
- Hey, by the way,

282
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,504
you can't tell anyone about this.

283
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,138
Of course, I won't.

284

00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,548
Hey, what's up?

287
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,318
Is Seung Jae not here yet?

288
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:11,558
I saw him earlier,
but he's not here now.

289
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,358
Should I call him?

290
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,628
No, I'll look for him.

291
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:21,228
- I know, right?
- No way.

292
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,328
- No!
- Hey.

293
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,368
- She said...
- Hey!

294
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:26,368
- Come on.
- I've been wanting to say this.

295
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,938
That hairstyle really suits you.

296
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,084
Really?

297
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,238
- I was so torn.
- This time, I...

298
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:32,678
Yes, it suits you.

299
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,408
- Really? Thanks.
- Yes.

300
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,478
What? Isn't this...

301
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:41,088
Mr. Lee, do you know what this is?

302
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:44,164
- What is this?
- Seung Jae dropped it at the event.

303
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,158
I forgot to give it to him
in the morning.

304
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,004
You know, I thought about it.

305
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,058
I think you should look into it
before you return it to him.

306
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:54,198
No, this isn't even mine.

307
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,814
These days, so many kids
are duped into cybercrimes.

308
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:59,668
What if he ends up
in such a situation...

309
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,538
because you don't intervene?

310
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:04,778
I think
Seung Jae is smarter than that.

311
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:07,278
Ms. Kim, Mr. Lee.

312
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,208
Yes?

314
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,648
- Okay.
- Okay.

315
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:16,118
You should still look into it
just in case.

316
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,988
Just give it back if there's
nothing suspicious about it.

317
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,038
Damn it.

318
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,108

I've been looking for you.

Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of busy right now.

322
00:21:57,258 --> 00:21:58,758
Let's talk later.

323
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:02,198
On the night of the event,

324
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,468
I was here.

325
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,378
I overheard your conversation
with your dad.

326
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:20,018
So I have many questions for you,
Seung Jae.

327
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:25,558
Okay.

328
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:28,004
I mean, I understand
what you're trying to say.

329
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:29,458
- I will...
- Hey, Han Seung Jae.

330
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:31,798
I asked you a question.

331
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,468
Don't list excuses.
Just answer my question.

332
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,468
I'll ask you one last time.

333
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:45,878
The science essay contest
hasn't even happened yet.

335
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:49,748
What was the thing
your dad gave you?

336
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,518
Why did he say
you must keep it a secret?

337
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,748
Tell me everything.
Don't leave anything out.

338
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,828

you asked about it first.

telling other kids to do it too.

I'm not sure.

351
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:55,478

they can't tell us.

"This is wrong. You must stop this."

356
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,128
Will you raise a problem with it?

What are you saying?

364
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:45,498
You are
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's daughter.

365
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:50,868
Your mom made it all happen,
you dummy.

366
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:56,368
Ms. Oh Su A...

367
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:58,938
has the link?

368
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,664
Ms. Oh Su A.

369
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,874
Hello.

370
00:25:11,204 --> 00:25:13,074
Where are you going in such a rush?

371
00:25:13,704 --> 00:25:15,474
I have to get ready for my class.

372
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:24,014
You majored in Korean History,
right?

373
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:25,684
Yes.

374
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:29,070
You see, I truly love world history.

375
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,200
For example,
the First Sino-Japanese War,

376
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:33,524
which started in 1894.

377
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,834
How did Japan...

378
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,864
manage to beat
the great Qing dynasty of China...

379
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:42,374
and seize hegemony over East Asia?

380
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,044
Through their military strength?
Weaponry?

381
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:46,820
Clever military strategies?

382
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,174
No.

383
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,314
The power of rules.

384
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:55,884
All soldiers were required
to obey their commanders.

385
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,554
It was all thanks
to their strict rules.

386
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,964
Japanese soldiers were shot to death
on the spot...

387
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,464
if they drank water
when they weren't on their break.

388
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,164
Those who are likely
to break the rules,

389
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,404
bring down morale,

390
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:15,234
and cause trouble.

391
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:18,274
To get rid of them
before they become trouble.

392
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:21,414
Bang.

393
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,014
Mark my words.

394
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:32,224
If you want to work here
for a long time, that is.

395
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,064
Have fun
getting ready for your class.

396
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:53,274
Ma'am.

397
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,884
I'm sorry,
but didn't the Japanese hegemony...

398
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:01,954
lead the empire to its collapse?

399
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,224
Please excuse me.

400
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,244
Damn it.

401
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,074
My gosh. Am I losing my mind?

402
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:34,244
What was I thinking,
talking back to her like that?

403
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,754
Unbelievable.

404
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:42,924
Seriously, what should I do?

405
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,564
I'm scared to handle this alone.

They did nothing wrong.

414
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:17,924
This should be investigated.

415
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,740
I know the school is falling apart,
but this is just wrong.

416
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:22,164
How could this...

417
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,404
Can you help me?

418
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:38,184
Sorry. That will be hard.

419
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,284
As you probably know already,
I have a lot on my plate now...

420
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,384
because of the situation at work.

421
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:49,224
Sorry about that.

422

427

Don't do this again.

Why are you studying so hard?

432
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,854
The exam week ended recently.

433
00:29:56,854 --> 00:29:59,370
The exams aren't everything.

434
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:02,994

is way more important.

for the competition too,

436

437

Competition?

438
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:12,944
Yes, the math competition.

439
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:14,714
You may not believe me,

440
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:16,444
but I always get the highest marks
in math.

441
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,614
I beat Ye Na on my midterms...

442
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:19,384
because I did so well
on my math exam.

443
00:30:20,814 --> 00:30:22,060
If they actually follow this plan,

444
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:23,930

will change.

448
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:31,024
Nothing.

449
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,464
Well...

450
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:36,640
Is the competition very important?

451
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,210
Yes, I would say so.

452
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:40,404
It's definitely helpful to have it
on your student record.

453
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,174
Have I told you this before?

454
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:46,874

No.

457
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:54,530
That's why
this competition is important to me.

458
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:56,954
It'll determine whether or not
I can get into the college...

459

where I'd study to achieve my dream.

460
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,624
It means I have to study even harder
from now on.

461
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:08,310
Did you and Dad fight?

462
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,464

about future events...

between me and the parents...

for my project...

that binds us together.

536

for the children's sake?

and nothing else.

00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:37,824
Sure. Well understood.
You are absolutely right.

540
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:41,064
Let me pour you one.

541
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:48,850
By the way, would it be okay
to leave Oh Su A like that?

542
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,704
We should teach her
an unforgettable lesson.

543
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:00,814
Hey, where are you?

544
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,714
Wait there. I'll come now.

545
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,534
My gosh!

546
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:19,704
Ma'am.

547
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,004
Oh, this is the men's room,
not the ladies' room...

548
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:26,104
What are you doing? What did I do?

549
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:39,784
On your knees!

550
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,524
I said, on your knees.

551
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,324
Yes, ma'am.

552
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:51,764
You see, your rude mouth
is always the problem.

553
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,504
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,104
I swear,
I didn't mean to tell Ye Na.

555
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:04,844
So, you don't even know
what you did wrong.

556
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,314
Pardon me?

557
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:08,984
What do you mean?

558
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:14,924
From now on,
when you're with your elders,

559
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:20,464
just watch what you say,
Han Seung Jae.

560
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:22,594
Yes, ma'am.

561
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,704
Wipe your face with this.

562
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,094
What are you doing?

563
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,704
Looking into
the school grade scandal?

564
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,664
Are you watching me
through a camera or something?

565
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:11,514
Why are you doing all this?

566
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,614
You said you wanted
a permanent position.

567
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,224
No one would dare to look into this.

568
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:22,954
Why would you do this like a fool,
knowing the risks involved?

569
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:25,924
Because no one else is doing it.

570
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,744
One of my first students
I told you about the other day.

571
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:42,414
She dropped out of school.

572
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:44,150
Do you have proof?

573
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,584
Can you prove
that my daughter framed...

574
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,884
that dirty orphan?

575
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:49,684
Committee Chairwoman, please.

576
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:52,014
Ms. Oh, apologize already.

577
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,130
Forget it.

578
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:55,454
- Unbelievable.
- Apologize, damn it!

579
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,394
Damn it.

580
00:39:57,924 --> 00:40:00,164
Ma'am!

581
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:06,764
She was framed
for stealing the exam sheet.

582
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:07,804
(Exam Sheet)

583
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,734
I promised to clear her name.

584
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:12,574
But I failed miserably.

585
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:17,244
I didn't know my place
as a temp teacher.

586
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:21,284
That's when I made up my mind.

587
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,814
To be someone qualified.

588
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,154
Because powerless justice
is another name for incompetence.

589
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:31,354
That's why I have
to be a full-time teacher.

590
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:33,664
But now?

591
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:41,404
Someone reminded me
of something I had forgotten about.

592
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,944
Something more important
than being a full-time teacher.

593
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,414
The reason I chose this career path.

594
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,314
It's my job to protect my students.

595
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,970
I'm not asking for your help,
so don't worry.

596
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:08,264
- Just don't try to stop me...
- Seo Myeong Ju knows.

597
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,234
She knows you're investigating
the fixed school grades.

598
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:15,734
I don't care.

599
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,974

to carry on at school.

and school grades for each subject.

609
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:58,844

that the system was rigged.

among parents we find suspicious.

Look here.

614

We'll compare this...

00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,224

with the gold bars...

715
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:35,217
is being backed up
by the school grades rigging scandal?

716
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:39,857
The scandal and the gold bars
are headed in the same direction.

717
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,057
This does look serious.

718
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:46,233
I'll think about it,
so head back to your post.

719
00:49:46,257 --> 00:49:47,473
Yes, sir.

720
00:49:47,497 --> 00:49:48,703
Seok Ho,

721
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:50,997
give me a full summation in an hour.

722
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:52,427
Yes, sir.

723
00:49:52,797 --> 00:49:54,167
You're dismissed.

724
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:12,847
I was just about to call you.

725
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,857
Jeong Hae Seong has been...

726
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,687
crossing the line these days.

727
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:20,727
Right.

728
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:25,427
Even as far as to that?

729
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:27,567
That brat.

730
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:33,477
Western culture
was introduced to us rapidly...

731
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,107
in the 1920s and 1930s
through newspapers,

732
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:38,053
magazines, and movies.

733
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,623
Major cities were
at the heart of this trend.

734
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:44,687
Capitalistic consumption culture
emerged...

735
00:50:44,747 --> 00:50:47,587
especially in and around Seoul.

736
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:51,857
That'll be the end of today's class.

737
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,813
(Mister)

738
00:51:02,837 --> 00:51:04,767
The mission has been aborted.

739
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:06,167
Wrap it up by the end of this week.

740
00:51:06,307 --> 00:51:08,237
Mission aborted?

741
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,607
That's the text I got
after I reported Seo Myeong Ju's...

742
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,047
school grades scandal.

743
00:51:14,517 --> 00:51:16,547
But you were just at the NIS.

744
00:51:16,547 --> 00:51:17,763
Who knew about this?

745
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:20,017
My team and the director.

746
00:51:20,957 --> 00:51:22,717
And the only people
who could order this...

747
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:24,557
are the director and my team leader.

748
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:33,097
You must stay at the school
to keep an eye on Seo Myeong Ju.

749
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:35,837
The order came from...

750
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:37,737
Seo Myeong Ju herself.

751
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,167
The mole at the NIS told her...

752
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,653
about my investigation
into the scandal,

753
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:43,277
and she wants me gone.

754
00:51:44,307 --> 00:51:45,947
I must stay at the school...

755
00:51:46,247 --> 00:51:49,347
for the sake of this mission
and to fish out the mole.

756
00:51:51,387 --> 00:51:53,317
I'll bait Seo Myeong Ju.

757
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:54,717
How?

758
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:59,557
By holding the gold bars hostage.

759
00:52:00,957 --> 00:52:03,327
If I tell her
I know where the gold bars are,

760
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:07,997
she won't kick me
out of this school.

761
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:09,567
(Ciabatta and butter, Fruit salad,
Sweet pumpkin cream soup,)

762
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:10,830
(Steak and cream pasta, Pickles,
Fruit juice, Pecan pie)

763
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:13,277
The chairwoman's coming today?

764
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:16,753
Of course. No wonder
the meal is this luxurious.

765
00:52:16,777 --> 00:52:18,077
So that's today.

766
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:20,547
The chairwoman eats with us
once every six months.

767
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:21,923
I'll pass on lunch.

768
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:24,047
Just locking eyes with her
will give me indigestion.

769
00:52:24,047 --> 00:52:25,223
I'll pass as well.

770
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:27,257
She's scary, so same here.

771
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:28,757
Same here.

772
00:52:30,687 --> 00:52:32,027
Hae Seong, where are you going?

773
00:52:34,597 --> 00:52:36,867
To have lunch. I'm hungry.

774
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:39,937
- What?
- What?

775
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:44,107
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

776
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,637
- Goodness.
- Please enjoy.

777
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:49,277
Let's add avocado to the salad.

778
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:51,547
- Avocado?
- That's right. Also...

779
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:53,223
Hello, Ms. Seo.

780
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:54,647
Goodness, hello.

781
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,217
What brings you here?

782
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:59,363
I was hoping to eat with you today.

783
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:01,317
- May I sit here?
- Hae Seong.

784
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:03,527
Can't you see she's eating?

785
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:05,857
To talk to her,
you must have an appointment...

786
00:53:05,857 --> 00:53:07,157
Don't.

787
00:53:07,357 --> 00:53:08,797
Sit over here.

788
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:10,573
Thank you.

789
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:11,897
But...

790
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:22,577
I'll enjoy it.
Gosh, this looks good.

791
00:53:27,777 --> 00:53:29,377
What did you want to say?

792
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:30,847
Sorry?

793
00:53:30,847 --> 00:53:33,147
Didn't you sit here
because you had something to say?

794
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:38,027
You see...

795
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:40,897
I don't know
if I should even ask you this.

796
00:53:41,027 --> 00:53:42,427
Feel free to ask me anything.

797
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:46,167
Sure. Then...

798
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,907
It's something
I've been curious about.

799
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:56,007
Byeongmun High was famous
at my old school as well.

800
00:53:56,947 --> 00:53:59,807
The rumor that practically
everyone has heard.

801
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:02,647
The strange mystery
of Byeongmun High.

802
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:09,057
Why is the food at Byeongmun High
so delicious?

803
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,433
The food?

804
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:17,067
Now I know why.

805
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:20,397
Because you show us you care
by being hands-on.

806
00:54:22,337 --> 00:54:23,667
Have your fill.

807
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:27,537
And come to my office
if there's something...

808
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,207
you really need to tell me.

809
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,877
How could a student dare
to enter your office?

810
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,377
The offer alone is much appreciated.

811
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:41,187
Anyway, Ms. Seo,

812
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:45,127
has the school gym
gone under renovation before?

813
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:47,927
The school gym?

814
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,967
Never. Why do you ask?

815
00:54:56,637 --> 00:55:00,037
As you know, I'm a curious soul.

816
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,977
There are interesting tales
surrounding the school.

817
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,077
You like ghost stories.

818
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:16,857
Goodness.

819
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:21,097
But the gym ghost
isn't known to many.

820
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:22,497
How did you know about it?

821
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:26,837
I enjoyed the meal.

822
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,437
I'll get going.

823
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:49,187
He's hoping
the fourth ghost story...

824
00:55:49,317 --> 00:55:51,857
will be enough
to keep him in school.

825
00:55:52,457 --> 00:55:53,757
Principal Park.

826
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:58,073
Deal with what I ordered
as soon as possible.

827
00:55:58,097 --> 00:55:59,667
Yes, ma'am.

828
00:56:03,307 --> 00:56:05,407
I'm going to check
Seo Myeong Ju's movements today.

829
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,407
Sure. I'll look further into
what I can find at school.

830
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,177
Right. Stay safe.

831
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:16,943
(Office of Records and Documents)

832
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,871
(2023 Intra-school English Reading
Comprehension Competition)

833
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:37,667
We found the link,
but it's still not enough.

834
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:40,007
Hard evidence that'll prove
the tests and contests...

835
00:56:40,007 --> 00:56:41,637
have been rigged.

836
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:43,377
Concrete evidence.

837
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:46,717
Let's think about
how we'll obtain that.

838
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,747
Why are you here
and not at ballet class?

839
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:01,717
I have something to ask.

840
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,487
Which is?

841
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,397
What is it?

842
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:18,537
Is it true...

843
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:22,437
that the reason
I'm at the top of the class...

844
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:24,177
Yes, it was all me.

845
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:29,477
- Mom?
- Because you're my daughter.

846
00:58:29,617 --> 00:58:31,147
My daughter should be the best,

847
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:34,157
and it is my responsibility
as your mother to make that happen.

848
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:36,557
What about me, then?

849
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,627
What about...

850
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:43,367
all the hard work
I've been putting in?

851
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:45,127
That's why
no one questioned your scores.

852
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:49,597
Ye Na.

853
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:54,337
Don't think too much of it
and do as you've been doing.

854
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:56,507
I'll take care of the rest.

855
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:00,217
You're not like Yu Jeong.

856
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:05,593
You were chosen
as Seo Myeong Ju's daughter...

857
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:08,187
and have all the right
to reap the benefits.

858
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:09,987
To be honest,
I'd do more if I could.

859
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:13,157
Hey, since we're on the subject,

860
00:59:13,157 --> 00:59:15,827
stop associating
with that Yu Jeong girl.

861
00:59:15,957 --> 00:59:18,003
Playing with her for a year
is more than enough.

862
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:20,667
If I'm being honest,

863
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,467
she pissed me off.

864
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,807
How dare a nobody like her...

865
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:27,807
take the top spot from my daughter?

866
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,607
Don't speak ill of Yu Jeong.

867
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:32,947
What?

868
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:36,563
She was never my plaything.

869
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:38,687
Don't speak that way
about my friend.

870
00:59:39,517 --> 00:59:41,217
Did you just call her your friend?

871
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:22,897
Ye Na, hey.

872
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:25,727
Sorry, but I'll sit here.

873
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:30,107
You had the second highest grades
this time around...

874
01:00:30,107 --> 01:00:31,567
only losing to me by one question.

875
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:34,177
Can I sit next to you?

876
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:36,377
What? Sure.

877
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:41,717
What's your secret?

878
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:43,887
You aren't in any study groups
or have any private tutors.

879
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:45,617
Well...

880
01:00:46,317 --> 01:00:48,117
I mostly stick
to studying the textbooks.

881
01:00:49,587 --> 01:00:51,387
Is studying
the easiest thing for you?

882
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:52,827
I guess.

883
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:55,997
It's Yu Jeong, right? An Yu Jeong.

884
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,527
I'm curious about you.

885
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:01,097
Let's be friends.

886
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:06,907
Lee Ye Na.

887
01:01:10,277 --> 01:01:11,707
What are you doing here?

888
01:01:29,197 --> 01:01:30,567
Here.

889
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:34,297
My gosh.

890
01:01:34,297 --> 01:01:36,937
You must be Ye Na
whom I heard so much about.

891
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:39,067
You're my daughter's best friend.

892
01:01:40,507 --> 01:01:43,807
I hope you keep getting along

but please bear with that.

895
01:01:47,877 --> 01:01:49,877
Mom, stop the nonsense
and head inside.

896
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:51,223
Why? I don't want to.

897
01:01:51,247 --> 01:01:53,347
I'd like to eat with Ye Na.

898
01:01:53,817 --> 01:01:56,217
Ye Na, please enjoy,

899
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:58,127
and tell me whatever you need.

900
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,733
I'll enjoy.

901
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:03,273
Goodness.
She has such a pretty voice.

902
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:04,473
Leave.

903
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:06,467
All right, fine.

904
01:02:07,867 --> 01:02:09,197
Hold on.

You like that, right?

907
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:01,487

A promise?

938
01:07:51,307 --> 01:07:54,417

like a question for me.

I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

950
