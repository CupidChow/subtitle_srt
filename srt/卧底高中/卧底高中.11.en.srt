7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,609
We got disconnected, so I didn't get the details.

8
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,609
We'll have to wait until Hae Seong gets out.

00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,955
Until we are back in contact with him,

10
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:28,719
we must stall.

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,819
Seo Myeong Ju of all people can't know what we just discovered.

12
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,459
Of course.

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,398
What now?

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,759
We've arrived, ma'am.

00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,999

19
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,619
see it to the end if you want.

20
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,059
Ma'am.

21
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,499
This is as far as we go.

22
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,239
Let them through.

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,185
Stand by.

24
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,509

25
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,828
- What the... - My gosh!

26
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:43,435
- Darn. - What on earth?

27
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,629
How can you just let them through?

28
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,999
Darn.

29
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,299
Goodness.

30
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,219
What on earth?

31
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,589
Where's my gold?

32
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,229
What the heck is all this?

33
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,889
Where is it?

34
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,599

35

Hold on.

00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:05,109
Darn, my gold.

37
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,639
Move this.

38
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,088
Where's my gold?

39
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,765
My gold! Where is it?

40
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,859
Where the heck is my gold?

41
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:34,039
Ma'am? Ma'am!

42
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,779
When will you get home if you leave this late?

43
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,025
It's my birthday tomorrow.

44
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,849
As if I would've forgotten that.

45
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,019
I'll be home before you know it and wake you up.

46
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,259
We'll go to your favourite observatory.

47
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,419
Keep your promise this time.

48
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:30,389
Or I won't ever talk to you again.

49
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,799

52
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,259
Grab a bite at least.

53
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,159
Or go inside and get some sleep.

55
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,669
I'm fine.

56
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,769
I'm good.

57
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,539
Goodness.

58
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,809
Hae Seong's father.

59
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,049
The evidence points to a homicide, right?

60
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,519
We won't know the details until the analysis is done,

61
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,849
but a bullet was found.

62
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,189
Why he was there also needs to be investigated.

63
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,729
What have we been doing?

64
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,798
After all the hoops we had to go through...

65
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,199
to find those darn gold bars,

66
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,015
this is what we ended up with, and Hae Seong...

67
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,369
Oh, dear.

68
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,449
Glasses shouldn't be raised.

69
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,189
Goodness.

70
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,589
If the gold was never there to begin with,

71
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,689
how come there was a photo of it?

72
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,335
We all saw the photo.

73
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,169
I think it was bait.

74
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,738
The director fabricated one...

75
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:34,199
to reel us in so that we'd accept this mission.

76
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,815
Anyhow,

77
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,339
Hae Seong is finally sending his father off,

78
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,049
but no one's here.

79
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,609
For Hae Seong to find peace,

80
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,419
it should be bustling with people.

81
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,659
My gosh. What...

82
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,929
Goodness.

83
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,669

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,549
How did you know to come here?

85
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,859
They wanted to come, so I brought them.

86
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,199
Let's pay our respects to his father.

87
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,529
Dad,

88
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,989
I guess you won't be so lonely.

89
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,359
Thanks for coming.

90
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,259
You must be hungry.

91
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:45,639
Thanks.

92
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,939

(Deceased: Jeong Jae Hyeon, Chief Mourner: Jeong Hae Seong)

95
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:16,729
As you requested, I had it analysed by a private facility...

96
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,168
and not the National Forensic Service...

97
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,539

Around 22 years ago,

102
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,679
it was the issued firearm for senior agents of the NIS and above.

103
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,049
A senior agent at the time...

104
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,759
That's why I looked into it.

105

my gold have gone?

Ma'am,

115
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,649
the investigation concluded...

116
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,765
that the space we found was never the vault.

117
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,288
It was a secret conference room...

118
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,828
that was put together...

119
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,029
by the founding chairman to collude with pro-Japanese figures.

120
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,699
It is my belief that the gifts...

121
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,875
presented to the chairman by those people...

122
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,868
were later misinformed as gold bars.

123
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,839
No, the gold existed.

124
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,139
I know that much. The gold was there at some point.

125
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:13,078

126

Ma'am, please.

128
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,459
Was it Hae Seong? Yes, it was.

129
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,659
What an agent.

130
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,228
That is one talented agent.

131
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,169
In that short amount of time,

132
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,099
how did he manage...

133
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,609
to steal and hide all that gold?

134
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
Ma'am, please.

135
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,089
Yes, Director.

136
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,529
Bring HR in.

139
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,315
What could be the reason?

140
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,599
As if he hasn't caused more than enough trouble.

141
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,909
The incident at the school yesterday...

142
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,985

Find my gold.

146
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:31,429
Kidnap Jeong Hae Seong...

147
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,328
or torture him if you have to.

148
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,599

158
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,259
That you got fired for botching a mission?

159
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:53,369
What the...

160
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,669
Are you going somewhere?

161
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,039
Yes. What brings you by?

162
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,878
Everyone's gathered at the restaurant...

163
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,218
and Senior Agent An told me to get you.

164
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,579
Let's grab a bite to eat.

165
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,289
Maybe later.

166
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,919
Start without me.

167
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,289
Hae Seong.

168
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,599
Are you sure you're okay?

169
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,409
Su A.

170
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,519
Thank you for everything.

171
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,839
You think the bullet...

172
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,645
was Director Kim's?

173
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,009
Yes.

174
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,079
That's how it seems so far.

175
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,619
I'm here.

176
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,125
Why is it just you? Where's my son-in-law?

177
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,525
He had somewhere to go.

178
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,689
Still. You should've brought him with you.

179
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,405
But he must be exhausted from the funeral.

180
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,928
Call him yourself then.

181
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,329
There's something else that's bugging me.

182
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,369
What could be bugging you?

183
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,769
What Hae Seong said to me last.

184
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,585
He thanked me...

185
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,669
as if he was saying goodbye.

186
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,109
Sir,

187
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,585
- could Hae Seong... - Come on.

188
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,049
I get he's upset,

189
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:49,119
but I doubt he'll hold a gun to Director Kim's head.

190
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,858
- Mom, I'm going too. - Hey, hold on!

191
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,328
- Su A, wait. - I'll see you!

192
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,059
Goodness me.

193
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,529
Hae Seong.

194
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,798
Let's talk this out.

195
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,468
Take a deep breath.

196
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:07,769
I'm sorry, Uncle.

197
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,045
But this seems like the only way.

198
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:12,385
I know you're frustrated, but if you do this...

199
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,909
You know this isn't the way.

200
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,055
Hae Seong, come on. Turn the car around.

201
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,778
We'll get together and discuss this.

202
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,579
This is for me to end.

203
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:23,949
Don't follow me.

204
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,259
Hey. Hello?

205
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,375
Where's Director Kim?

206
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,528
He's at the Incheon Hotel...

207
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,929
for the Defence and National Security Conference.

208
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,139
(Defence and National Security Conference)

209
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:52,267
Hello.

210
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,218
Welcome. How may I help you?

211
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,348
My director forgot this document.

212
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,065
It's urgent, but he's not picking up his phone.

213
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,858
What is the guest's name?

214
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,018
It's Kim Hyung Bae.

215
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,359
Mr. Kim Hyung Bae.

216
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,598
Yes, Mr. Kim is staying with us.

217
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,928
Allow me to have it delivered.

218
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,299
Thank you.

219
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,313
(Calling extension number 1201)

220
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,079
Yes?

221
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,979
There's a file for Mr. Kim Hyung Bae.

222
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,689
The one who...

223
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:40,399
- I'll head downstairs for a bit. - Sure.

224
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:58,518
(An Seok Ho)

225
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,759
Would it have killed you to take the keycard?

226
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,869
Your bullet was found with my dad's body.

227
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,779
Why did you kill him?

228
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,209
Why did you kill my father?

229
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:44,158
Where's the person who gave you this?

230
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,459
He suddenly disappeared, and I don't know where he went.

231
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,009
It's Room 1201.

232
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,509
Wait.

233
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,848
How do you expect to handle the fallout?

234
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,209
Agent Jeong!

235
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:08,018
Calm down. Let's sit down and talk.

236
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,419
Call security.

237
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:10,995
Yes, sir.

238
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,135
You're only making things worse.

239
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,489
Lower your gun and...

240
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,329
What happened...

241
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,939
the day my father died?

242
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,109
Why did he...

243
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,909
have to take a bullet?

244
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,539
Tell me everything.

245
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:37,849
Hurry!

246
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:42,919
Get in.

247
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,619
I think we're one step behind.

248
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,629
It's still not too late.

249
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,769
Pull yourself together...

250
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,269
and let us talk.

251
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,899
Agent Jeong!

252
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,269
As a member of the NIS,

253
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,178
- you should serve the state... - Three.

254
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,408
Forget that. Clear your mind...

255
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:09,578
and pull yourself together...

256
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,909
Two.

257
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,249
Fine. I'll talk!

258
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,479
I'll tell you everything.

259
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,758
That night...

260
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,989
Jeong Hae Seong, lower your gun!

261
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,099
Or I'll fire.

262
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,969
Lower your gun!

263
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,149
Sir, are you all right?

264
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,165
Get him out of my face.

265
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:54,519
Take him outside.

266
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,739
Have him ready for the local police.

267
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,585
You're out of your mind.

268
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:12,379
How dare you point a gun at the director?

269
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,095
He's dangerous, so keep your eye on him.

270
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,479
Take him away.

271
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:21,349
Stay frosty!

272
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,235
What now?

273
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,189
One problem at a time.

274
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,758
Right now, let's focus on helping Hae Seong.

275
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,128
To do so, we need to get past that mountain gorilla.

276
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:33,469
Would that be possible?

277
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,529
If only I had brought a banana.

278
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,639
How about this?

279
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,009
Hey, gorilla. It's been a while.

280
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,749
Domestic Team Four, you're supposed to be on standby.

281
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:49,719
What brings you here?

282
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,619
We were passing by...

283
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:53,349
and heard of a seminar.

284
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,359
Are you here to help Hae Seong escape?

285
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,029
I'm right.

286
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:01,729
Security.

287
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:04,499
Gosh, it's Song Hye Kyo.

288
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:06,768
Where?

289
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,629
As if that'd be true, you moron.

290
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,009
Ms. Oh.

291
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,409
You're up!

292
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,509
I've been meaning to ask.

293
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,779
Who is she?

294
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,579
Her?

295
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,719
Our team's wild card.

296
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:06,989
Why you...

297
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:10,829
Hold on.

298
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:13,999
Can I go to the restroom?

299
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:16,298
Those who request bathroom breaks at this point...

300
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,015
are up to no good.

301
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,669
Don't be absurd. This isn't a TV show.

302
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,879
I really need to go. Come on.

303
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,909
Stop!

304
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,118
- Su A? - What on earth?

305
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,719
No, don't!

306
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,789
What the...

307
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,399
Hold on.

308
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:51,439
Why are you here?

309
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:53,969
Is Agent An here too?

310
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:55,408
The whole team?

311
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,738
Yes, we all came to stop you.

312
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,855
Me and the rest of your team.

313
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,509
How stupid can you be?

314
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,548
I don't care how upset you are.

315
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,425
This isn't the place to come without a plan.

316
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:08,789
You guys are driving me nuts.

317
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:12,135
I told you not to come, but you just won't listen!

318
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,529
What are you talking about?

319
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:15,188
- Where is he? - He went downstairs.

320
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:16,529
Run for now.

321
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:24,269
Act normal.

322
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,115
One male and one female suspects of a violent crime...

323
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,749
are evading authorities within the hotel.

324
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,119
Excuse me. May we see some ID?

325
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:56,029
We'll hold them off, so go.

326
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,098
But Agent An...

327
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:59,239
Today, I'm paying you back...

328
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:00,968
for all you did for me.

329
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,038
- Yeong Hun. - Don't worry.

330
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,985
It's our turn to protect you.

331
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,009
Mi Jeong.

332
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,548
Don't just stand there and get going.

333
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:09,209
Go!

334
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,719
I can't believe he actually left.

335
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,818
Hey! Are you sure about this?

336
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:17,858
(Exit)

337
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,289
I know my team can handle this.

338
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,389
Let me tell you about my team.

339
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:23,929
Individually, they lack talent.

340
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,269
But together, they can take on anyone.

341
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,659
Get them!

342
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,909
Mi Jeong!

343
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:19,148
Yeong Hun?

344
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:20,449
You little...

345
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,189
Here we go!

346
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,689
Get them!

347
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,679
Are you all right?

348
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,879
Yeong Hun!

349
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:20,349
Our scholarship system and...

350
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:23,525
This too. Financial aid for those who need social support.

351
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,279
Go ahead and get rid of these.

352
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,119
Also, we'll increase our tuition fees by 50 percent.

353
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,759
Ma'am.

354
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:32,905
Then many of our students may not be able...

355
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,405
to continue their studies with us starting next semester.

356
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,135
And I'm sure the board won't be okay with it.

357
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,328
Those kids won't be able to transfer to Edu-City anyway.

358
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:41,528
They'll drop out anyway,

359
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,639
so we'll just be rid of them now.

360
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,199
Ma'am.

361
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,815
It may not be my place to say this, but if you made this decision...

362
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,679
to secure funding for Edu-City,

363
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:55,109
I suggest you take a step back for the time being.

364
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:58,378
Public opinion and the situation with the National Assembly...

365
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,189
aren't unfolding in our favour at the moment.

366
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,465
We should reassess the situation and wait for our next opportunity.

367
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,758
All will be taken care of once we find the gold bars.

368
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,789
What are you talking about now?

369
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:11,828
Wait for our next opportunity and take a step back for now?

370
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,899
Must you talk like a gutless coward?

371
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:17,315
I mean, once you have a plan,

372
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,268
you need to do whatever it takes...

373
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,369
to execute that plan.

374
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:27,209
Principal Park, why are you here now?

375
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:29,449
Go and find the gold bars.

376
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:34,019
Go and find the gold bars.

377
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,859
Go and find the gold bars!

378
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,488
Go and find the gold bars!

379
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:40,889
Ma'am.

380
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,099
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:31:58,179 --> 00:31:59,755
I can find the gold bars.

382
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,555
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong.

383
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:03,879
So, Edu-City will be all mine.

384
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,265
I can find the gold bars.

385
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,965
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong.

386
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:12,419
So, Edu-City will be all mine.

387
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:19,769
So, you guys are saying...

388
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,339
I was about to shoot Director Kim in the head. Is that right?

389
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,309
That's why you made such a big fuss and tussled with those guys?

390
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:34,049
Do you seriously think I'm that dumb?

391
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,619
I ranked tenth in my entire school.

392
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:40,219
Well, we really thought that was what was going on.

393
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:43,989
Then you shouldn't have said what you said.

394
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,289
What? What did I say?

395
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:50,199
Su A.

396
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:52,629
Thanks for everything.

397
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,229
What the...

398
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,099
Am I Chow Yun Fat?

399
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,438
I meant that I was grateful to her...

400
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,009
for attending my father's funeral.

401
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,178
Then you should've said so.

402
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,748
You confused me by saying that in such a serious voice.

403
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:11,778
Right?

404
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,525
In other words, it was all my fault?

405
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,089
It wasn't my fault.

406
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:16,459
My gosh.

407
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:20,189
Unbelievable.

408
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,928
I can't believe this.

409
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,659
Stop. That's enough!

410
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,429
Hey, why did you go and see Director Kim?

411
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,839
His bullet was found...

412
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:33,838
with my dad's body,

413
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,469
but there was something suspicious.

414
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,809
Something suspicious?

415
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,749
Seo Myeong Ju.

416
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,479
Kim Hyeon Ho had my dad's notebook, but he died.

417
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,489
And my dad's death.

418
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:50,659
It all happened at Byeongmun High.

419
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:53,529
Seo Myeong Ju and Director Kim were the ones...

420
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:55,459
who chose me for this operation,

421
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,759
so maybe they were the ones who sent my dad...

422
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:00,569
to Byeongmun High in the past too.

423
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:02,999
Maybe...

424
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,439
Seo Myeong Ju...

425
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,309
had something to do with my dad's death.

426
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,449
So, I wanted to ask Director Kim about it...

427
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,519
before they arrested him.

428
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,219
Your bullet was found with my dad's body.

429
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:23,019
Why did you kill him?

430
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,219
Why did you kill my father?

431
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,529
You're only making things worse.

432
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,878
What happened the day my father died?

433
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,379
Tell me everything.

434
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:57,119
You turned Director Kim's phone into a zombie phone?

435
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:59,835
Monitoring his phone conversations, location tracking, and so on.

436
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,659
I wanted full access.

437
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,159
How is Seo Myeong Ju connected to all of this?

438
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,129
And what happened that day?

439
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:08,969
It was the only way to find out the answers.

440
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,139
Hey, but...

441
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,969
do you think he will give away what you need to know?

442
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,779
He must be under a lot of pressure, knowing they found his bullet.

443
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,539
He'll try whatever he can to get it sorted out.

444
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:22,349
I'm sure we'll find something.

445
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:45,469
Hey, it's me.

446
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,309
Tell them I can't attend the seminar tomorrow.

447
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,109
Why do you look so tired today?

448
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:56,955
Did you have a busy weekend?

449
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:59,549
It was very eventful.

450
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:02,389
I couldn't sleep at all because of the dopamine rush.

451
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,719
Hey, something's fishy here.

452
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,189
I bet something happened between you and Mr. Jeong Hae Seong.

453
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:09,975
Why are you calling him like that?

454
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,199
He's 31.

455
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,069
I still dream about how he confessed his love in front of everyone.

456
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,769
"I like her, a lot."

457
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,639
"Can I kiss you now?"

458
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,709
Hey, don't exaggerate it.

459
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,025
By the way, why would you have a dream about Hae Seong?

460
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:30,649
You're free to dream about anything you wish.

461
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,549
Are you jealous now?

462
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:35,719
- Don't have dreams about him. - Oh, no.

463
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,819
- "Don't have dreams about him." - Attention, please.

464
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,429
I have special instructions from Chairwoman Seo.

465
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,905
I mean, does this make sense to you?

466
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:47,475
How can the school suddenly make a decision like this?

467
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,969
Hey, Dong Min.

468
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,699
- Will you be all right? - No.

469
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:54,439
I'm in trouble now.

470
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,855
It's not just Dong Min. We're all in trouble now.

471
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:01,279
We'll practically become refugees when the next semester begins.

472
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:06,319
Look at them making such a fuss over the 50-percent tuition hike.

473
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:08,489
Hey, Chae Lin. Read the room.

474
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,129
That's not what I meant.

475
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:15,629
Right.

476
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,422
(Byeongmun High Notice)

477
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,969
Don't worry too much.

478
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,939
Okay.

479
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,485
Ms. Oh, I'm only asking out of concern.

480
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:38,549
You won't take this up with Chairwoman Seo, right?

481
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,519
Ms. Oh!

482
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,189
Where are you going now?

483
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,799
If you push ahead with this,

484
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,908
at least 150 students...

485
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,339
will have nowhere to go in the new semester.

486
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,408
There are no schools in the district...

487
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,278
that can accept that many students.

488
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,609
Did you have an appointment to see me?

489
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:14,419
This is a school.

490
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,918
A school must offer equal opportunities to everyone...

491
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,888
Equal opportunities, my foot.

492
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,459
You know the world is an unfair place.

493
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,728
You teachers share the same office,

494
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,728
but only some of you have permanent positions.

495
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:28,828
A school guides its students toward better futures...

496
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:31,315
through education. That is what a school does!

497
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:32,769
Be quiet.

498
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:37,638
When I decided to become an educator...

499
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,109
Goodness. I'm sick of this.

500
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,408
I made a promise to myself.

501
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,849
Hey, you are so fake.

502
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:46,865
You tell kids that everyone is equal, knowing it isn't true.

503
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:49,148
It's not like you will take care of them for life.

504
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:51,188
You keep making promises you can't even keep.

505
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:52,189
You're a hypocrite!

506
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,628
"Don't become a selfish adult..."

507
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:56,458
"who turns her back on children to pursue her own personal gain!"

508
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,999
Get lost!

509
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,569
You are a narcissist. A hypocrite!

510
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,909
You must be very lonely.

511
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:54,749
Ms. Oh.

512
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:56,649
Ms. Oh, where are you going?

513
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:00,459
(Byeongmun Foundation)

514
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:15,939
Hello.

515
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,109
I'm here to speak to the board...

516
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,579
about Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

517
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,528
What brings you here? You didn't even call.

518
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,838
My bullet was found with Jeong Jae Hyeon's skeleton.

519
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,838
I see.

520
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:05,937
It is evidence that he was killed,

521
00:41:05,938 --> 00:41:07,507
so Jeong Hae Seong won't sit idly by.

522
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,137
We must get rid of him before he does anything.

523
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:10,478
No.

524
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:13,478
Never.

525
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:18,317
Not before I find my gold.

526
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:19,817
Then I'll be put in a difficult position.

527
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:21,988
Director Kim, you are a 50-year-old man.

528
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,858
Figure it out on your own.

529
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,058
I will deal with Jeong Hae Seong.

530
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:30,158
As for the bullet, you deal with it.

531
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:35,068
You can't do this.

532
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:38,138
You...

533
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:40,437
You can't do this to me.

534
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:42,108
What do you mean?

535
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,548
You killed Jae Hyeon.

536
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,894
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

537
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:51,594
You might not remember, but you fired the gun!

538
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:54,618
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

539
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:56,758
Dad!

540
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:58,234
Yes?

541
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:00,828
You need this, your notebook.

542
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:04,998
Thanks, son.

543
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,168
Bye.

544
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:16,838
I'll be home soon.

545
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:28,258
Hey, Jae Hyeon.

546
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,958
Oh, what are you doing here?

547
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:32,388
Nothing much.

548
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:35,158
I wanted to talk to you someplace quiet.

549
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:42,468
Was it you?

550
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:45,714
You're the spy in league with Seo Myeong Ju?

551
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:47,678
You see, here's the thing about life.

552
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:50,008
It all comes down to money.

553
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,348
Considering the amount of gold hidden there,

554
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,418
I hope you can understand.

555
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,958
Oh! Hello, Mr. Kim Jae Yeong.

556
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:08,158
Right. Today, you are here as Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon.

557
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,898
I should've greeted you properly sooner.

558
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:14,168
Just get to the point.

559
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,644
Where is my gold?

560
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,008
Gold?

561
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:20,307
Just tell her where it is, Jae Hyeon.

562
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:21,638
Let's take the easy road.

563
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:24,378
There is no gold.

564
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:26,647
The secret vault built by Seo Byeong Mun, the founder.

565
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,918
It was empty.

566
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,587
Your crazy delusions led you to believe...

567
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:34,258
Jeong Si Hyun is your son's name, right?

568
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:37,218
Stay away from Si Hyun.

569
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:39,558
Stay away from my son!

570
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,828
My gosh. I'm so scared.

571
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:46,428
Let me ask you one last time.

572
00:43:47,068 --> 00:43:48,368
Where is it?

573
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:56,808
Chairwoman Seo.

574
00:43:58,148 --> 00:44:00,224
Then grant me a wish.

575
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:01,454
Go on and tell me.

576
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:03,348
I only have one wish.

577
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:07,248
I want the world to know all about your disgusting corrupt deeds.

578
00:44:08,758 --> 00:44:10,058
What are you doing?

579
00:44:11,628 --> 00:44:13,434
What you so desperately want.

580
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,028
No, don't shoot!

581
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:18,928
You'll never find it.

582
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:21,438
- Oh, no! - Ma'am.

583
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:35,124
What are you doing?

584
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:36,518
Do you want him dead?

585
00:44:38,648 --> 00:44:40,288
That's why I pulled the trigger.

586
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:44,658
The vault is in the school anyway.

587
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:46,958
If I have to let the government confiscate my gold,

588
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:48,458
it's better...

589
00:44:48,798 --> 00:44:50,458
to just kill him now.

590
00:45:40,748 --> 00:45:42,648
- You didn't find him? - We're sorry, sir.

591
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:46,347
I swear, he came in here!

592
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:48,088
- Find him! - Yes, sir.

593
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:50,064
Search every corner!

594
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:51,558
- Go upstairs. - Yes, sir!

595
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:35,468
Son.

596
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,108
I couldn't keep my promise.

597
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:45,908
I'm sorry.

598
00:46:56,118 --> 00:46:57,958
Happy birthday.

599
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:21,018
You killed Jae Hyeon and want me to take the fall for everything?

600
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:23,818
I won't let that happen.

601
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:28,158
Do you have evidence?

602
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:34,958
Evidence to prove that I was the one who shot Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon.

603
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:38,968
Do you have such evidence, Director Kim?

604
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:43,668
No, I do not.

605
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:46,768
But I do have something.

606
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,308
I can testify against you as a living witness.

607
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:53,548
What could you even do with the gold if you find it?

608
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:57,294
Will Edu-City ever be completed when a murderer is behind it?

609
00:47:57,318 --> 00:47:58,818
That will be interesting to watch.

610
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:03,788
Jeong Hae Seong...

611
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:06,828
really wants to know how his father died.

612
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,358
I'm going to tell him, one thing at a time.

613
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:37,258
I think I found a way.

614
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:39,158
I think I found a way.

615
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:40,998
A way to make...

616
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:43,158
Jeong Hae Seong talk.

617
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:14,298
Darn it!

618
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,589
(Jeong Hae Seong)

619
00:49:21,613 --> 00:49:22,968
Shoot.

620
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:29,438
What's up?

621
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,878
How does it feel to be dumped by Seo Myeong Ju?

622
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:33,748
What are you on about?

623
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:35,918
(Jeong Hae Seong)

624
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:37,948
If you testify,

625
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:39,918
we can take down Seo Myeong Ju.

626
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:43,558
Show you have some humanity left.

627
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,498
Let's meet in person.

628
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,728
I have a lot to tell you.

629
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:25,098
Director.

630
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:55,928

631
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:59,693

632
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,214
(Byeongmun High)

633
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:11,814
(Byeongmun High, for whom...)

634
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:20,397

(Crushing dreams)

639
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:41,703
Hey, open the door.

640
00:52:41,704 --> 00:52:43,174
Open the door right now!

641
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:47,104
- Get him out. - Come on out.

642
00:52:47,404 --> 00:52:49,274
Drop the knife!

643
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:51,214
Drag him out.

644
00:52:53,514 --> 00:52:56,354
You're being arrested at the site of Kim Hyung Bae's murder.

645
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:58,054
You can hire a lawyer,

646
00:52:58,354 --> 00:52:59,984
explain yourself,

647
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,900
and refuse to incriminate yourself.

648
00:53:01,924 --> 00:53:03,254
- Take him away. - Okay.

649
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:09,534
(Police)

650
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,206
The final exams are coming up.

651
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,516
Talk to the students...

652
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,270
so they don't loosen up.

653
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,680
- This month's dinner... - Ms. Oh.

654
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,720
Yu Jeong. What...

655
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,819
This morning, ex-NIS agent Jeong...

656
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,889
was arrested...

657
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,290
on-site for the murder of his superior Kim.

658
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,929
Jeong had had a grudge against Kim...

659
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,776
because of his recent dismissal.

660
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,946
They met last night and the argument escalated,

661
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,999
resulting in Jeong reportedly stabbing him...

662
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,770
- with a knife he'd brought. - No way.

663
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,569
- Police... - Hae Seong!

664
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,109
requested an autopsy...

665
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,649
to identify Kim's cause of death,

666
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,049
- How come... - while questioning...

667
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,050
a warrant for Jeong's arrest.

668
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,720
Find any proof you can...

669
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,960
focusing on last night's movements.

670
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,830
Hae Seong ended up like that...

671
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,230
because something happened last night.

672
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,200
- Get to it. - Yes, sir.

673
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,920
Sir.

674
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,860
- Yeong Hun. - Yes?

675
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,790
- You found something? - A recording.

676
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,206
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

677
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,916
You might not remember, but you fired the gun!

678
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,816
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

679
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,270
Do you have evidence?

680
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,310
Let's go.

681
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,890
I get it now.

682
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,159
He heard this and went to see Director Kim.

683
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,030
Where he fell into a trap?

684
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,776
Secure all exits...

685
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,199
and take all you can find.

686
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,229
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

687
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,976
Get Seo Myeong Ju's recording.

688
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,730
Take all that.

689
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:52,639
We're executing...

690
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,186
a search and seizure warrant at Jeong Hae Seong's residence.

691
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,979
I need you three to come with us...

692
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,079
to give a statement.

693
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,250
- Get to it. - No, wait.

694
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,720
What's the rush?

695
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,796
You brought a lot of boxes.

696
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,189
Let me help. Come this way.

697
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,159
This could become obstruction.

698
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,189
Get started!

699
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,259
- Let us through. - I can help.

700
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,389
Please cooperate.

701
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,066
- Take your time. - Let us in.

702
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,760
Coming through.

703
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,159
Get out of the way.

704
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,530
- Fine. - Come in.

705
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,800
My leg cramped up.

706
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,940
Wait.

707
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,050
What...

708
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,420
You can go now. Okay?

709
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,236
Guys. Search the second floor thoroughly too.

710
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,606
- Let's go. - Okay.

711
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,930
After you.

712
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,229
Let's get going. To the police station.

713
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,516
- Okay. - Go on.

714
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,769
This was found...

715
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,410
during the search of Jeong Hae Seong's home.

716
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,786
It contains a recording of your conversation...

717
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,050
with Director Kim.

718
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,120
I can't let my guard down with him.

719
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,819
Tell Detective Cho he did well...

720
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,760
and pay him handsomely.

721
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,406
What do you plan to do with Jeong Hae Seong?

722
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,500
We set a trap and caught him.

723
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,740
Let's open him up.

724
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,580
We'll see if my gold appears or not.

725
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,780
I'm hungry.

726
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,990
I want food.

727
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,720
Seolleongtang, please.

728
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,230
He's a psycho.

729
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,030
Hey.

730
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,830
Order him a seolleongtang.

731
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,870
They got Hae Seong?

732
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,800
The police are questioning him.

733
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,440
Mom. Do you know anyone...

734
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,039
Who are you calling?

735
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,210
We can't just sit and wait. Let's break him out of there.

736
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,949
Yes, it's me.

737
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,150
Get all the boys and...

738
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,466
Let's break free from the age of violence.

739
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,049
We should do something.

740
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,920
We can't let innocent Hae Seong suffer.

741
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,100
If you'd come a bit earlier, we could've eaten together.

742
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,870
We meet again so soon.

743
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,750
Let's see what state you're in.

744
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,279
Not too bad.

745
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,220
I'm not easily intimidated.

746
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,720
- So full of energy. - Because I'm not guilty.

747
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,390
You know that.

748
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,530
Too much hope...

749
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,030
makes you miserable.

750
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,606
"Everything's fine. Nothing will go wrong."

751
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,330
"I can win as long as I don't give up."

752
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,370
Hope...

753
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,116
is evil.

754
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,270
Because it prolongs suffering,

755
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,940
of all the evil in the world,

756
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,940
hope is the worst.

757
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,420
Many years ago,

758
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,420
I met someone just like you.

759
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,420
He was so stubborn,

760
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,660
he ended up dead in a vault.

761
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,000
How dare you mention my father?

762
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,170
Where did you hide my gold?

763
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,100
Tell me.

764
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,470
Do you want to go down a murderer?

765
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,149
Why do you think I have it?

766
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,150
Because you have it.

767
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
Chairwoman Seo, you've become a monster.

768
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,866
What made you like this?

769
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,260
The chosen people...

770
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:44,730
have a duty and responsibility to care about education.

771
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,130
The next 100 years?

772
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,440
I'll raise up those who will run our nation.

773
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,869
That's my dream.

774
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,246
What of the people who died for that pipe dream?

775
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,609
Stepping on a few insects is nothing...

776
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,640
when you're on a long journey.

777
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,150
That's not a dream.

778
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,620
It's a desire and obsession. You pitiful woman.

779
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,420
You're pitying me when you're in that seat?

780
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,690
I'll ask you again.

781
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,930
My gold.

782
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,130
Where is it?

783
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,330
It's in your pipe dream.

784
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,740
It must be in your blood.

785
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,210
Bad things can be inherited.

786
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,480
Okay.

787
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,579
Do you know where I'll go as soon as I leave?

788
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,126
I'll go to Yu Jeong.

789
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,350
I'll cut off a finger and send it to you.

790
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,466
Then you'll call me in tears.

791
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,119
You'll beg me to stop and to see you.

792
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,689
You'll offer to tell me anything.

793
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,690
But I won't stop...

794
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:51,530
until all the people you care about become miserable.

795
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,769
Don't touch anyone else.

796
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,440
You'd be dead if I so much as touched you.

797
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,740
I swear I'll take you down.

798
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,350
We have a friendship of sorts.

799
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,580
For that, I'll give you one day.

800
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,820
Think hard tonight...

801
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,750
and then call me tomorrow.

802
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,790
My number's the same.

803
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,600
Let's eat when you get out.

804
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:33,934

(Warm and trustworthy Sangan police)

806
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,910
Sorry in advance.

807
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,580
- It'll hurt a bit. - What?

808
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,950
You punk.

809
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,820
You...

810
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,820
Darn you.

811
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,160
Shoot.

812
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,330
Stop it!

813
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,140
Darn you!

814
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,210
Let go!

815
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,550
Pull over.

816
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,620
Pull over.

817
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,430
How in the world...

818
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,860
Okay.

819

820
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,210
See you later.

(Police Say Ex-NIS Agent Jeong Planned Murder)

822
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,160
Hello?

823
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,730
- It's me. - Is that you, Hae Seong?

824
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,170
Where are you?

825
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,670
What happened? You got out?

826
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,540
Su A.

827
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,980
I'm sorry.

828
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,780
I need your help.

829
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,780
Hae Seong. Where are you?

830
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,220
I'll come over.

831
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:40,726
Where are you?

832
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,120
Hae Seong!

833
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,490
Hae Seong!

(Undercover High School)

835
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,646
No one knows what she'll do to those around me.

836
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,540
I'll go after Seo Myeong Ju.

837
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,709
Only one thing in the whole world is impartial.

838
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,210
Do you know what that is?

839
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:35,910
It's death.

840
01:07:35,911 --> 01:07:37,316
You said you'd protect the kids.

841
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,956
Go and protect them.

842
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,480
I have a condition.

843
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,480
I'll resign and willingly.

844
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,026
She went against you to protect us.

845
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,020
You inferior fools.

846
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:48,866
We'll all die together.

847
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,119
What are you doing?

848
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,319
No. Seo Myeong Ju!

01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,966
Hae Seong.

851
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,660
I came to say this.

852
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,200
I'll miss you.
