Let me...

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,230
Let me first call the cops.

6
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,469
Don't.

7
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,770
These aren't human remains. It's plastic.

8
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,910
Who's there?

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,050
I was wondering why the door was open.

10
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,780
What are students doing in here?

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,050
Principal Park.

12
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,530
It's a skeleton model.

13
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,799
We came to see if the
ghost story was true...

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,970
and stumbled upon it.

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,630
- What ghost story?
- They say this place is haunted.

16
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,539
The ballet studio, to be exact.

17
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,810
Who would do such a thing?

18
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,310
Actually, when we got here...

19
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,919
We don't know.

20
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,519
I apologize for trespassing.

21
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:01,949
It won't happen again.

22
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,660
You'd better behave yourselves.

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,059

25
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,319
(Byeongmun High School)

26
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,590
Why did you stop me from telling him?

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,500
About that person who was here before us.

28
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,659
We don't know for sure who it was.

29
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,769
I thought telling him would
only make things worse.

30
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,930
Who do you think it was?

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,810
Time will tell.

32
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,810
Byeongmun High's school
uniform from the 1950s,

33
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,978
the ballet studio,

34
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,449
a skeleton model missing legs, and a tutu.

35
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,988
The scene was staged...

36
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,649
to perfectly fit the ghost
story of the old building.

37
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,620
Why though?

38
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,859
And who?

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,329
This is a key I found next to the skeleton.

40
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,600
Look at the seal on it.

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,539
It's a perfect match with Seo Byeong Mun's.

42
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,940
What we should especially
focus on is the phrase on its side.

43
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,710
It translates to "The
beginning of the gold bar."

44
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,350
The character itself
doesn't mean "bar" though.

45
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,719
Doesn't that mean odd or bizarre?

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,448
It's used to make up
the word for "ghost story."

47
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,919
Are you saying...

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
there's a connection between
the ghost story and the gold bars?

49
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,430
As of now, yes.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,359
The ghost story itself is the
key to finding the gold bars?

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,728
Seo Byeong Mun who hid the gold bars...

52
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,229
set up the ghost story as a riddle.

53
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,439
One must solve the ghost story...

54
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,910
to gain access to the gold bars.

55
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,879
As of now, there are more
questions than answers.

56
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,950
However, I'm certain of two things.

57
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,809
A...

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,320
We must find the gold bars before
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju does.

59
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,189
B...

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,689
Now that we know that the gold
bars and the ghost story are related,

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,059
we must focus on that story.

62
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,359
Including the one of the old building,

63
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:25,760
Byeongmun High has
four ghost stories in total.

64
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,770
Please approve of my
investigation into them.

65
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,270
Get on it.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
Find out about the other stories first.

67
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,640

The ballet studio?

70
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,909
Why there?

71
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,519
They were there to see
if it was really haunted,

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,820
and in the process,

73
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,950
they stumbled upon a
model of human remains.

74
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,289
A ghost story?

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,700
Oh, dear. My gosh.

76
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,070
That thought never even crossed my mind.

77
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,799
A ghost...

78
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,570
How amusing!

79
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,580
I can't believe that man.

80
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,619
He's an odd one. I give you that.

81
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,688
Ghost stories related to this school?

82
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,729
How should I wrap up this transgression?

83
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:30,890
For now,

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,499
we'll let them be.

85
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,200
No one knows the school
better than the students.

86
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,239
An unexpected solution
might present itself.

87
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,280
Why do you want to know
about the school ghost stories?

88
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:50,410
What happened last night has me intrigued.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,280
Spill, will you?

90
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:55,520
You really must like this kind of thing.

91
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,789
I thought that was only for people like me.

92
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:00,989
And what kind of person would that be?

93
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,960
Someone with no connections and no friends.

94
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,900
A loner and loser who
writes weird web novels.

95
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,770
Hey.

96
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,369
As if there's anything wrong with you.

97
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,739
Besides, friends are overrated.

98
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,010
Once you graduate,
it's you against the world.

99
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,350
We're all by ourselves.

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,280
As if you'd know.

101
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:28,890
That's just how it is.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,419
Anyway, what's the next ghost story?

103
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,999
Are you trying to make the ground give way?

104
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,140
What are you thinking so deeply about?

105
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,439
It's nothing.

106
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,950
What's your take on me?

107
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,150
Do I seem clueless to you?

108
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,720
I can't say you're quick to notice things.

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,030
Why? Did something happen?

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,559
Wouldn't you like to know?

111
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,070
Hello, Ms. Choi. Have you been well?

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,839
Yes, I have. I'm sorry to bother you,

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,780
but I called about my ID
that the school needed.

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,178
I was wondering when I'd get it back.

115
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,910
The school asked for your ID?

116
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,020
Dong Min's friend said so yesterday.

117
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,789
Dong Min was receiving a
scholarship and my ID was needed.

118
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,660
His friend as in who?

119
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,288
Jeong Hae Seong.

120
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,530
Jeong Hae Seong?

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,928
Apart from the story
about the old building,

122
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,629
there are three others.

123
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,739
And one of them is about this.

124
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,609
The grandfather clock.

125
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,580
People think it's broken
because it doesn't chime,

126
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:04,080
but it does so now and again.

127
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,080
When you're the only one left...

128
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,519
in the school building.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,219

most terrified about.

Crimson eyes?

135
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,639

two students in school...

136
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,540
You're busted.

137
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,978

140

Ms. Oh, please. That hurts.

141
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,560
Give it to me straight.

142
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,159
Why did you take Dong
Min's grandmother's ID?

143
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:50,790
Her ID?

144
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,359
Is it over if you don't bring it?

145
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:55,100
Why do you want my grandma's ID?

146
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,940
You almost had me fooled.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,970

It'd be faster for you to see it yourself,

184
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,889
so I'll send his info and photo.

185
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,100
Okay, thanks.

186
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,339

here's his info and photo.)

189
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,859
What's taking him so long?

190
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,869
Ms. Oh, I'm sorry,

191
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,440
but I left the stove on at home.

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,340
I need a drink.

193
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,190
Here you go. You seem exhausted.

194
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,220
Goodness, how sweet
of you. I'll enjoy this.

195
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,359
You must not have gotten
a lot of sleep last night.

196
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,600
Maybe it's because you
were at the old building.

197
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,440
You're the one who threw...

198
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,100
the hammer at me.

199
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,310
That is one wild accusation.

200
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,009
Why would I go there...

201
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,710
when I could piss off the principal.

202
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,940
The tracksuit you wore last night...

203
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,450
How about a wager?

204
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,590
Did you or did you not
scrape your leg on a nail?

205
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,129
The unused sealed entrance
at the back of the old building.

206
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,529
That's how you got in and out.

207
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,889
I only have one question.

208
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,060
What were you doing in there?

209
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,129
You probably knew about
the fake human remains.

210
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,469
- They're fake? - So you didn't know.

211
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,210
Goodness me.

212
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,238
I thought it was real.

213
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,639
Do you have any idea
how shocked I was at first?

214
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,850
What kind of psycho...

215
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,420
Goodness.

216
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,018
The first time I discovered the remains,

217
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,359
I mean, the fake skeleton,

218
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,129
was when I was feeding the cat.

219
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,159
You must've been hungry.

220
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,739
Tasty, isn't it?

221
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,139
Nabi.

222
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,979
Nabi?

223
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,779
Nabi?

224
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,850
Nabi.

225
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,919
I was aware of the ghost
story regarding the old building...

226
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,489
and went to check it out out of boredom.

228
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,739
Kids?

229
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,379
What could I do?

230
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,679
I was terrified...

231
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:31,679
and couldn't say anything
for fear of losing my job.

232
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:34,519
Last night, I went back to
hammer the floorboards back in...

233
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,989
when you scared the life out of me.

234
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,189
That's why I swirled the hammer at you.

235
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,060
That's all.

236
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,859
Did you see anything suspicious
the first time you saw the skeleton?

237
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,330
I'll take any minor details.

238
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,100
I'm not sure.

239
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,969
I don't remember anything else.

240
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:55,369
By the way, who made you a detective?

241
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,009
Why are you asking me this?

242
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,209

We're good, then.

245
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,849
Don't forget your tetanus shot.

246
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,020
Or you could be in trouble.

(Byeongmun High School)

248
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,260
You won't tell the school, will you?

249
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,990
You have to keep it between us.

250
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,500
Why was the security guard...

251
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,770
in the old building?

252
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,969
I didn't find anything
suspicious about him.

253
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,770
Then why did he run?

254
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,310
He didn't want to be
seen in a restricted area.

255
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,790
I have to ask though.

256
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,419
Why are we here?

257
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,629
Isn't it obvious? We're here for a meeting.

258
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,790
I get it, but why a sandwich place?

259
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,358
Welcome.

260
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,599
I'll take a sandwich and coke.

261
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,040
Got it. Please have a seat.

262
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,570
- You heard her. - One sandwich and coke.

263
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,139
What on earth...

264
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,810
I'll cut right to the chase.

265
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,809
This will be...

266
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,619
the headquarters for Domestic Team Four.

267
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,148
- What? - Since we're supporting you,

268
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,918
we figured it'd be better...

269
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,119
to be closer to the scene.

270
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,159
I get that, but this isn't like the movies.

271
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,688
What about the person who ran this place?

272
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,500
He'll be vacationing in
the US until we're done.

273
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,830
I paid for it with my pension.

274

Does Yu Jeong know?

276
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,010
I agreed to raise her
allowance by 100 dollars.

277
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,980

278
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,678

280
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,750
Meanwhile, at school...

281
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,820
This is a serious issue.

282
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,520
Be at the counselling office after school.

283
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:53,760
Nothing's going on.

284
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,800
If you're going to give me an excuse,

285
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,469
at least let it be decent.

286
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,129
You left your stove on?

287
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,510
Your stove?

288
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,740
That's something I didn't expect.

289
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:17,250
Just wait till I see you
in school tomorrow.

290
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,949
You'll be begging for mercy!

291
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,040
You've finally lost your mind.

292
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,310
What do you want back?

293
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,709
Give back my grandma's ID.

294
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,050
Unbelievable.

295
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,879
I know you took it,

296
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,479
so before I call the cops...

297
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,750
Shut up.

298
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,459
Hey, get up.

299
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,399
Get up.

300
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,469
Hey.

301
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,399
You've got some balls.

302
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,300
Why have you been challenging me lately?

303
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,010
Dong Min, let's stick to how things were.

304
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,379
Give it back.

305
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,550
Just target me, okay?

306
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Leave my grandma out of this.

307
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,919
Darn it.

308
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,859
Fine. Whatever.

309
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:39,359
I don't need it. Take it.

310
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,040
It'd be no fun to give it back for free.

311
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
Our aspiring writer is
right-handed, is he not?

312
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,750
From now on, you'll be a lefty.

313
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,090
What are you doing?

314
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,869
Hello, Ms. Oh.

315
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,669
I asked you a question.

316
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,439
What are you doing here?

317
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
I just got here myself.

318
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,850
Dong Min, are you all right?

319
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,780
What's wrong?

320
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:35,850
I saw it all.

321
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:37,949
Park Tae Soo,

322
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,990
wait for me at the counselling office.

323
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,790
I told you to go.

324
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,600
Should I call your parents?

325
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Goodness.

326
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,070
What a joke.

327
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,840
Ms. Oh.

328
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,909
Just look the other way.

329
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,070
You're only a temp, so act like it.

330
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:05,879
Darn.

331
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:11,619
Ms. Oh, I'll leave it at this
since you look pretty today.

332
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,689
Don't let this be a habit.

333
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,810
Dong Min.

334
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:34,179
Has this been going on for a while?

335
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,820
Your grandmother called.

336
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,659
- Was it Tae Soo who... - No, Ms. Oh.

337
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,230
Tae Soo and I were only messing around,

338
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,469
and I'm fine.

339
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,699
I'm sorry for putting you in this spot.

340
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,270
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,429
Shoot.

342
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:30,800
Give it to me straight.

343
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,469
Why did you take Dong
Min's grandmother's ID?

344
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,479
Hey, Hae Seong.

345
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,619
Are you alone?

346
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,959
Is there something you need me to do?

347
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,459
Look into something for me.

348
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,829
Park Tae Soo, Class 1 of Grade 11...

349
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,590
If anything like this happens again,

350
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,359
the mission will be called off.

351
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,199
You joined the NIS to follow
in your father's footsteps.

352
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,369
What will you say to him
when you finally locate him?

353
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,369
That you got fired for botching a mission?

354
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,070
Hello?

355
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,609
It's nothing. Forget I said anything.

356
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,549
Old lady, get out of my way!

357
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,889
Goodness me. I'm terribly sorry.

358
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,790
I don't appreciate the
racket, so keep it down.

359
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,699
Sorry.

360
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,669
I didn't want you to be
late for your study group.

361
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,438
Come on. Move out of the way.

362
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,469
Goodness.

363
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:44,939
My gosh.

364
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,820
I'm sorry about that.

365
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,129
Thank you for this.

366
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,859
He sure is an oddball.

367
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,569
It's dangerous out here,
so let's get out of the street.

368
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,770
Let's go that way.

369
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,719
Thank you, young man.

370
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,159
You made the trip home easy for me.

371
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,458
Can I get you something to drink?

372
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,560
It's fine, ma'am. I'll be on my way.

373
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:43,899
Grandma!

374
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,500
Dong Min, you're home.

375
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,439
- Goodness. - What's going on?

376
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,709
Why are you two together?

377
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,679
Is he your friend?

378
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,879
A friend of yours?

379
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,219
Hold on a second.

380
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:10,490
I'm giving you this in the hopes
of you being a good friend to him.

381
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,659
Grab something delicious to eat.

382
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,330
Grandma, come on. Two
dollars gets you nowhere.

383
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,069
You can't even buy a bag of chips.

384
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,240
Is that so?

385
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,139
Oh, dear.

386
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:26,609
But that's all I have.

387
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:28,340
This is more than enough, ma'am.

388
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,280
I'll spend it wisely.

389
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,919
- Goodness. - I'll get going, then.

390
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,090
See you tomorrow.

391
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,520
Good night.

392
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Hae Seong.

393
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,129
Thanks for helping out my grandma.

394
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,399
I considered it a workout.

395
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,669
Besides, it's no big deal.

396
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:00,010
I overheard what happened earlier today...

397
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,149
when Ms. Oh approached you.

398
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,320
I should've told her...

399
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,250
that it wasn't you who
took my grandma's ID,

400
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,290
but I didn't know how to say it.

401
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:15,619
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,290
There's no need to apologize.

403
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,060
It was Tae Soo, wasn't it?

404
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:24,969
Yes.

405
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
But I'm done worrying about him.

406
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:32,409
I got the ID back anyway.

407
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,750
If that's what you want.

408
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,750
Head on in. Your grandma must be waiting.

409
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,928
- Your phone. - My phone?

410
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,230
Give it here already.

411
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,340
It's my number. Save it.

412
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,709
Call me if anything happens.

413
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,219
I can't believe I'm saying this to a guy.

414
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,550
I'm really off now.

415
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,169
(Hae Seong)

416
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,379
So, it was Tae Soo
who did that to Dong Min.

417
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,719
We should tell the vice-principal, right?

418
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,179
Hey, don't even.

419
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,020
As if he'd listen to us.

420
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,118
He's trying so hard to build connections...

421
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,919
to get the principal title.

422
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,629
Then what do we do about Dong Min?

423
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,770
Just turn a blind eye to it.

424
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:10,709
What?

425
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,239
Tae Soo's father is a
three-term assemblyman,

426
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,540
and he's on the parent board.

427
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,379
Besides, you know how
things are done at this school.

428
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:21,080
They're categorized based
on what their parents do.

429
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:22,790
The school only cares
about important people's kids.

430
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,119
Then let's submit a petition
to the Office of Education.

431
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,020
You're so naive.

432
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,290
And shouldn't you
worry about yourself first?

433
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,000
Ms. Oh, don't you want
a permanent position?

434
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:39,540
Let's just turn a blind
eye to it this time.

435
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,070
Make a wise decision.

436
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,159
Seriously, what am I supposed to do?

437
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:25,879
(Start)

438
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,330
It's me, Dong Min.

439
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,888
To tell you the truth,

440
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:41,230
I didn't have anyone's
number, except for Tae Soo's.

441
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,169
So, thanks.

442
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,939
Hello.

443
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,059
I grabbed this first.

444
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,429
No, I beat you by a split second.

445
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,790
I guess you live around here.

446
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,428
Yes, I guess you live around here too.

447
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,260
I don't really want it to be known.

448
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,300
As if I wanted to know.

449
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:19,300
Are you going to keep talking back to me?

450
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,969
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong. Get it together.

451
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,669
You're a student, and I'm your teacher!

452
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,129
You took your hand off, so it's mine.

453
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:50,869
Darn it!

454
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:55,539
(Corn Silk Tea)

455
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,269
The owner stocked the shelf again.

456
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,369
It's buy-1-get-1-free. Thanks for this.

457
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,149
You knew about Tae Soo
and Dong Min, didn't you?

458
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,290
You knew about it but couldn't tell me...

459
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,959
because you couldn't trust me, right?

460
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,699
Dong Min asked me not to tell anyone.

461
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,368
About his grandma's ID and everything else,

462
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:31,709
I'm sorry for getting the wrong idea.

463
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,149
About your situation too.
Sorry for not catching on sooner.

464
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,679
So, what's next?

465
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:46,290
Now that you know everything,

466
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:48,860
what do you plan to do?

467
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,339
What's this?

468
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,310
Dong Min's grandma gave it to me,

469
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,449
hoping I'd stay friends with Dong Min.

470
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,449
I don't deserve this.

471
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,190
You can work on it.

472
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,400
You kind of look like him.

473
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:06,969
- Who? - Just someone.

474
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:08,900
Someone who's like my sworn enemy.

475
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,239
What did he do to become your sworn enemy?

476
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:16,179
Eat up.

477
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,549
I sure will.

478
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,449
Who is it?

479
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,650
We're from Gangnam Police.

480
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,619
Ms. Choi Bok Sun lives here, right?

481
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,560
What is this about?

482
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,330
Is she inside?

483
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:32,830
I am Choi Bok Sun.

484
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,298
You're police officers?

485
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,129
We were investigating
an illegal gambling website,

486
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,529
and your name came up.

487
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,170
They said you were running the site.

488
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:40,868
Take her.

489
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:41,969
- Wait, but... - Hold on!

490
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,670
There must have been some misunderstanding.

491
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,810
Take her.

492
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,580
What? Why are you doing this to me?

493
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,408
Dong Min.

494
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,380
- Grandma! - Come on.

495
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,948
Dong Min!

496
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,980
Why on earth are they doing this to me?

497
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,419
- Grandma! - Seriously!

498
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,690
That's enough. Go back inside, okay?

499
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Grandma!

500
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,560
It's getting late. Where's your place?

501
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,999
Near those houses over there...

502
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,529
You live in a rooftop room near the school.

503
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,130
Do you live in a house?

504
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,238
No, in a rooftop room across the street.

505
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,270
It's close.

506
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,810
Hey, Dong Min.

507
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,889
What?

509
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,630
Dong Min, what happened?

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Ms. Oh.

(Bet Amount: 8,000 dollars)

513
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,210
This is why gambling is so dangerous.

514
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,350
Why do people think
they can win this money?

Hey, you.

519
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,869
Can I borrow 20,000 dollars from you?

520
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:28,880
Spare me a moment, Ms. Oh. This way.

521
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,350
I'll be right back, Dong Min.

522
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,749
She was running a gambling site?

523
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,989
What is going on?

524
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,989
I bet this is connected to Park Tae Soo.

525
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,500
Ms. Choi's ID.

526
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,429
At this rate, Ms. Choi might
end up getting arrested.

527
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:52,770
That's crazy.

528
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,670
The police must know she's not the one.

529
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,239
But all the evidence says it was her.

530
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,139
This is no longer a school bullying issue.

531
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,549
This is a serious crime,

532
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,250
and someone should step in.

533
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:20,259
Me?

534
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,029
This isn't right.

535
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,969
What should I do now?

536
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:27,600
Darn it. This isn't right. This is wrong!

537
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
What do I do?

538
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,839
I should take sick leave.

539
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,909
Yes, I'm going to take
sick leave. That's it.

540

had a positive COVID-19 test.

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,948
(Im Yoon Chul)

546
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,618
This crazy punk.

547
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,088
Why is he calling at this important moment?

548
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:21,190
(Im Yoon Chul)

549
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,830
What is it?

550
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,389
What?

551
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,669
Hey, guys!

552
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,798
Did you see the
discussion board? It's nuts.

553
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,439
- Someone ratted on Tae Soo. - What?

554
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,909
- What is it? - Look at this. Come here.

555
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,040
Look, the discussion board.

556
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,739
- My, Tae Soo is doomed now. - Amazing.

557
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:45,178
- Goodbye, Tae Soo. - Oh, my.

558
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,749
- He was so mean. - He's done for.

559
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,218
- Honestly, this is all true.
- I know, seriously.

560
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:51,189
- Who wrote this? - You reap what you sow.

561
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,488
As they say, "Reward good and punish evil."

562
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:55,520
- Totally. - Tae Soo is doomed now.

563
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,258
Who did this?

564
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,229
Who posted something like
this on the discussion board?

565
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,129
Look, what is this?

566
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,369
Tae Soo bullied Dong Min?

567
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,130
And what? Illegal gambling?

568
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,908
Are these punks trying
to shut the school down?

569
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:10,940
This is...

570
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Hold on.

571
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,179
Was it perhaps...

572
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,150
one of the teachers?

573
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,520
Ms. Oh?

574
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:31,630
Did you write this, by any chance?

575
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,069
Who did this?

576
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,770
Who dared...

577
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,179
to disgrace the great Byeongmun
High like this? What a traitor!

578
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,778
- Was it you? - No, it wasn't me.

579
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,318
- I bet it was you. - No.

580
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,818
- It was you, Mr. Baek.
- No, it was not me.

581
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,219
- Ms. Oh, please calm down. - No.

582
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,389
I cannot let this slide.

583
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:03,019
If it concerns you, then I'm concerned too.

584
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,230
If it involves the school,
then it's my problem too!

585
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,400
Who dared to upset our
vice-principal like this?

586
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:09,699
Mark my words.

587
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,028
I will be sure to find out who did this.

588
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:14,068
I promise I will bring
the traitor's head to you.

589
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:15,698
No, you don't need to do that.

590
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,138
Please calm down. Come here.

591
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,539
- How can I calm down right now?
- Well, get back here.

592
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,739
This way. Yes.

593
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,849
- For you, I'll calm down and...
- Yes, it's okay.

594
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,549
Good. Thank you.

595
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,649
Anyway, we'll need Tae
Soo and Dong Min's parents...

596
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,149
to come in tomorrow for a meeting.

597
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,519
Chairwoman Seo will meet with them.

598
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,290
Ms. Oh, please calm down
and contact the parents.

599
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,230
- So, that's what we're doing?
- Yes, that's right.

600
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:41,730
Got it, sir.

601
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,599
- I'll sit down. - Yes, please sit.

602
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,940
(Byeongmun High School)

603
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,869
When we catch this person,
we'll teach them a serious lesson.

604
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,339
All right, then. Get
back to work, all of you.

605
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:01,319
It was you, wasn't it?

606
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:03,619
Was it that obvious?

607
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:06,150
A little bit? About 51 percent?

608
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,689
Fifty-one percent?

609
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,259
What will you do if you get caught?

610
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,259
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

611
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,560
I will worry about tomorrow
when tomorrow comes.

612
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,330
Go back to your desk.

613
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,009
"The traitor's head!"

614
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:27,540
- I shall behead the traitor! - Goodness.

615
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,080
Oh Su A.

616
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:46,759
Thank you.

617
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,799
Who knew the situation
would unfold like this?

618
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,540
Isn't it the first time Chairwoman
Seo is meeting with parents?

619
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,569
I knew Park Tae Soo would end up like this.

620
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:59,469
He brought it upon himself,
so let him figure out what to do.

621
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:01,980
What will we do about Jeong Hae Seong?

622
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,779
Right, at the cafeteria.

623
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,048
I know Tae Soo is a jerk,

624
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,279
but he is a member of the student council.

625
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,850
He humiliated Tae Soo in front of everyone.

626
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,250
We can't let him get away with it.

627
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,960
Why not? I liked it. It
was so manly of him.

628
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,460
Are you jealous because he's good-looking?

629
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,829
Why should we waste time
worrying about that punk?

630
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,100
He seemed a little crazy.
Let's just ignore him...

631
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,270
For now, let's just wait and see.

632
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,509
It's entertaining to have
someone like that at school.

633
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,779
Besides, he piques my curiosity.

634
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,349
This is too bitter. I don't like this.

635
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,420
Oh, one moment.

636
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,829
Sorry, Yu Jeong. We have to go.

637
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,270
We forgot we had to
meet with our study group.

638
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:03,969
Oh, okay.

639
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:05,210
What about you, Yu Jeong?

640
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,440
Well, I'll leave in a bit.

641
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,480
All right, then. See you at school.

642
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,138
Don't worry too much.

643
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:40,339
Everything will be all right.

644
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,440
You did nothing wrong, Grandma.

645
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,710
They'll let you go as soon as the
misunderstanding is cleared up.

646
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:47,380
Did you have dinner?

647
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,250
Yes, of course.

648
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,420
You should never skip a
meal either. Eat well, okay?

649
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,360
I'll get you out of here no
matter what, so hang in there.

650
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,089
You can do it, right?

651
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,199
You, over there.

652
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,400
What are you doing here at this hour?

653
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,869
You can't go in there.

654
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

655
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,639
- I was just... - Hello.

656
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:20,779
Oh, my.

657
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,580
We haven't met before, right?

658
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,610
I'm Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

659
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,920
- I'm Jeong Hae Seong. - I know.

660
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,948
Well, Principal Park told me.

661
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:35,719
Was it a skeleton model?

662
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,130
I heard you and Dong Min were
the ones who found that thing.

663
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:41,100
Yes.

664
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,630
You must be very
interested in the ghost stories.

665
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,439
You broke the rules...

666
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,810
to enter the old building
and even came in here.

667
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,439
I'm sorry. I'm just a curious person.

668
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,580
You're a curious person?

669
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,310
Oh, my. That's great.

670
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,650
I mean, I just...

671
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,790
Well, being curious...

672
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,659
is a great thing, as a person.

673
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,589
But you know what?

674
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,929
The students these days aren't curious.

675
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,069
Well, good for you.

676
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,339
If you ever need my help...

677
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:31,080
or want a counselling session,

678
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:33,949
come to my office.

679
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:35,880
I'm always on the students' side.

680
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,049
Thank you for your
advice. I'll be off, then.

681
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,000
Dong Min.

682
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,049
Thanks for coming
despite your busy schedule.

683
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,589
Dong Min.

684
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,130
Where's your grandmother?

685
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,060
She's still being
investigated by the police.

686
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,060
I'm here instead as his guardian.

687
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,369
Why are we in this mess
because of a stupid post...

688
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,299
anyone could've made?

689
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,739
Did you identify who posted it?

690
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,508
We didn't bother to check.

691
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:08,980
Whether it's a rumour or a fact,

692
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,778
it will be sorted out today.

693
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,709
Even so, this isn't right.

694
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:15,080
Ma'am, why don't you calm down?

695
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,679
Let's hear what the kids say.

696
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,750
Yes, honey. Let's wait.

697
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,219
The chairwoman will handle it just fine.

698
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,589
Why worry?

699
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,060
Lee Dong Min, was it?

700
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,929
I read the online post too.

701
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,270
The assault and stolen ID.

702
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,540
It was full of lies.

703
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,270
Will you explain?

704
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:40,310
Don't mind us at all. Be honest.

705
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,210
Yes.

706
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,650
Tell your side of the story, Dong Min.

707
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,909
This isn't fair at all.

708
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,179
We have been good friends so far.

709
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,350
Why would such a post suddenly appear...

710
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,589
Will you explain the truth?

711
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,799
Dong Min?

712
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,540
The online post.

713
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:16,710
It's a lie.

714
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,210
Dong Min.

715
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,989
Tae Soo...

716
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,989
didn't hit me.

717
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,159
The one who hit me...

718
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,400
was Jeong Hae Seong.

719
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,350
Dong Min.

720
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,360
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?

721
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,529
Will you tell me at least?

722
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:15,170
Why did you suddenly mention Hae Seong?

723
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,179
Say anything tomorrow...

724
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:23,909

It's not? Too bad, then.

730
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:42,630

No.

I don't need your help.

735
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,980
Just keep quiet.

736
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:03,380
Please...

737
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:05,790
don't do anything.

738
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,600
I didn't think this would happen.

739
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,060
Tae Soo framed Hae Seong, right?

740
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:20,670
What will happen to Hae Seong, then?

741
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:22,440
Will he really be expelled?

742
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,810
And I thought school had gotten better.

743
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,610
He will be disciplined, I guess?

Sorry. I have to go.

Yes.

754
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:03,469
I was threatened.

755
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:07,069
He said if I didn't put the blame on you,

756
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,279
my grandma would stay in prison.

757
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:13,580
What else could I do in that situation?

758
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:17,919
I can't fight, my grades
are at rock bottom,

759
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,520
and I'm an outcast and a moron.

760
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,659
What should I do?

761
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:26,130
I tried to think of a way, you know.

762
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:29,698
Should I call the police...

763
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,529
or tell our homeroom teacher or...

764
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:35,040
Should I really...

765
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,739
just stab him to death?

766
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,839
I imagined murdering
him dozens of times a day.

767
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:44,610
I thought prison...

768
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,580
would be nicer than school.

769
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,589
But if I were to do that,

770

Do you know what the worst part is?

772
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,199
That reality isn't a fairy tale.

773
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,568
The wounds and trauma he left me...

774
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:12,670
will ensure I stay a loser forever.

775
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,738
But he'll forget that he bullied me...

776
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,239

01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,588
Sit down!

909
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:15,460
- Look. - It's for real.

910
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,830
No way.

911
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,969
- Who is it? - Who is it?

912
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,679
Who is it?

913
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:31,080
Whoever it is he's dead cool.

914
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,480
Hey, look.

915
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,020
Isn't that Jeong Hae Seong?

916
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,980
Hae Seong!

917
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,049
- It's Hae Seong. - You're awesome!

918
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,389
Hey!

919
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:43,988
Hae Seong!

920
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:45,060
It's Hae Seong!

921
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,460
That lunatic.

922
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:51,230
Move. What is it?

923
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,770
A motorcycle...

924
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,139
He's here. Jeong Hae Seong.

925
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:01,710
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

926
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,409
You look awesome!

927
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,619
- Look over here! - What?

928
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,380
Hae Seong!

929
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:11,819
That crazy...

930
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:13,989
Will you give me a ride?

931
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,690
Hae Seong!

932
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:17,689
Our school is a mess.

933
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,460
- Hae Seong! - Look at him.

934
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,230
- Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

935
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:38,750
You crazy...

936
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:40,449
I'm sorry I'm late.

937
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,130
Shall we begin?

938
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:07,509
(Undercover High School)

939
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:11,310
I'm sorry.

940
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,719
I'm truly sorry.

941
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,318
If you show some mercy...

942
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,489
How can you say that to
my son's messed-up face?

943
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,920
This is why kids without
parents are troublemakers.

944
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:24,588
From what my son said,

945
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:25,860
you're not related to him.

946
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,259
You're just a patron.

947
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,529
I didn't teach him properly.

948
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:31,830
Please show some forgiveness.

949
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:34,839
No. I won't let this go.

950
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,299
Si Hyun.

951
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,139
Say you're sorry.

952
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,610
Why should I?

953
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,309
- Jeong Si Hyun. - They teased me...

954
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,179
for being an orphan and picked on me.

955
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,479
Why should I apologize?

956
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,449
Do you hear what he's saying?

957
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:51,588
He's proving how poorly you taught him!

958
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:52,618
Sir.

959
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:54,249
I want that punk expelled.

960
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,389
I'll drop out.

961
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:00,929
Hey, you. Come back here.

962
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,549
Will you really quit school?

963
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,049
Will you quit school?

964
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,969
Quit if you want to.

965
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:49,940
School isn't the only way
to get a high school diploma.

966
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:52,480
Study at home...

967
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:54,819
and get a GED.

968
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:04,929
Can I do that?

969
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,159
Why not?

970
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,429
I'm on your side.

971
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,440
And...

972
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
I'm sorry.

973
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:28,319
I'm doing my best to fill in for your dad,

974
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:31,850
but it's not easy.

975
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,529
You're doing enough.

976
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,130
I'm grateful.

977
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:52,969
Darn it.

978
01:06:55,009 --> 01:06:57,610
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's get some ramyeon.

979
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,420
Let's go.

980
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:19,429
(Undercover High School)

981
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:43,860
{\an8}If you're asking if I was
violent against Dong Min...

982
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,489
{\an8}No.

983
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,589
{\an8}I didn't do that.

984
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:49,960
{\an8}I just feel like my heart is skipping.

985
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:51,570
{\an8}I'll be careful.

986
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,969
{\an8}No one knows the fourth story.

987
01:07:55,499 --> 01:07:56,569
{\an8}The twin clocks?

988
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,070
{\an8}There were always two.

989
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,240
{\an8}"Student Council recruitment?"

990
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,410
{\an8}Don't join.

991
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:03,039
{\an8}I'll tell everyone who you are.

992
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:04,609
{\an8}He's a loose cannon.

993
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,649
{\an8}He could stir up more ruckus,

994
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,809
{\an8}so keep an eye on him.

995
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,549
{\an8}Hae Seong, there's a problem.

996
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:10,820
{\an8}What?
