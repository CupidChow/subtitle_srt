(Episode 2)

6
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,034
Don't move.

7
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,365
Oh Su A the teacher?

8
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:44,935
Who are you?

9
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,735
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,374
What is she doing here?

11
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,944
Stop! Just don't!

12
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,715
Your hand.

13
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,884
Does this look like a toy?

14
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,023
This is a real tear gas gun, okay?

15
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:05,529
(Patrol)

16
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,525
I told you not to move.

17
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,525
Darn it.

18
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,335
Remove your cap and mask.

19
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:20,805
Hey, you!

20
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,675
Hey!

21
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,444
Shoot.

22
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:30,685
(Keep Out)

23
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,555
Why are you so fast?

24
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:44,194
I was on the track and field team in high school!

25
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,335
Stop right there!

26
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,874
- Oh, dear. - Mister.

27
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,590
- My gosh. - That weird guy...

28
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,944
- A weird guy? - Where'd he go?

29
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:02,613
You didn't see a masked man in a cap?

30
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,015
No.

31
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,184
I'm sorry, sir.

32
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,384
Tell me if you're in pain tomorrow.

33
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,955
Okay?

34
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:18,694
Darn it.

35
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:21,064
He got away.

36
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:24,504
I'll kill him next time.

37
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,784
What?

38
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,485
Were you caught?

39
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,530
You should've been more careful.

40
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't get caught by your own teacher.

41
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,254
Okay. I'll be more careful.

42
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,795
Who'd have thought someone would patrol the place?

43
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,425
What about your face?

44
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:53,041
Did she see it?

45
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,564
Fortunately not.

46
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,004
She's weird, though.

47
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:59,334
She runs like she's a machine.

48
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,380
Like a real Terminator.

49
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:02,745
What?

50
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,105
So what happened? Did you get him?

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,620
No.

52
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:09,545
I lost him, but I almost had him.

53
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,854
Should I have just shot him?

54
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,101
My gosh.

55
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,324
What if you didn't have the tear gas gun?

56
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,593
I told you...

57
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,700
it was dangerous out there and you'd need it.

58
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,194
Yes.

59
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,093
I listened to you and got out alive.

60
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,640
You must be so proud of yourself.

61
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:29,341
If I saved your life,

62
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,305
why don't you help me close up?

63
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,374
I must've had the shock of my life.

64
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,704
I need to go home and rest.

65
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,204
Bye.

66
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,245
It's my fault.

67
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,444
I raised her.

68
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,685
It's such a shame.

69
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:49,155
If I'd caught him,

70
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:52,754
I'd have gotten a citizen's award and become a full-time teacher.

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,324
Please show up once more.

72
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,134
She's so weird. We won't get along.

73
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,564
(Keep Out)

(Byeongmun High School)

75
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,144
Last night, someone broke into the old building.

76
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,424
Ms. Oh came across the intruder...

77
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:07,264
on the first floor and gave chase,

78
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:08,865
but lost him.

79
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,165
She didn't see his face.

80
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,981
See if there were other witnesses.

81
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,305
I will.

82
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,214
Okay.

83
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,685
What should N be if these are to be equal?

84
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,624
It should be nine.

85
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:31,924
That's it for today.

86
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,570
Well done. See you next time.

87
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,665
- Thank you. - Thank you.

88
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:40,264
Why the heck am I studying math at my age?

89
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:42,165
What's wrong with your age?

90
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,504
You have no idea what you're asking.

91
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,944
Here's your first mission, Hae Seong.

92
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,274
Ta-da.

93
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,214
Dong Min's fingers are way too slow.

94
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,184
You have three days.

95
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,954
Get him to max level.

96
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,624
- You can do it, right? - Wait.

97
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,194
I don't know this game.

98
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:10,165
Learn how to play, then.

99
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,510
It's three days. Get to it.

100
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,865
Okay.

101
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,665
Good.

102
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,905
Three days. Good luck.

103
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,884
I know the game.

104
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,884
- Want me to teach you? - How can you say that?

105
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,560
Where's your pride?

106
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:37,485
You want to do this because they say so?

107
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,954
Aren't you a man?

108
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,841
- What? - Max level in a game.

109
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,810
Don't tell sir or Yeong Hun.

110
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,963
Hae Seong, this is the NIS.

111
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,774
Asking me to hack a game to get you to max level...

112
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,374
is crossing the line.

113
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,605
Pretend it's part of the mission.

114
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:58,591
I'm having the worst time here.

115
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,115
Goodbye.

116
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:02,760
Hello? Mi Jeong.

117
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:03,913
Park Mi Jeong.

118
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:07,185
I see you're having a rough time.

119
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,260
You make it max level for me, then.

120
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,655
No, thank you.

121
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,354
You're really impatient.

122
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:17,564
Even before I told you to stay away from Park Tae Soo,

123
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:18,834
you two got involved.

124
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:21,035
I don't know what I'm doing here.

125
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,711
What's the guy like?

126
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,635
He's a typical jerk and bully.

127
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,574
He harasses kids because his dad's an assemblyman.

128
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,744
What about you, Yu Jeong? Are you okay?

129
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,645
Me? I'm...

130
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:37,443
I'm, well... We're both on the student council.

131
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,785
What? You too?

132
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,285
What? You think it's weird?

133
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,255
I heard it was really hard to join.

134
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,964
I'm impressed.

135
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,295
Well, I happened to get accepted.

136
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:56,064
Anyway, beware of Park Tae Soo.

137
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,403
He's a jerk, but he's on the student council.

138
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,374
If you get on their bad side, even I can't help you.

139
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,775
Watch your language.

140
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,005
I smell a nagging old guy.

141
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,244
See you. Stay another five minutes.

142
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:19,094
What? I'm a nag?

143
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,625
Ms. Oh.

144
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,494
- Do you think little of me? - No.

145
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,780
Whom did you see last night?

146
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:31,910
I told you to patrol with an extra dose...

147
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,535
of a sense of duty.

148
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:38,104
Why did you take extra care to lose him?

149
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,714
I apologize.

150
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,614
I promise...

151
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,643
to get him next time.

152
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:46,354
Are you praying for him to reappear?

153
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,614
Enough with the nonsense.

154
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,484
Those reports.

155
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,354
Go through them all and submit a summary.

156
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,265
- All of that? - Is there too many?

157
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,435
I'll do it, then. Let's see.

158
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,981
The job posting for a vacancy at our school...

159
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,375
No, sir.

160
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,474
I'll do it.

161
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,515
I love this kind of work.

162
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:18,614
Good.

163
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,683
It's fine.

164
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:23,824
Ms. Oh was the only witness.

165
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,295
The CCTV cameras didn't catch anything.

166
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:28,231
I see.

167
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:32,140
However, there was some interference in the footage.

168
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,540
An expert says...

169
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,964
it looks like a video jammer was used.

170
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,665
A jammer?

171
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:40,474
What an interesting toy.

172
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,851
If they fled from the first floor,

173
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,675
they didn't get to the basement.

174
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:51,584
The person will be back.

175
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,785
Let's see...

176
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:57,824
what they get up to.

177
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,895
It's that, isn't it?

178
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:05,025
"Workplace bullying."

179
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,864
Discrimination against temporary teachers.

180
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,665
We're to put up with it or become a full-time teacher.

181
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:12,635
The bullying could be because of...

182
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,334
the toupee incident.

183
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:20,045
Things are already rough. The darn intruder...

184
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,714
I wonder.

185
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,645
What was the intruder doing there?

186
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,561
You have a point. There's nothing there.

187
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:31,084
Only he'd know that.

188
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:34,194
There are spooky stories and now an intruder too?

189
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,364
Why won't they just tear down the old building?

190
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,194
"Spooky stories?"

191
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:43,604
There's a ballet studio in the basement over there.

192
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:45,951
Something happened there years ago.

193
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,405
What are you three doing?

194
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:00,484
Oh, no.

195
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,525
I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,423
Play or you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

197
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,464
- There. - Okay.

198
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,594
Rock-paper-scissors.

199
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,064
- Nice one. - Come on.

200
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:13,693
- No. - Please?

201
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:14,834
- Pay up. - Seriously?

202
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,834
- You lost. - But still.

203
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,303
- Why do you need it? - To play games.

204
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:21,304
Hand it over.

205
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,675
Be quiet!

206
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:26,214
Let's start. Turn to page 125.

207
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,015
Did Dong Min go somewhere?

208
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,461
Ms. Oh.

209
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,714
He left early saying he felt sick.

210
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:37,601
Was it Park Tae Soo?

211
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,801
- Who else would it be? - Darn him.

212
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,555
He never mentioned that to me.

213
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:45,640
He said you weren't in the teachers' office...

214
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,640
and asked me to tell you, but I forgot.

215
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:48,994
Sorry.

216
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,805
Okay. Let's start the lesson.

217
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,574
What did we learn last time?

218
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,604
- The Russo-Japanese War. - The Russo-Japanese War.

219
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:59,074
Right. Today we'll touch on the 1905 Protectorate Treaty.

220
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,744
As you all know,

221
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,043
the 1905 Protectorate Treaty...

222
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:06,454
isn't exactly a "treaty" because we were unwilling.

223
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,994
The call cannot be connected.

224
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,334
After the beep, you'll be transferred to...

226

I don't have his number so I can't even call.

227
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:41,015
I'm bothered.

228
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,894
(You are dead.)

229
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:51,765

You there.

237
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,645
Hurry over here.

238
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,331
You could get into huge trouble.

239
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,354
Weren't you told students were to stay away from the building?

240
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:55,523
Some crazy guy was in there last night,

241
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:56,724
and the principal's on edge.

242
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,265
You could get chewed out.

243
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,795
I'll be careful.

244
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:02,380
Just wait until I set eyes on the fool.

245
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,981
Stay away from the old building.

246
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,104
You could get into trouble if you're caught.

247
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,181
Did they hide gold and jewels under the floor?

248
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,104
They make such a fuss of the place.

249
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,974
The eyesore is a headache.

250
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:18,191
I'll go on my way.

251
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,354
Okay. Study hard.

252
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,655

Byeongmun High's principal?

255
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,795
Yes. He went into the basement.

256
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,964
Did you find out what he went there for?

257
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,775
Not exactly.

258
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,275
Something's definitely in the basement.

259
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:44,005
I doubt...

260
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,545
the principal went down there to take a poop.

261
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:50,185
Don't talk about food when we're eating poop.

262
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,714
It's the other way around.

263

264

265

Thanks.

266

Don't you hate how they treat you?

267
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,315
I do.

268
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,284
But there's nothing I can do...

269
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:03,355
other than bear with it.

270
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,895
Don't tell the teacher.

271
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:11,065
It'll make things worse.

272
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,304
You mentioned your grandma's ID.

273
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:19,635
Is that why Tae Soo's bullying you?

274
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,905
That too...

275
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,704
and some other stuff.

276
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,544

283
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,675
What happened?

284
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,875
You left early but didn't answer your phone.

285
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,685
I went to see a doctor and just got back.

286

287
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,685
Why are your clothes dirty?

288
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,825

290
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,734

291
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,435
Stop where you are.

292
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,774

293
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:39,115

295
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,244
You said you wanted to talk to me about something.

296
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,415
Be honest with me.

299
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,124
Fine. Considering the situation earlier,

300
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,831
I understand why you got the wrong idea.

301
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,165
But you see,

302
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,464
I'm not a bully.

303
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:27,034
Then explain what happened.

304
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,834
He left early, so why was he with you?

305
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,964
And what happened to his uniform?

306
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,605
You can't even answer these questions.

307
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:42,014
I knew you'd be trouble when I saw you drinking.

308
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,044
How dare you try to fool me?

309
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,085

- Come here. - What? Why?

313
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,094
- Why... - Hey, come here for a second.

314
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,034

00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,551
Why do you keep dodging me?

318
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,084
I'm sorry. Blame my reflexes.

319
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:53,185
Shut it. I should use my reflexes and smack you.

321
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,655

00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,334
to fire Baek Kwang Du?

369
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:28,204
Then my mom will expel you first.

370
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:33,044
Let's decide on the demerit points for each category.

371
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,915
What's up?

372
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,224
- Goodness. - Hey, you reek of cigarettes.

373
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:46,594
You said you quit smoking.

374
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:48,595
Many smokers quit only to smoke again, you fool.

375
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,665
The transfer student is getting on my nerves.

376
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,463
- Why? What did he do? - Well, he's a weirdo.

377
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:58,105
He went ahead and let Dong Min go without my permission.

378
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,104
Go easy on him. Don't you feel bad for him?

379
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,334
Did you lock him up or something?

380
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,075
Yes, in the recycling bin.

381
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,680
You're crazy.

382
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:09,315
My gosh. He bawled his eyes out as he refused to go in there.

383
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,114
- Do you want to watch the video? - Yes, show me.

384
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,143
Hold on.

385
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:15,054
Did you really have to do that?

386
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:21,595
What did you say?

387
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,071
I mean, I'll be honest.

388
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,665
There's a line you should never cross.

389
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:30,311
Also, the others really hate it when you do stuff like this.

390
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,334
This could negatively impact the student council...

391
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:35,075
My, you're something else.

392
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,175
Who are you to lecture me and tell me what not to do?

393
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:40,743
You're in the student council too, so we let you talk to us.

394
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,244
And you think you're it?

395
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,645
Do you think you're on the same level as us?

396
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:49,061
Hey, what's with you? Don't be so delusional.

397
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,983
We let you join because you're Ye Na's friend, you loser.

398
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,153
- Tae Soo. - What?

399
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:53,824
- You're out of line. - Why? Am I wrong?

400
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,923
She was an outcast and had no friends until last year.

401
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:57,595
Ye Na saved her. Am I wrong?

402
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,565
Hey.

403
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,503
You should thank Dong Min.

404
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:04,564
I'd be picking on you if he weren't around.

405
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:06,435
We heard you, so that's enough.

406
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,274
You're starting to get on my nerves.

407
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:17,713
Hey, stop defending her.

408
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,443
What is this? You're ruining the morale here.

409
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:21,484
Says the one who's actually ruining the morale here.

410
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,900
I agree with everything Yu Jeong said earlier.

411
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,585
Apologize to Yu Jeong.

412
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:35,595
Hey.

413
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:38,105
Isn't your dad seeking a fourth term in the National Assembly?

414
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,534
The party leader dropped by my house yesterday.

415
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,704
I think he and my mom discussed who to nominate.

416
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:50,714
The minute your dad loses his job, you become a loser too.

417
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,185
So, you need to apologize before that happens.

418
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,155
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,494
It's okay.

420
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,415
Hey, Ye Na.

421
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,685
Thanks for doing that earlier.

422
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,743
I had been vying for a chance to tell him off.

423
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:27,784
Tae Soo is a total scumbag, you know.

424
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:32,554
Yu Jeong, but don't step in like that from now on.

425
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,125
How you told Tae Soo to stop being a bully.

426
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:39,524
Let me say those things. It shouldn't come from you.

427
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:43,435
Right, I'm sorry. I'll be careful from now on.

428
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,935
Let's go.

429
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:48,203
(Grade 11)

430
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,504
This is the cut off line.

431
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,781
That's our top one percent.

432
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:53,074
Assemble them...

433
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,214
and create a special class for our top students.

434
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:58,183
We already have a special class. Do you want to split them up?

435
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:01,784
Create the best environment for them to study.

436
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,653
Get ready to manage their extracurricular activities...

437
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:05,624
on top of offering college admissions consultations.

438
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,001
Anyway, they should get more perks than those in the special class.

439
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,064
Ma'am.

440
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:13,470
Many students are complaining about the school's policies.

441
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:17,433
Especially those who aren't in the top ten percent.

442
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:21,804
They don't care about winning the competition.

443
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:26,650
No wonder they aren't in the top ten percent.

444
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:28,890
If we split up the class again...

445
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,460
in the current situation,

446
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,614
more people will complain.

447
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:35,214
Back when black slavery...

448
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:37,923
was a key part of the economy and society in America,

449
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:40,794
many slaves killed their masters and ran away,

450
00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:42,895
so someone wrote a book called...

451
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:45,895
"How to Make a Slave."

452
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:47,694
It's very simple.

453
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:50,864
Create a caste system within the slave community,

454
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,734
clearly differentiate the groups in the slave caste system,

455
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,933
and treat them differently based on their caste.

456
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,075
In other words, drive a wedge...

457
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,614
between the slaves to...

458
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,075
So they'd look at...

459
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,291
who's at their level...

460
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,855
instead of who's above them when they have complaints.

461
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:10,655
We should split up the 90 percent too.

462
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,124
Give it a name that's similar to the special class.

463
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,825
Thirty percent in each class. We'll have three classes in total.

464
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,065
Yes, ma'am. Got it.

465
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,365
(Bulletin Board)

466
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,004
Are you skipping lunch?

467
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,145
I'll eat in a bit.

468
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:37,214
It's embarrassing to eat alone, you know.

469
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:39,585
Okay, suit yourself.

470
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,004
I hate crowds.

471
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,764
Wake me up when you're heading out.

472
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:04,581
Why did you ask me about the old building the other day?

473
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:06,044
Hey, kid. I'm going to sleep.

474
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,915
We're the same age.

475
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:10,344
I'm warning you just in case.

476
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:12,085
You'd be better off staying away.

477
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,784
Especially from the basement.

478
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,615
I know because I've been inside.

479
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,595
If you're curious, I could tell you more...

480
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,565
while we have lunch together.

481
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,405
Let's go. I'm hungry.

482
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,405
Come on. Let's go.

483
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:37,785
Are you not eating?

484
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,754
Well, just go ahead and tell me...

485
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:41,454
why I should stay away from the old building.

486
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:44,355
Before that, if you're not eating...

487
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,025
Here, it's all yours.

488
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:51,164
All yours.

489
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,134
Eat up.

490
00:29:57,864 --> 00:30:00,335
Hae Seong, you're new here, so you probably don't know about...

491
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,105
the spooky stories about that building.

492
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:06,590
Years ago, there were classrooms in the building,

493
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:08,744
and this happened in the ballet studio.

494
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:20,618
There was a girl who dreamed of becoming a ballerina.

495
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:22,743
She practised there every night.

496
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:42,662
Oh, no. That must hurt.

497
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:48,902
She was being bullied by her classmates.

498
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:50,979
One night...

499
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,179
- Hey! - Hey!

500
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,472
Hey, where are you going?

501
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,642
- Stop! - Stop right there!

502
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:56,919
Get her!

503
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:58,012
Stop right there!

504
00:30:58,013 --> 00:30:59,813
- Stop! - We'll catch you!

505
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,692
- Oh, no. - What do we do now?

506
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,993
- Darn it. - What should we do?

507
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,681
(Byeongmun High School)

508
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:04,548
She felt that she'd lost all hopes and dreams and chose to...

509
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,712
- For real. - What are you saying?

510
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:08,213
What do you mean? It's...

511
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:39,618
The girls decided to hide her body...

512
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:41,783
somewhere in the old building...

513
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:48,223
so that no one...

514
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:50,553
would ever find out what they did.

515
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:19,382
Hey.

516
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:21,723
What are you doing here? You should go home.

517
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,422
Hey.

518
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,392
Sir.

519
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,862
I have no legs.

520
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,803
That was when...

521
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:40,601
rumours started to spread that she'd appear every night...

522
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,649
in the studio at the time of her death.

523
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,848
That's an interesting story.

524
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,583
I hope you don't expect me to believe it, though.

525
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,922
You see, I don't believe that stuff.

526
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,223
Come on.

527
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:57,393
I mean, in this day and age... Give me a break.

528
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:00,663
But I saw her.

529
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,808
I told you. I've been inside the building.

530
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:08,433
You actually saw a ghost?

531
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:17,172
(Dance Studio)

532
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:44,893
I swear, I wasn't mistaken.

533
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:47,462
I'm sure it was the ghost people talk about.

534
00:36:02,182 --> 00:36:04,913
Do you want to hear the other spooky stories too?

535
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:07,453
The four spooky stories about Byeongmun High.

536
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:13,192
There are four scary stories about our school.

537
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:15,069
The first one is about the old building,

538
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,562
and the second one is...

539
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,933
Look, the losers are having lunch together!

540
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,709
- What? - What's going on?

541
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:23,973
- Are they talking about Dong Min? - Goodness.

542
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:25,971
(Lee Dong Min)

543
00:36:25,972 --> 00:36:27,373
What if Dong Min is...

544
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:32,473
What if he's going through something?

545
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:35,083
School violence, perhaps?

546
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:37,252
Could he be being bullied?

547
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,453
What if he is being bullied?

548
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:42,752
But who'd bully Dong Min?

549
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:45,529
The transfer student, perhaps?

550
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,763
That's my guess.

551
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:50,263
But then again,

552
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,578
the look on his face tells me that he may not be a bully.

553
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,433
If you're not sure, just observe them for now.

554
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:58,033
And if you get a chance,

555
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:01,272
try talking to Dong Min.

556
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:12,112
I put in some honey to help boost your appetite.

557
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:15,053
- Eat up. - Nice, that looks delicious.

558
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:16,592
Eyes down.

559
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:18,823
Put your phones away.

560
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,808
And you, Dong Min.

561
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:26,561
Why did you crawl out without your master's permission...

562
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:28,163
to be embarrassed like this?

563
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,603
You think you can act out now that you've got a friend?

564
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,373
All right, go on and eat.

565
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:40,583
Hey, if you keep this up, I'll make you drop your pants.

566
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:24,692
Eat it!

567
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,022
Don't eat it.

568
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,603
What did you just say?

569
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:36,632
You keep crossing the line.

570
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:40,402
You three are disgusting.

571
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:49,413
He's out of his mind.

572
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,252
Say that again.

573
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,522
I dare you to say it again.

574
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:54,982
Hae Seong.

575
00:38:57,992 --> 00:39:00,092
Repeat yourself, you punk.

576
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:06,232
Sorry. I guess I overreacted.

577
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,803
My bad. I apologize.

578
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,073
This won't ever happen again, so...

579
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:13,672
- What the... - No way.

580
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,402
Did you see that?

581
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:18,913
- Darn it. - Unbelievable.

582
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:21,342
- Are they insane? - What's going on?

583
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:23,183
Shouldn't we get someone?

584
00:39:30,653 --> 00:39:31,968
What gives?

585
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:33,792
- No way. - This is bad.

586
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,692
Ms. Oh, it's bad!

587
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,033
Hey.

588
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:45,073
Jeong Hae Seong, was it?

589
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:48,672
- Come with me. - No, don't do this.

590
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,373
Hey.

591
00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:53,011
Come on. I can't get into fights.

592
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,612
You've clearly lost your mind.

593
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,882
- I said that was enough. - Let go.

594
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:01,723
Let go of me, you punk.

595
00:40:07,693 --> 00:40:09,362
Everyone's watching, so let's cut this short.

596
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,968
Let go, you prick.

597
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,192
Let go of me, darn it!

598
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:17,502
Get over here.

599
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,732
You...

600
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:23,589
Did you see that?

601
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:26,312
This is insane.

602
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,589
- No way. - My gosh.

603
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,453
That was crazy.

604
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,323
I can't believe it.

605
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,893
Stop right there!

606
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,263
Darn it.

607
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:54,442
What are you two doing?

608
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:57,942
Both of you, wait for me at the counselling office!

609
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:07,752
No way. The stream is going viral.

610
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:16,362
I've never seen Park Tae Soo get his butt kicked before.

611
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,192
That will cause quite the commotion.

612
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:19,632
He's an amusing one.

613
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,433
Let's eat.

614
00:41:27,497 --> 00:41:29,129
(Student Counselling Office)

615
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:38,181
Are you that stupid?

616
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,783
How can you cause problems in less than a day?

617
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:46,422
I bet you have no idea what you've done.

618
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,462
You messed with the wrong guy.

619
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:52,163
You're in for a painful lesson.

620
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,203
Tae Soo, what are you doing here? Come on out.

621
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:01,002
Getting into fights when you just transferred?

622
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,643
I'm curious to know what will become of you.

623
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,982
I hope we can get along.

624
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:22,663
These schools are still pretty much the same.

625
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:31,073
Why is it just you? Where's the class monitor?

626
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:32,873
The vice-principal came by.

627
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,359
Why did you and Tae Soo fight?

628
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:42,542
Because he started it.

629
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,252
As in Tae Soo?

630
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:47,823
What could the two of you get into it about?

631
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:53,223
A physical altercation of this level isn't something I can take lightly.

632
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:55,192
So answer me.

633
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:56,922
Why did you two fight?

634
00:42:58,062 --> 00:43:01,362
You should've come to me if an argument had started.

635
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,973
Are you a common thug?

636
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:05,873
A bully?

637
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:08,601
How can you get into fights only just after transferring?

638
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:10,873
You really are clueless.

639
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,373
What?

640
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,083
Are you knowingly turning a blind eye...

641
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:18,482
or are you just dense?

642
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:23,692
Ms. Oh, do you even care about your students?

643
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:29,292
I'll think that Tae Soo's a fine actor.

644
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:31,232
Because I'll be disappointed...

645
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,263
if you've knowingly been turning a blind eye.

646
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,502
I have nothing more to say.

647
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:41,342
This is up to you now.

648
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:07,603
Darn.

649
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:25,353
I bought another while getting mine.

650
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:27,882
I'm the reason you couldn't finish your lunch.

651
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:32,152
Thanks.

652
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:40,433
What did Ms. Oh say?

653
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:43,533
You know, the usual.

654
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:47,303
Don't get into fights and whatnot.

655
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:52,513
Sorry I made it hard on you.

656
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:57,712
Why would you need to apologize?

657
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,252
It's this world that's the issue.

658
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:05,893
Why did you hold back the other time?

659
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,663
You seem to pack a punch.

660
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:11,393
What was it again?

661
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:16,279
Hiding your true powers or something like that.

662
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:19,002
- HTP? - Yes, it's something like that.

663
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:21,902
I see.

664
00:45:57,472 --> 00:45:58,772
Dong Min.

665
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:02,013
Hang in there.

666
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:04,853
You too.

667
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:10,453
(Have a Drink With Su A)

668
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:18,993
Darn.

669
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,132
Who does he think he is?

670
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:26,132
Of course, I care about my students.

671
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:29,701
Why do you think I want to be a full-time teacher?

672
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:33,573
Why? Just why? Darn it!

673
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,081
- Goodness. - My gosh.

674
00:46:35,082 --> 00:46:36,811
- Darn! - I'm so sorry.

675
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:38,911
This is what I should've said to him.

676
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,621
She's not in her right mind.

677
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:42,221
Oh Su A,

678
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:44,893
you idiot.

679
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:50,993
You wait and see, Jeong Hae Seong.

680
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:55,163
I'll get rid of you.

681
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,062
Shouldn't the line be...

682
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:59,772
"I'll crush you?"

683
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:01,402
Potato, po-tah-to.

684
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:06,573
Darn.

685
00:47:07,812 --> 00:47:10,013
I have students talking down to me now.

686
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:14,158
What a life this is.

687
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,152
It's the path you chose.

688
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:18,123
Hang in there.

689
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:21,522
What about that first student you taught?

690
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:22,968
Min Ji, was it?

691
00:47:22,992 --> 00:47:25,232
You want to be a full-time teacher for her sake.

692
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,862
To guide other students since you failed her.

693
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:31,471
Is that something I said?

694
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:33,502
Yes, while crying your eyes out.

695
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:39,573
Drink in silence and go home.

696
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:04,933
Sir,

697
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:07,033
it's about Hae Seong.

698
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:10,348
- Will he be all right? - Don't.

699
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:12,612
Don't you dare say you want to be in a school uniform.

700
00:48:12,713 --> 00:48:14,542
We're short-staffed as is.

701
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,513
Also, you look like...

702
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:21,499
you can pass for a disciplinary teacher.

703
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,351
Why are you hung up on school uniforms?

704
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:26,353
That's not it. I'm seriously worried.

705
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:29,061
You know how Hae Seong gets easily worked up.

706
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:32,033
You can worry about everyone else but not Hae Seong.

707
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,002
I know him better than anyone.

708
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:37,149
I heard you two had a long history.

709
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:39,272
You've known him since he was young.

710
00:48:40,903 --> 00:48:42,272
Tell me about it.

711
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:44,272
My gosh.

712
00:48:44,742 --> 00:48:46,212
Time sure does fly.

713
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:49,342
I can't believe that tiny thing is already...

714
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,283
Goodness.

715
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,183
Anyway,

716
00:48:55,622 --> 00:48:58,723
he's not someone who'd easily cause trouble.

717
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,292
I trust him.

718
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:04,433
Let's eat before the noodles go mushy.

719
00:49:11,733 --> 00:49:13,132
Director, my gosh.

720
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,603
Eat for now.

721
00:49:16,843 --> 00:49:18,913
See for yourselves.

722
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:21,413
Eat while you watch.

723
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:23,342
Let go.

724
00:49:23,613 --> 00:49:25,413
Let go of me, darn it!

725
00:49:27,622 --> 00:49:29,252
You...

726
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:43,962
The transfer student has balls.

727
00:49:45,872 --> 00:49:48,348
He messed with you of all people.

728
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:49,372
Here.

729
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:51,212
I'm not in the mood to laugh.

730
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:53,911
How can I end that punk?

731
00:49:53,912 --> 00:49:55,842
You're not one to let this slide.

732
00:49:58,253 --> 00:49:59,882
Tell me.

733
00:50:00,452 --> 00:50:01,982
Should I come to your aid?

734
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:05,353
Forget it. He's not even worth it.

735
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:10,022
If that's what you say.

736
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:14,303
By the way, when are you going to pay me back?

737
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:17,672
If you're having trouble with it,

738
00:50:18,073 --> 00:50:20,333
get me IDs instead like last time.

739
00:50:22,673 --> 00:50:28,189
(Spark Golf)

740
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:49,462
I enjoyed the video.

741
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:52,303
What have you been getting yourself into?

742
00:50:53,372 --> 00:50:55,073
Senior Agent An, didn't you warn him?

743
00:50:55,403 --> 00:50:56,502
He's to lead a quiet school life...

744
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:58,042
to keep it from interfering with the mission.

745
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:00,473
I'm sorry.

746
00:51:00,713 --> 00:51:03,382
I'll keep it brief, Agent Jeong.

747
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:05,783
If anything like this happens again,

748
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,623
the mission will be called off,

749
00:51:07,852 --> 00:51:09,922
and you'll be investigated on the charge...

750
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:11,752
of damaging national treasure.

751
00:51:12,093 --> 00:51:15,493
That'll definitely be the end of the idiotic Domestic Team Four.

752
00:51:17,023 --> 00:51:18,433
You.

753
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,692
You joined the NIS to follow in your father's footsteps.

754
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:22,833
What will you say to him when you finally locate him?

755
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:25,433
That you got fired for botching a mission?

756
00:51:28,972 --> 00:51:31,112
That'd be humiliating if you ask me.

757
00:51:35,783 --> 00:51:37,283
Don't just look at me and get going.

758
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:40,982
Darn, I have an important game tomorrow.

759
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,533
Was it necessary to put it like that?

760
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:55,303
Don't be bothered about that comment about your father.

761
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,833
Just behave from here on out.

762
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,203
What about what I requested?

763
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:08,842
It'll be able to crack any door lock out there.

764
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:11,683
You said there was likely to be a storage room.

765
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:14,922
Anyway, let's wrap up this operation today.

766
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:17,053
Sure.

767
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:42,783
Ta-da!

768
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:44,282
What's this?

769
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:46,083
A gift for Parents' Day.

770
00:52:46,783 --> 00:52:48,152
Really?

771
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:50,683
This is incredible.

772
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:53,553
I should wear this forever.

773
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:55,569
Dad.

774
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:58,069
Job shadowing is required for homework.

775
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:00,163
You said you worked for the government.

776
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:02,933
What should I say under job description?

777
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:06,132
Say I'm like a compass.

778
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:08,042
A compass?

779
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:12,812
A nameless compass that guides the nation...

780
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:14,743
to prosper and into the future.

781
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,522
When will you get home if you leave this late?

782
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:27,763
It's my birthday tomorrow.

783
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:29,692
As if I would've forgotten that.

784
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:32,833
I'll be home before you know it and wake you up.

785
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:35,062
We'll go to your favourite observatory.

786
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:37,203
Keep your promise this time.

787
00:53:37,403 --> 00:53:40,232
Or I won't ever talk to you again.

788
00:53:42,273 --> 00:53:43,643
I promise.

789
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:50,112
This won't take long.

790
00:53:50,283 --> 00:53:51,612
Bye.

791
00:53:58,892 --> 00:54:00,223
Dad!

792
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,393
Dad!

793
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:07,462
- Yes? - You forgot this.

794
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,132
Your notepad.

795
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:16,303
Thanks, Son.

796
00:54:22,113 --> 00:54:23,442
Bye.

797
00:54:26,852 --> 00:54:28,422
I'll be back before you know it.

798
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:02,403
- Who is it? - Hello, ma'am.

799
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:05,079
I'm Dong Min's friend Jeong Hae Seong.

800
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,479
Why would Dong Min's friend come by at this hour?

801
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:09,189
He's at his part-time job.

802
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,189
He asked me for a favour, that's all.

803
00:55:11,213 --> 00:55:13,713
- A favour? - I guess he didn't tell you yet.

804
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:15,653
He's receiving the encouragement scholarship,

805
00:55:15,654 --> 00:55:18,953
but your ID is needed to complete the process.

806
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:21,053
He asked me to get it for him.

807
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:23,854
How sweet of you.

808
00:55:24,693 --> 00:55:26,593
- Just a second. - Sure.

809
00:55:26,764 --> 00:55:29,593
Goodness me.

810
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,834
My gosh.

811
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:34,380
- Hello. - Delivery!

812
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:35,704
Over here.

813
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:37,849
I'll leave it here. Please enjoy.

814
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:39,204
Sure.

815
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:42,736
(365 Pool)

816
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,013
Hae Seong.

817
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,053
What are you doing here?

818
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,334
What about you?

819
00:56:35,463 --> 00:56:37,794
I saw you while out working my part-time delivery job.

820
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:40,934
Why did you jump over the wall?

821
00:56:43,674 --> 00:56:46,573
Could you be after what I think you're after?

822
00:56:48,974 --> 00:56:50,573
You are.

823
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:53,360
That's why you're here. To see if the story is true.

824
00:56:53,384 --> 00:56:54,684
What?

825
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:57,389
No wonder you sneaked in here.

826
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,923
The place is out of bounds,

827
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:00,954
and you didn't want your name written down on the visitors' log.

828
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:03,323
Yes, that's it.

829
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:05,923
- Can I come with you? - No way.

830
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,579
Getting in here wasn't an easy feat for you.

831
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:15,234
Nothing good will come out of you being disciplined.

832
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:16,903
It'll only upset your grandma.

833
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,044
So head home already.

834
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:20,374
Be on your way.

835
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,213
You'd be disciplined as well.

836
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:37,653
Darn.

837
00:57:37,893 --> 00:57:39,624
For the record, I told you to leave.

838
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:44,064
I didn't follow you in here. I'm going my own way.

839
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:46,979
You're more stubborn than you seem.

840
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:48,303
Whatever. Come back tomorrow, then.

841
00:57:48,304 --> 00:57:50,204
Go your own way tomorrow.

842
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:51,803
Wait.

843
00:57:52,244 --> 00:57:53,604
Do you hear that?

844
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:18,604
Senior Agent An.

845
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,573
I'm afraid this mission will take a while.

846
01:02:22,713 --> 01:02:24,044
What do you mean?

847
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:27,783
My guess is that the chairwoman...

848
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,283
is also looking for the gold bars.

849
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,312
(Retired to the countryside after the 1905 Protectorate Treaty)

850
01:03:30,313 --> 01:03:31,840
(The emperor's lost gold funding Byeongmun Foundation?)

851
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,164
Dong Min, let's go.

852
01:03:57,574 --> 01:03:59,104
Let's go. It's dangerous here.

853
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,283
That was when...

854
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:16,229
rumours started to spread that she'd appear every night...

855
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:19,463
in the studio at the time of her death.

856
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:26,434
Hey.

857
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,673
What are you doing here? You should go home.

858
01:04:29,003 --> 01:04:30,249
Hey.

859
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:31,573
Sir.

860
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:34,173
I have no legs.

861
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:45,053
The story was true.

862
01:04:46,184 --> 01:04:47,724
About the school ghost.

863
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:11,539
(Undercover High School)

864
01:05:28,475 --> 01:05:29,333
(Sending back to desk)

865
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:30,392
(Where did the 800 million dollars from the national coffer go?)

866
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,662
(He was appointed as the first chairman...)

867
01:05:31,663 --> 01:05:33,095
(of the school board.)

868
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:36,232
Who's there?

869
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,162
Seo Byeong Mun who hid the gold bars...

870
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:40,910
set up the ghost story as a riddle.

871
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:42,903
You must be interested in ghost stories.

872
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:44,073
Jeong Hae Seong did what?

873
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:45,249
Darn!

874
01:06:45,273 --> 01:06:46,343
You're busted.

875
01:06:46,344 --> 01:06:48,419
Jeong Hae Seong, get your act together.

876
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:51,142
Young man, you can't go in there.

877
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:53,644
This is a serious issue.

878
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:56,360
What will happen to Hae Seong, then?

879
01:06:56,384 --> 01:06:58,314
Will he really be expelled?
