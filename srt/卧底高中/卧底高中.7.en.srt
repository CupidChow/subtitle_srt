incidents, and backstories...)

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,814
Wait. Come on.

6
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:20,330
Who was it? Tell me.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,960
Why do you even want to know?

8
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:23,154
Don't be like that and tell me.

9
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:26,124
I can't sleep
with this hanging over my head.

10
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,034
Wait, it's raining.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,394
What...

12
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:36,834
Oh Bong Ja, take this umbrella.

13
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,904
I told you not to call me
by that name!

14
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,344
Just a second.

15
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:44,474
Mom, I don't go
by Oh Bong Ja anymore.

16
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:45,790
Why is there only one umbrella?

17
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,344
That's me being smart.

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,814
- Don't leave him hanging and go!
- What?

19
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:54,254
All right, fine.

20
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,784
What were you going on about?

21
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,864
(Have a Drink With Su A)

22
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:02,864
Sorry about that.
We only had one umbrella.

23
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,994
Shall we? Where do you live?

24
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:41,264
Have you lost it?

25
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,744
Is Bong Ja your name?

26
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,774
Oh Bong Ja?

27
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,344
Yes, that's what I went by.

28
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,884
Who are you to smirk
at someone else's name?

29
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,154
It's not that.
You're totally mistaken.

30
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,984
I know the name is old-fashioned,

31
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:04,624
but it's rude to laugh
in front of me.

32
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,464
So much for walking you home.

33
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,934
- Get home yourself.
- But...

34
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:11,994
How annoying.

35
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,364
Why are you already back?

36
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,624
Why didn't you go
with that handsome young man?

37
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:45,294
What is it? What's wrong?

38
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:57,041
(Episode 7)

39
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,510
Let's get married.

40
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:25,850
You like me,

41
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:29,074
and I like you too,
so let's get married.

42
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,654
You kind of look like him.

43
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:43,924
Who?

44
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,864
Just someone.
Someone who's like my sworn enemy.

45
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,234
Was she talking about me?

46
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:53,864
Really?

47
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,350
This is the list of guests attending
the Night for Byeongmunites.

48
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:05,474
We have confirmation
that everyone will be present.

49
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:09,044
Meanwhile, those are the parents
in the academic management program.

(Child attending Byeongmun High:
Han Seung Jae, Grade 11, Class 2)

53
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,554
Mom.

54
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,724
Hey, you're here.

55
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,194
Let them know
we'll gather separately for tea...

56
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,394
during the event.

57
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,364
Yes, ma'am. I'll relay the message.

58
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,604
Have a good evening.

59
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:46,354
I heard something happened
earlier at school today.

60
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,294
When were you going to tell me?

61
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:58,864
My Ye Na,

62
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:02,280
you are to be
the face of the school.

63
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:03,674
But someone like that...

64
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:07,544
is cutting herself?

65
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,774
If word gets out,

66
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,214
I'll...

67
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,584
I'll be mortified.

68
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,024
I'm sorry, Mom.

69
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:28,064
I want my Ye Na...

70
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,994
to be strong.

71
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:39,844
Mom. Gosh, Mom...

72
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:41,474
Strong enough to know...

73
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,604
Mom...

74
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:46,214
that even cutting yourself
won't change anything.

75
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,814
An important event awaits us.

76
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,184
Let's both cut ourselves
all we want...

77
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,424
and shed all our tears.

78
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,054
Now that we're done,

79
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:01,764
we'll smile.

80
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:06,334
Whose daughter are you?

81
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:11,974
Yours, Mom.

82
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:15,904
Now, eat.

83
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:48,074
<i>I didn't mean what I said</i>

84
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:52,674
<i>I was worried</i>

85
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:56,684
<i>You might see how I felt about you</i>

86
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,214
<i>That's all</i>

87
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:01,754
<i>My darling</i>

88
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:04,824
<i>I only have eyes for you</i>

89
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,970
<i>Please just focus on me, babe</i>

90
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,194
<i>Pretend you didn't</i>

91
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,664
<i>And I'll fake it too</i>

92
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,164
Yes!

93
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,654
What were you doing?

94
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:36,284
When did you get here?

95
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,894
A second ago.

96
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,794
You could've announced yourself.

97
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,524
Do you normally
come to school this early?

98
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,294
I couldn't sleep properly
last night.

99
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,164
Since I was up, I figured...

100
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,904
Has the mission been compromised?

101
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:55,344
Of course not.

102
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,314
Anyway,

103
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,044
it's about that sworn enemy
you once mentioned.

104
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,054
What about him?

105
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:07,024
Well...

106
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,824
It's nothing.

107
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,224
Why are you cleaning
first thing in the morning?

108
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,264
Don't they have cleaning ladies?

109
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,624
Well,

110
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:19,264
this is me investing in myself.

111
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,964
You never know.

112
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,834
Someone might post a photo
of my love of the school...

113
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,374
on the school bulletin board.

114
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:25,774
That will give me
additional points...

115
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:28,420
when I'm being evaluated
to become a full-time teacher.

116
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:29,604
I see you work hard.

117
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,214
Right? I work extremely hard.

118
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,014
It's admirable.

119
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,530
You'll get the job for sure.

120
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:38,914
I'll be rooting for you.

121
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,694
That was unexpected.

122
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,714
Is something up at home?

123
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,684
What is wrong with you?

124
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:18,194
(Byeongmun High School)

125
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:21,264
Ms. Kim.

126
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:23,694
This happened to a friend.

127
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,634
On a rainy day,

128
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,664
some guy pulled her toward him
right in his arms...

129
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,904
to save her from being hit
by a motorcycle.

130
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:34,104
Is her name Oh Su A by any chance?

131
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,384
Gosh, no. Keep listening.

132
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,684
And then,
he went on to shower her...

133
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,614
with words of encouragement.

134
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,284
"You work hard."

135
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,254
"It's admirable." Like that.

136
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,724
What do you think?
Didn't he give her the green light?

137
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,900
What's the relationship
between this friend...

138
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,234
and the guy?

139
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,664
They're acquaintances...

140
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,410
with an eventful history.

141
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:06,504
They're just acquaintances
and not in a fling?

142
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:11,714
It's nothing.

143
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:15,284
Ms. Oh, here goes.

144
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:16,784
There's something...

145
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,354
that must be kept in mind
by those like your friend...

146
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,224
who have never
had a boyfriend before.

147
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,394
Don't mistake friendliness
for romantic gestures.

148
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,964
I've seen many people
be humiliated...

149
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,024
because they forgot
that cardinal rule.

150
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,140
Tell your friend...

151
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,704
to be careful.

152
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,274
Teachers, gather around.

153
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,784
Over here.

154
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:52,884
We now have to decide
on the face of Byeongmun High.

155
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:56,000
Look at the photos
and openly voice...

156
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,654
- your personal opinions.
- Sure.

157
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:02,170
I think Ye Na will represent
the school quite nicely.

158
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,494
What do you think?

159
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:04,534
I like Ye Na for this too.

160
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,394
- Of course, it should be Ye Na.
- Absolutely.

161
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:08,364
Good. Then that's it
for the female student.

162
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,904
Let's move on to the male student.

163
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,704
Goodness. Look how handsome he is.

164
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,404
- He is a handsome one.
- Right?

165
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:18,714
His parents must be proud because
he is one handsome young man.

166
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,514
What do you think?

167
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,344
If no one objects,

168
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,484
Hyeon Joon will be chosen as...

169
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,854
A vote!

170
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,324
Let's put it to a vote.

171
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:32,324
Would that be necessary?

172
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:35,864
They say that voting
is the key element of democracy.

173
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:38,394
And honoring that...

174
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:41,134
is how we show respect
to the fighters of democracy.

175
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,434
It is also our duty
as their decedents.

176
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:47,844
Why does choosing a model
have to be a grand process?

177
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,674
Being sloppy for even a second...

178
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,584
could cause us to fall right back
into a dictatorship.

179
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,554
As a teacher of Korean history...

180
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:59,384
who preaches
about learning from the past,

181
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,624
I am deeply worried...

182
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:06,630
about this process.

183
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,364
Fine. We'll vote.

184
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,124
Put it to a vote.

185
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,534
Thank you.

186
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,104
Hurry up, will you?
What's taking you so long?

187
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,734
I'm done, sir.

188
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,874
(The Male Face of Byeongmun:
Ji Hyeon Joon, Grade 11, Class 2)

189
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,244
Oh, no.

190
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,474
Darn it.

191
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,144
Let's count the votes.

192
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:29,714
Ji Hyeon Joon.

193
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:33,984
Jeong Hae Seong.

194
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,723
(Jeong Hae Seong: 4,
Ji Hyeon Joon: 4)

195
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,064
- Ji Hyeon Joon.
- That's it.

196
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,764
Jeong Hae Seong.

197
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,641
(Jeong Hae Seong: 5,
Ji Hyeon Joon: 5)

198
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:55,404
This is the last vote.

199
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,644
(Votes, Male Face of Byeongmun)

200
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,914
Please...

201
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,264
The results must be out by now.

202
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:19,034
I'm even more nervous now...

203
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,664
than I was before I took
that beating from you.

204
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,264
Hae Seong will win, right?

205
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,904
I had a lucky dream last night.

206
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,904
Hae Seong will win for sure.

207
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:30,444
Guys, the faces of Byeongmun
have been posted!

208
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:39,914
Hey!

209
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,524
Damn it.

210
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,894
Did you hear...

211
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:47,564
- about the face of Byeongmun?
- Who won?

212
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:49,224
Jeong Hae Seong!

213
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:50,931
(The Faces of Byeongmun:
Lee Ye Na, Jeong Hae Seong)

214
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,464
What a relief.

215
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,104
Thank you, Dad!

216
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,480
Hyeon Joon's Mom, of course.

217
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,744
I'm truly sorry about this.

218
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,174
I tried my best but...

219
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:06,414
That's it!

220
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:07,844
- Snacks are on me.
- Snacks!

221
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:09,144
- Let's go.
- Come on.

222
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,954
- Let's go!
- This way!

223
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,124
It's his treat!

224
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,624
Nice!

225
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,594
Let's take a rain check
on the snacks.

226
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,524
What? But you said you'd treat us.

227
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:23,764
I'm really sorry about this.

228
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,134
Hey!

229
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,334
Where are you headed?

230
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:36,004
- The library.
- The library. Sure.

231
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,184
You read a lot of fancy books.

232
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,754
No wonder you have
the highest grades.

233
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:54,900
All high school students
are required to read these.

234
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,224
Try reading sometime.

235
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,564
Oh, this one.

236
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,454
Goodness.

237
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:21,454
Why are you following me?

238
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,470
I wasn't following you.

239
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:25,824
I was going my way.

240
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:29,364
Even a kid
wouldn't be this childish.

241
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,510
Five minutes.

242
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,404
I have to get to class, so no more.

243
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,354
First of all,

244
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:53,384
I'll start with an apology.

245
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,654
I meddled in your life...

246
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:59,894
when I didn't know
anything about it.

247
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:02,994
Sorry.

248
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,570
Were you tutored by someone?

249
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:08,004
What's gotten into you?

250
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,774
That's just how I feel.

251
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:13,834
I...

252
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,614
don't want to see you hurting.

253
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,814
Ye Na...

254
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:27,884
isn't the mean girl
you peg her to be.

255
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,354
She has it rough, that's all.

256
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,154
Her life is tough,

257
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,294
and I'm the only one
who can take her crap.

258
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:41,104
She's only venting,
so don't hate her too much.

259
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,804
Got it.

260
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:50,274
Your five minutes is up, so I'm off.

261
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:04,354
- Hey.
- We're done...

262
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,194
looking into the detective
on Kim Hyeon Ho's case,

263
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:08,624
but you need to hear this in person.

264
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,310
That's the bell, guys. Get to class!

265
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,634
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

266
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,074
Leaving school early.
Cooperation requested.

267
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,804
What the...

268
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,474
How old is this jerk?

269
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,643
(Leaving school early,
Cooperation requested)

270
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,084
Cooperation, my ass.

271
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:32,360
The detective
on Kim Hyeon Ho's case...

272
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,854
We looked into everything
from his accounts to his assets,

273
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,384
but nothing was out of the ordinary.

274
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:37,624
Then what was flagged?

275
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,870
The detective has a daughter.

276
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,064
She's been hospitalized
for chronic kidney disease,

277
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,794
but she was recently moved
to a hospital owned...

278
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:44,794
by the Byeongmun Foundation.

279
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,810
The foundation
is footing her medical bill.

280
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,680
"Recommendations made
by Park Jae Mun,"

281
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,034
"Principal
of Byeongmun High School."

282
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:52,310
The question is this.

283
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,674
Why did the principal
have her admitted...

284
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,580
when he doesn't know the detective?

285
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:58,974
To hide the fact
that he's the culprit.

286
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:03,044
By wrapping up the case
as a suicide.

287
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:08,854
The archives in the basement
of the old building...

288
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,524
were put up by my dad
and not the chairwoman.

289
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,404
At first, I wondered if the chairwoman
was also looking for the gold bars...

290
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,834
and thought that they could
already be in her possession.

291
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:28,644
If Park Jae Mun was the one
after the notebook,

292
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,644
it'd be safe to assume
that the chairwoman...

293
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,644
hasn't found them yet.

294
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:39,384
If, and this is a big if.

295
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:43,794
Could Seo Myeong Ju
have anything to do...

296
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:45,794
with your father's disappearance?

297
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:51,094
We'll soon find out.

298
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,934
(Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju)

299
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:18,054
For now, let's focus
on the third ghost story.

300
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:20,124
- Mi Jeong.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,024
I compared
Byeongmun High's school song...

302
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,464
to the song Hae Seong recorded.

303
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,604
As you can see,

304
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:30,164
it's the same song
but with different waveforms.

305
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,150
Judging by the spread of the notes
and the number of them,

306
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,304
the school song you recorded...

307
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,314
has to be a piano four hands.

308
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,714
A piano four hands.

309
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,484
Two people must play
the school song together.

310
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,044
Once you play the piece,

311
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,454
we'll get a clue
about the last ghost story.

312
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:48,054
Who here can play the piano?

313
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:58,234
So much for things going smoothly.

314
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:02,804
Getting into the chairwoman's office
wasn't our only obstacle.

315
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,374
Come on, you brats.
What are you going to do about this?

316
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,674
I'll do it.

317
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:11,844
Ms. Oh?

318
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:15,344
Why do you keep entering
while making a declaration?

319
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,414
Because it's cool.

320
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:21,254
Outside,
I heard everything you said.

321
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,493
(Master Czerny)

322
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,940
Czerny that comes after Beyer?

323
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:31,734
The school song
isn't that difficult to play.

324
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,834
Even with all thumbs,
anyone will be able to play it...

325
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,404
after a few hours of practice.

326
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:37,650
Hold on.

327
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:39,504
This isn't a game.

328
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,774
If you get caught
in the chairwoman's office,

329
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,144
you could get fired.

330
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,420
Really?

331
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,544
- Then I won't do it.
- What?

332
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:48,314
That was unexpected.

333
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,684
Good thinking.

334
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,854
- Let's continue...
- Wait.

335
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,554
- Ms. Oh will do it.
- What?

336
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,264
A twist upon a twist.

337
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,970
We can't officially ask
for assistance...

338
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,734
with this being a secret mission.

339
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,764
As of now, Ms. Oh is our best bet.

340
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,034
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

341
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,374
No.

342
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,374
You can do this.

343
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:22,314
Because you are
the one and only partner...

344
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:25,354
of NIS' finest agent
Jeong Hae Seong...

345
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,154
and the honorary field agent...

346
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,324
of Domestic Team Four.

347
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,294
An honorary field...

348
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,394
agent?

349
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,864
What are you two doing?

350
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,064
What are you saying?

351
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,434
I'll do it.

352
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:47,004
I'm an honorary field agent,
after all.

353
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:55,614
That's Ms. Oh for you.

354
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,614
She's our team's wild card.

355
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,854
Have you lost it?

356
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:01,924
I need you to promise me
something in return.

357
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:05,654
(I, Senior Agent An Seok Ho
of the NIS, will provide...)

358
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,949
(state-level support for Oh Su A's
full-time teaching position...)

359
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,775
(November 10, 2025, An Seok Ho)

360
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:35,154
Nice.

361
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:38,954
Just a second.

362
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:41,124
- Come with me.
- What?

363
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,464
I won't say this twice. Don't do it.

364
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:50,164
- Why not?
- Because it's dangerous.

365
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:52,474
As if you need to ask.

366
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,680
Either way, you can't do this.

367
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:57,344
All faculty members
of Byeongmun High...

368
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,774
are expected to be
at the event anyway.

369
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:02,344
Anyway, it's already been decided,

370
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:05,114
so let's just focus
on the mission at hand.

371
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:07,754
This.

372
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,924
Why are you hellbent
on becoming a full-time teacher?

373
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:15,100
As if I need a reason.

374
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:17,734
No one wants to stay a temp.

375
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,274
But not everyone...

376
00:23:24,274 --> 00:23:26,274
willingly puts themselves
in danger to achieve it.

377
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:29,074
So be honest with me.

378
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,414
I have to do it for someone.

379
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,004
This is what I like.

380
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:00,904
She was one of my first students,

381
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:02,604
and I made her a promise.

382
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,374
That I'd become a full-time teacher.

383
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:11,044
Darn.

384
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,884
That made things weird
and killed the vibe.

385
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:18,294
Anyway, I have
to become a full-time teacher...

386
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:20,024
and am ready
to risk everything for it.

387
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,464
So please don't stop me.

388
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,694
What's life without a little risk?

389
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:30,904
Stay right beside me.

390
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:40,244
- Unbelievable.
- Thanks.

391
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:47,154
This is wrong in every way.

392
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,454
You really are clueless.

393
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,264
Are you knowingly
turning a blind eye...

394
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:56,224
or are you just dense?

395
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:58,564
Ms. Oh,

396
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:00,764
do you even care
about your students?

397
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:06,104
Why was I so blunt
with her that day?

398
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,374
Hold on.

399
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,020
Don't worry about it.

400
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,474
It can happen.

401
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,244
Why would you even care?

402
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,585
(Ms. Oh Su A)

403
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:25,554
This is Jeong Hae Seong.

404
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:27,754
Why are you speaking
in a deeper voice?

405
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,234
What's up?

406
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:38,234
Principal Park showed up
at the library!

407
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,814
Only two people can deactivate
the security system.

408
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:50,084
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju
and Principal Park Jae Mun.

409
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:53,184
The door can only be unlocked
with their fingerprints.

410
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,134
Principal Park, hello.

411
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:11,327
Right. Hello, there.

412
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:12,869
("Love Everything")

413
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:17,004
Is that the book
you're checking out?

414
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:21,814
That's actually
what I came here to borrow.

415
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,254
Oh, dear. What do I do?

416
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:30,584
I really wanted
to read that book today.

417
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:33,794
Take it first, then.

418
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,964
Really? Thank you.

419
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:43,464
(Byeongmun High School)

420
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:46,804
Thank you.

421
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:08,524
("Love Everything")

422
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:20,634
What's wrong?

423
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,274
It's nothing.

424
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,014
Are you stupid?

425
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,784
Do, sol.

426
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:07,414
Do, sol.

427
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:09,254
Do, sol. That's it.

428
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,184
You can't even memorize that?

429
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:13,994
Sorry.

430
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,098
(Meditation)

431
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,397
(Meditation)

432
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,075
("I Don't Understand My Own Mind,"
"Why Do I Feel This Way?")

433
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:37,184
Hello, this is about
a friend of mine.

434
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:40,314
He's been acting weird.
What is wrong with him?

435
00:28:40,314 --> 00:28:41,453
(Question)

436
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:44,794
We will be prepared,

437
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,194
but we have no idea
what could happen inside.

438
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,664
You need to be able
to protect yourself...

439
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:52,094
in case I can't help you.

440
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,064
I can do the shoulder throw,

441
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,504
and I have a gas gun.

442
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,834
Weapons aren't allowed
at the event venue.

443
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,404
I'll show you a few moves.
Watch and learn.

444
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,574
All right.

445
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,914
When someone grabs your shoulder,

446
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,144
use your elbow
on the other side like this...

447
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:10,684
and push their arm down.

448
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,814
Easy, right? Now, try it.

449
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:15,854
You're grabbing my shoulder.

450
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,024
- Use my elbow like this.
- Yes, that's it.

451
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,394
- And push it down!
- Ouch, hold on!

452
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,170
That really worked.

453
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,634
Okay, show me the next one.
Show me something else.

454
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:27,964
It's an extension
of what I showed you.

455
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,104
When someone
grabs your shoulder like this,

456
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:32,180
use your elbow in the same manner...

457
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,134
to take them down...

458
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:45,484
That's it?

459
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:48,624
Well, there must be
something else after this.

460
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,594
Try to get out of my grip
if you can!

461
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:06,574
That's it for today's class.

462
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,544
- We're done already?
- Ask no questions.

463
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,044
Today, I...

464
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:16,344
I have a lot on my mind today.
I have to go.

465
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:20,614
What's with him?

466
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:23,084
Jeong Hae Seong,
you're acting so weird today.

467
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:24,554
Snap out of it.

468
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,694
Snap out of it!

469
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:42,744
Oh, my.

470
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:45,614
So, this is an NIS office?

471
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:49,084
Since you're now
our honorary field agent,

472
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,790
we made an exception for you
and brought you to our office.

473
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:53,154
Thank you.

474
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:54,584
My gosh.

475
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,354
- We closed the shop.
- What?

476
00:30:57,484 --> 00:31:00,000
The owner couple
got into a fight in the US.

477
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,470
They returned earlier than expected.

478
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:03,624
What? Everything
is happening so suddenly...

479
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,240
Do you have a cold?

480
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,264
Don't ask.
I have a lot on my mind now.

481
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,404
Goodness.

482
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:29,854
Sir!

483
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,894
- It's a hot mess.
- Why?

484
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:36,024
There's a civilian
in Seok Ho's office.

485
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,294
I should have a word
with him, right?

486
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,094
She's helping them with the mission.
He told me earlier.

487
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:45,034
But I'm his manager.

488
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,034
He went over my head and told you?

489
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,674
Do you want
some coffee-flavored milk?

490
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:55,784
Come on. Let's go.

491
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:58,654
- Come on.
- An Seok Ho, that little...

492
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:01,618
The Night for Byeongmunites
will take place...

493
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:03,018
in the banquet hall
on the first floor.

494
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,252
To solve the puzzle behind...

495
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:06,712
the third story,
we must enter the chairwoman's office,

496
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:09,682
which is on the third floor
of the annex.

497
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,492
The annex will be open
for this special occasion,

498
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:16,022
but only registered guests
can enter.

499
00:32:16,462 --> 00:32:18,262
Hae Seong and Ms. Oh
might struggle...

500
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:20,962
to pull off the operation
if it's just the two of them.

501
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:23,132
So I want you to go inside
with them, Yeong Hun.

502
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:24,708
- Yes, sir.
- If needed,

503
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,702
Mi Jeong and I
can back you guys up too,

504
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:30,772
but the students
have already seen our faces,

505
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,012
so it'll be safer
not to be seen together.

506
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:34,512
(Byeongmun High School,
Annex Floor Plan)

507
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:36,022
(Annex 1st Floor,
2nd Floor, 3rd Floor)

508
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:40,982
During the operation,
never forget...

509
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:44,052
that there are security cameras
all over the annex...

510
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:47,962
and that there will be
security guards in every corner.

511
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,138
Then how can we get to
the chairwoman's office?

512
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:55,062
You'll have to go up
to the third floor...

513
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,638
through the central staircase
in the lobby.

514
00:32:56,662 --> 00:32:58,072
The central staircase?

515
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:00,918
A teacher walking up the stairs
in the annex...

516
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:03,172
with two students...

517
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:05,388
That will look very suspicious.

518
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:09,142
I'll try to figure out a way
to distract everyone.

519
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:11,052
Okay.

520
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:13,082
Every year, the chairwoman
has a tea session...

521
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,652
with the parents
in the reception room...

522
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,222
halfway through the event.

523
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:20,522
Which means, she'll need to
step out of her office for that.

524
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:23,392
That will be our golden chance.

525
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:27,292
Her office only has one door.

526
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,662
We have a fingerprint
to open the door.

527
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:33,002
However, as soon as the door opens,

528
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:35,842
the entry record will automatically
be sent to Seo Myeong Ju,

529
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:38,372
and it'll be saved
on the server as well.

530
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,712
Even if you manage
to get to the piano,

531
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:50,282
both you and Hae Seong
will be expelled from the school...

532
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:53,552
if they find out
that the two of you...

533
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,338
broke into the chairwoman's office,
so brace yourselves.

534
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:57,662
What?

535
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,132
- What?
- When you get to the door,

536
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:03,662
I'll step in remotely to make sure
Seo Myeong Ju won't get the record,

537
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:04,972
so don't worry about that.

538
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:07,442
But anything saved

to just come to me instead of...

as the student council president.

704

00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:59,512
<i>- A life full of mistakes</i>
<i>- A life full of mistakes</i>

715
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:05,754
My, this is your favorite liquor,
Chairwoman Seo.

716
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,352
(Byeongmun High School)

717
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:08,692
Oh, my.

718
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:11,708
- It smells amazing.
- Right?

719
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:15,032
Chairwoman Seo,
it's so elegant just like you.

720
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:18,532
Such important guests are here,
so I should serve this rare liquor.

721
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:19,902
However,

722
00:46:20,002 --> 00:46:22,442
this isn't the one
I cherish the most.

723
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,318
- What?
- Oh, my.

724
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,852
The founding chairman
Seo Byeong Mun...

725
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:35,552
brewed this liquor himself
to drink to celebrate...

726
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:38,622
a very important, historical day.

727
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:40,192
Fortunately or not,

728
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,662
that day has not yet come,
and I inherited the liquor.

729
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:46,132
My plan...

730
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:49,002
is to share this liquor with you...

731
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:51,932
to commemorate the day...

732
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:53,732
Edu-City is completed...

733
00:46:53,872 --> 00:46:57,272
and a new era truly begins.

734
00:46:57,672 --> 00:47:00,188
That would be a glorious day.

735
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:04,012
I think a child's potential
is decided the moment they're born.

736
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:08,128
Even when we buy a mutt
in the corner of a market,

737
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:09,982
we pick the healthiest one.

738
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:12,252
We're even more choosy with people.

739
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,992
Students with no hope or future...

740
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:18,792
should be made to give up sooner.

741
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:23,578
Looking out for such kids
and forcing them to study...

742
00:47:23,602 --> 00:47:26,702
by giving them a fair chance
for the sake of equality of outcome?

743
00:47:26,702 --> 00:47:29,318
I think that's a waste.

744
00:47:29,342 --> 00:47:31,602
We're already short on taxes.

745
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:38,682
One genius supports
tens of thousands of people.

746
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:41,722
The world is led by
the elite one percent,

747
00:47:41,782 --> 00:47:44,252
and my plan
is to fill that one percent...

748
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:47,922
with Byeongmun graduates.

749
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:53,232
More accomplished graduates
ready to lead the new era.

750
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,462
Just hearing that got me excited.

751
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,748
Congratulations in advance
on your new Edu-City.

752
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:00,848
Thank you so much, ma'am.

753
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:03,618
But you know, it may look like...

754
00:48:03,642 --> 00:48:07,472
the new era is at our doorstep.

755
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:10,358
But until the very last moment,

756
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:12,788
we must all give our best efforts...

757
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:15,498
to ensure what we want comes true.

758
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:18,052
Or that time will never come.

759
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:22,662
Until the day
the world of the one percent comes,

760
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:24,992
could you all please...

761
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,992
give one percent more?

762
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:28,778
We'll do everything in our power...

763
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:31,032
so you accomplish
what you set out to.

764
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:32,472
Thank you so much.

765
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:34,202
How about a toast?

766
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,642
Why not?

767
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:39,918
For our own one percent.

768
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:41,782
For Edu-City.

769
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:44,182
For Byeongmun Foundation.

770
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:46,012
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

771
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:51,922
Thank you.

772
00:48:58,592 --> 00:49:01,632
How about we discuss...

773
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:05,072
the program for our kids?

774
00:49:05,232 --> 00:49:07,372
I'm sorry. I droned on.

775
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:08,642
That's fine.

776
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,102
Principal Park?

777
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:20,994
<i>Bravo, bravo</i>

778
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:24,564
<i>To my very own life</i>

779
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:29,128
<i>To our brilliant future</i>

780
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,628
If you're ready, let's begin.

781
00:49:31,128 --> 00:49:32,468
Yeong Hun.

782
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:35,744
I'm outside the switchboard room.

783
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:37,438
Hae Seong and Ms. Oh.

784
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:38,908
We're ready.

785
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,808
Okay. Let's do this.

786
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:44,548
Power cut, counting down. Three,

787
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:46,818
two,

788
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:48,664
one.

789
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:50,455
(Annex, Power)

790
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,518
(The 24th Anniversary
of Byeongmun High School)

791
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,094
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

792
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,258
Where's the staff?

793
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,458
Everyone! I'm sure it's nothing.

794
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,458
Calm down.

795
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,658
Calm down, kids.

796
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,028
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

797
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,068
I don't know.

798
00:50:04,498 --> 00:50:06,238
Go check it out.

799
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:11,108
It's a temporary power outage.

800
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,008
Quickly find out what happened.

801
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:14,338
Yes, ma'am.

802
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:17,508
Principal Park.

803
00:50:17,578 --> 00:50:19,918
It's not a technical issue.
It's an electrical malfunction.

804
00:50:20,348 --> 00:50:22,418
It must be the switchboard room.

805
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:23,618
I'll check the switchboard room.

806
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:25,758
You secure the chairwoman's office.

807
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,748
Nice one, NIS.

808
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:55,178
- I didn't even see that.
- We had no time.

809
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:00,388
We're heading
to the chairwoman's office.

810
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:06,528
- Oh, good.
- The power's back.

811
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:07,858
My gosh.

812
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,568
I'm sorry for the confusion.
Shall we go downstairs?

813
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:17,468
The power shouldn't be back already.

814
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:22,008
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

815
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:23,348
Excuse me.

816
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:26,448
Hello?

817
00:51:26,448 --> 00:51:28,118
The power is back on.

818
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:31,118
(Flowing electric current)

819
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:32,458
Okay.

820
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,658
What's this?

821
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,758
What happened?

822
00:51:37,788 --> 00:51:40,274
You said it would take him
three minutes to get there!

823
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,198
I didn't know he walked so fast.

824
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:43,868
This is madness.

825
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:47,838
Don't worry, sir.

826
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,768
We still have...

827
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:52,578
a hidden card for emergencies.

828
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:59,448
Who's in charge here?

829
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,748
Sorry. Who are you?

830
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,218
Me?

831
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:08,688
What's his name?

832
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:10,928
I'm some student's dad.

833
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:15,668
How could there be a power outage
during such a big event?

834
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:18,844
I fell down the stairs
and almost broke every bone!

835
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:21,068
You look just fine, sir.

836
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:32,978
My back.

837
00:52:33,678 --> 00:52:35,018
The fourth lumbar vertebrae!

838
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,258
No, wait.

839
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,268
Now we can go.

840
00:53:18,928 --> 00:53:20,258
It didn't work?

841
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:26,838
Yeong Hun, I need more time.

842
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:29,008
I get it, sir.

843
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,278
Instead of freaking out here,
why not go to a hospital?

844
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:38,048
Is this how you react
when a parent says...

845
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,548
he fell down the stairs?

846
00:53:40,378 --> 00:53:41,678
You!

847
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:43,248
Do you know who I am?

848
00:53:43,248 --> 00:53:46,418
You took my boss to eat,
bathe, play soccer, play basketball,

849
00:53:46,418 --> 00:53:48,728
play baseball,
and jogged with him too, right?

850
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:51,158
- You can go.
- Come on. Get going.

851
00:53:51,858 --> 00:53:54,698
Okay, fine. I'll leave.

852
00:53:55,158 --> 00:53:56,798
Even if I must...

853
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:59,614
You can't smoke indoors.

854
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:02,008
It's a perfect day to smoke outside.

855
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:03,584
- Get out.
- Leave.

856
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,108
Wait. Who are you?

857
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:06,138
- Leave.
- Wait!

858
00:54:06,138 --> 00:54:08,508
You!

859
00:54:15,688 --> 00:54:17,988
How could you do this to me?

860
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:21,418
What about the baby I'm carrying?

861
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:26,228
Go that way.

862
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:27,958
Hurry!

863
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:34,838
Who are you?

864
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:36,768
Stay close.

865
00:54:37,268 --> 00:54:38,908
Be prepared to use what I gave you.

866
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,408
You want me to poke someone with it?

867
00:54:40,638 --> 00:54:42,448
An honorary field agent should.

868
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:45,448
Enough talking. Moving in.

869
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,448
- Darn you.
- You punk.

870
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,088
Move.

871
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:04,128
Sorry.

872
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:10,508
Come here!

873
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:24,188
Behind you!

874
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,258
What was I to you?

875
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:30,558
Was I just a one-night stand?

876
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:32,598
We only kissed.

877
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:34,774
You said...

878
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,928
you didn't like me.

879
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,268
You fool! Don't you see how I feel?

880
00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:02,158
You tried.

881
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:21,478
What's wrong with me?

882
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:39,428
Good job. Thanks.

883
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,968
Yeong Hun, clean up for me.

884
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:54,578
Going in.

885
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:01,878
Agent Jeong. Over there.

886
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:23,308
- What?
- Never mind.

887
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:33,154
Next, we'll sing
Byeongmun High School's song.

888
00:57:33,178 --> 00:57:35,748
Please stand up.

889
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:38,958
Let's sing the school song.

890
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:43,218
(The 24th Anniversary
of Byeongmun High School)

891
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:45,058
The event's continuing.
Now's your chance.

892
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:46,898
Shall we begin?

893
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:48,528
Let's begin.

894
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,028
Three, four.

895
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:05,348
What's wrong?

896
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:08,154
This key isn't working.

897
00:58:08,178 --> 00:58:10,018
Is it broken? Then...

898
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:12,488
there's no point in playing.

899
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:15,164
Let's keep going.

900
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:16,888
Something might happen at the end.

901
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:19,058
Okay. Let's start over.

902
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:39,224
<i>Our country shines bright</i>

903
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:43,724
<i>And so does Byeongmun High</i>

904
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:49,888
<i>So does Byeongmun High</i>

905
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:53,928
Nothing happened.

906
00:59:09,008 --> 00:59:10,348
What now?

907
00:59:16,118 --> 00:59:17,618
Hae Seong, leave for now.

908
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:19,418
It's dangerous for you to stay.

909
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:24,988
Delete your entry record
and get out of there!

910
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,698
We're leaving.

911
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:55,727

(Domestic Team 4)

920
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:08,198
Welcome to the NIS, Jeong Si Hyun.

921
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:12,698
Thank you.

922
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:14,998
You're a field agent,

923
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:17,268
so you need an alias.

924
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:21,708
A name our colleagues and I
will call you by.

925
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:23,878
Have you thought of one?

926
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:31,618
- Si Hyun, let's eat.
- Dad.

927
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,188
It says Liu Bei's other name
was "Xuande."

928
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:35,588
What's the other name for?

929
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:41,858
("Romance of the Three Kingdoms")

930
01:01:41,858 --> 01:01:43,368
To put it simply,

931
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:46,098
it's the name others call you by.

932
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:49,208
Long ago, it was rude
for others to use the name...

933
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:51,208
your parents gave you.

934
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:52,838
I see.

935
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:55,438
- I want one too.
- What?

936
01:01:55,808 --> 01:01:58,478
I like stars,
so I'll be called "Hae Seong."

937
01:01:58,578 --> 01:01:59,618
"Hae Seong?"

938
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,018
You know,
the word they use for comets.

939
01:02:03,448 --> 01:02:05,150
It passes by our earth.

940
01:02:05,174 --> 01:02:08,134
(Hae Seong)

941
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,528
Here.

942
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,698
This is it? You won't regret it?

943
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,598
No.

944
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:17,968
You can call me "Hae Seong" now.

945
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,138
Hae Seong.

946
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:24,868
Jeong Hae Seong.

947
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,908
I had no idea there was this side
to her project.

948
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:03,678
Did you give up
becoming a full-time teacher?

949
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:06,894
How many times did I tell you
to leave the council members alone?

950
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:08,894
Could you help?

951
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,088
We must stop them somehow.

952
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:11,564
Let's go. Do it with me.

953
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:12,888
Did you forget what the mission was?

954
01:03:12,888 --> 01:03:14,818
What have you been thinking
since you were in...

955
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:16,334
the chairwoman's office?

956
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:19,458
It was Seo Myeong Ju
who put me on this mission.

957
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,804
Jeong Hae Seong has been
crossing the line these days.

958
01:03:21,828 --> 01:03:23,568
Why does it feel like
you're obsessed with the gold bars?

959
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:25,768
You could really die.

960
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:48,518
Are you stupid?

961
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,958
Do, sol.

962
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:54,034
Do, sol.

963
01:03:54,058 --> 01:03:55,498
Do, sol. That's it.

964
01:03:55,968 --> 01:03:57,528
You can't even memorize that?

965
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,498
Sorry.

966
01:04:02,198 --> 01:04:04,708
- Can we get through it once?
- Okay.

967
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:08,138
Let's try again. Ready, and go.

968
01:04:19,558 --> 01:04:20,858
Do.

969
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,258
Yes.

970
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,828
- Is that right?
- Yes.
