(Episode 4)

6
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,503
My goodness!

7
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:28,332
Who are you?

8
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,003
A high-school student.

9
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,393
Raise a hand if you're Gu Sang Tae.

10
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:56,733
Are you Gu Sang Tae?

11
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:58,778
Well...

12
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,703
That is me, but...

13
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,308
why is a teen looking for me?

14
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,478
Do you want a job?

15
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:05,072
You know Park Tae Soo, right?

16
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:07,319
Bring me everything on him.

17
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,582
Where are your manners?

18
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:11,983
Hey. How old are you?

19
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,683
Leave it.

20
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:16,983
Kids these days learn manners
from fantasy novels.

21
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,128
Teach him a lesson and send him off.

22
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,993
- Yes, boss.
- Okay.

23
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:23,262
You're dead meat.

24
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,892
Let's warm up.

25
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,303
- Let's go.
- Who is this freak?

26
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,982
Hae Seong!

27
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,963
Hae Seong!

28
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,903
How did you know I was here?

29
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,083
Damn you.

30
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,482
He filled us in on the way.

31
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,158
There's no time. Get the files.

32
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,482
Got it.

33
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,269
And you.

34
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,623
Why didn't you tell us
you could be disciplined for bullying?

35
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,863
I'd never have known
if he hadn't told me.

36
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,503
Sorry.

37
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,933
I get you don't want to be
a nuisance to others...

38
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,442
but learn to lean on us.

39
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:20,042
Share the load and rely on others.

40
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:21,672
We're a team!

41
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,213
Yes.

42
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,989
You're cool and all,
but strangely, you're shy.

43
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,413
Shut your mouth.

44
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:30,952
I got it.

45
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,322
We'll clean this place up.
You get going.

46
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:38,762
And...

47
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,092
you might need a witness.

48
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,632
Take this guy with you.

49
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:45,603
Okay.

50
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,142
Stop!

51
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,282
Jeong Hae Seong!

52
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,282
Hae Seong!

53
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,613
Hae Seong! You look awesome!

54
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:36,929
Look over here!

55
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,799
Will you give me a ride?

56
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:41,223
Hae Seong!

57
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,392
Look at him.

58
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,202
I'm sorry I'm late.

59
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:01,543
Shall we begin?

60
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,159
Jeong Hae Seong.

61
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,659
What are you doing?

62
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:05,989
Not only are you late,

63
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,152
but you also brought a stranger
to the session?

64
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:09,253
Who's he?

65
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:11,128
He's an important witness
to this incident.

66
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,053
It took me a while to persuade him.

67
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:15,599
What do you mean by that? A witness?

68
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:16,923
Just a moment.

69
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,179
Now's the time
for you to tell the truth.

70
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:26,532
Or you'll get beaten to death
like before.

71
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:32,549
The actual operator
of the illegal gambling site,

72
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,142
Mr. Gu Sang Tae.

73
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,842
- Yes.
- Do you know someone present?

74
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:39,613
Yes, I do.

75
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,522
Him.

76
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,493
What are you trying to pull?

77
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:55,092
Mister. Do you know me?

78
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,103
How do you know each other?

79
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:00,532
You punk.

80
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,942
He's a VIP member of my site.

81
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:08,543
He owes me a great deal of money.

82
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:12,282
In return for reducing the debt,

83
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,853
he brought new members...

84
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,782
and ID cards I could use.

85
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,123
The police arrested an old woman.

86
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,753
Blame him for that.

87
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:25,763
Father.

88
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:28,708
He's lying. Believe me.

89
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,063
Keep quiet.

90
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:34,149
So what does the man
you brought here saying...

91
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:36,702
have anything to do
with this session?

92
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,179
You seem to be mistaken.

93
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,049
We're not here about my son.

94
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:43,483
If you're asking
if I was violent against Dong Min...

95
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,082
No.

96
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,913
I didn't do that.

97
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,022
Then who bullied Dong Min?

98
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,892
You all know the truth.

99
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:09,942
He threatened the students
to register on the gambling site.

100
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:13,473
He stole their family members' IDs
to carry out crimes.

101
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:15,942
Just because they're weaker.

102
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,942
Just because he thinks he can.

103
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,413
He beat up a student,

104
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,353
stomped on him,

105
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:25,983
spit in his food,

106
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,853
and locked him in a trash collector.

107
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:31,892
You son of a bitch.

108
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,632
I don't believe this.

109
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:44,073
Dong Min. You tell them.

110
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,542
Come on. Say something.

111
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:53,253
He bullied you, not me.

112
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:56,922
Dong Min.

113
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:00,323
In a session like this,
the victim's statement...

114
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,353
is like court evidence.

115
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:05,823
So I need you to think carefully
before you speak.

116
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:08,863
About what you said earlier.

117
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,302
Do you have anything to add?

118
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,613
Very well.

119
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,058
Vice-principal Baek.

120
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:25,919
Regarding the school bullying issue,

121
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,912
this school will discipline
Jeong Hae Seong...

122
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:32,582
by expelling him for his actions
that brought shame...

123
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:33,892
No.

124
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,863
It wasn't Hae Seong.

125
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,833
Tae Soo made me do it.

126
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,503
Everything Tae Soo did to me.

127
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,103
He told me to frame Hae Seong.

128
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,773
He used my grandma to threaten me.

129
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,113
Hey.

130
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,812
Shut your mouth.

131
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,812
Dong Min.

132
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,152
Can you be responsible
for what you said?

133
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:03,782
Can you?

134
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:06,323
Can you be responsible?

135
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,022
Nothing you say...

136
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,863
will change the truth.

137
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:15,132
Even if others say
I'm insisting without proof,

138
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,003
I'll speak up until the end.

139
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,733
Dong Min.

140
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,842
Thank you.

141
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,282
You did enough.

142
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,282
I'm so sorry.

143
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,753
Don't cry, punk. You look ugly.

144
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,052
You were cool just now.

145
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,422
I'll take it from here.

146
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,039
Here's the evidence
on Park Tae Soo that backs up...

147
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,802
what Gu Sang Tae said.

148
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,103
- Open the files.
- Where'd you get this?

149
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,373
Don't ask, just do it.
Everyone's waiting.

150
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,129
- Can I go now?
- Stay here.

151
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:13,453
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,363
(USB flash drive)

153
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:22,620
(Files)

154
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,772
Here.

155
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,812
Damn it.

156
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,527
(Identity Card)

157
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,136
(Baek Kwang Du)

158
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,693
Evidence, a witness,
a victim's statement...

159
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,962
This is enough to land you
in a police station,

160
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,963
not an anti-bullying
committee session.

161
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:57,503
Turn it off.

162
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,578
Turn it off, you bastard.

163
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:02,172
Congratulations, Tae Soo.

164
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,372
You're done for.

165
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:06,073
Turn it off, you bastard!

166
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,682
You punched me first.

167
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,052
Tae Soo!

168
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:18,529
You lunatic.

169
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,353
You dare punch my son?

170
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,753
He's my student!

171
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,662
Who do you think you are?

172
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:28,193
Honey!

173
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,172
Honey.

174
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,873
Tae Soo.

175
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:38,767
Mr. Park.

176
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,703
(Seo Myeong Ju)

177
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:41,012
Oh, dear.

178
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,512
Are you all right?

179
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,683
Shall I call an ambulance?

180
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,183
Or your aide if you're embarrassed?

181
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:51,583
- Damn it.
- I don't have your aide's number.

182
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,922
What can I do to help you?

183
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,963
- Well done.
- Thank you.

184
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,512
- Hae Seong.
- What?

185
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,213
Sorry for everything.

186
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:24,382
I should've been honest
from the start.

187
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,052
You had your reasons.

188
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:30,993
Buy me a pastry.

189
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,693
Why are you nice to me?

190
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:38,203
I'd always wanted to know.

191
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:41,833
Everyone else
acts like I'm invisible.

192
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,343
You don't.

193
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:50,483
Because you're like someone I know?

194
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,152
It's a shame you hurt your back.

195
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,583
I have no choice but to say...

196
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,723
we must expel your son.

197
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:04,023
Chairwoman.

198
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,938
He's involved in a criminal case.

199
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,592
That's beyond anything I can accept,

200
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:11,703
and Tae Soo presents
too big of a risk...

201
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,402
for our school to take on.

202
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:17,272
You took him in
to reap the benefits,

203
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,402
and now you'll discard him?

204
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,973
Chairwoman. You can't do that.

205
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:25,318
Have you forgotten...

206
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,483
who helped you
get Edu-City green-lit?

207
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:31,083
You still owe
hundreds of millions of dollars.

208
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,282
One wrong rumor...

209
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:35,629
could ruin your lifelong dream...

210
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:37,723
right before your eyes.

211
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,032
Let's do what's good for us both.

212
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:43,632
If you get the message,

213
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,662
you'll let my son stay.

214
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:49,549
This is the problem
with politicians.

215
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:51,273
- What?
- They forget...

216
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:54,672
how they got there
and who got them there.

217
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:57,412
They completely forget
how it started.

218
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,443
Why you crazy...

219
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,792
Be gentle.

220
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,922
Gently, please.

221
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,662
You're such a baby.

222
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,902
Tae Soo was expelled.

223
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:24,843
That's good to hear.

224
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,743
Not even an assemblyman
could shield him.

225
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,082
Even if you mean well,

226
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:33,552
you can't go around
beating people up.

227
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,213
It's a warning instead of a penalty.

228
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,253
I'll be careful.

229
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:03,583
We're done.

230
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,713
Take this and put it on regularly.

231
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,493
- Thank you.
- For what?

232
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:18,963
For posting online.

233
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,562
I can say for sure that...

234
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,762
not anyone could've done that.

235
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:25,562
I'm proud of you.

236
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:29,733
That wasn't me.

237
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:31,448
It was...

238
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:34,113
someone who was really awesome.

239
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,812
How dare you say...

240
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:41,282
you're proud of your teacher?
That's too arrogant...

241
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,402
This was on your head.

242
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,522
Where are you going?

243
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,332
The gold bars
left by the foundation's...

244
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:35,473
first chairman.

245
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:39,272
We should speed things up.

246
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,883
The girl who always came second...

247
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,953
to her friend.

248
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,172
(Report Card)

249
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,962
(Ranked 2nd)

250
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,393
Eun Ok came first.

251
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,133
- What?
- Let's see.

252
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,762
- Eun Ok!
- Oh, my.

253
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,639
- Congratulations.
- You did so well!

254
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:40,603
- Good for you.
- I know you studied hard.

255
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:43,333
- Look at this!
- She came first!

256
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,173
Blinded by jealousy over her friend,

257
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,612
she did something
she should have never done.

258
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,602
She fell, hit the ground
with her head, and died.

259
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:17,372
Seeing her friend's body lying
on the ground, she thought,

260
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:23,983
"Now,"

261
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,213
"I can come first."

262
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,893
(Byeongmun High School)

263
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,612
The girl who killed her friend...

264
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:37,753
was found dead.

265
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:41,498
After that,
rumors started to spread.

266
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,352
"You should never be at school..."

267
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,923
"when the clock bell chimes."

268
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:49,393
"Crimson eyes will come for you."

269
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,933
And there are
two more stories like this?

270
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:55,572
Like I said,
there are four in total.

271
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:58,173
Do you know what's really spooky?

272
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:01,673
No one knows the fourth story.

273
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,713
- You don't know either?
- No.

274
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,842
Even though I've been reading books
and scouring the Internet.

275
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,953
I'm still researching
but haven't found a single clue yet.

276
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:17,762
Anyway, Hae Seong.

277
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:20,393
Why are these people here?

278
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,762
What?

279
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:26,633
Goodness!

280
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:30,379
What are you doing here?

281
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:33,072
- This place is so scary.
- I'm really scared.

282
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,372
Hey, turn on the lights.

283
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:39,312
My goodness.

284
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,028
Oh, well...

285
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,353
Do you know these people?

286
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,923
Oh, I guess I didn't tell you.

287
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:47,493
I work here part-time.

288
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,022
I see.

289
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,233
All right.

290
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,102
You punk. You should study hard.

291
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:15,153
You, Hae Seong's friend.
What's your name?

292
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,953
- I'm Lee Dong Min.
- I see.

293
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:20,393
Come by often. You can come alone.

294
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,153
I'll give you many freebies.

295
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,562
You must be hungry. Dig in. Eat up.

296
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:27,238
Thanks for this.

297
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,292
It just came out of the oven.
Eat it while it's still warm.

298
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:38,203
- It's so good.
- Is it?

299
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:48,812
What is this? Why is this so tasty?

300
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:53,582
Here.

301
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,998
It must've given your grandma
such a scare.

302
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,493
Go and take good care of her.

303
00:22:58,423 --> 00:22:59,762
Thanks.

304
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,093
It sure is nice to have a friend.

305
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:04,909
Come on. Don't make me cringe.

306
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,802
And you won't call me once
after we graduate.

307
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,203
I'll definitely stay in touch
with you.

308
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,133
Sure, whatever.

309
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,503
We'll see about that.

310
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:13,903
I'm off.

00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,933
What's with you today?

313
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:40,403
Hey.

314
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,034
If you just want to stare at the wall,
do it somewhere else.

315
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,044
I'm losing my appetite
because of you.

316
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,144
What is it? Did something happen?

317
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,814
No, it's nothing.

318
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:55,614
I just feel like...

319
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,723
my heart is...

320
00:23:58,554 --> 00:23:59,884
skipping.

321
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:02,794
Does it feel different
from when it's fluttering?

322
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,064
Yes, it's different.

323
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,493
It's kind of like...

324
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,463
You don't need to know.

325
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,134
I'm sorry, Yu Jeong.
You must be exhausted.

326
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,480
No. I got to see many things,
thanks to you. It was fun.

327
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:21,514
I only bought things for myself,
didn't I?

328
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:23,574
How come you didn't get anything?
You should've bought something.

329
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:26,584
I didn't really see anything
I needed. It's all good.

330
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:30,854
Let's go together again next week.

331
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,830
Actually, forget it.

332
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,030
We'll be busy studying for midterms.

333
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:37,423
You're right.

334
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,199
You always come first anyway.

335
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:41,564
Congratulations, in advance.

336
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,780
I know
you've been studying very hard.

337
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:45,334
What if you beat me this time?

338
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:48,550
No way. Me? Beat you?

339
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,834
How?

340
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,144
You don't think so?

341
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,673
Who's that for?

342
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:56,389
Oh, this? This is for Hae Seong.

00:24:58,383 --> 00:25:00,344
Oh, I see.

345
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,513
Are you interested in Hae Seong?

346
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:07,023
If I must tell you, yes.
I'm very interested.

347
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:12,693
Gosh, I'm tired
from all the walking.

348
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,364
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

349
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,433
- See you at school.
- Yes.

350
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,493

for the student council...

00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:57,949
As you all know,

354
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,720
the school was in a bit of an uproar
because of Tae Soo.

355
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:02,149
So, the higher-ups want...

356
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:04,560
to appoint an advising teacher
for the student council.

357
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,859
Is anyone interested
in the position?

358
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:07,784
It sounds like an honorary title,

359
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,560
but who wants to be ordered around
by those students?

360
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,723
They're the ones who call the shots.
No teacher can mess with them.

361

Hey, teachers.
Are you all going to stay quiet?

362
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:18,963
The meeting won't end until
we pick someone for the position.

363
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:28,233
All right.

364
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:31,473
Then if you don't want the position,
leave the room now.

Of course, you won't hesitate
to make a sacrifice, Ms. Oh.

This is why
I'm so fond of you, Ms. Oh.

367
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,223

in joining the council.

return this and get a refund.

- What?
- If you have money to buy this,

429
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:14,970
you should buy workbooks instead.

430

the chairwoman of the school,

431

but you shouldn't spend frivolously.

to be your friend, so...

547
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:33,934
I think this comes down
to your willpower.

548
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:39,880
What now? This is terrible.

549
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:41,614
This can't be.

550
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,373
I blame the shift in curriculum.

551
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:45,914
How far away are the midterms?

552
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:51,313
Hae Seong, get a grip on yourself
and look at me.

553
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:54,130
We'll do whatever it takes
to get those signatures,

554
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:55,494
so focus.

555
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,393
Focus on the midterms.

556
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:01,493
This can't be.
My brain got me into the NIS.

557
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:03,063
I get it, so that's enough.

558
00:38:03,493 --> 00:38:06,463
You were good in school
which means you'll catch up easily.

559
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:07,963
Focus.

560
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:10,904
- Okay?
- Got it.

561
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,074
Good.

562
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,713
Unbelievable.

563
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,083
Tell me about it.

564
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:29,654
Here it is.

00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,523

567
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:45,173
I see you're focused.

568
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:49,643
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

569
00:38:51,984 --> 00:38:53,284
Here you go.

570
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,123
Are you ready for this?

571
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:12,034
Let us begin.

572
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:21,243
- No way.
- Come on.

573
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:23,544
- There's a cheese option.
- That looks so good!

574
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,444
- Come on.
- Get one too.

00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:28,713

00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:32,783
- Hurry.
- Check this out.

- What's that?
- No way.

579

If you vote for Jeong Hae Seong,

580
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,924
you get a free sandwich.

Did you check out
that sandwich place earlier?

618
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:14,360
It was hilarious.

619
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:15,993
Doesn't that count
as cheating though?

620
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,369
He's buying people's votes.

621
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,294
Isn't that what you also did,
Seung Jae?

622
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:20,924
What I did isn't the same.

623
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:23,464
Seung Jae, are you worried...

624
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,303
about Hae Seong
joining the student council?

625
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:27,264
I'm definitely going
to stop you from debuting.

626
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:28,603
Whatever.

627
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:33,273
Even if Jeong Hae Seong
hands in his application to join,

628
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,250
I'll be against it.

629
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:36,614
For what reason?

630
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:40,114
He drove Tae Soo out.

631
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:42,453
He may be a hero to the others...

632
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:44,454
but a traitor to us.

633
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,900
It doesn't seem right
for him to join us.

634
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,993
Why not?
Don't you think it'll be fun?

635
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:51,253
- Why you...
- Yu Jeong, how about you?

636
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,264
What's your take on it?

637
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,034

638
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:58,264
Well, I...

639
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,204
I wouldn't be too pleased
with him joining us either.

640
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:06,243
He only just transferred here,

641
00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:08,304
and we don't know him that well.

642
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:11,884
Maybe after he spends
more time here.

643
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,483
That was unexpected.

644
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:16,454
I thought you'd vote for him.

645
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:18,013
The Yu Jeong I know would've.

646
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,353
- Well...
- I must've been mistaken.

647
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,193
So? Did he get enough signatures?

648
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,323
It seems that way.

649
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:26,893
- Stop talking, will you?
- Why?

653
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:38,420

which wasn't an easy feat.

It's up to you now,

656
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,943

in the top ten.

00:42:47,643 --> 00:42:48,983
Good luck.

00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:50,483

- Be careful.

00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:58,423

to talk to someone older.

673
00:43:36,763 --> 00:43:38,094
Don't join.

00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,580

686
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:24,943

That sounds exhausting.

697
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:24,499
It's for the textbook.

698

Hold on, the textbook?

701
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:35,433
Did you see me?

702
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,202
You were visible.

703
00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:38,973
Why didn't you greet me, then?

704
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:41,172
You didn't either.

705
00:46:42,543 --> 00:46:44,383

to greet me first?

How has Jeong Hae Seong been
after the Anti-School Bullying Committee?

712
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:10,343
He handed in his application
to join the student council.

713
00:47:10,472 --> 00:47:12,473
- Our student council?
- Yes.

714
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:23,022
I hope it works out for him.

715
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:28,093
What happened during the session
proved he's a loose cannon.

716
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:31,462
He could stir up more ruckus,
so keep an eye on him.

717

she'll be under special care.

She worries me.

727
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,053
Mom, come on.

728
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:02,198
I'll get going, then.

729
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:04,363
Thank you for working
well into the night.

730
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:06,093
Get home safely.

731
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:08,493
Are you leaving already?

732
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,502
You're more than welcome to stay.

733
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:12,263
It's already quite late.

734
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:14,133
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

735
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,372
Then...

736
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:17,942
Sure.

737
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,082
I'll get going too.

738
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,823
Was the dinner necessary?

739
00:48:37,822 --> 00:48:39,162
Midterms are
right around the corner.

740
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:40,933
Shouldn't you
spend your time wisely?

741
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:43,663
You've been sleeping
a lot lately too.

742
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,933
Why don't you cut back an hour?

743
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,572
Mom, I only get
about four hours of sleep...

744
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:51,548
This is medicine for ADHD.

745
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:53,413
I hear it helps one focus.

746
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:56,942
Take one a day.

747
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:01,913
Ye Na?

748
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:18,863
My daughter.

749
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,942
You know I love you, don't you?

750
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,042
Everything I do...

751
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:32,783
is for you. You know that, right?

752
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:36,982
- I know, Mom.
- No one...

753
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:40,223
remembers those who come in second.

754
00:49:41,122 --> 00:49:44,462
Second place
is only first place among losers.

755
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:46,893
You see,

756
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:50,232
I want my Ye Na...

757
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:57,602
to be someone this world remembers.

758
00:49:58,802 --> 00:50:00,143
Sure, Mom.

759
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,672
I'll keep that in mind.

760
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:17,663
Ye Na.

761
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:26,902
Take it now.

762
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:05,742
Hey, Mi Jeong.

763
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:07,772
Hae Seong, we have a problem.

(Korean History)

765
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:19,893
What?

766
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,922
Say that again.
What about Jeong Hae Seong?

767
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:27,562
You see, Hae Seong...

768
00:51:28,032 --> 00:51:29,533
You're not feeling well?

769
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:31,562
Yes, I'm afraid...

770
00:51:34,102 --> 00:51:36,033
I have a severe cold.

771
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,002
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

772
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:40,243
I should be in school today but...

773
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:43,513
Is it bad?

774
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:46,352
- Did you take your meds?
- Yes.

775
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:48,953
A day of rest will do the trick.

776
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:52,652
Sure. See you tomorrow.

777
00:51:57,722 --> 00:51:59,022
Hae Seong!

778
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:00,893
Hurry on in.

(Welcome to Reserve Forces Training)

780
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,242
With this being a covert operation,

781
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,613
we weren't able to communicate
with the Ministry of National Defense.

782
00:52:17,282 --> 00:52:18,613
You!

784
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:54,313
Hello?

785
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,982
Hae Seong, how's the cold?

786
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:03,468
I'm still running a fever.

787
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:05,192
That's lasting quite long.

788
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:07,833
I'm on my way
with porridge and medicine,

789
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:08,963
so sleep until then.

790
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:11,333
You live in the rooftop unit
of Chanseo Villa...

791
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,948
that's at the school intersection.

792
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:14,272
What?

793
00:53:26,713 --> 00:53:30,022
Still, we dodged a bullet
with Hae Seong today.

794
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:32,622
What would we have done...

795
00:53:32,622 --> 00:53:33,868
if it were a two-night
mobilization training?

796
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:35,493
Don't even mention that.

797
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:37,192
The thought of it
sends chills down my spine.

798
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:40,933
- Are you done cleaning up?
- Yes.

799
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:42,993
Call Hae Seong over
for some barbecue.

800
00:53:47,802 --> 00:53:50,548
Hey, Hae Seong.
I was just about to call you.

801
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:51,572
Sir,

802
00:53:51,572 --> 00:53:53,113
that rooftop unit
on my student record.

803
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:54,643
How has the room been set?

804
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:57,012
Hey, has the rooftop unit
been set up?

805
00:53:57,012 --> 00:53:58,442
- No.
- Why not?

806
00:53:58,543 --> 00:54:00,582
- I was going to do it next week.
- I see.

807
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:03,482
It's still an empty unit. Why?

808
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:07,852
What?

809
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:10,422
You've got to be kidding me.

810
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:12,122
Code black.

811
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:24,542
This can't go cold.

812
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:58,272
- Come on!
- Damn it.

813
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:01,772
Didn't you bring anything?

814
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:04,142
Who'd believe
I live in an empty unit?

815
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:05,813
How could we bring anything
on short notice?

816
00:55:05,813 --> 00:55:07,452
This would compromise
the entire mission.

817
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:08,552
Is there a way out of this?

818
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:10,198
Failing the mission
won't be the worst of it.

819
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:11,999
You should've gotten this done!

820
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:14,222
I didn't have any days off!

821
00:55:14,222 --> 00:55:15,622
Shut it. That's enough!

822
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:21,732
I know where we can find
what we need.

823
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:26,973
Right there.

824
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:33,513
Sir, are you suggesting
that we borrow everything?

825
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,743
Do you have a better idea?

826
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,183
If not, do as I say.

827
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,553
Listen up. This is an order
by your team leader.

828
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:43,753
Right this moment,

829
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:46,798
we will run around
this neighborhood...

830
00:55:46,822 --> 00:55:49,323
and obtain all that is needed
by a high school student living alone.

831
00:55:50,162 --> 00:55:52,138
- Did you bring your school uniform?
- It's back at home.

832
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,633
How could you have forgotten that?

833
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:55,809
Things were happening too fast.
What's next?

834
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,133
Okay, fine.

835
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:00,073
Yeong Hun, Mi Jeong,
get everything he needs...

836
00:56:00,102 --> 00:56:03,573
from his school uniform
to necessities.

837
00:56:03,642 --> 00:56:05,379
In the meantime, we'll focus...

838
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,113
on securing a TV, a laptop,
and other appliances.

839
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,243
What's the ETA on your teacher?

840
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,843
- She'll be here in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

841
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:13,883
Time your clocks.
We have 15 minutes.

842
00:56:15,412 --> 00:56:16,583
Hear me loud and clear.

843
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,752
There is no room for error.

14 minutes and 55 seconds.

- The cold must be severe.
- Not really.

Get some rest while I clean up.

There is one open late.

908
01:01:55,322 --> 01:01:56,652
Don't.

909
01:01:56,992 --> 01:01:59,163
Don't you dare.

910
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:03,933
Sure.

911
01:02:04,802 --> 01:02:06,732
Let's walk out together.

912
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:41,533
No, don't you dare!

913
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:18,042
Someone needs...

914
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,872
to explain.

915
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:34,082
(Undercover High School)

916
01:03:56,472 --> 01:03:58,182
- I want to take one too.
- Can I?

917
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,689
- Me too.
- Am I next?

918
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:01,213
Can you take one of me too?

919
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,852
- No way.
- What's this called?

920
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,822
- It's fascinating.
- Where did you buy this?

921
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:09,223
Si Hyun,
you'll regret that later on.

922
01:04:09,352 --> 01:04:12,093
My mom said you needed
to eat beans to grow taller.

923
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:14,008
I believe I'm taller than you,
Bong Ja.

924
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:16,232
Later on, you idiot.

925
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:19,602
Besides, stop calling me Bong Ja.

926
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:20,749
Why?

927
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,533
I think it's a pretty name.

928
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:31,383
I'm watching my weight.

929
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,413
I'll throw it out anyway, so eat.

930
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:40,082
Hey, Oh Bong Ja!

931
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:52,562
I wonder how he's doing.

932
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:28,008
It's more than just suspicious.

933
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:30,649
There could be a chance
he isn't a student.

934
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:33,572
Stay clear of Oh Su A in school
from here on out.

935
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:34,912
What is this woman doing here?

936
01:05:34,912 --> 01:05:36,513
As if there's a way to avoid her.

937
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:38,782
I have the results of your midterms.

938
01:05:38,782 --> 01:05:40,113
How high did you rank?

939
01:05:40,282 --> 01:05:42,559
I bet this is the first time
Ye Na got crushed.

940
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:43,822
It's getting on my nerves.

941
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:46,658
Or maybe have him
kicked out of school.

942
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:48,722
Could the operation
have been leaked?

943
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:49,722
I want detailed reports...

944
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:51,722
on the staff and teachers
at Byeongmun High.

945
01:05:51,722 --> 01:05:53,562
Are you the one who sent the letter?

946
01:05:56,863 --> 01:05:58,323
