1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,409
(All places, organizations, characters,
incidents, and backstories...)

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,710
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,749
Where should I begin?

4
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,189
The secret operation...

5
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,230
that drastically changed
my world of darkness.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,970
It all began on that very day.

7
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,709
That night I had myself
immersed in the operation...

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,140
like any other mission.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,339
What are you gazing at me for?

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,710
Is this a blind date?

11
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,079
As if you need to
translate that.

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,649
Tell him to show me the money.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,290
Is it in dollars?

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,420
Thank you.

15
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:56,689
The item.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
He wants to see the item.

17
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,729
Oh, sure.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,640
He wasn't someone
easy to escort here.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,669
I breathed in all the
dust at the museum...

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,610
just to have him accompany me.

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,780
Watch yourself.

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,370
I've confirmed the item.

23
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,140
Listen up. I say this again.

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,738
It's a national treasure we
were barely able to locate...

25
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,459
by tracing transactions
on the black market.

26
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,209
It cannot be damaged.

27
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,409
We are to arrest those involved,

28
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:53,079
but securing the cultural
heritage is also a priority.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,569
Darn, it's quite the drop.

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,470
What now?

31
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,370
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,199
Who are you, darn it?

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,590
Next.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,870
Why you...

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Hands off.

36
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,569
What the...

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,740
You!

38
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,419
Keep your hands off
what belongs to others.

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,300
I surrender.

40
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,000
Item secured.

41
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,439
Agent Jeong, I'll
get going first.

42
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,409
Sure.

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,939
You're not going anywhere.

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,280
Don't you dare...

45
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,150
Sweet.

46
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,960
Agent Jeong!

47
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,099
Don't!

48
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,238
The next one will be for real.

49
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,379
Jeong Hae Seong,
have you lost it?

50
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,340
Put it down unless you
want a bullet to the brain.

51
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,449
You have three seconds.

52
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,419
- Three, two...
- You!

53
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,760
Drive!

54
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,210
Step on it.

55
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,710
That was electrifying.

56
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,848
Backup has arrived on scene.

57
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,618
They'll soon catch up
with you, so keep on him.

58
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:15,649
There's no time.

59
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,788
He'll soon hit the main street
and must be apprehended now.

60
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:18,918
That's an order.

61
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,960
Jeong Hae Seong, don't do
anything dangerous and follow...

62
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,959
Hello?

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
We got disconnected.

64
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,849
What the...

65
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,119
Pull over, you punk.

66
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,619
Seriously? Knock him over!

67
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,460
Where did he go? Is he gone?

68
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,799
I guess he's gone.

69
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,130
Hey!

70
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,799
What?

71
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,279
What...

72
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,780
Rock the car side
to side, darn it!

73
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,650
What now?

74
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,558
He's up there!

75
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,999
Rock the car hard!

76
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,868
Keep it up.

77
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,368
Side to side!

78
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,940
Come on, side to side.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,419
No, don't.

80
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,159
Wait. Hey!

81
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,830
Darn!

82
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,770
What's with him?

83
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,640
Stop!

84
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,869
Are you out of your mind?

85
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,130
You're done for.

86
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,399
No...

87
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,109
Hae Seong!

88
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,749
That's freaking awesome.

89
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,040
Mission complete.

90
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,988
What about Mr. Park
and the Chinese broker?

91
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,589
They were turned over
to the prosecution,

92
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,359
and Mr. Park has
been hospitalized.

93
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,729
As well as the driver.

94
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,460
Prison food will knock
some sense into them.

95
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,830
Anyway, good job on the mission.

96
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,769
And Yeong Hun...

97
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,239
You...

98
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,310
That was some good work.

99
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:13,210
Now, let's have a look.

100
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,580
How has Buddha been?

101
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,249
Goodness, I know...

102
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:23,019
it's been rough for you.

103
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,430
From here on out, we'll give
you the royal treatment.

104
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,639
(National Intelligence Service)

105
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:41,139
What... What happened to it?

106
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,639
This!

107
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,450
Where is the hand that
his chin rests on?

108
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,450
His arm...

109
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,519
Sir.

110
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
This...

111
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,229
This looks like a bullet.

112
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,099
A bullet?

113
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,200
Are you saying someone shot
at a national treasure?

114
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,109
No one fired a
shot at the scene.

115
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,440
The arm's been
completely severed.

116
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,910
Which punk had the
audacity to shoot...

117
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,820
Darn it.

118
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,639
(Serving in the shadows
to light the way forward)

119
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,369
An Seok Ho!

120
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,009
What now?

121
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,080
How will you fix this?

122
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,149
- I'm sorry.
- You think an apology will suffice?

123
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,349
Take a deep breath, Director.

124
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,889
Domestic Team Four
may lack in many ways,

125
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,759
but I doubt this was on purpose.

126
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,660
Whatever.

127
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,200
I want Agent Jeong gone.

128
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,700
- Sorry?
- Did I stutter?

129
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,539
One has to take
the fall for his.

130
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,700
Should it be you instead?

131
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,440
Sir, hold on.

132
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,670
Not Agent Jeong, sir.

133
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,539
Please consider his
devotion to this country.

134
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,508
I know Agent Jeong is one
of the best we have...

135
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,419
and that he's wasting his time
being on your moronic team.

136
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,489
But who are we?

137
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,220
The NIS.

138
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,290
A single mishap outweighs
100 successful missions.

139
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,459
Have him gone by tomorrow.

140
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,258
That's an order,
Senior Agent An.

141
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,899
- Director, please...
- Come on, Seok Ho.

142
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,238
No, let go of me.

143
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,169
Director!

144
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,139
I'll do whatever you ask.

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,410
- Let go!
- Senior Agent Gong.

146
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,749
Darn you.

147
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,889
Yes?

148
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,659
Are you sure you're
willing to do anything?

149
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,859
Absolutely. Of course, sir.

150
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,509
My gosh.

151
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,349
How could a bullet ricochet
like a ball on a pool table?

152
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,019
Give me a break.

153
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,489
There's being unlucky
and then this.

154
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,259
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,430
I should've been more careful.

156
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,029
Was it necessary for the
director to go this far?

157
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,498
It's not like Hae Seong
shot it on purpose.

158
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,199
It happened in the line of duty.

159
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,570
He shouldn't have
to resign over this.

160
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,840
Sir, are you really going...

161
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:05,239
to let Hae Seong turn
over his badge over this?

162
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,839
As if I have any
power to stop it.

163
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,609
I'm also someone
who follows orders.

164
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,759
But when the door
closes, a window opens.

165
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,790
He gave us an assignment
earlier today.

166
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,430
Hae Seong, it's the only way
you'll get to keep your job.

167
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,300
There's this school in Seoul.

168
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,769
Byeongmun High School. I'm
sure you've heard of it.

169
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:34,670
Hey, wait.

170
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,540
It's one of Korea's most
prestigious private high schools.

171
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,120
The first chairman of the
school was Seo Byeong Mun.

172
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,189
A traitor to our people who was
never recorded in history...

173
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,119
and the keeper of Emperor
Gojong's secret safe.

174
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,329
Ten tons of gold bars from
the Emperor's treasury...

175
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,488
were given to Seo Byeong
Mun for safekeeping...

176
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,569
which was to fund the nation's
independence movement.

177
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,830
The Emperor trusted
Seo Byeong Mun,

178
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,899
but the latter had other plans.

179
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,989
He deemed the nation
to be hopeless...

180
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,710
and pocketed all that gold
which would be equivalent...

181
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,820
to over 800 million
dollars today.

182
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,869
Hurrah for the
independence of Korea!

183
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,439
Hurrah for the
independence of Korea.

184
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,839
- Hurrah for...
- Hurrah for...

185
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,210
the independence of Korea!

186
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,210
Hurrah for the
independence of Korea!

187
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,180
Hurrah for the
independence of Korea!

188
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,148
Hurrah for the
independence of Korea!

189
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,550
But when Japan fell,

190
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:57,149
Seo Byeong Mun had
to go into hiding.

191
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,930
- In here! Come on!
- Get him!

192
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,998
- Go after him.
- Search every inch!

193
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,729
All that gold he wasn't
able to take with him...

194
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,279
is said to be in
slumber somewhere...

195
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,009
awaiting the day
to see the light.

196
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,579
That's more like
an urban legend.

197
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,589
Exactly. That was
my thought at first.

198
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,950
But then...

199
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,960
the director showed me this.

200
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,100
It's absolute proof that
the gold bars exist.

201
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,399
With this as its lead,

202
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
the NIS once investigated
the Byeongmun Foundation.

203
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,839
However, nothing was uncovered.

204
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,568
Where are the gold bars then if
the foundation doesn't have them?

205
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,239
The one place the NIS didn't
think to investigate at the time.

206
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,979
Byeongmun High School.

207
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,819
Recently, the NIS
received an anonymous tip.

208
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,119
We know that the gold bars
hidden by Seo Byeong Mun...

209
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
are somewhere
within the school...

210
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,190
and that the foundation will be
smuggling them out of the country.

211
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,499
All of the remaining gold bars?

212
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,359
The whole 800 million
dollars' worth?

213
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,099
If the gold leaves the country,

214
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,499
it will be a huge
loss of state funds.

215
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:22,610
The ramifications it will have on
the country will be catastrophic.

216
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,710
Hae Seong, what's
your take on it?

217
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,579
Where should I start?

218
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
Here's the actual mission.

219
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,220
Hae Seong, you're going
back to high school...

220
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,889
as a student attending
Byeongmun High.

221
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,788
Find the gold...

222
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,829
hidden by Seo Byeong Mun,
the traitor to our people.

223
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,460
This is Operation...

224
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,499
Undercover High School.

225
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,309
Have you lost your mind?

226
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,508
We don't have a lot of time.

227
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,149
The briefing will be tomorrow.

228
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,350
Just a second.

229
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,919
What is this nonsense?

230
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,950
- How can I go back to school?
- Don't worry.

231
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,149
You look incredibly
young for your age.

232
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,449
If anyone doubts your age,

233
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,318
say that your face aged rapidly
from a bad batch of herbal medicine,

234
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,989
and stick to that story.

235
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,689
- Are you serious?
- Yeong Hun, how old are you?

236
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,700
- I'm 26.
- You're in your 20s?

237
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,028
Why are you startled by that...

238
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,169
when I've been
calling you my senior?

239
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,969
I only thought that because I
joined the agency before you did.

240
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,330
I addressed you respectfully
thinking you were older than...

241
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,569
me.

242
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,710
How old did you think I was?

243
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
I thought you were
in your early 40s.

244
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:39,699
Was it the herbal
medicine you had as a kid?

245
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,190
- It was turtle extract.
- He had turtle extract.

246
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,620
See?

247
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,860
How about this, then?

248
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,988
I'll go undercover as a teacher.

249
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,629
No, that won't work.

250
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,258
There aren't any
available positions,

251
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,699
and the foundation would know.

252
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,768
- Still...
- No, that's enough talking.

253
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,940
I promised the director I'd
have you work this case.

254
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:03,569
(Have a Drink With Su A)

255
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,538
I can't do this. I won't.

256
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,650
Would you rather
get the boot, then?

257
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,950
Come on. There's no other way.

258
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,860
We're to take shelter
first when it pours.

259
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,130
Let's work on this
case, Hae Seong.

260
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,130
We'll arrest all
those who are corrupt,

261
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,559
retrieve 800 million dollars in
gold that belongs to the country,

262
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,269
and...

263
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,309
make a triumphant return.

264
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,149
<i>Did she come back
because she missed me?</i>

265
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,159
<i>Yes! Nice! I love
that Kwang Du is here</i>

266
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,190
- I love you too!
<i>- The one I waited for is Kwang Du</i>

267
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:59,999
<i>Kwang Du, I love you so much</i>

268
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:05,269
<i>So much</i>

269
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,210
Nice!

270
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,449
- You're the best!
- Thank you.

271
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,649
My gosh, Ms. Oh.

272
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,349
You could be a singer.

273
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,459
The spirit was
alive in your song.

274
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,289
Come here and let
me pour you a glass.

275
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,200
A drink from you, Vice-principal
Baek, would be an honor.

276
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,799
Happy birthday, sir!

277
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,338
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Happy birthday.

278
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,268
- I'm the one who's grateful.
- Move.

279
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,939
You held a party just for me.

280
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,509
I love you all.

281
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,278
He would've sulked all year
if we hadn't thrown a party.

282
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,410
Like last year.

283
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,389
What a nutjob.

284
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,028
This is how you
drink these days.

285
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,390
Bottoms up!

286
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,059
All of it?

287
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,370
Come on. Are you going to
ruin the mood like this?

288
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,929
That would definitely
be upsetting.

289
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,869
I'm the man of the hour today.

290
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,039
How can you think of becoming
a full-time teacher...

291
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,370
without listening
to your superiors?

292
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,309
That would probably
knock her out.

293
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,379
I was only joking.

294
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,679
Bottoms up.

295
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,548
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

296
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,549
- Bottoms up.
- Wait!

297
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,420
I'll drink it.

298
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,360
That was too loud.

299
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,789
Why would you drink
it instead, Mr. Lee?

300
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:42,170
Well... I'll be
her white knight.

301
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,970
Mr. Lee, are you
here on a blind date?

302
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,569
Sit down.

303
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,710
- Bottoms up.
- I'll drink it.

304
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,910
I can hold my liquor
like no other.

305
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,548
As if that makes any sense
when you only drink coke.

306
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:56,610
Now, sit!

307
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,179
Sit. Don't move. Sit.

308
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,578
Wait. Don't move.

309
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,150
Enough!

310
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,419
I, Oh Su A, homeroom teacher...

311
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,020
of Class 1 of Grade
11 at Byeongmun High,

312
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,389
will drink this and die today.

313
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,430
That's the spirit.

314
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,959
Bottoms up!

315
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,929
There you go. It's going down.

316
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,869
You're doing great.

317
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,369
Good job.

318
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,338
In it goes. She's
chugging it down.

319
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,209
No way. She's drinking
it all. Goodness me.

320
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,640
She emptied it!

321
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,379
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

322
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,909
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

323
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,079
- Good night.
- Let's go home.

324
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,350
There's a cab.

325
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,259
Come on. You can't leave
without a third round of drinks.

326
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,120
How about a club
for round three?

327
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,690
Let's go clubbing!

328
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,589
- Clubbing!
- Ms. Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,328
- I apologize.
- No.

330
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,558
Mr. Lee, stop her, will you?

331
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,268
No, don't be sorry.
Let's go clubbing!

332
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,269
Ms. Oh, you're drunk,
so let's call it a day.

333
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,710
What? No way.

334
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,369
I'm not tipsy at all.

335
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,778
Happy birthday, Mr. Baek.

336
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,278
- Good night, sir.
- Thanks.

337
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,309
Stop! Vice-principal Baek!

338
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,370
My goodness.

339
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,210
That sobered me right up.

340
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,910
Darn it.

341
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,110
Darn.

342
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,499
I'll get going, sir.

343
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,640
What...

344
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,038
Sir, please step on it.

345
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,140
Now!

346
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,670
If Hae Seong refuses...

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,940
The team could be dismantled?

348
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,769
I can't be sure, but
that's what was implied.

349
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,739
They may call it that, but
it's them forcing us out.

350
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,509
They were waiting
for the right excuse.

351
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,120
To be honest,

352
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,789
we've been riding Hae Seong's
coattails all this time.

353
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,229
Cheers.

354
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:31,229
(Have a Drink With Su A)

355
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,700
Ma'am, one bowl of
hangover soup, please.

356
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,739
Unbelievable.

357
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,700
She crawled in
here wasted again.

358
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,739
Go home, you brat.

359
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,509
Unbelievable.

360
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,079
Did I open this restaurant
to make a living...

361
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,679
or to feed my daughter
her hangover soup?

362
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,819
I'll pay.

363
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,919
It's not like you have
a lot of customers.

364
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,288
Always giving me the lip.

365
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,419
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

366
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,820
- I'd like to get the check.
- Sure.

367
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,130
- Did you enjoy the food?
- We did.

368
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,450
That's one gorgeous face.

369
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,970
Are you a student?

370
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:44,670
University students?

371
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,538
No, we're in 11th grade.

372
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,339
We're 17.

373
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,440
Come on. That can't be true.

374
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,709
I checked all your IDs.

375
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,409
Ma'am, you're too gullible.

376
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,679
Fake IDs are easy to
come by these days.

377
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,419
You know what'll happen...

378
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,249
if we report you for
serving alcohol to minors.

379
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,120
- Thank you for the meal.
- But...

380
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:09,559
But that's...

381
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,860
Hold up.

382
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,160
What now?

383
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,068
I can't believe you're
still trying to pull this...

384
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:21,100
when a new law has
been implemented.

385
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,839
Which school do you attend?

386
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,509
And who may you be, old lady?

387
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,710
Old lady?

388
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,889
I work here.

389
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,950
Seriously?

390
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,220
Then what happens to
her isn't your concern.

391
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,229
Don't stick your nose in
where it doesn't belong,

392
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,228
- Goodness.
- And clean the tables.

393
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,069
Kids these days don't
let things like that fly.

394
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,769
Take a step closer,

395
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,100
and I'll call the cops.

396
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,609
Hey. Who do you think you are?

397
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,538
Who are you...

398
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,779
to yap on about
calling the cops on me?

399
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,380
Are you my mom or teacher?

400
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,589
Tell me.

401
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,720
Who do you think you are?

402
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,259
Who are you to...

403
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,559
That's enough.

404
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,470
What now, you punk?

405
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,129
- Darn!
- My gosh.

406
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,039
Don't just stand there!

407
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,710
You...

408
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,610
You punk!

409
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,940
Hey!

410
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,479
Why you...

411
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,519
Darn.

412
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:43,890
You!

413
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,489
What...

414
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,160
- That hurts.
- Come on. Let's go.

415
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,430
Get up.

416
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,399
Hey, pay up!

417
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,069
Pay before you go, you punk!

418
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,299
Yes, ma'am.

419
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,780
- Oh, no.
- Hey, what the...

420
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,769
- He's paying. This guy here!
- Hey!

421
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,339
Darn it.

422
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,109
Here, 50 dollars.

423
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,140
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,279
My goodness. Thank
you very much.

425
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,279
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

426
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,489
I'm fine.

427
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,489
No!

428
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,119
Don't be silly.

429
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,289
Please don't worry about it.

430
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,759
It's totally fine,
so just get going.

431
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,058
Just give me some
freebies next time.

432
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,100
No, but...

433
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,930
Well...

434
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:30,999
Then please come again.

435
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,900
I'll give you our large
portion on the house.

436
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:35,170
Thank you.

437
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,940
My gosh. I should thank you.

438
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,519
Bye now.

439
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,410
I envy his mother for
having a son like him.

440
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,988
Anyway, you!

441
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,159
Didn't you want to get a
full-time teaching job?

442
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,700
Don't be so reckless.

443
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:02,829
Mom.

444
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,839
I have this fluttering
feeling in my chest.

445
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,769
Your chest is flat.
What's there to flutter?

446
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,239
Mom!

447
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,739
Darn you!

448
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,210
(Jeong Si Hyun)

449
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:26,579
This is the problem
with orphans.

450
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,289
They need a beating to
get their act together.

451
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,549
Seriously.

452
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,059
- Hey, let's go.
- Okay.

453
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,019
Darn it.

454
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,319
Sir.

455
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,120
I'll do it.

456
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,470
Byeongmun High School.

457
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,439
Seo Byeong Mun,

458
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,298
the head of Internal Affairs
of the Empire of Korea,

459
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,539
launched his eponymous foundation
and founded the school.

460
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,778
The school was founded...

461
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,478
under Japanese rule
with the goal of...

462
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:03,399
achieving full Japanization
of the Korean people.

463
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,779
At the time, the school
was as highly regarded...

464
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,089
as Jedok High School,
which was founded...

465
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,860
by the Japanese
Governor-General of Korea.

466
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,318
It's a prestigious high
school, and every year,

467
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,766
over a hundred of its students enter
the top three universities in Korea.

468
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,958
Many influential politicians,

469
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,529
business leaders,
legal professionals,

470
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,270
and media professionals are
Byeongmun High graduates.

471
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,568
Using such strong connections...

472
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:26,299
as its weapon,

473
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,168
the school has formed
a power cartel...

474
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,369
with some of the most influential
people in the country.

475

(Donation from Byeongmun High
School Alumni Association)

478
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,878
Ma'am.

479
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,849
The Minister of
Education is here.

480
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,120
Oh, my.

481
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,649
Please come on in.

482
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,019
I know you're a busy man.

483
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,700
- Thank you for coming.
- It's my pleasure.

484
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:54,100
Please look kindly
upon my daughter.

485
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,830
It's nice to meet you.

486
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Please take a seat.

487
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:07,309
Byeongmun High's
school culture...

488
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,585
is akin to military culture. It's
all about discipline and rules,

489
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,769
and the seniority among
students is strictly respected.

490
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,918
Only the students in
the top 0.1 percent...

491
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,259
are qualified to join
the student council.

492
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:25,089
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

493
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:28,230
- Are you a freshman?
- Yes, I am.

494
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,050
I guess they didn't tell you
at the entrance ceremony.

495
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,711
Here, first-year students
aren't allowed to wear earrings.

496
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:36,539
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

497
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,169
- Be careful from now on.
- I will.

498
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,540
The school is becoming
lax on the rules.

499
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,580
Book a meeting with
her homeroom teacher.

500
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,950
They have so much
power and authority...

501
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:52,588
that no one at the school...

502
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:54,660
can dare to mess with them.

503
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,560
Okay, so?

504
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,700
Do we have a detailed plan?

505
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
How are you going to make
me look like a student?

506
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,700
- Agent Park.
- Yes.

507
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:09,139
Here are your family
relation certificate,

508
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,639
student record, and so on,
which we put together...

509
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,240
based on your information
and background.

510
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,279
(Family Relation Certificate,
Transfer Application)

511
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,319
"Applicant category,
socially disadvantaged?"

512
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,148
- Me? Why?
- Byeongmun High...

513
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,520
doesn't welcome
transfer students...

514
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:29,859
unless the student makes
a donation to the school.

515
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,299
I'll donate some
money. How much?

516
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,629
At least 100,000 dollars.

517
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,799
Do you have that kind of money?

518
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:40,100
Someone's bluntly
straightforward.

519
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:43,839
What's this?

520
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,779
I'm transferring from a school
in Ttangkkeut Village, Haenam?

521
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,338
Most students will show...

522
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,310
a lot of interest in
transfer students.

523
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:53,109
They'll definitely ask you about
the school you transferred from.

524
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,389
To prevent the likelihood of them
knowing someone at your old school,

525
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,989
I chose the farthest region.

526
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,529
It sounds absurd,
but it makes sense.

527
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,930
You live in a rooftop
room near the school.

528
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,329
Your uncle is your guardian, and
he's a deep-sea fishing crewman.

529
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,799
So, you live alone in Seoul.

530
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,899
Next.

Memorize all of them.

538
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,489

conversations with the students.

Tell me.

540
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:34,209
Who was your favorite girl
group? The most recent one.

541
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,028
Girls' Generation?

542
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,909
Girls' Generation? No,
Wonder Girls is the best.

543
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,060
Study and memorize
everything here.

544
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,230
And don't even mention
Girls' Generation.

545
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,870
Wonder Girls too.

546
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,600
Do not mention them.

547
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,799
As I said earlier,

548
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
Byeongmun High is no
ordinary high school.

549
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,629
The same goes for its
students and their parents.

550
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
You.

551
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,980
Don't get tangled up
with any of the students.

552
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,378
Getting tangled up
with any of them...

553
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,318
will only increase the likelihood
of getting your cover blown.

554
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,890
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

555
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,290
Those of us here...

556
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,851
and the director are the only ones
who know about this operation.

557
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,560
The operation is on...

558
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,700
until Agent Jeong Hae Seong...

559
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,700
finds the national treasure...

560
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:20,415
valued at 800 million dollars
hidden somewhere in that building...

561
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,370
and returns it to
the national coffers.

562
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,569
The operation will commence
this coming Monday.

563
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,739
Get ready, all of you.

564
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:29,949
Any questions?

565
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,008
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

566
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,769
- Then you're dismissed.
- I have a question.

567
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,890
But you're sure...

568
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,489
the gold bars do exist, right?

569
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,160
Well, we received a tip-off,

570
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,100
- so they must be there.
- What?

571
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,950
What if this is a part of
the director's bigger plan?

572
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:55,270
To make us go after something
that doesn't exist to fire us?

573
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:57,609
No.

574
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,379
You all saw the picture.

575
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
They exist.

576
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,750
I'm sure of it,

577
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:04,750
so don't you worry.

578
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:06,620
All right. Dismissed.

579
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,220
What is this?

580
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,930
I don't think they exist.

581
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,199
What choice do we have?
We still have to do it.

582
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,230
(Senior Agent An Seok Ho)

583
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,939
This just came in.

584
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,970
Your aunt will drop by
shortly to check up on you.

585
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,079
From cleaning to the air
quality in the house,

586
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,109
make sure everything's
perfect at home.

587
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:38,379
You know what to do.

588
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,049
Your aunt is determined
to make you...

589
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,620
move back home.

590
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,319
- I'll get ready.
- Good.

591
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
The place looks pretty good.

592
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,168
- Mom.
- Yes?

593
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,045
Come and join us. You're
making him uncomfortable.

594
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,810
Yes, that's enough.

595
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,568
The meat is all cooked now.

596
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,609
All right.

597
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,379
Hey, Hae Seong.

598
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:09,709
Are you...

599
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,149
not struggling to pay
your monthly bills?

600
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:15,318
You won't have to worry about
that if you move in with us.

601
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:16,419
Mom.

602
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,519
Okay, you little brat.

603
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,290
Did I ask you to pay for his
bills? Why are you yelling?

604
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:26,730
Anyway, you're single,
and you live alone.

605
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,230
Your place is
unbelievably clean.

606
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,169
Hey, that startled me.

607
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,169
I'm sad that you
don't need my help.

608
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:39,139
It's all thanks to you who
raised me so well, Auntie.

609
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,410
My goodness. You're
such a sweet talker.

610
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:42,950
Here, Auntie. Open wide.

611
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,979
What an eyesore.

612
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,620
Right, Dad?

613
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,689
What are you doing?

614
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,859
Nothing. Eat up.

615
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,790
Well...

616
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,989
Since the whole family is here,

617
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,199
we should make the
announcement now.

618
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,870
Starting on Monday, Hae
Seong will be sent...

619
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,398
to Byeongmun High
School on an operation.

620
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,159
To my school? Why would
he come to my school?

621
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:12,140
It's top secret, so ask no more.

622
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,209
And watch your mouth at school.

623
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,580
Top secret, my foot.

624
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,809
If you put Hae Seong
in danger again,

625
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,220
- I will cut you up like this.
- Auntie, no!

626
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,220
Calm down.

627
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,790
Put it down, all right?

628
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,919
- Let me pour you one.
- Okay.

629
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,259
Here.

630
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,200
Don't worry. I'm not a
little boy, you know.

631
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,568
You'll always be my little boy.

632
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:37,799
All right, come on.

633
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,839
Let's drink, okay?

634
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,938
All right. Here's to the happiness
and health of the family...

635
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,779
and to the success of Hae
Seong's new operation.

636
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,709
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

637
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,230
(Jeong Hae Seong)

638
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,629
See you later.

639
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:49,519
Get out of my way, will you?

640
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,069
Me?

641
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,739
Why can't she just go around me?

642
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,109
Who is he? A transfer student?

643
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:06,919
I guess.

644
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,730
These brats.

645
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,129
Ms. Oh?

646
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,200
Is Ms. Oh not here yet?

647
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,398
What time is it now? I can't
believe she's not here yet!

648
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:27,798
No wonder people
say teachers have...

649
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,640
- no authority nowadays!
- This is nuts.

650
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:32,039
Teachers, will you keep this up?

651
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,639
- Excuse me.
- Hush.

652
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,209
Is she trying to
shut the school down?

653
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,879
Ms. Oh?

654
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,279
(Byeongmun High School)

655
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,790
Goodness, you scared
me. Where did she go?

656
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
Anyway, who are you?

657
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,028
I'm Jeong Hae Seong.

658
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:51,229
I'm a transfer student.

659
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,429
I see. I'm busy now. You can
introduce yourself later.

660
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,898
Did you see the
teacher who was here?

661
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:56,160
I swear, she was right here.

662
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:57,870
Right.

663
00:44:58,669 --> 00:44:59,770
Well...

664
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,700
She went that way.

665
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:05,770
Thank you. Ms. Oh!

666
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:08,879
Ms. Oh!

667
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,279
Where did she go? Ms. Oh!

668
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,500
So, you're Hae Seong.

669
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:28,230
The transfer student
joining my class.

670
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,200
- Your class?
- Nice to meet you.

671
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,529
I'm Oh Su A, your
homeroom teacher.

672
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,039
I teach Korean History.

673
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,140
And please forget
what you just saw.

674
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,939
It's nice to meet you.

675
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,286
You might find it hard to adapt to
a new school environment at first.

676
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,249
If anything stresses you
out, just come to me anytime.

677
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,480
I'll do my best to help
you as much as I can.

678
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,689
Okay.

679
00:45:57,529 --> 00:45:59,089
By any chance, have we met...

680
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,370
Wait, at the diner?

681
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,009
Come here.

682
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,809
- Are you out of your mind?
- It hurts!

683
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,290
- Don't talk casually to me.
- Ms. Oh!

684
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:17,949
- Hey, turn around!
- It hurts!

685
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,149
- Come on, quick!
- It really hurts!

686
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
It hurts!

687
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,489
Ms. Oh!

688
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,120
- It really hurts!
- Shut it!

689
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,829
I can't believe this.

690
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,500
How did you get
around the ID check?

691
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,029
Right, you probably
have a fake ID.

692
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,369
Were you at a
funeral or something?

693
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,169
You were dressed in a suit!

694
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,045
I'll let you off this time
since you just transferred here,

695
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,140
but watch out.

696
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:48,209
If I catch you again, I'll send
you straight to the counselor!

697
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,310
Goodness. I can't believe this.

698
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,650
Hey, you've done nothing
to be proud of either.

699
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:54,950
"Hey?"

700
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,290
I mean, you shouldn't be so proud
of what you did either, Ms. Oh.

701
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,959
Didn't you fight alongside me?

702
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:05,088
I saw you ruthlessly
beat up those kids.

703
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,759
- Hey.
- With a steel tray.

704
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,068
Hey, that was... I was
just trying to save you!

705
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,299
I never asked you to save me.

706
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:18,738
I admit what I did was wrong,

707
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,039
so you should admit it too.

708
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,378
Let's cut each other some
slack and let it go, okay?

709
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:23,699
It's my first day
here, you know.

710
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,309
Oh, the morning assembly
will begin soon.

711
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,319
See? Here.

712
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:29,419
Where's the classroom?

713
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,419
(Grade 11, Class 1)

714
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,759
Ye Na!

715
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,330
Hey, I'm seriously so jealous.

716
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,999
Your mom... I mean, can't
you talk to Chairwoman Seo...

717
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,659
and take me with you to France
on the exchange program?

718
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,000
Hey, I thought you were busy
training for your idol debut.

719
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,068
Don't listen to her. Just
take me with you. Please?

720
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:50,739
I won't leave until the term
ends. It's a long time away.

721
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,950
And I'm sorry to
disappoint you girls.

722
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,008
I've already decided who I
want to take on the trip.

723
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:56,009
Who?

724
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:01,318
Me?

725
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,419
You know I can't
live without you.

726
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:05,089
You'll come with me, right?

727
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:09,359
How much does it cost to
join the exchange program?

728
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,730
I'm not sure.

729
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:14,529
The school will take care
of some of the expenses,

730
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:15,829
so I'd say 10,000 dollars?

731
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,330
What? Did you say
10,000 dollars?

732
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:20,298
Oh, my. It costs 10,000
dollars? Goodness.

733
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:22,339
- I see.
- Good morning, Mr. Writer.

734
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:25,069
My gosh.

735
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:27,879
Look at this loser
scribbling away again.

736
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:29,180
Hey, Mr. Writer.

737
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,509
Have you finished preparing for
Tae Soo's performance assessment?

738
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,419
Sorry. I'll take
care of it quickly.

739
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,689
Hey, Dong Min.

740
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:42,989
Be good.

741
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,529
You know I can be
scary when I'm angry.

742
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,599
- Yes.
- Hey, Ms. Oh is here!

743
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Come on.

744
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,470
Quiet down! Get ready for
your morning assembly.

745
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:02,939
We have a new student
joining us as of today.

746
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,350
Come on in.

747
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,980
- He's good-looking.
- Hey, look.

748
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,069
I've found my Prince Charming.

749
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:30,568
I saw him by the
main gate earlier.

750
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:33,279
- Is he a celebrity or something?
- My gosh!

751
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,950
I'm Jung Hae Seong.
Nice to meet you all.

752
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Applause!

753
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,489
Let's see. Is there
an empty desk?

754
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,629
You can sit there.

755
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,250
All of you should help Hae Seong
adjust to his new environment.

756
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,580
I'll check attendance now.

757
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,649
Han Tae Hee.

758
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,588
- Hi.
- Lee Yeon Jae.

759
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:17,749
I'm Lee Dong Min.

760
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,319
- Jang Ki Yeon.
- Nice to meet you.

761
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,890
- Let's be friends.
- Jeong Sang Hun.

762
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:22,819
Kim Woo Jin.

763
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,939
Hae Seong. Come to the
rooftop after this.

764
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,890
Hae Seong.

765
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:52,449
Are you insane?

766
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,790
You're here as a student?

767
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,759
You can't call me
"insane" when...

768
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,060
Goodness.

769
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,859
Stuff happened. Don't ask.

770
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,298
There's no way you
can be a student.

771
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:08,640
I thought you'd be a
teacher or faculty member.

772
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,910
Do you think I want
to be in this uniform?

773
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,050
See what it's like
when you start working.

774
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,588
Forget everything else.
I'll help as best I can.

775
00:51:24,589 --> 00:51:26,520
Finish your mission and
get out of here quickly.

776
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,589
And promise...

777
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,759
you won't tell Mom and Dad
how I'm doing at school.

778
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,330
Is something wrong?

779
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:37,399
Don't ask questions.
Just do as I say.

780
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:40,100
Okay. I promise.

781
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,770
- You promised.
- Yes.

782
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,639
Break it, and I'll
never see you again.

783
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,669
Fine.

784
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,040
Let's do this.

785
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,048
A year later, Emperor Gojong...

786
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:26,980
moved from the Russian Legation
to Gyeongungung Palace.

787
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,649
He came home.

788
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,790
No way.

789
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,359
I'm so sorry.

790
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:39,089
How dare you try
to hit my throat?

791
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,160
Sorry.

792
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,009
Hi, Transfer Student.

793
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,439
What's your social media handle?

794
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:54,779
I'll send you my AW.

795
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,208
"AW?"

796
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:57,426
(An honest message
sent anonymously)

797
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,910
You don't know what "AW" means?

798
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,120
Are you a primitive, Hae Seong?

799
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,620
No. I know what it means.

800
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,359
I don't know what you want
me to promise, but no thanks.

801
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,160
That's fine. It's okay.

802
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:17,068
You're a jokester.

803
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,829
- He's witty.
- I'm kidding.

804
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,200
I knew it.

805
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,410
You mean I look familiar.

806
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,580
It's not at all what I learned.

807
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,350
What the heck is an AW?

808
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
"AW?"

809
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,590
Weren't they saying "awww"
because you're cute?

810
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:36,350
Why am I even asking you? Bye.

811
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,819
Darn it.

812
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:41,619
Rock-paper-scissors.

813
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,660
Go!

814
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,689
- Get out of the way.
- Gosh.

815
00:53:45,259 --> 00:53:46,660
- Okay.
- Wait.

816
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,000
Hurry up.

817
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,399
Hey.

818
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,399
- Sorry.
- It's my ball.

819
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,068
What do you want?

820
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:54,169
You can't...

821
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,869
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going!

822
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,410
Let's keep streaming.

823
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:03,239
(Jeong Hae Seong)

824
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:05,450
No, let's go over
that move again.

825
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,149
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

826
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,620
Hurry up.

827
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,529
I want to go home.

828
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:36,180
(Keep Out)

829
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,060
(Keep Out)

830
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,980
(Byeongmun High School)

831
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:24,689
(Byeongmun High School)

832
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,169

(Electricity Meter)

834
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:47,310
Did you stuff your
ears with something?

835
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:51,080
Hey. Lee Dong Min.

836
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,148
We pay extra tuition...

837
00:56:53,149 --> 00:56:54,378
so you can study for free.

838
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:56,279
At least do as you're told.

839
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:57,620
Am I wrong?

840
00:56:58,049 --> 00:56:59,520
Is it over if you
don't bring it?

841
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:02,489
Why do you want my grandma's ID?

842
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,759
Are you being funny?

843
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:06,559
Why do you need to know that?

844
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,799
Just do as you're
told and bring it.

845
00:57:11,029 --> 00:57:12,199
This isn't working.

846
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,739
You need a mental reboot.

847
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,339
Stand still.

848
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:17,709
Don't move, okay?

849
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,379
What's that noise?

850
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,220
Hey.

851
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,879
You!

852
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,250
Stop and come on over.

853
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,259
The transfer student?

854
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,230
What are you doing here?

855
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:43,799
How long were you here for?

856
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,500
I got here just now.

857
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,668
Where's the toilet?

858
00:57:47,669 --> 00:57:49,040
The toilet? You idiot.

859
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,169
A spectator should
be made to pay.

860
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,779
Get us some dumplings
and fishcake skewers.

861
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:56,540
We'll pay for it...

862
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,310
later on.

864
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:06,989
What?

865
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,619
What do you want?

866
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,689
- So what if you glare at us?
- So what?

867
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,660
Don't go too far.

868
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:15,000
I've been watching
and this is too much.

869
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:16,930
Stop it and get back indoors.

870
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:19,230
I'm saying this for your sake...

871
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,709
Hae Seong.

872
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:27,410
You must hold back.

873
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:37,720
What happened? Why
did he stop talking?

874
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,120
Is something over there?

875
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,029
So what?

876
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,830
You don't want to go?

877
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:50,600
Shall I get sodas too?

878
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,339
You startled me, you punk.

879
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,839
- You darn eyes...
- Okay. I'm off.

880
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,679
Get going right now.

881
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,039
- Get running.
- Okay.

882
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,680
Three, two, one!

883
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:06,839
- I can still see your feet.
- You're pretty fast.

884
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:11,419
It must be nice to have
a loser friend, Dong Min.

885
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:17,359
The transfer student was in
a fight at your restaurant?

886
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,330
The face you're making is
the face I made earlier.

887
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,660
You have no idea
how shocked I was.

888
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:25,870
I hate problem students.

889
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,370
Do you think he's
covered in tattoos?

890
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,109
I never imagined he'd
be in high school.

891
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:36,540
He was in a suit
drinking alcohol.

892
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:39,049
Mom.

893
00:59:40,149 --> 00:59:42,080
I have this fluttering
feeling in my chest.

894
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,390
Are you insane?

895
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,759
What's up with her?

896
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,700
This is the last
time I let him off.

897
00:59:57,299 --> 00:59:59,100
If I catch him doing anything,

898
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,669
I'll make sure he pays.

899
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,009
It was another long, hard day.

900
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:11,310
Get home safe. I'll
see you tomorrow.

901
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:12,648
What's our class motto?

902
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:13,750
Look at the blackboard...

903
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,950
- As if it's BTS.
- As if it's BTS.

904
01:00:17,189 --> 01:00:19,269
(Class Motto: Look at the
blackboard as if it's BTS.)

905
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,890
Perfect. That's all.

906
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,339
- Was your name Dong Min?
- What?

907
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:42,939
Yes. That's my name.

908
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,680
Instead of just taking it,
try fighting back next time.

909
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:48,750
Holding back
doesn't always work.

910
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:50,419
Okay?

911
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,220
You couldn't fight
back either...

912
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:54,919
when Yoon Chul kicked you.

913
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,259
My butt's firm, so it's fine.

914
01:00:58,459 --> 01:00:59,660
Let me ask you something.

915
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,930
What's the old
building in the back?

916
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,200
The one that's out of bounds.

917
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,100
That one?

918
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,609
It's our old facility
that we don't use anymore.

919
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:12,669
It's so old that
it could collapse.

920
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:14,379
How old is it?

921
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,399
It was probably built during
the Japanese colonial era.

922
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,709
It's the oldest of
our school buildings.

923
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,950
The Japanese colonial era?

924
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,088
Yes.

925
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:26,148
There are rumors
that it's haunted...

926
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,060
and that bodies
are buried inside.

927
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,290
I love spooky stories
about our school.

928
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,330
If you're interested in...

930

(Assemblyman Yu Ja Kyung)

931
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:48,939
(My deepest condolences)

932
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,730
I offer my sincerest
condolences.

933
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:10,970
Thank you for coming.

934
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,529
I don't know...

935
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:17,069
if this will offer any comfort.

936
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:19,870
Don't worry about your son.

937
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:23,310
Our Byeongmun Foundation
will look after him.

938
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,250
Thank you, chairwoman.

939
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,418
Make room for her son
in our special class.

940
01:02:34,419 --> 01:02:35,790
Yes, chairwoman.

941
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,560
Thank you.

942
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,700
You never truly know someone.

943
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:49,640
The man had some influence
within the school.

944
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,040
Who'd have thought
he'd hang himself?

945
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:54,480
It's a shame.

946
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,549
He was at loggerheads with
you over the Education City,

947
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,520
but he wasn't a bad guy.

948
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,188
Why did he upset you so
much only to die like this?

949
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:06,849
Assemblyman Park Min Cheol.

950
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:07,859
Yes?

951
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,730
We're here to mourn
him and send him off.

952
01:03:11,129 --> 01:03:12,489
Talk about that later.

953
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,160
I apologize.

954
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,870
I only meant to show my pity.

955
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,600
But all is not lost for him.

956
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,109
You promised to
look after his son.

957
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,439
I'm sure Assemblyman
Choi can rest in peace.

958
01:03:29,879 --> 01:03:30,910
He will, right?

959
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:35,319
I really hope so.

960
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,230
Did you clean everything up?

961
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,399
The case was closed
without an autopsy.

962
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,000
That's enough mourning.

963
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,669
We dealt with the headache.

964
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,910
Shall we get to work?

965
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:02,239
Sure.

966
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,980
Byeongmun High's old building?

967
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,680
It's not easy to keep so
many gold bars in one place.

968
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,149
That requires space,
necessary security,

969
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,318
and a way to maintain
temperature...

970
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:14,735
and humidity to
prevent discoloration.

971
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,430
All that must be
checked regularly.

972
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:18,830
So what?

973
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,330
What do you think is odd?

974
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,730
The electricity meter.

975
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:25,269
(Old building)

976
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,069
The building was
neglected for a long time,

977
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,769
but the meter was running.

978
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:29,838
(Electricity Meter)

979
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,270
People were told to keep
out for safety reasons,

980
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,910
but if they truly cared
about the students' safety,

981
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:36,409
they'd have torn it down,

982
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,850
not left it up for this long.

983
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,250
That's why you think
it's the old building?

984
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,949
If the foundation is hiding
the gold bars illegally?

985
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,359
I think it's worth checking out.

986
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,120
(Old building)

987
01:04:50,121 --> 01:04:51,128
I'm off.

995
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:40,419
Last night, someone broke
into the old building.

996
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:41,619
The person will be back.

997
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:44,289
Let's see what they get up to.

998
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,789
Stay away from the old building.

999
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,560
Did they hide gold and
jewels under the floor?

1000
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:49,899
I'm warning you.

1001
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,298
You'd be better
off staying away.

1002
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:52,629
Especially from the basement.

1003
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:54,030
I should know. I went there.

1004
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,999
Let's wrap up the mission today.

1005
01:08:57,169 --> 01:08:58,169
Follow me.

1006
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,140
Are you a thug?
Are you into crime?

1007
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,079
Is the punk out of his mind?

1008
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,680
I'll keep an eye on you.

1009
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:05,209
What are you up to?

1010
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,578
Are you Jeong Hae Seong?

1011
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:07,919
Don't be intimidated.

1012
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:10,020
I said to stop.

1014
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,980
Yes.

1015
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,180
This is it.

1016
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,220
This is a real student.

1017
01:09:41,879 --> 01:09:42,919
