00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,520
That took longer than I thought.

8
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,190
I ran into some interference.

9
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,700
And the notebook?

10
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Please leave if you're not the director.

11
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,290
Jeong Hae Seong.

12
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,290
How dare you come in without knocking?

13
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,660
I told you to all leave.

14
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,760
Who do you think you're talking to?

15
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,130
Come with me.

16
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,260
Out, everyone.

17
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,370
You'll pay for this if it's not urgent.

18
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,540
What's going on?

19
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,060
My father who went missing 22 years ago.

20
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,990
Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon.
This is his notebook.

21
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,900
I need you to answer...

22
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,330
all my questions.

23
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,170
Why was this notebook...

24
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,940
at Byeongmun High School?

25
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,380
I can kill you here and now.

26
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,420
So talk.

27
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,320
Why was my dad's notebook...

28
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,120
at Byeongmun High School?

29
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,230
Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's last mission...

30
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,460
was the same as yours now.

31
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,640
Jeong Hae Seong. Open the door!

32
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,940
- Director! - Jeong Hae Seong!

33
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,940
He went in to find the hidden gold bars.

34
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,739
We have no way of knowing
if he's dead or alive now.

35
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,950
You piece of crap!

36
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,420
Why did you keep it from me?

37
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,620
Why didn't you tell me?

38
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,419
The circumstances of an
agent's mishap on a mission...

39
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,630
are never shared with anyone.

40
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,460
Don't you know that basic rule?

41
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,869
Whether Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's
your dad or not isn't important.

42
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,540
What's important is whether
or not you complete the mission.

43
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,140
Over 20 years have passed
since my dad vanished.

44
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,780
The suffering I've been through...

45
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,380
was for that stupid reason...

46
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,520
You should never have known.

47
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,090
I'm sorry you found out
like this, Agent Jeong.

48
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,790
You call yourself human?

49
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,460
Jeong Hae Seong!

50
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,060
Are you out of your mind?

51
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,760
You tried to punch the director.

52
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,260
What's wrong with you?

53
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,800
We're checking the ID of
the dead man, Kim Hyeon Ho.

54
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,170
We're looking into why
he had that notebook...

55
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,270
and what he wanted to tell you.

56
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,110
Don't you know...

57
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,840
what you did could bring
everything to an end?

58
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,610
Did you know about this, sir?

59
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,190
Uncle.

60
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,200
Tell me the honest truth.

61
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,270
Did you know my dad disappeared...

62
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,910
while on this mission?

63
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,610
I didn't.

64
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,920
He vanished when I was nine.

65
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,260
Then, he reappeared
like this when I was 31.

66
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm his son,

67
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,230
but I don't know what he was
doing when he disappeared.

68
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,570
Is that even right?

69
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,180
This darn place knew and still...

70
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,970
I'm sorry, sir.

71
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,980
I can't do this anymore.

72
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,610
Hae Seong.

73
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
Hey.

74
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,690
I need to...

75
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
I need to take a short break.

76
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,180

77
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,000
The empty space in the basement
of the old building will be my HQ.

78
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,430
This place is safe.

79
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,509

(Ballerina, crimson eyes,

81
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,960
On my dear son Si Hyun's
birthday, we'll go to the observatory.

82
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,160
Did you think I forgot?

83
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,630
I'll wake you up when I'm back.

84
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,599
Let's go to the observatory,
your favourite place.

85
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,939
(On my dear son Si Hyun's birthday, )

86
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,340
(we'll go to the observatory.)

87
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,160
- Is that blood? - No way.

88
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,630
- He must've fallen from the roof.
- The roof?

89
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,460
- That's so scary. - Gosh.

90
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,230
- What happened? - I don't know.

91
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,130
What's going on?

92
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,040
Someone must've fallen. A
lot of people have gathered.

93
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,610
- Who was it? - From the rooftop?

94
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,179
That's blood. This is horrible.

95
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Ms. Oh.

96
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,550
Have you heard?

97
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,210
Mr. Kim jumped to his death.

98
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,479
Someone really died?

99
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,619
It was suicide?

100
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Yes. They found a death note in his office.

101
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,020
Hey. Did you hear about
the guard at the gate?

102
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,960
He fell from the rooftop.

103
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,330
I heard.

104
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
He was alone at school
when it wasn't the time to patrol.

105
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,030
It's not the curse...

106
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,700
of the grandfather clock, is it?

107
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,670
"Don't be alone at school."

108
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,880
"When the clock chimes..."

109
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,210
"Crimson eyes will come for you."

110
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,890
- I hate you. - You scaredy-cats.

111
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,960
It's morning assembly time.

112
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,630
Where's my chair?

113
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,160
Ms. Oh. What happened to the guard?

114
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,630
Do you know anything?

115
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,440
I don't because I just heard myself.

116
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,240
Roll call time. Who isn't here yet?

117
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,580
Hae Seong's not here?

118
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,580
Shall I call him?

119
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,150
No, I'll do that.

120
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,520
Report how many hours of
volunteer work you did by today.

121
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,380
Be sure to do it if you haven't yet.

122

(Order bouquet of condolence)

123
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,890
Seung Jae, put in the order for flowers.

124
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,160
That's all for today.

125
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,360
Isn't this the rookie's job?

126
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,330
Where's Hae Seong?

127
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,669
Where's Jeong Hae Seong?

128
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,000
Isn't it unacceptable to go AWOL?

129
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,270
The meeting's over. You can go.

130
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,640
- Let's go. - Whatever.

131
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,450
Yu Jeong.

132
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,850
I'd wanted to ask for a while.

133
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,620
How do you know Hae Seong?

134
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,720
What do you mean?

135
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,160
I sensed something between you
two, especially when we had dinner.

136
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,690
You care and worry about each other...

137
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,460
and have each other's backs.

138
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,730
Was he like that? I didn't notice.

139
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,730
Be honest.

140
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,370
Yu Jeong.

141
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,070
- You fancy him, don't you? - What?

142
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,410
It's okay. You can tell me.

143
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,980
- Since when? - Don't be silly.

144
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,410
I have high standards.

145
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,020
That's odd. I have a pretty good hunch.

146
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
- I'll fancy him, then. - What?

147
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,790
Ye Na, that's...

148
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,060
I'm being very serious.

149
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,530
Why don't you change your mind?

150
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,500
You don't fancy him and
there's nothing between you.

151
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,170
So what's wrong?

152
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay, so, what I mean is,

153
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,139
why Jeong Hae Seong of all people?

154
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,010
There are many other nice guys.

155
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,680
I think Hae Seong's pretty nice.

156
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,150
I told you my plan.

157
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,350
- Don't get in the way. - What?

158
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,129
(Director Kim Hyung Bae)

159
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,200
Good job.

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,410
Director.

161
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,009
About Jeong Jae Hyeon's disappearance...

162
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,610
related to Byeongmun High...

163
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,950
Was Seok Ho aware of it too?

164
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,550
Jin Sang.

165
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,490
Do you know why people die in streams?

166
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,960
It's because...

167
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,190
it looks shallow but you never know
how deep until you've stepped in.

168
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,760
- Right. - Seok Ho's like that.

169
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,170
I can't tell at all what he's
thinking or what he knows.

170
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,540
I thought he was a simpleton.

171
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,410
We're not close enough for
me to know his deepest thoughts.

172
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,080
- Did that answer your question? - Yes.

173
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,850
Go, then.

Yes.

What?

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,010
"Did Dad walk this path too?"

184
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,780
"Did Dad feel lonely like I do now?"

185
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,360
I found myself wondering.

186
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,030
I believed you were alive somewhere,

187
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,900
but I thought you could be dead too.

188
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,310
"He's alive."

189
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,780
"He'll be out there somewhere."

190
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,080
I believed so,

191
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,520
but it was so hard on me that...

192
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,130
I'm sorry.

193
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm sorry, Dad.

194
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,300
It's okay.

195
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Si Hyun.

196
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,890
Don't cry. It's okay.

197
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,230
Hey! I told you not to shorten the uniform.

198
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,999
Look at that side part.

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,700
I should split your head
following that part line.

200
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,769
I styled it with the hair
mousse at the sauna...

201
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,169
He looks like he should
go to the police station,

202
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,540
not the teachers' office.

203
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,510
Hae Seong is out, so we have no choice.

204
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,679
I heard he already
turned in his guns and ID.

205
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,280
Do you think he'll actually resign?

206
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,020
We should be prepared for that scenario.

207
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,460
Mi Jeong, prepare the necessary
documents for Yeong Hun...

208
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,060
so we can send him to
Byeongmun High this week.

209
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Hae Seong!

210
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,900
Hey, Hae Seong.

211
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,370
Hi.

212
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,200
I wanted to just quit everything
and go on a fishing trip.

213
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,240
But I should find this man.

214
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,050
NIS Agent Jeong Hae
Seong, Domestic Team Four.

215
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,250
I will carry on with the mission.

216
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,120
Applause.

217
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,790
Take off the uniform, you punk.

218
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Hey, Hae Seong.

219
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,179
Why did you miss school?

220
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,649
- Were you sick? - No.

221
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,650
- Did something bad happen? - No.

222
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,350
Then why did you miss
the student council meeting?

223
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,650
Something came up.

224
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,050
You didn't even answer your phone.

225
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I was busy.

226
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,560
I organized the notes for you.

227
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,530
Thanks.

228
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,900
You little...

229
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,370
How could you miss
school without telling me?

230
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,770
- Where have you been?
- We weren't worried about you.

231
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,780
We just needed more people
to go to the Internet cafe with.

232
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,450
- Did something happen? - No, all's good.

233
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,180
Sit down, everyone.

234
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,320
Jeong Hae Seong, what happened?

235
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,760
I had to deal with a
personal matter. I apologize.

236
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,030
This is school.

237
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,300
All students must attend
school. It's the number one rule.

238
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,770
Just know that you'll get
demerit points for your absence.

239
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,700
Is Ms. Oh upset with you or something?

240
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,180
Let's go to the snack bar
before the first period begins.

241
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,080
I have to go somewhere.

242
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,680
Let's go during our break.

243
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,520
Where do you need to go?

244
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,790
Just somewhere.

245
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,190
{\an8}(Byeongmun High Organizational Chart)

247
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,590
The girl fell, hit the ground
with her head, and died.

248

the piano that plays alone.

257
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,990
We don't have a meeting
today. Why are you here?

258
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,060
I was looking for something urgently.

259
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,760
What about you, Ms. Oh?

260
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,030
I came to check something
too. Something urgent.

261
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,570
You must've heard about Mr. Kim.

262
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,270
Yes.

263
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,800
I heard he jumped to
his death from the rooftop.

264
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,740
If you have nothing
else to say, I'll be off.

265
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
Jeong Hae Seong.

266
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,350
You know he didn't take his own life.

267
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,320
You were on the rooftop when it happened.

268
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,590
You...

269
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,760
Who are you, really?

270
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,840
Jeong Hae Seong?

271
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,890
I could report you to the police right now.

272
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,390
You're not a student, right?

273
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,370
I'll tell you everything.

274
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,230
I am...

275
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,760
an undercover NIS agent.

276
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,210
(Fox)

277
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,510
What's up?

278
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,890
Sure, I'll meet you there.

279
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,060
Sir, so... I mean,

280
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,430
Mr. NIS agent, so you're saying...

281
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,369
Emperor Gojong's gold bars
are hidden somewhere here,

282
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,000
and you came here to find them.

283
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,640
As for Mr. Kim, the man
who was tussling with you...

284
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,720
What are you doing?

285
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,290
Listen to me carefully.

286
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,190
You have two options, Ms. Oh.

287
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,390
Option one.

288
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,200
You can actively cooperate
with this NIS operation...

289
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,930
and do your duty as a Korean citizen.

290
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,170
- What are you saying? - Option two.

291
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,500
You can leak information
about this covert NIS operation...

292
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,439
and face severe punishment...

293
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,170
for violating the National Security Act.

294
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,810
"Severe punishment?"
What exactly do you mean?

295
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,220
- Am I going to jail?
- For at least ten years.

296
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,090
Oh, no.

297
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,090
Ten years?

298
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,260
You have one day to
think it over and decide.

299
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,230
I'll see you tomorrow.

300
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,570
Wait, hold on. Hey!

301
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,080
Why do I have to go to jail?

302
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,990
Did I commit a crime?

303
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,730
(Voice Memo)

304
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,070
So, this is your school's...

305
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,940
Sorry.

306
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,200
This is Byeongmun High's school anthem?

307
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,609
The song was written when Seo Byeong Mun...

308
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,580
became the first chairman of the school.

309
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,250
Seo Byeong Mun wrote the
lyrics and composed the song too.

310
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,950
Lyrics by that man, and his song...

311
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,050
Sorry about that.

312
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,820
According to the notes, the
keywords of the third story are...

313
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,820
"piano four hands," "silently moving keys,"

314
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,330
and "the dead girl's performance."

315
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,559
Will you have no problem
accessing the piano?

316
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,760
I'll find out when I'm at school tomorrow.

317
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,600
We don't know when that
guy might show up again,

318
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,500
so be very careful.

319
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,970
Who do you think that guy is?

320
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,840
He was after the notebook,

321
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,680
so he's probably looking
for the gold bars too.

322
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,380
But we shouldn't jump to
conclusions without evidence.

323
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,580
We should be careful, indeed.

324
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,720
Anything on Kim Hyeon Ho yet?

325
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh, we combed through
everything we could find.

326
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,520
He was just a civilian.

327
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,159
Unfortunately, I don't know how...

328
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,990
Jae Hyeon's notebook ended up in his hands.

329
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,290
It is a mystery.

330
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,330
The same goes for his motive
behind wanting to meet up with you.

331
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,470
What did he want to say to
you? We can't find a single clue.

332
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,170
In any case, there's one
thing we know for sure.

333
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,910
Someone pulled strings to
manipulate the investigation.

334
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,010
Otherwise, they wouldn't have...

335
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,010
wrapped it up in such a rush
and concluded it as suicide.

336
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,250
Can you look into the
detective in charge...

337
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,120
- Look into it. - Got it.

338
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,690
What about your absence?

339
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,289
All is good with Oh Su A, right?

340
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,820
Right, I was going to tell you about that.

341
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,290
There was a little hiccup,

342
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,900
but it's been taken care of.

343
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,069
(Out of Office)

344
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,569
(Our deepest condolences.)

345
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,270
(Rest in peace.)

346
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,120
What?

347
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,250
What matters is that
it's been taken care of.

348
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,750
I made sure she'd never tell anyone,

349
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,060
so don't you worry...

350
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,990
So, you're saying...

351
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,300
an NIS agent bluffed an innocent civilian?

352
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,529
Hey, you threatened an innocent civilian.

353
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,669
You could go to jail for this!

354
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,369
Hey, you should've tried your
best to placate her and win her over.

355
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,900
Why would you threaten her like that?

356
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,470
- Really? - Hey!

357
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,540
"Really?" It's common sense!

358
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,380
Hey, you. Get up.

359
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,980
Get up and go see Oh Su A.

360
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,880
Say you're so sorry about
earlier. Beg on your knees!

361
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,620
Be nice and polite. Do whatever it takes...

362
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,850
to make her promise
that she won't tell anyone.

363
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,660
Do you understand?

364
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,240
What the...

365
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,810
This is on me, so eat as much as you like.

366
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,520
If you want more food, just let me know.

367
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,720
Thank you.

368
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,590
My pleasure! Enjoy.

369
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,660
Well, then I'll leave you two to talk.

370
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,290
Okay.

371
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,630
It's not what you think.

372
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,970
What a mess.

373
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,640
- Let me pour you one. - No, thank you.

374
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,720
What did you want to talk to me about?

375
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,690
I'm sorry about earlier.

376
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,089
- That was rude of me. - My goodness.

377
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,889
Didn't you say this in
your serious voice earlier?

378
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,160
"I'll give you one day." What's
gotten into you all of a sudden?

379
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,860
I said that because I wasn't
in my right mind earlier.

380
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,420
So? Go on.

382
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,750
- Hiding my identity...
- Aren't you going to drink that?

383
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,900
I won't ask you to understand
why I've had to hide my identity.

384
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,530
Regardless of the
reason, I am not a student,

385
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,230
so I shouldn't stay at Byeongmun High.

386
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,440
But I implore you.

387
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,910
To uncover the truth behind
Mr. Kim Hyeon Ho's death,

388
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,509
protect our country,

389
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,940
and punish those who have done wrong,

390
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,310
I must stay at Byeongmun High.

391
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,250
Also, my colleagues and I
are discussing how we can...

392
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,090
compensate you for all of this, so...

393
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,860
I trust you'll keep it to yourself.

394
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,190
Listen.

395
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,630
Even if you say that, I feel...

396
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Let's be honest.

397
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,729
It's not like you'll
share the gold with me.

398
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,769
Even if I get something,
it'll either be a watch...

399
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,740
or ring with the NIS logo on it.

400
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,709
Life is all about give and take,

401
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,270
but what's there for me
to take? Nothing at all.

402
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,710
Even if I kindly keep
your secret to myself,

403
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,280
I'll get nothing...

404
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,480
Ms. Oh, congratulations on being
awarded the Presidential Citation.

405
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,119
You helped an NIS agent find
Emperor Gojong's gold bars.

406
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,250
How do you feel now?

407
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,790
I simply did my duty.

408
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,790
As a Korean History
teacher and a Korean citizen,

409
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,390
it is my duty...

410
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,500
to teach children accurate history.

411
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,870
Ms. Oh, I had faith in you!

412
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,330
I'm flattered.

413
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,200
And you're so modest
too. You're the best, Ms. Oh.

414
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,709
Mr. Baek, go ahead and give Ms.
Oh a permanent teaching position.

415
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,879
{\an8}(Award Certificate)

416
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,509
Congratulations, Ms. Oh!

417
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,580
Congratulations!

418
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,349
Thank you!

419
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,780
- Oh Su A! - Oh Su A!

420
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,690
- Oh Su A! - Oh Su A!

421
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,220
- Oh Su A! - Oh Su A!

422
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,800
- Ms. Oh? - I will help you.

423
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,200
All of a sudden?

424
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,200
I give you my word...

425
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,870
that I won't tell anyone.

426
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,710
Mr. NIS Agent, I'll do my very best...

427
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,880
to help you...

428
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,780
so you can accomplish your
mission without any difficulty.

429
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,150
You kind of sound like...

430
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,720
you're brimming with ambition right now.

431
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,950
No.

432
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,290
I just want to help you...

433
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,460
- because I'm a nice person. - What?

434
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,599
You haven't tried this, right?

435
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,430
This is really... My,
look at all this meat.

436
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,400
Eat the meat with some potato.

437
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,100
Eat up.

438
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,070
The pork bone soup here is very good.

439
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,240
- But why, all of a sudden... - Eat up.

440
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Yu Jeong is your little sister?

441
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,019
My gosh. Then that part-time employer...

442
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,920
must be your supervisor
at NIS and Yu Jeong's dad.

443
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,790
Yes, precisely.

444
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,659
Jeong and An. Your surnames are different,

445
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,290
so she can't be your real sister.

446
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,930
I guess she's your stepsister, then.

447
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,730
No, it's not like that.

448
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,700
It's a long story.

449
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,440
Everyone has a story. I understand.

450
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,950
Ms. Oh.

451
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
If...

452
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,889
the person who killed Mr. Kim Hyeon Ho...

453
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,790
finds out that you were there
at the time of the incident,

454
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,830
you could be put in danger too.

455
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,500
But you don't need to worry.

456
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,170
I'll be sure to protect you.

457
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,310
I promise I'll keep you out of harm's way.

458
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,240
Since you've made up your mind to help me,

459
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,210
I'll do my very best to wrap up...

460
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,920
What's wrong?

461
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,090
Your face is all red.

462
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,850
Maybe you have a fever.

463
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,930
My gosh. What do you think you're doing?

464
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,060
I mean...

465
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,200
Are the people at the
NIS... Are they all like this?

466
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,700
- What did I even do?
- Get a grip on yourself.

467
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,869
You're a teacher, and I'm a student.

468
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,039
I mean, we're both students.

469
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,170
- What? - I mean... What?

470
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,410
Whatever!

471
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Don't say things like that
with that face of yours.

472
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,980
How could he be so careless?

473
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,020
What's up with her?

474
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
That face of mine?

475
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,410
I appreciate the heads-up.

476
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,149
I wouldn't have known.

477
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,219
(Kim Hyeon Ho)

478
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,990
But Kim Hyeon Ho...

479
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,619
There was nothing I could do.

480
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,890
He was...

481
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,120
too haughty.

482
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,170
Goodness.

483
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,410
Hello.

484
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,450
You seem good-natured.

485
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,060
Who knew someone as amiable as you...

486
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,420
would do such a thing?

487
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,570
What was the reason?

488
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,070
Why did you send Jeong
Hae Seong that letter?

489
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,270
(Personnel File)

490
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,040
(Domestic Team 3 until 2002,
Domestic Team 4 until 2003)

491
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,650
I thought about it...

492
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,420
and figured he should know...

493
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,090
why Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon
disappeared all those years ago.

494
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,520
Seo Myeong Ju, don't think...

495
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,659
you people are the only ones...

496
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,400
who know about the
mission from 22 years ago.

497
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,160
Would Jeong Hae Seong even believe you?

498
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,430
I'll show him something...

499
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,040
that'll make him believe such as...

500
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,570
Agent Jeong's notebook.

501
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,680
That'll be a huge help to Hae Seong.

502
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,110
It has the answers to
Seo Byeong Mun's riddle.

503
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,920
Relay this message to him at the NIS.

504
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,490
Tell him that he will fail this time...

505
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,960
just like he did last time
retrieving the gold bars.

506
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,160
Mr. Kim.

507
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,230
Why are you addressing
me like I'm under you?

508
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,910
I'll see you at school.

509
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,580
You won't allow any more murders?

510
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,580
Is this a treasure hunt
hosted at a school picnic?

511
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,920
Or is this you...

512
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,150
being sentimental...

513
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,190
over a former colleague?

514
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,500
What if Jeong Hae Seong had
met with a former NIS agent...

515
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,870
and had heard the truth about his father?

516
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,140
He would've come for you.

517
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,490
If I had been even a little bit late,

518
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,730
the entire plan would've gone awry.

519
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,070
Consider your gratitude noted.

520
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,279
(3. The piano that plays alone)

521
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,980
(The president of the piano club...)

522
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,350
The third ghost story...

523
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,090
is about the piano that plays by itself.

524
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,560
{\an8}(Since then, the piano at
Byeongmun High's music studio...)

525
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,380
The president of the piano club...

526
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,480
had a female student as his partner.

527
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,000
After finding out she was pregnant one day,

528
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,470
she told the piano club president.

529
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,410
His reaction was nothing but cold.

530
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,060
Left with no hope,

531
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,760
the girl chose to take her own life.

532
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,630
Since then, the piano at
Byeongmun High's music studio...

533
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,950
What the heck?

534
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,490
What is that notebook?

535
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,289
What's with that scary story?

536
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,960
You were even more terrifying!

537
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,260
The key to Emperor Gojong's gold bars.

538
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,400
Ghost story number three.
The piano that plays by itself.

539
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,470
Do you know where the grand piano is kept?

540
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,610
Beats me. I haven't been
working here that long.

541
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,480
A grand piano...

542
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,720
from the 1950s?

543
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,330
While meeting with Dong
Min's and Tae Soo's parents,

544
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,560
I saw it in the chairwoman's office.

545
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,470
However,

546
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,200
it'll be nearly impossible
to sneak in there.

547
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,770
The annex isn't open at all times,

548
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,439
and it has its own security guards.

549
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,580
When do they open it?

550
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,710
When was it again?

551
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,450
There's the perfect day for it.

552
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,680
(The 24th Night for Byeongmunites, 2025)

553
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,120
You probably all know
this, but the day has come.

554
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,260
The Night for Byeongmunites.

555
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,490
We invite those in politics,
judicial circles, business,

556
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,299
as well as alumni to this event,

557
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,570
so I ask all members of
the council to be present.

558
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,870
I'm afraid that won't be
the case for Hae Seong.

559
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,139
What? Why?

560
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,010
Because it's not for just anyone,

561
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,540
especially someone with
over 20 demerit points.

562
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,980
I don't understand.

563
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,149
How did I get over 20 demerit points?

564
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,450
For skipping school.

565
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,950
- How many are you at? - I'm at 19.

566
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,760
You can't spring this on me.

567
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,519
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

568
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,790
Didn't you read the student handbook?

569
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,660
It's all in there, so get reading.

570
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,760
Are you saying you did?

571
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,680
You said you would assist me.

572
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,849
How could you give me the
maximum demerit points...

573
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,850
for skipping school?

574
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:47,009
Why are you biting my head off...

575
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,180
when you're the one who skipped school?

576
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,749
Besides, just because
I agreed to assist you...

577
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,190
doesn't mean I'll only give
you half of the demerit points.

578
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,859
I couldn't since there are rules.

579
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,930
Unbelievable.

580
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,160
Since when have you
been a stickler for rules?

581
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,730
I can't believe you're
talking to me like this.

582
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,570
How old are you?

583
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,040
Why would age matter at this point?

584
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,640
You're obviously older than me.

585
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,180
- Maybe if you... - Hey!

586
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,920
Move along.

587
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,090
Such sweethearts.

588
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,920
Anyway, this is bad.

589
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,590
We'll think of something
and regroup tomorrow.

590
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,100
Look at him being thorough.

591
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,999
He actually bowed before leaving.

592
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,200
Unbelievable.

593
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,009
How can he think I'm older
when he looks like my senior?

594
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,080
Unbelievable.

595
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,880
How do I get back at him for this?

596
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,820
(The Next Face of Byeongmun High)

597
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,530
I must ask, Hae Seong.

598
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,470
Did it never occur to you...

599
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,540
to give a reason before skipping school?

600
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,370
I needed time to collect my thoughts.

601
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,340
Who knew truancy would
result in 20 demerit points?

602
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,710
This is bad.

603
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,749
This upcoming event
seems like the only chance...

604
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,250
to get into the chairwoman's office.

605
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,520
There's a way.

606
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,120
Ms. Oh.

607
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,359
Allow me to officially introduce myself.

608
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,899
I'm Oh Su A,

609
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,030
a Korean history teacher at Byeongmun High.

610
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,600
Yu Jeong's father, I believe we met before.

611
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,800
Goodness me, Ms. Oh.

612
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,010
I apologize for my behaviour that day.

613
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,039
{\an8}(The Next Face of Byeongmun High)

614
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,240
{\an8}(Benefits)

615
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,319
"The Next Face of Byeongmun High?"

616
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,220
The one selected will
instantly receive 25 merit points.

617
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,519
That'll make up for the
agent's 20 demerit points...

618
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,890
and give him five extra.

619
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,260
You have a point.

620
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,200
Why are you showing me this though?

621
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Come on.

622
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,270
You can't be serious. It's absurd.

623
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,340
This isn't right.

624
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,910
How can I compete with kids at this age?

625
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,450
I even danced to promote
myself the last time.

626
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,090
I'm quite shy.

627
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,390
I won't do it. No way.

628
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,830
I'm putting my foot down.

629
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,600
I won't do it.

630
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,190
Shall we?

631
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,300
Move it along.

632
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,610
Okay.

633
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,180
One, two, three.

634
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,520
Here we go.

635
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,760
Should it be taken this far?

636
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,360
It's my first time at one of these things.

637
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,800
Okay.

638
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,740
- You're here! - Gosh, hello.

639
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,840
Isn't that Ms. Kim?

640
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,679
I didn't know this,

641
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,180
but it turns out she's as
good as any photographer.

642
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,919
She took all the photos of the
former faces of Byeongmun.

643
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,950
I see.

644
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,190
Don't stand there nodding
and head over to her.

645
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,460
Hurry and change!

646
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,660
Come on.

647
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,160
Come on.

648
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,640
Relax and let's start simple.

649
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,540
- With a smile. - Sure.

650
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,970
A small one will do.

651
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,610
Smile.

652
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,850
Relax your mouth a bit.

653
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,810
Smile.

654
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,920
Relax your shoulders and let them drop.

655
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,260
- Are they stiff? - Good.

656
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,020
What's with his expression?

657
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,929
- He's usually more handsome.
- He's so stiff.

658
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,500
He must be finding this too awkward.

659
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,169
- Maybe... - I know he can relax more.

660
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,030
You can do better.

661
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,470
- Just a second. - Sure.

662
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,710
What now?

663
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:14,680
He's a lost cause.

664
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,339
All I see is a log.

665
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,150
There aren't any usable shots.

666
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,950
He's hopeless.

667
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,349
Let's go.

668
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,889
Look.

669
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,789
Here he comes.

670
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,630
He used to model as a kid.

671
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:44,710
Check Hyeon Joon out.

672
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:46,969
Nice going, Hyeon Joon. Looking good.

673
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,840
No wonder he's vice president.

674
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,910
- That's what I'm talking about. - Nice!

675
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,649
That's great, Hyeon Joon.

676
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,880
A former model sure knows what he's doing.

677
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,419
He'll win at this rate.

678
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,450
What?

679
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,519
Check that out.

680
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,190
Isn't he sexy?

681
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,230
Guys, let's take ten!

682
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,430
Come here.

683
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,199
Agent, you're not here
for a passport photo.

684
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,669
You need to smile prettier.

685
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,439
I was doing my best.

686
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,170
Look sexier.

687
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,710
- Water. - He'll have some water.

688
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,880
Didn't I at least do better than them?

689
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,979
You weren't any better!

690
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,980
One, two.

691
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,980
Okay, good.

692
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,160
All right. Watch and learn.

693
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,100
First, second, and third.

694
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,570
Byeongmun High School. Got it?

695
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,779
Come to Byeongmun High.

696
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,980
What are you doing?

697
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,310
Just watch and memorize.

698
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,980
Come to Byeongmun High.

699
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,090
That smile is a keeper.

700
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,460
Stay as you are. Hold on.

701
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,530
One. One, two three.

702
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,930
Nice!

703
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,630
That's it. "Come to our school."

704
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,200
See? Check this out.

705
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,240
Look. Don't you look way better?

706
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,939
What?

707
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,540
Look how natural this is.

708
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,140
Don't you look great?
You're actually good at this.

709
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,480
Look. This is what you need...

710
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,420
to bring to the photo shoot.

711
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,519
You've got this, Agent Jeong.

712
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,190
- Got it. - Okay?

713
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,990
- Has the break loosened you up? - Sure.

714
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,160
We'll try again.

715
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,670
Smile gently.

716
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,230
That's it.

717
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,440
No way.

718
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,210
All right.

719
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,580
- No way. - Give me a shy smile.

720
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,050
That's it.

721
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,049
Look at him!

722
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,980
- No way. - He's actually good.

723
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,090
Could you take off your jacket?

724
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,190
My jacket?

725
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,460
Here we go.

726
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,530
- Good job, Hae Seong! - He looks great.

727
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,130
- Check that out. - No way.

728
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,099
All right. Give it to me.

729
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,369
Think you're a beast.

730
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,400
That's it.

731
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,640
Why don't you loosen your
tie and unbutton your shirt?

732
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,680
Good! I love it.

733
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:43,080
You're swallowing the camera whole.

734
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,490
Okay!

735
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,890
Good job.

736
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,389
You did great.

737
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,530
Ye Na, you're up next.

738
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,700
Hae Seong, you looked great.

739
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,840
What happened during the break?

740
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,070
How did you get so good?

741
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,840
I received a private tutoring session.

742
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,440
He had a tutor?

743
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,950
I don't want to.

744
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,980
I won't roll up my sleeve, so just take it.

745
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,820
This is more than enough.

746
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,019
Everyone else looked relaxed,

747
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,259
but you might seem too rigid.

748
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,789
Let's take a few with
your sleeves rolled up.

749
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,259
How many times must
I refuse? I don't want to.

750
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,200
I don't want to, so don't give it a rest!

751
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,270
Ye Na, does it hurt a lot?

752
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,180
I'm sorry.

753
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,979
Ms. Kim, the truth is,

754
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,350
she got injured because of me earlier.

755
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,250
Can we go see the school nurse?

756
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,690
What? Yes, of course.

757
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
Come on.

758
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,610
We're good now. I'm fine, so get going.

759
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,180
Do you still do it?

760
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:25,820
Your wrist, I mean.

761
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,360
Ye Na, the gym teacher said to...

762
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,730
Hey, what's that?

763
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,940
I told you never to bring it up again.

764
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,810
Right, I'm sorry.

765
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,609
As a friend, I was worried...

766
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,680
My friend?

767
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,410
An Yu Jeong.

768
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,780
Have you no shame?

769
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,120
You're not my friend.

770
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,420
Don't think you're on my level
just because I hung out with you.

771
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,759
Hypocrites like you who
pretend to be saints make me sick.

772
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,790
Lee Ye Na.

773
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,230
Apologize to her.

774
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,700
- What if I don't? - Apologize.

775
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,470
You've got to be kidding me.

776
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,939
What are you two to each other?

777
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,070
- That's enough. Get back inside.
- Why should I?

778
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,310
Doesn't it hurt your pride to hear that?

779
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,580
An Yu Jeong.

780
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,580
You're a piece of work.

781
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:32,219
But still, you had the
audacity to lie to me.

782
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,320
Ye Na, you're mistaken.

783
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,219
We're not what you think.

784
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,320
You're despicable.

785
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,630
You make me sick.

786
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,700
Yu Jeong, we need to talk.

787
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,340
Was what I said a joke to you?

788
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,540
I told you not to interfere!

789
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,250
Not now but later.

790
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,790
Come see me once the photo shoot is over.

791
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,860
I saw what went on before
making my presence known.

792
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,000
You have no idea about high school girls.

793
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,700
What don't I know?

794
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,240
You're Yu Jeong's family.

795
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,440
I can guarantee you...

796
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,150
that there's no high school girl...

797
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,020
who wants her brother to
meddle with her friendships.

798
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,650
I get that but...

799
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,620
How could I not say anything and let her...

800
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,860
be treated like that?

801
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,690
Friendships...

802
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,429
are more complicated and
delicate than we can imagine.

803
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,060
That's why you must give it time.

804
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,900
Besides, you know this.

805
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,640
You're only here momentarily
while Yu Jeong is here to stay.

806
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,110
These are her peers she
must go to school with.

807
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,480
At least for a year or maybe even more.

808
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,680
That's why...

809
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,720
you should let it play out...

810
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,650
until she comes to you.

811
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,450
In my opinion,

812
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,690
that's how you can help her.

813
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:18,330
It's not easy.

814
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,560
Did you think it would be?

815
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,830
Here. Hang in there and push forward.

816
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,650
Unbelievable. What do I
do with a bonehead like you?

817
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,480
"Hye" is spelled...

818
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,549
with a Y in the middle.

819
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,560
How many times must I tell you that?

820
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,989
Spellings are hard to memorize.

821
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,760
Did you think it'd be easy?

822
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,730
Hang in there and push forward.

823
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,270
Again.

824
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,700
Write "a teacher's grace."

825
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,180
Why are you smirking?

826
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,450
I was reminded of someone.

827
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,280
Your first love?

828
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,060
Come on. Who was it?

829
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:25,360
Who?

830
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,890
There's this someone.

831
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,500
Wait. Come on.

832
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,030
Who was it? Tell me.

833
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,000
Why do you even want to know?

834
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,299
Don't be like that and tell me.

835
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,970
I can't sleep with this
hanging over my head.

836
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,780
Wait, it's raining.

837
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,079
Oh Bong Ja, take this umbrella.

838
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,790
I told you not to call me by that name!

839
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,320
Just a second.

840
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,290
Mom, I don't go by Oh Bong Ja anymore.

841
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,030
- Why is there only one umbrella?
- That's me being smart.

842
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,899
Don't leave him hanging and go!

843
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,900
What?

844
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,070
All right, fine.

845
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
What were you going on about?

846
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,870
(Have a Drink With Su A)

847
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,680
Sorry about that. We only had one umbrella.

848
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,840
Shall we? Where do you live?

849
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,200
(Undercover High School)

850
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,830
I'll come find you soon.

851
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,999
{\an8}I'll do it.

852
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,329
{\an8}Ms. Oh, of course. She's
the wild card of our team.

853
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,369
{\an8}What do you think you're doing?

854
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:33,470
{\an8}Stay right beside me.

855
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,740
{\an8}Something's up with
me. Get a grip on yourself.

856
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,800
{\an8}That was unexpected.

857
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,840
{\an8}The operation will be carried
out at 8pm when the event begins.

858
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,039
{\an8}When the chairwoman leaves her office...

859
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,640
{\an8}is our best moment to strike.

860
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,779
{\an8}- Cheers! - Cheers! You know...

861
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,810
{\an8}how important this day is.

862
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,080
{\an8}Would I be able to do this?

863
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,719
{\an8}Calm down. I'm sure it's nothing.

864
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,849
{\an8}Hae Seong, leave for now.

865
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,090
{\an8}It's dangerous for you to stay.

866
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,789
{\an8}I'll make sure nothing
happens, so don't worry.

867
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,820
{\an8}Also...

868
01:09:58,990 --> 01:09:59,990
{\an8}You look pretty today.
