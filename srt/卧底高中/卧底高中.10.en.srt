Hello.

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,550
I heard.

15
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,320
You almost died.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,960
From now on, you should be extra careful.

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,450
We meet often these days.

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,450

Right, of course.

That's a secret.

29
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,450
I'd like my name tag back.

refer to Chairman Seo Byeong Mun.

Is there more you can tell me?

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,080
What don't I know? Give me anything.

39

leaving anything behind.

Please, sir.

It's out of my hands.

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,859
Who could possibly disobey
the chairwoman's order?

46
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,530
Even the chairwoman
has to follow school policy.

47

The school doesn't belong to her.

48
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,369
How could she expel my student...

49
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,600
- without my approval... - Ms. Oh!

50
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,810

- Mr. Baek... - Let me be clear.

52
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,179
You're to follow the order from above.

Do not mention Jeong Hae Seong ever again.

54

Keep this up,

55

Why doesn't she get it?

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,690
Can't she tell which way the water flows?

58
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,530
I still can't wrap my head around it.

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,459
What did Hae Seong do wrong?

60
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,200
Won't we get to see you anymore?

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,629
We'll talk to the chairwoman.

Seo's office or anything.

solid with witnesses and evidence.

a stroll in the park for him.

go without making a scene?

I'm now wondering if I'm being greedy...

161
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,240
and selfish.

162
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,880

That's what scares you.

168

171
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,180

is for you to be scared.

172

I am.

crumble within seconds.

It's better now that you're smiling.

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,860
Cheers.

185
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,250
(Uncle)

186
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,980
How did it go?

187
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,290
We've been put on standby,

188
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,560
and the team was dismantled.

189
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,569
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

190
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,070
It's not like you to sound weak and guilty.

191
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,199
If this has you dispirited...

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,270
Uncle.

193
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,070
I want to continue.

194
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,840
I...

195
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,750
want to correct what is wrong.

196
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,650
Can you help me?

197
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,850
That's it.

198
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,350
That's my boy.

199
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,529
Starting tomorrow,
we'll gather at my place.

200
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,700
- Got it, Hae Seong. - Got it, Hae Seong.

201
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,670
Isn't that the first time
he asked for our help?

202
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,970
You heard him.

203
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,240
Starting tomorrow,
we'll gather at his place.

204
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,210
(Domestic Team Four)

205
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,880
That was fine work you did.

206
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,980
Should I be thanking you or something?

207
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,150
I hope this will be the
end of such requests.

208
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,460
No one in this room has
a squeaky-clean past.

209
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,889
You should keep your head down and...

210
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,960
There's something my
father always used to say.

211
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,700
"If you serve your servants white rice,"

212
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,170
"they come to think of
themselves as noblemen."

213
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,970
Chairwoman Seo.

214
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,970
That's out of line.

215
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,810
Mr. Kim.

216
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,850
I'm the one who seated
you as the director of the NIS.

217
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,290
Now, listen.

218
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,690
Don't challenge me.

219
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,360
Don't talk back.

220
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,960
Like you've been doing so far,

221
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,900
eat the feed I've been giving you.

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,570
No. Don't nod and answer me in words.

223
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,070
Principal Park.

224
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,050
There you go. Good boy.

225
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey, we're listed here.

226
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,300
- Are you saying we can't eat yet? - What?

227
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,769
- Hey. - Move, will you?

228
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,070
- Out of the way. - Move!

229
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,409
- I'm Class B. - Move, will you?

230
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,640
What's going on?

231
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,609
The chairwoman ordered
them to serve meals differently...

232
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,780
according to our grades.

233
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,680
I thought you knew.

234
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
I never thought she'd stoop this low.

235
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,620
Why is Hae Seong suddenly calling you?

236
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,290
Are you in contact with him?

237
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,570
Why is he calling me?

238
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,870
I bet he called the wrong person.
He's never called me before.

239
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,070
Gosh, I'm hungry.

240
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
This is me.

241
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,680
That reaction just now
is highly suspicious.

242
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,940
Chae Lin.

243
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,710
- Your meal's over there. - Me?

244
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
What...

245
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,790
But why?

246
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,430
Agent Jeong Hae Seong, this is An Yu Jeong.

247
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,840
I will begin my briefing.

248
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,540
Shoot.

249
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,910
The school meal.

250
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,639
We are served different
meals depending on our grades.

251
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,839
The side dishes are different,

252
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,809
and you have to eat later
if you have lower grades.

253
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,949
What about Dong Min and the others?

254
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,719
As if there would be any surprises.

255
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,750
They eat last, of course.

256
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,589
What else?

257
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,819
Only those in the special class...

258
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,419
can stay behind for
late-night self-study sessions.

259
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,890
The rest can't even if they want to.

260
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,489
They're only caring about
those in the special class.

261
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,759
Also, our grades for midterms and finals...

262
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
will be posted on the bulletin board.

263
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,499
The school has gotten weirder...

264
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,970
ever since the chairwoman got back.

265
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,140
Can't...

266
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,469
Can't the NIS help?

267
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,470
I'm hanging up.

268
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,610
You darn jerk.

269
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,300
Is there anything to place this on?

270
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,400
- Why you... - What?

271
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,670
- Come on. Get me something. - Over there.

272
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,930
Oh, right.

273
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,740
Did I tell you...

274
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,940
that Seo Myeong Ju
solved the third ghost story?

275
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,610
What?

276
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,239
I guess I didn't.

277
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,750
I think she saw what was in the notebook.

278
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,450
Thanks for telling us this quickly.

279
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,480
- I'm amazed by the speed.
- I appreciate the compliment.

280
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,390
What's good though...

281
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,730
is that she hasn't solved
the fourth ghost story yet.

282
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,830
But we're just as clueless.

283
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,840
Check this out for now.

Hold on. I have something for you.

290
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,550
What's this?

291
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,449
The collection of writings
of the student council...

292
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,520
back when your dad
was the advising teacher.

293
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,219
He went by the name Kim Jae Yeong.

294
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,129

You're saying...

303
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,890
that this is Byeongmun
High's fourth ghost story?

304
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,420
That's how it seems.

305
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,290
Isn't it weird though?

The computer.

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,029
Seo Byeong Mun died in 1957.

308
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,570
At that time, computers
weren't even used in Korea.

309
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,239
That means the ghost story...

310
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
wasn't left behind by Seo Byeong Mun.

311
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,670

(Advising teacher: Kim Jae Yeong)

313

The one who put this
collection of writings together.

314
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,049
There were only ever three ghost stories,

315
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,750
but one was fabricated to confuse others...

316
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,690
or to stop Seo Myeong Ju
from obtaining the gold bars.

317
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,659
If there never was a
fourth story to begin with,

318
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,890
that leaves us with one conclusion.

319
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,000
The meaning behind this phrase.

320
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,799
Solving it...

321
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,700
will point us to where the gold bars are.

322
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,079
So? How did it go?

323
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,949
We checked from the
gym to the assembly hall,

324
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,220
but nothing showed up.

325
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,320
Anyway, Ms. Seo, has the school
gym gone under renovation before?

326
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,620
There are interesting tales
surrounding the school.

327
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,230
He even went as far as to lie to me?

328
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,330
Fine. Starting tomorrow,
search the main building.

329
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,070
And make it fast.

330
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,399
Our cards are all on the table now,

331
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,369
so speed is of the essence.

332
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,910
- Okay? - Yes, ma'am.

333
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,750
The one with the bead. "Hwigyeong."

334
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
The words refers to Seo Byeong Mun.

335
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,920
"The gold will shine."

336
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,860
That's where the gold bars are.

337
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,890
When Seo Byeong Mun faces the red sun,

338
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,860
he'll point to where the gold bars are.

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,069
What on earth is the red sun?

340
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,869
Seo Byeong Mun facing it is also an issue.

341
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,270
It's not like a dead man
can rise from his casket.

342
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,869
What can he face?

343
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,010
Could he have...

344
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,040
left a copy of him at the school?

345
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
A copy of him?

346
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:23,080
To guard the gold bars even in his death...

347
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,679
with those crimson eyes of his.

348
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,379
What is this crap you're spewing?

349
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,849
Go home if you're not going to be helpful!

350
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,190
No, wait. Yeong Hun has a point.

351
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,420
See? I have my moments.

352
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,560
So what could be a copy of him
or something that symbolizes...

353
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Seo Byeong Mun?

354
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,729
Come on.

355
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,740
You'd know having been a student there.

356
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,140
Seo Byeong Mun's...

357
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,170
portrait?

358
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
His portrait?

359
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,410
- There are too many of them. - I see.

360
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,710
Seo Byeong Mun's...

361
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,680
bust.

362
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,590
Look it up.

363
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,750
His bust?

364
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,029
"As the Minister of Finance
of the Empire of Korea,"

365
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,159
"he served as keeper
of the royal treasure..."

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,430
"and founded Hwigyeong Public Academy."

367
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,569
"After Korea lost its sovereignty,"

368
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,069
"he joined the independence movement..."

369
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,499
"and contributed to the development
of our nation's education..."

370
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,869
"by taking office as the first chairman..."

371
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,270
"of Hwigyeong Academy."

372
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,039
He served Japan and wasn't
an independence fighter.

Hey. Where are you off to?

377
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,789
The school. To confirm it.

378
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,060
How? You were expelled.

379
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,020
You're right.

382
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,609
Things haven't been the same...

383
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,280
since Hae Seong was expelled.

384
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,520
Everything's a mess and is confusing.

385
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,689
He came with his drama,

386
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,450
but things were fun when he was around.

387
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,320
Anyway,

388
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,790
what did he do to get on
the chairwoman's bad side?

389
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,490
Do you know anything?

390
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,800
I'm just as clueless.

391
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,839
The recently changed guidelines
aren't making things better.

392
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,340
What will become of this school?

393
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,950
I wouldn't mind someone
turning it upside down.

394
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,150
- Delivery. - Come on in.

395
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,080
You can leave it here.

396
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,789
Please enjoy.

397
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,460
Thank you.

398
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,130
You!

399
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,240
You?

400
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,809
My gosh!

401
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,870
My stomach hurts.

402
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,139
Enjoy and head home.

403
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,380
- What? - My stomach's killing me!

404
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,620
But this is delicious.

405
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,060
You! Are you crazy?

406
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,130
Why would you come here?

407
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,570
You're out of your mind.

408
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,039
This was my best option.

409
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,510
My heart's still racing.

410
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,379
What if the chairwoman finds out?

411
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,480
I had something to check.

412
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,050
What about his bust? Why...

413
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,260
Did you find them?

414
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,290
If what I think is correct, yes.

415
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,830
My gosh.

416
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,430
So you're saying...

417
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,269
that he stole from the nation...

418
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,630
and hid the gold in the
sculpture of himself?

419
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,370
He sure is testing me.

420
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,540
What are you doing?

421
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,139
Do you know how long...

422
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,039
our independence was
set back because of him?

423
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,579
An independence fighter, you say?

424
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,649
A contributor to our nation's education?

425
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,979
You shouldn't touch that.

426
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Why you...

427
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,940
Who's there?

428
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,310
Ms. Oh?

429
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,420
Mr. Baek, what brings you here?

430
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,080
I forgot something.

431
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,020
Who's there behind you?

432
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,220
I ordered a late-night snack,

433
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,719
but he couldn't remember his way out.

434
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,959
He should've dropped off the food and left.

435
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,330
Why is he still here?

436
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,200
Well...

437
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,469
He was greatly interested
in our school's history,

438
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,600
- so I was explaining... - Step aside.

439
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,940
Which service are you with?

440
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,010
What's the number?

441
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,840
Look at that.

442
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,039
You can't even answer my questions.

443
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,540
There's something suspicious about you.

444
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,180
Take off that helmet.

445
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,890
Don't just stand there and take it off!

446
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,060
If you don't comply, I'll call the cops.

447
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Good.

448
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,780
Guess who?

449
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,749
Ms. Oh, I'm sorry,

450
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,149
but what is the meaning of this?

451
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,590
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,589
- Ms. Oh, what... - Guess who?

453
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,729
- What is this? - My gosh!

454
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,230
Are you kidding me?

455
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,829
Let go!

456
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,530
What woman is this strong?

457
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,539
What... My eyes.

458
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,140
What on earth? Wait, that man.

459
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,180
Where did he go?

460
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,779
He has deliveries piled up.

461
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,719
Are you kidding me?

462
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,849
- You... - My gosh.

463
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,119
- Which service did you use? - I'm sorry.

464
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,989
Was it Delivery Nation or Coming to You?

465
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,050
I don't know.

466
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,299
Hey, how did it go?

467
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,069
- What the... - Hey!

468
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,240
Stay put, will you?

469
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,710
The bust is the key.

470
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,880
- It rotates. - No way. And?

471
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,309
So?

472
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,810
What happened after it rotated?

473
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,380
I don't know.

474
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,080
Why not?

475
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Because I got caught.

476
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,419
You were caught?

477
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,960
By whom?

478
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,329
- I wasn't caught. - What?

479
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,130
I was caught, but I also wasn't.

480
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,130
What on earth is he saying?

481
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,799
Someone interpret that.

482
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
Well, I had my helmet on, so don't worry.

483
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,840
Anyway, that's not important.

484
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,080
We need to figure out
how we'll get the gold bars.

485
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,880
- Okay, how will we do that?
- Let's brainstorm.

486
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,310
What? What is with you?

487
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,950
I didn't know you liked
to do things on a whim!

488
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,719
So, we don't have a plan.

489
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,189
- Seriously. - You said you wouldn't...

490
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,319
Then you come up with a plan, you punk!

491
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,419
- What? - Why are you yelling?

492
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,459
- When did I... - How could you...

493
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,890
- This fool! - Quiet down!

494
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,890
I barely made it out!

495
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,059
Students are complaining
about the differences...

496
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,500
in school meals based on their grades.

497
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,440
History always moves forward
even if people have complaints.

498
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,840
Don't mind them.

499
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,969
Ma'am, but if they continue
to complain about it...

500
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,869
The train has to depart on
time even if some dogs bark.

501
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,980
Don't worry about it.

502
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,880
- Mr. Baek, you're next. - Oh, yes.

503
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,949
I wanted to talk to you
about visitor control.

504
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,119
- Visitor? - Yes.

505
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Trespassing cases at schools...

506
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,459
have been on the rise
for the past five years.

507
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,019
But we have no security issues.

508
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,629
Sometimes, teachers who are working late...

509
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,260
would use food delivery apps.

510
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,030
Even last night, Ms. Oh Su A did that.

511
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,770
- Ms. Oh Su A? - Tell us more.

512
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
Sure.

513
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,670
The thing is, I saw Ms. Oh
talking to some delivery guy...

514
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,739
under the founder's sculpture last night.

515
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,239
She said he came to deliver her food.

516
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,679
I was like, "Just leave the food and go."

517
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,080
"Why are you chatting away?"

518
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,080
Then she said she was
explaining the school's history...

519
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,990
A food delivery guy driving
a van? That's unheard of.

520
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,920
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

521
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,429
There's a chance...

522
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,560
he might try to sneak in
again to find the gold bars.

523
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,629
What should we do?

524
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,470
I so kindly asked him not to do this.

525
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,240
Let's send him our second gift.

526
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,340
Yes.

527
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,080
Please proceed with the plan.

528
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,990
- I guess you're very busy.
- Yes, I am quite busy.

529
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,220
What is it? What now?

530
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,989
If it's about school
management, don't bring it up.

531
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,160
It's about Hae Seong.

532
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,230
I thought about it all day yesterday,

533
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,830
and there's only one answer.

534
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,470
You knew, didn't you?
That he wasn't a real student.

535
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,870
Hae Seong is an NIS agent.

536
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,240
Wasn't that why he was expelled?

537
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,809
The recent incidents at school.

538
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,149
Mr. Lee, you, Principal Park.

539
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,750
Hae Seong's real identity
and his expulsion too.

540
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,250
I bet there's something I don't know.

541
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,720
Ye Na, when I don't tell you something,

542
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
it means you don't need to know about it.

543
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,590
Tell me, please.

544
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,330
I have the right to know, Mom.

545
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,300
You can't get anything
done without trial and error.

546
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,969
The bigger the ocean is,

547
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,770
the more unpredictable the waves are.

548
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,509
Ye Na, the important thing is...

549
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,440
that Edu-City will be completed.

550
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,080
And the owner of Edu-City
is me, Seo Myeong Ju.

551
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,020
You will be my successor.

552
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,490
That's all you need to
know. I'll take care of the rest.

553
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,790
Mom.

554
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,600
Have you ever...

555
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,640
thought about what I might really want?

556
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
You see, I...

557
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,440
I believe there will come a day
when you can understand me.

558
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,210
I really believe that.

559
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,990
How about we go for a walk?

560
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,390
We haven't done it in a while.
You and me, just the two of us.

561
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,470
It's so cold these days.

562
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,330
Come on. Let's go!

563
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,070
(Here's the file on Jeong
Hae Seong you asked for.)

564
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,430
What is this?

565
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
My gosh.

566
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,410
That really scared me.

567
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,920
Hello?

568
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,290
I swear, I saw it move.

569
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,279
What are you doing?
You have a class to teach.

570
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,350
Yes, hello! I'm on my
way to my class. And you?

571
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,979
Hey, breathe.

572
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,220
You're out of breath.

573
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,160
I'm teaching Class Two. Let's go together.

574
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,060
What?

575
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,310
(New Message)

576
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,640
No way.

577
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,410
- What is this? - Hey, what's this?

578
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,010
- Did you see this? - What is this?

579
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,449
- What's going on?
- A teacher dating her student?

580
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,619
- What's this? - Guys, did you see this?

581
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,690
What is this?

582
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,820
What's this?

583
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,420
- This is huge! - Is this real?

584
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,990
- What's going on? - No way.

585
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,560
- Isn't this Ms. Oh?
- Is this the transfer student?

586
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,729
- What? - Oh, my.

587
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,300
- What is this? - For real?

588
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,810
My gosh.

589
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,220
(I'm so shocked. Shouldn't she get fired?)

590
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,150
This is why...

591
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,690
they should've listened to
me when I warned them nicely.

592
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,660
Stupid Koreans.

593
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,340
Hey, she's here.

594
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,610
All right.

595
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,190
Let's begin.

596
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:59,690
Where did we leave off last class?

597
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,160
Ms. Oh, what's with those photos?

598
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,790
Are you really dating a student?

599
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,830
She's all quiet, so it must be true.

600
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,170
I told you what I saw at the hospital.

601
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,070
They really are dating.

602
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,840
- How could she do this?
- That's inappropriate.

603
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,669
- Isn't it out of line? - Unbelievable.

604
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,069
I'm so disappointed in Ms. Oh.

605
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,440
How could she date a student?

606
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,440
- How could she... - Ms. Oh.

607
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,310
Chairwoman Seo wants to see you.

608
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,579
I'm teaching a class.
I'll speak with her later.

609
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,620
You don't have to...

610
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,750
teach here anymore.

611

(Korean History, Oh Su A)

612
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,390
Are they letting her go?

613
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,890
- Really? - I think she's getting fired.

614
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Come with me.

615
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,840
Who is interrupting Ms. Oh's class?

616
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,880
- Oh, my. - Hae Seong is here.

617
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,910
The students are here now, you know.

618
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,580
I suggest you return to
your office, Principal Park.

619
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,300
I know it's only been a few days,

620
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,600
but it's good to see you again.

621
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,570
Should we applaud him?

622
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,679
- Applause! - Give him a big hand!

623
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,850
- Thanks. - Applause!

624
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,850
- Yes! - He's so cool.

625
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,490
Applause!

626
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,730
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing here?

627
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,400
I came here today...

628
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,330
to tell you guys the truth.

629
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,340
About the pictures you saw this morning...

630
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,810
They're real.

631
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,380
- My gosh! - So, it's true?

632
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,180
- It's real? - They really are dating?

633
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,980
- So, it's real. - Yes, I told you.

634
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,520
But you guys shouldn't get the wrong idea.

635
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,690
Ms. Oh...

636
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,120
did not go on a date with a minor.

637
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,620
- "Minor?" - What's he saying?

638
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,430
- What? - He's not making any sense.

639
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,790
He's not a minor?

640
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,610
I've been serving in the
Reserve Forces for six years.

641
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,040
(Military Service Certificate)

642
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,750
I'm 31 years old.

643
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
- What? - What?

644
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,350
- What? - Now, he's even cooler.

645
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,049
- What? - So, he's an old man.

646
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,989
- He's old enough to be my uncle.
- Who called me Uncle?

647
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,819
Six years in the Reserve
Forces? He's thirty-one?

648
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,360
Anyway, I'm sorry for lying to you guys.

649
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,730
From now on, call me your big brother.

650
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,430
- Brother! - Brother!

651
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,970
Nice, I have a brother now.

652
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,400
- My brother, Hae Seong.
- He's older than us!

653
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,239
My gosh. What a relief.

- What? Jeong Hae Seong?

656
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,739
- Hey, Jeong Hae Seong is here! - Really?

657
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,079
- Jeong Hae Seong is here. - For real?

658
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,150
Is he really here?

659
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,250
Did the bell ring?

660
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,120
Ma'am.

661
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,030
Jeong Hae Seong is here now.

662
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,669
Jeong Hae Seong is here.
Look, Jeong Hae Seong.

663
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,339
My gosh. I guess it's true.

664
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,809
- Does this mean it's true?
- Yes, I think so.

665
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,840
It must be true.

666
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,810
- Oh, my. - I told you.

667
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,879
- I know. - What did I tell you?

668
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,380
All right. Any questions?

669
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,020
Yes, Chae Lin.

670
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,230
Why did you lie about your
age to attend this school, sir?

671
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,960
Right, I haven't explained that part.

672
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,170
The truth is, I'm from...

673
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,310
the National...

674
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,510
The National...

675
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,619
I didn't complete my
basic national education,

676
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,850
which left me deeply scarred.

677
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,890
What's he saying?

678
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,390
- He didn't go to high school. - Oh, I see.

679
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,400
Life's been tough for me.

680
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,270
As a Korean citizen,

681
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,940
I thought I at least needed
a high school diploma.

682
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,839
- How inspiring. - We understand!

683
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,169
- You're an inspiration! - Yes!

684
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,239
- Don't cry! - We get it!

685
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,279
- We understand. - Yes!

686
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,710
- So... - Don't worry!

687
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,650
I came here.

688
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,350
Then what about the
pictures of you and Ms. Oh?

689
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,480
What's going on between you two?

690
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,820
She helped me so I
could adjust well at school.

691
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,690
And...

692
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,330
I like her...

693
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,130
a lot.

694
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,249
Oh, my. They really are dating!

Hae Seong, you're so cool!

697
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,920
- Oh, no. - How romantic!

698
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,060
That was so cool!

699
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,260
- So cool! - Oh, my!

700
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,200
Kiss!

701
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,199
- What? Stop it. - Kiss!

702
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,899
- Kiss! - Kiss!

703
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,609
- Kiss! - Kiss!

704
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,070
- Kiss! - Kiss!

705
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,979
- Kiss! - Kiss!

706
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,150
- Kiss! - Kiss!

707
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,720
- Kiss! - Kiss!

708
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,420
You managed to turn an
ugly rumour into romance.

709
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,130
You can change genres
in the middle of a story.

710
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,200
It all depends on the choices
that the protagonist makes.

711
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,170
Try to smile a little.

712
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,800
When you're mad, it shows.

713
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,470
And...

714
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,370
it's my turn now.

715
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,050

00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,280
Let's go, teacher.

723
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,530
How could Jeong Hae Seong
get it sorted out so quickly?

724
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,869
I think the info got leaked...

725
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,569
Right, so who gave him the information?

726
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,670
You and I were the only ones
who knew about those pictures...

727
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,679
Come on, Ye Na. What are you doing?

728
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,810
I'm waiting.

729
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,180
I'm coming.

730
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,330
Thanks for your help in the morning.

731
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,510
Yes, hello?

732
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,270
I have something to tell you.

733
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,440
It's about you and Ms. Oh.

734
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,509
{\an8}(Byeongmun High School)

735
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,480
Wait, stop!

736
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,050
May I help you?

737
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Well...

738
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,260
He's a friend of mine.

739
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,690
Let's go inside.

740
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,360
Oh, all right.

741
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,200
You may go inside.

742
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,000
No problem.

743
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,710
No.

744
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,970
Ms. Oh means a lot to me too.

745
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,310
Should I use honorifics
when talking to you now?

746
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,580
I'll just keep talking casually.

747
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,320
- That's okay, right? - Suit yourself.

748
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,390
By the way, why did you give me a heads-up?

749
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,930
I don't know.

750
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,240
I just...

751
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,840
felt like I should tell you.

752
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,780
Let me ask you a question too.

753
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,610
Why did you come to our school?

754
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,480
Does it...

755
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,520
have something to do with my mom?

756
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,530
I'll tell you later...

757
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,500
when and if I get the chance.

758
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,510
I'm home.

759
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,080
Why did you do that?

760
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,050
I'm talking about Jeong Hae
Seong. Why did you do that?

761
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,390
Ye Na.

762
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,790
This is so frustrating.

763
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,820
I am asking you a question right now.

764
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,890
My gosh.

765
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,199
I'm really frustrated.

766
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,399
Your mother is asking you a question.

767
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,769
Why are you standing
there, all quiet? My goodness.

768
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,240
Ye Na, you...

769
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,699
Why do you keep acting up these days?

770
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,870
It's because of you, Mom.

771
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Hae Seong asked me the exact same question.

772
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,980
To him, I just said, "I don't know."

773
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,920
But now, I know why.

774
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,390
It was because of you, Mom.

775
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,390
You seem to be in a really
precarious situation now.

776
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,730
This isn't good.

777
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,340
Ye Na, get ready to study abroad.

778
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Mom.

779
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,969
You'll leave as soon as
possible, within one week.

780
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,039
No, I'm not going. I will stay here.

781
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,210
Don't act like a child!

782
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,020
Ye Na.

783
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,150
I call the shots. All you
need to do is obey me.

784
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,210
Hello, chairwoman.

785
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,110
The gold bars.

786
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,550
Find them within the day.

787
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,720
Search the whole main building if you must.

788
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,430
I won't lose them...

789
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,360
to Jeong Hae Seong.

790
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,030
Did you read that story?

791
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,069
Some lunatic in his 30s...

792
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,670
joined a high school
pretending to be a student.

793
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,940
What the heck for? Is he a pervert?

794
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,610
If you think about it, the world
must be coming to an end.

795
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,080
Shouldn't a grown man have better to do?

796
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,020
The darn psycho.

797
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,090
It's me.

798
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,160
- What? - It's me.

799
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,960
- Eat all you want. - Thanks.

800
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,170
Put that down.

801
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,740
Stop eating and talk first.

802
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,340
You mean...

803
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,410
the story that's
circulating the Internet...

804
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,880
- is about you? - Yes.

805
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,850
You did a proper job telling
the truth in front of the class.

806
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,920
(A student is dating a teacher.)

807
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,819
I didn't say I was NIS.

808
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,880
Good for me, right?

809
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,960
My blood pressure's rising.

810
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,460
Get me some water.

811
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,630
But...

812
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,730
why did you go and do that?

813
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,430
Seo Myeong Ju...

814
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,170
threatened me with photos of
me and Su A so I had no choice.

815
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,170
She helped us with our mission,

816
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,070
so I couldn't let her suffer.

817
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,510
Hey. Be honest.

818
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,080
There's something between you.

819
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,150
No.

820
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,750
On the house.

821
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,890
- Thank you. - There is.

822
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,120
It goes both ways.

823
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,330
That's not what's important.

824
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,070
If we don't find the gold tonight,

825
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,370
we might lose it to Seo Myeong Ju.

826
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,340
How are we to find the gold tonight?

827
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,909
The chairwoman is guarding the school,

828
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,240
and we're on standby.

829
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,080
We can't apply for a warrant.

830
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,779
We're stuck.

831
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,850
And if we're to sneak in...

832
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,810
Security will have been upgraded.

833
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,180
Yes.

834
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,520
So today,

835
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,250
we'll attack in the open.

836
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,260
Where are you?

837
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,699
We completed your
bust that will be placed...

838
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,940
in the main building of the new Edu-City.

839
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,739
There might not be an Edu-City.

840
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,080
What use is a bust?

841
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,820
The bust.

842
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,760
One's own representation.

843
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,060
The symbol of oneself.

844
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,969
- What? - What?

845
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,470
What? Is it weird?

846
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,070
Forget the weirdness. Is that...

847
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,610
even plausible?

848
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,110
Let's say it is for some miraculous reason.

849
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,610
We're too few.

850
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
Where will you find backup?

851
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,249
Director Kim can't know,

852
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,820
so we can't ask the company for help.

853
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,550
Shall I help?

854
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,490
You, ma'am?

855
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,200
My daughter told me a bit about you.

856
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,170
Thanks for looking out
for her, darling Hae Seong.

857
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,900
"Darling..."

858
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,410
You need people for your mission.

859
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,070
How many do you need?

860
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,230
- Have you eaten, ma'am? - Ma'am.

861
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,070
Ma'am.

862
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,200
What brings you out of
retirement to this rundown place?

863
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,940
Bongchang-dong Bloody Chicken Gang.

864
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,650
We have a job to do.

865
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,050
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

866
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,470
Did you know your mother's past?

867
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,080
I just found out, and I
won't talk back to her.

868
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,440
Don't.

869
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,620
Why are they called the
Bloody Chicken Gang?

870
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,520
"Bloodbath" sounded old...

871
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,950
and Ms. Im used to sell fried chicken.

872
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,490
Gosh.

873
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,720
And "Spicy Chicken Gang" sounds weird.

874
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,060
Sorry.

875
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,829
Are you ready?

876
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,070
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

877
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,639
Let's go!

878
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,640
- Okay! - Okay!

879
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,569
I'll see you later, agents.

880
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,609
- Okay. - Okay.

881
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,610
Take care, ma'am.

882
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,150
Make way.

883
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,160
My gosh.

884
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,870
It feels like a storm just passed by.

885
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,070
We'll get ready and set off too.

886
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,540
- See you later. - I'll be right there.

887
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,210
You're not coming?

888
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,080
You clueless idiot.

889
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,680
What...

890
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,690
Let's go.

891
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,289
After today's mission,

892
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,800
Jeong Hae Seong the
student will be no more.

893
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,630
That's a bit of a shame.

894
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,070
You looked good in the school uniform.

895
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,770
- Did I? - Yes.

896
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,510
What about you?

897
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,240
Do you feel sad about leaving your friends?

898
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,950
I do.

899
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,450
I think I'll miss them.

900
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,150
I'm off.

901
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,760
- Hae Seong. - Yes?

902
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,460
Once this mission is done...

903
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,900
- Let's grab a meal together. - A meal?

904
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,770
Okay.

905
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,770
- Just like that? - Yes.

906
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,080
I want to. Let's grab a meal.

907
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,210
Okay.

908
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,480
Let's grab a meal and a coffee too.

909
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,150
- Okay. - See you.

910
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,940
The bust.

911
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,540
The founding chairman's bust.

912
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,609
The gold's under that bust.

913
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,980
I'm heading to the school now.

914
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,650
Bring in some heavy
machinery and start digging.

915
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,450
Okay.

916
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,489
Let's do it!

917
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,129
Move in! Quickly!

918
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,160
Let's go!

919
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:09,460
This is it.

920
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,870
The bust. Did you remove it?

921
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,810
I think you should get here fast.

922
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,480
Block the entrance.

923
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,080
- Bring that over here. - Block the path.

924
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,950
Block it.

925
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,590
Okay.

926
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,560
- You can't come in here. - Get walking.

927
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:41,429
A car's coming. Take your positions.

928
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,459
- Hurry up. - Darn you.

929
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,900
- Let's be loud. - Okay.

930
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,600
Keep your wits about you.

931
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,299
Do you want to be here all night?

932
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,369
Find it quickly!

933
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,139
Don't you know we must move fast!

934
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,370
- Get to it! - What are you doing?

935
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,580
What are you doing in my school?

936
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,250
Speak with me...

937
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,250
Chairwoman Seo.

938
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,850
I'm from the NIS.

939
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,260
Mr. Agent.

940
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,990
What on earth is this?

941
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,130
I'm sorry I couldn't inform you sooner.

942
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,330
We got a tip that...

943
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,630
a spy got into Byeongmun High.

944
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,870
A spy?

945
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,500
From North Korea, to be exact.

946
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,940
We believe he came in via
the west coast and Incheon.

947
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,980
I see.

948
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,850
Shall I confirm that, then?

949
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,060
- And spin. - Spin.

950
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,760
- And swing down. - Down.

951
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,229
Try again a bit more relaxed.

952
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,700
Let's work more slowly.

953
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,169
- Hello? - It's Seo Myeong Ju.

954
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,840
Hyung Bae's busy right now.

955
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:58,910
Are you his wifey?

956
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,080
You dare take me on
with a stupid trick like this?

957
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,490
We'll investigate to see
if the tip-off was genuine.

958
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,960
For your safety, chairwoman...

959
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,090
Very well.

960
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,330
Principal Park?

961
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,370
Call our people immediately.

962
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,870
Okay.

963
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,270
Come this way.

964
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,370
Come with...

965
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,150
Hey.

966
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,760
She's calling her people. Will it be okay?

967
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,390
I don't know. It could be bad.

968
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,460
What?

969
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,900
I promise to find Emperor
Gojong's gold tonight.

970
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,270
You must.

971
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,550
They're ready.

972
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,130
If I were Seo Byeong Mun...

973
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,200
If I loved riddles and treasure...

974
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,540
If I created the scary stories...

975
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,410
and allowed only those who
solved them to reach the gold.

976
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,380
You were a curious guy.

977
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,780
Even in death,

978
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,190
you'd have wanted to
see who solved the puzzle.

979
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,420
If it were your descendant...

980
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,120
or someone like me and my dad...

981
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,430
who wanted to correct all the wrong.

982
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,840
First, the old building.

983
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,780
Second, the student council room.

984
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,380
Third, the music studio.

985
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,690
When the one with the bead...

986
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,620
faces the red sun...

987
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,740
The gold will shine.

988
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,050
{\an8}(First Chairman Seo Byeong Mun)

989
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,970
Senior Agent An.

990
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,340
How did it go? Did you find it?

991
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,140
The gold.

992
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,680
I don't think it existed.

993
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,010
What do you mean?

994
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,950
There's no gold?

995
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,420
Hello?

996
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:12,950
Hello?

997
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,190
Darn it.

998
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,630
(Undercover High School)

999
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,899
{\an8}Where's my gold?

1000
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,699
{\an8}Where did you hide my gold?

1001
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,229
{\an8}Chairwoman Seo's become a monster.

1002
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,800
{\an8}I think I found a way.

1003
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,270
{\an8}A way to make Jeong Hae Seong talk.

1004
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:21,039
{\an8}It looks like Hae Seong's
father was murdered, right?

1005
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,940
{\an8}I think Director Kim is the suspect.

1006
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,409
{\an8}Will Hae Seong...

1007
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,079
{\an8}Let's talk in person. Try to calm down...

1008
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,279
{\an8}I'm sorry, Uncle. This is the only way.

1009
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,150
{\an8}Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my dad?

1010
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,390
{\an8}- Jeong Hae Seong! - Three, two.

1011
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,890
{\an8}Su A. Thanks for everything.

1012
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,960
{\an8}Hae Seong!
