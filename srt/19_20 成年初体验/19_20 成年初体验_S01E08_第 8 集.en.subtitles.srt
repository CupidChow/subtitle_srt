SE-YEON

JI-MIN

YE-RIN

JI-WOO

PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,638
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,559
-Last time, I talked to Ye-rin in here.
-Really? What did you talk about?

13
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,811
-That I can't tell you.
-Oh, sorry.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,230
-Okay. Let's talk.
-Sure.

15
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,901
Finally.

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,737
-And so the battle begins.
-Isn't that Se-yeon's bed?

17
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,325
-I don't know much about you.
-Right.

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,579
Because we weren't that close
when you first came to school.

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,873
-Right.
-We're closer now.

20
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,210
-We got closer after cooking class.
-Right?

21
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,462
I like spending time with you

22
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,507
because I feel like we have good banter.

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,384
It's fun to be with you.

24
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,303
-And you're pretty.
-How can--

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,473
I thought you were really pretty.

26
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,308
-What?
-What's he doing?

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,976
-That was unexpected.
-Just like that?

28
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,146
-Ji-woo must be so confused.
-He's going so fast.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,106
I thought you were pretty
when we first met.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,358
How was my first impression?

31
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,734
You were very pretty.

32
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,069
-Really?
-You were pretty.

33
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,446
I kind of fell for you.

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,785
-I can't believe it.
-I fell for you.

35
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,663
I liked you ever since then.

36
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,583
I wanted to approach you,
but Jung-yun was faster.

37
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,085
-So I was just watching.
-Really?

38
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,003
-Yeah. I have feelings for you.
-I had no idea.

39
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,089
-That's cool.
-Cool?

40
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,424
If you hadn't told me,
I would've never known.

41
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,346
I'm actually very shy.
I've never done this with anybody before.

42
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,515
-That's crazy.
-Right?

43
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,185
I'm telling you because I thought
I should tell you how I feel.

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,479
I want to get to know you better
by going on dates.

45
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,940
-I'd love that.
-Now that you know how I feel,

46
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,235
-I hope we can talk more often.
-Sounds good.

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,320
I seriously had no idea.

48
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,323
Really? We've never had
a serious conversation before.

49
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
-We never had a chance to.
-So you had no idea.

50
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,745
-I want to go on the dream date with you.
-Okay.

51
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,372
If I ask you, will you say yes?

52
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,833
-Of course.
-Then I'll…

53
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,590
-This is funny.
-I'll walk fast.

54
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,384
I'll move super fast and write my name.

55
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,343
Sure. Okay.

56
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,387
-Let's go on a date.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,763
Think about what you want to do.

58
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,099
Let's go on the dream date.
When should we go?

59
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,685
I have a date with Se-yeon tomorrow.

60
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,478
I'm free after that.
The day after tomorrow

61
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,897
-or any days after that.
-Really?

62
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,608
It's a shame
that you have a date tomorrow.

63
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,193
I'm going to

64
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,446
try to get closer to you.

65
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,324
-So give me a chance, okay?
-Sure.

66
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,285
This is crazy.
I never imagined this would happen.

67
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,288
This is interesting.

68
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,708
He finally confessed the feelings
he had for her since school.

69
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,878
-And he did it in broad daylight.
-I know. I didn't see it coming.

70
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,088
-I thought he'd do it while he's drunk.
-It was unexpected.

71
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,882
He confessed his feelings to Ji-woo.

72
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,468
I wonder how Ji-woo received it.

73
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,887
She's just surprised.

74
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,349
She had no idea. She was thankful.
That's all.

75
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,392
She looked more excited
when Se-yeon confessed.

76
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,685
-Right.
-Yeah.

77
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,482
She was happy about it. She was excited.
I mean, we could feel it too.

78
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,858
But now she's just…

79
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,320
-Is it because it's daytime?
-That's what I was thinking.

80
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,530
Is it because there was no alcohol?

81
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,577
Well, it's a pretty long story.

82
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,457
Ye-rin was the one I liked the most.

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,251
But after coming here,

84
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,171
I keep seeing Ji-woo
and Jung-yun together.

85
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,839
It doesn't make me feel so good.

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
It's been bothering me.

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,513
So I thought I should have
an honest conversation about this.

88
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,433
Ye-rin told me not to worry, but…

89
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,604
-Being honest is best.
-Yeah, I told her my honest feelings.

90
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,525
Ji-woo and I talked for a long time, too.

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,653
And we told each other how we feel.

92
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,909
Even though I confessed how I felt,
I still can't organize my thoughts.

93
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,162
-I see.
-I don't know what my heart wants.

94
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,206
-It's hard. It's a lot to handle.
-Yeah.

95
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,010
-Didn't you have ramyeon yesterday too?
-Yes.

96
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,469
You had cup noodles, right?

97
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,057
The two Ye-rin wants are all there.

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,517
Oh, you're right.

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
-You're right.
-Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon.

100
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,937
Do you want a bowl?

101
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,023
-A bowl?
-Yes.

102
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,442
Are you giving me some?

103
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,944
-You… You want this?
-Yes.

104
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,945
Sure.

105
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,990
Thank you.

106
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,911
-I suddenly feel like drinking.
-Me too.

107
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,254
You can go if you're done.

108
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,797
-What?
-Weren't you going to get up?

109
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,966
-No. You want me to?
-Then I'm going to stay.

110
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,468
-What?
-I'm going to stay.

111
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,220
-What? You want me to leave?
-No.

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,226
Does anyone want this?

113
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,562
This is really good.

114
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,980
It's so hot here.

115
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,108
I'm going outside. It's too hot.

116
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,651
-Really?
-It's too hot.

117
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,073
After Se-yeon and I talked, we agreed
to not let this situation burden us.

118
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,493
But we feel more burdensome
than before.

119
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,996
Ever since that day,

120
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,248
I get the feeling

121
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,377
Se-yeon is trying to keep a distance
from me.

122
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,799
I'm a bit disappointed,
and I'm not sure what I should do.

123
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,389
Want to go to the basement?

124
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,141
-Is everyone else downstairs?
-Yes.

125
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,395
-They're all playing a game.
-What game? We should go play too.

126
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,730
Let's go. Are you coming?

127
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,149
-Why not?
-You go first. I'll go after this.

128
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,402
-Got it.
-Let me wash my hands.

129
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,199
Se-yeon, are we still going
on a date tomorrow?

130
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,118
-What?
-Are we going on a date?

131
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,120
Have you decided where you want to go?

132
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,538
Already?

133
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,457
-You said that yesterday too.
-I know. I…

134
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,583
Think about it.

135
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,878
Are we going?

136
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,350
Let's talk about it later.

137
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,780
I guess I should say

138
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,742
that I was flustered and a bit stumped.

139
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,328
If I'm being honest,

140
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,916
when Ye-rin, Ji-woo, and I are together,

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,960
I don't feel comfortable.

142
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,526
Oh, Ji-woo.

143
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
What?

144
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,993
Everything that I see happening right now…

145
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,290
-It's interesting. Very interesting.
-I'm curious about what you think of this.

146
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,083
Yesterday, I…

147
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,295
I heard you talked to Ji-woo.

148
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,258
I plucked up my courage big time.

149
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,885
Yeah.

150
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,722
This is so interesting.

151
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,017
It's like watching a drama.

152
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,520
-What about you?
-What?

153
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,396
-What about you?
-What about me?

154
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,274
What about me?

155
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,110
Don't act like you have nothing…

156
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,987
What about me?

157
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,033
Since I moved to House 20,

158
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:58,704
I've been enjoying talking to Pyeong-seok
more and more.

159
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,042
I'm getting more certain
about my feelings for Pyeong-seok.

160
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,461
It keeps getting more fun.

161
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,049
-I wonder if anything will happen to them.
-Something might happen to Pyeong-seok.

162
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,968
That's what I was thinking too.

163
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,972
-Bowling.
-Oh, bowling…

164
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,016
You want to bowl?

165
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,269
How many points can you score?

166
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,853
About 200.

167
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,814
That's high. You must be very good.

168
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,484
The best score I got was 150.

169
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,903
Wait. I have something
to show Pyeong-seok.

170
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,821
Come here.

171
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,323
-What?
-I have something to show you.

172
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,408
It got in my shoes.

173
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,835
Where should we go?

174
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,629
-Come on.
-What is it?

175
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,758
I have something to show you.

176
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,927
It's so messy in here.

177
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,435
Here.

178
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,145
What is it?

179
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,025
Did you think I had something?
I don't have anything.

180
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,363
-Hey. Oh, I thought you were leaving.
-What?

181
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,574
What?

182
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,745
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

183
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,872
I got nothing.

184
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,750
Let's go.

185
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,628
-For dinner.
-Should we go? For dinner?

186
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,172
But tonight…

187
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,054
-The dream dates will be revealed tonight.
-Yes.

188
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,265
If the dream date is something I want,

189
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,933
I'm going to take you with me.

190
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,729
-What do you think?
-Okay.

191
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,483
Okay? Then if it's something I want,
I'm going to dash out.

192
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,694
-I got your consent.
-Okay.

193
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,154
-Okay?
-Okay.

194
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,406
But if I don't like it,

195
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,410
then we should just go
for dinner tomorrow.

196
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,997
But if it's something you like
and you want to go with someone else,

197
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,877
-just go ask for her consent.
-Okay.

198
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,588
If it's something you like,
write your name.

199
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,091
-Okay?
-Okay.

200
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,635
-That's it.
-Okay.

201
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,595
That was easy, right?

202
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,139
-You're so cool.
-I know.

203
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,558
You too.

204
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,230
I really didn't see it coming.

205
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,068
If it was just a casual date,
I'd go with no pressure.

206
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:38,072
But she wants to go on a dream date too.

207
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,991
I had a lot to think about.

208
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,328
If I use my dream date on Se-yeon,

209
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,416
he's going to use his on someone else.

210
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,794
I don't want to watch that happen.

211
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,006
Besides, I also want to
get to know Pyeong-seok better.

212
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,008
So I asked Pyeong-seok out
on the dream date

213
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,469
because I want to figure
this situation out.

214
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,179
So, in the end,

215
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,558
Ye-rin chose Pyeong-seok, not Se-yeon.

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,768
Instead of using up her own date,

217
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,729
she is letting Se-yeon think
and choose between her and Ji-woo

218
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,357
for his dream date.
She left that up to him.

219
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,528
And she asked Pyeong-seok.
I think that was smart.

220
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,364
There's no guarantee that Se-yeon will
go with Ye-rin.

221
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,532
It's not guaranteed.

222
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,659
But it'd still make him contemplate.

223
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,995
-She cornered herself.
-Right.

224
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,289
She put herself all the way to the line
in the sand.

225
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,376
-She's putting up a fight there.
-What's going to happen to Pyeong-seok?

226
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,503
Would that sway him or not?

227
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,090
It might sway him a bit
because that was his first time.

228
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,342
Yeah. I think it's like

229
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,180
-an intervention of a third party. Right?
-Yeah, it is.

230
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:49,143
This is the first time for Pyeong-seok
to have a third party intervene.

231
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,061
-It might be his first time ever.
-Yes.

232
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,023
It's not that he's swayed by Ye-rin,

233
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,109
but he might be swayed by the situation.

234
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,113
-Do you want to try this?
-Sure, but it looks scary.

235
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,948
-It's scary.
-Who wants to start?

236
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,658
I'm nervous.

237
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,662
"I'm one of the top three
prettiest girls here."

238
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,123
No.

239
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,667
-I'm really not.
-It'd be funny

240
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,711
-if it said you're lying.
-Yes. I'm scared.

241
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,421
I'm really not.

242
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,507
LIE

243
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,054
-That was a good one.
-Come on.

244
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,557
Okay, all right.

245
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,727
Ji-woo. Oh, my gosh.

246
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
It's because I moved in the middle.

247
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,065
Hee-ji.

248
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,944
"If I arm wrestle with Pyeong-seok,
I'd win."

249
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,695
Pyeong-seok is strong.

250
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,531
I wouldn't win.

251
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,616
It's a lie.

252
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,245
LIE

253
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,996
Pyeong-seok!

254
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,041
-I want to see them try.
-Pyeong-seok!

255
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,548
-Liars.
-I have a question.

256
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,968
"The date last night was boring."

257
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:11,934
It was fun.

258
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,978
It was fun.

259
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,229
It was really fun!

260
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,314
TRUTH

261
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,030
No wonder you were nervous.

262
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,575
It wasn't easy.

263
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,953
-The last one.
-Sure. I'll ask.

264
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,914
"I want my next date to be
someone other than Sang-won."

265
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,542
-No, it's not like that.
-Okay.

266
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,170
I don't.

267
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,380
It stings. I don't.

268
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,592
LIE

269
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,052
Why are you surprised?

270
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,472
I thought she saw a ghost.

271
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,640
Wait.

272
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,850
This is not true.

273
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,561
-We'll leave you two alone.
-Wait.

274
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,438
Hey. Wait.

275
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,607
-She doesn't want to be here with me.
-Seo-hyeon.

276
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,650
If you're staying here,
check on the order.

277
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,320
-That's not it.
-Call us when it's here.

278
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,780
This keeps saying everything's a lie.

279
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,366
So you have someone in mind
for your next date.

280
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,951
-Wait.
-I'm out.

281
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,915
I'm a woman.

282
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,335
I'm a woman.

283
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,294
TRUTH

284
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,754
We need to throw this out.

285
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,798
"We need to throw this out."

286
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,760
-That device works well.
-That's very reliable.

287
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,272
Hey, can we go out…

288
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,400
You can. We went out yesterday.

289
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,528
You don't remember
what happened yesterday?

290
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,948
-I remember.
-You don't remember, do you?

291
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,990
I remember.

292
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,785
-I sulked because you didn't respond.
-So you remember.

293
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,829
Is there anybody you want to go on a date
with besides me?

294
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,832
-No.
-What if you include me?

295
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,000
It's a secret.

296
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,258
-What did you talk about yesterday?
-Yesterday?

297
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,511
About how Se-yeon feels.

298
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,305
-I heard it too.
-You did?

299
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,934
We had a beer outside.
You must have been busy then.

300
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,771
I was surprised.

301
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,360
-Why? How did you feel at the time?
-Me?

302
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,946
It is what it is.

303
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,532
That's it?

304
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,326
So is that all you talked about?

305
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,869
-That's all you talked about?
-Yes.

306
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,457
I just kept listening and got surprised.
I had no idea.

307
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,837
Who are you going on your dream date with?

308
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,673
Did you decide who?

309
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,049
-The dream date?
-Yes.

310
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,552
Ji-min asked me.

311
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,929
Ji-min?

312
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,934
Ji-min all of a sudden?

313
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,103
He's surprised again.

314
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,230
Ji-min?

315
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,567
I had no idea that Ji-min would do that.

316
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,735
I was surprised.

317
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,570
I had no idea.

318
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,656
You're busy.

319
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,576
So what if I'm busy?

320
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,537
If you're busy…

321
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,167
I don't know.

322
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,717
Have fun.

323
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,136
Seriously…

324
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,937
You always… You're such a fool.

325
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,939
-Me?
-Yes.

326
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,329
He should've told her not to go.

327
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,166
She wants to hear that he's jealous.
That she should go with him.

328
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,003
But when Jung-yun said that,
he didn't actually mean what he said.

329
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,296
Perhaps he didn't know.

330
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,048
He's heartbroken.

331
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,050
But she definitely likes
Jung-yun the most.

332
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,301
Yes, I can tell.

333
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,844
This is great.

334
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,597
"You're such a fool."

335
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,433
-That's such a great expression.
-"You're such a fool."

336
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,559
"You're such a fool."

337
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,270
-"You're such a fool."
-You have to turn your head and say it.

338
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,189
-"Fool. You have no idea how I feel."
-Yeah.

339
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,899
Let's go.

340
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:35,906
YE-RIN & JI-MIN'S DATE

341
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,074
-What?
-What?

342
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,451
Right. They decided to go to eat.

343
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,911
Oh, right.

344
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,913
Put your seatbelt on.

345
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,087
Bowling is such a difficult sport.

346
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,421
Let's make it look cool.

347
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,216
-Make it look cool.
-Yeah, cool.

348
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,556
-Make me say, "Ye-rin, you look so cool."
-"Did you fall for me?"

349
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,517
"Ye-rin, I fell for you!"

350
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,854
I'll make you fall for me with bowling.

351
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,232
-Bowling.
-It's going to be fun.

352
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,363
What do you like about Ji-woo?
I don't really know about girls,

353
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,865
-For me…
-because I'm also a girl.

354
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,242
Ji-woo has a really innocent look.

355
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,078
-Yes.
-She looks like a cat.

356
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,330
We have good banter.

357
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,373
Yes.

358
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,750
So it's easy to talk to her.

359
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,712
She's charming.

360
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,802
It's important to know
why you like someone.

361
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,097
-Why do you like him?
-I don't know.

362
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,640
Because he's hot?

363
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,979
You think that I'd fall for somebody
because they're hot?

364
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,648
-It's not about looks--
-But he is hot.

365
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,401
-Se-yeon?
-Yes, when someone's good-looking,

366
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,861
you fall for them easily.

367
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,070
You can't help it.

368
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,615
You can't just look at
what's on the inside.

369
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,910
So you don't need to be like that.
Just be honest.

370
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,582
The thing is,

371
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,128
I don't need to feel this way.
There's no need for me to feel bad.

372
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,131
But I feel bad for my number one
to become number two.

373
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,843
I believe I shouldn't feel that way here.

374
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,513
-Right. This place is…
-It's a battlefield.

375
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
-You don't know what will happen.
-Choi.

376
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,894
-Lee.
-Lee.

377
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,729
-Choi… Cross.
-Cross.

378
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,899
One more time in sync.

379
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,442
You say it.

380
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,652
-Lee.
-Choi.

381
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,736
-Cross.
-Cross. Okay.

382
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,491
I'm hungry.

383
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,408
Get some alcohol.

384
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:50,040
BOWLING ALLEY

385
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,084
I haven't been to the bowling alley
for so long.

386
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,295
-Why don't you go first?
-Sure.

387
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,589
-Show me what you've got.
-Want to see?

388
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,507
Yeah.

389
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,137
Good luck. Go for a strike.

390
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,226
Come on.

391
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,562
-I'm terrible.
-You're amazing.

392
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,774
Wait. Let me just…

393
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,115
Oh, no.

394
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,743
Show me what you've got.

395
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,539
Gosh, that was too…

396
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,833
I haven't played in a while.

397
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,584
It's okay.

398
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,795
-I'm surprisingly terrible.
-I might win.

399
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,380
Why am I so terrible?

400
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
No way.

401
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,259
-I might win.
-Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

402
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,427
-Watch me.
-Good luck.

403
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,263
But why…

404
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,976
Hey.

405
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,354
That's what you call talent.

406
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,272
Why are you so good?

407
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,399
Good job.

408
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,985
Show me what you got.

409
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,449
You really showed me.

410
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,284
-Oh, my god.
-I showed you.

411
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,913
-You're so cool.
-It's a strike.

412
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,212
Really? Seriously?

413
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,924
-Awesome.
-I knew it.

414
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,135
That was a mistake.

415
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,762
Nice!

416
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,558
-Bam!
-That was good.

417
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,477
They look okay so far, right?

418
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,854
They look like friends.

419
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,065
Se-woon, you don't look like you agree.

420
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,776
-He crossed his arms.
-What do you think?

421
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,445
I don't think it meant anything really.

422
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,864
-Right?
-Honestly, that's what I think.

423
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,116
-It's their first time bowling together.
-Me, too.

424
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,619
I mean, they're playing a sport right now.

425
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,829
It's hard to to know what they're feeling.

426
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,040
-They need to talk.
-I'm excited for their dinner.

427
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,374
Something might happen.

428
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,669
Nothing is certain.
This is one scary show.

429
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,131
One minute together and things start
to head in a different direction.

430
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,842
Spending time is important.

431
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,389
JUNG-YUN & JI-WOO'S DATE

432
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,269
-What's that look on your face?
-What?

433
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,854
What's that look on your face?

434
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,148
-I'm just thinking.
-About?

435
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,819
-Nothing.
-What?

436
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,487
Tell me.

437
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,948
I'll tell you later.

438
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,204
I want to know.

439
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,916
I have another question.

440
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,584
-What?
-Before I got here,

441
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,713
-Yes.
-was there anyone you were interested in?

442
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
Back then, I didn't have anyone.

443
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,637
I mean, it's not that I didn't
have anyone. They were just… You know.

444
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,888
Just friends?

445
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,598
Yes.

446
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,350
Then am I the first?

447
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,394
-To have feelings?
-What? Yes.

448
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,400
That's crazy.

449
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,694
I thought you weren't interested in me.

450
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,404
-Really?
-You never looked at me.

451
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,822
Because I couldn't.

452
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,991
-Why not?
-What?

453
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,409
How can I stare at you?

454
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,331
At the time, I thought
no one was interested in me.

455
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,291
But now…

456
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
I had no idea.

457
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,844
-Did you know?
-About what?

458
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,305
-That they like me…
-I didn't know.

459
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,682
Yeah, me neither. I didn't know.

460
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,394
-So you found out yesterday?
-Yes.

461
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,023
That's why you just said,
"It is what it is"?

462
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,482
I mean, it is…

463
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,567
But it is what it is.

464
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,152
-It happens.
-Yeah.

465
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,572
It is…

466
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,507
How did you feel when they told you?

467
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,511
At first, I was very surprised.

468
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,849
And I thought it was kind of cool because…

469
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,853
Everyone was already kind of saying

470
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
that you and I are already set.

471
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,526
Se-yeon and Ji-min thought that too.

472
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:34,199
If I were them, I would've given up.

473
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,247
I was impressed by their courage.

474
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,512
-Show some courage.
-This will drive him crazy.

475
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,889
-Jung-yun, win her over.
-Show some courage.

476
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,475
-Hold her hand.
-Oh, you scared me.

477
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,812
-Sorry, I got too invested.
-I thought you said something else.

478
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,023
CANDLE STUDIO

479
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,693
-Hello.
-Hello.

480
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,821
-Do you want to put on an apron?
-Yes.

481
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,079
Can you tie…

482
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,831
-I'll tie it for you.
-Sure.

483
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,210
-Done.
-Done? I'll tie yours.

484
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,470
All done.

485
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,266
-Have you made candles before?
-No, it's my first time.

486
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,892
-Is it your first time?
-Yes.

487
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,270
Here are some fragrances.

488
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,356
-Okay.
-You can open them like this

489
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,442
-and smell them.
-Okay.

490
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,820
You can each pick out a fragrance.

491
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,906
-You can try smelling them.
-I like fragrances.

492
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,702
-Remove the cap.
-The cap.

493
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,412
No wonder I couldn't smell anything.

494
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,001
If it's too strong,
open the small cap on the top.

495
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,046
-Why did you do it like…
-Oh, I didn't know.

496
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,882
What? I like this one.

497
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,967
-Smell this.
-Okay.

498
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,056
What do you think?

499
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,724
-Should I set it aside?
-It's nice.

500
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,517
-Is it nice?
-It's vanilla.

501
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,688
I like this too.

502
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,942
-Let's go with this.
-This?

503
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,027
-Yes.
-Okay.

504
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,447
Nine.

505
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,784
Eleven. It's perfect.

506
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,832
This one looks special.

507
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,126
-I'll use one of those.
-You immediately…

508
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,669
-Do I cut it?
-Yeah.

509
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,879
It's cute.

510
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,631
I like it.

511
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,467
Let's make it similar.

512
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,885
I'll go for the blue one.

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,679
So cute…

514
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,849
-So good.
-Indeed.

515
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,644
-I'll add some of this.
-Okay.

516
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,077
This is it.

517
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,370
Done.

518
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,205
Me too.

519
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,625
This is really cute.

520
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,753
Cheers. Yours looks nice.

521
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,139
I went to the table tennis club
and practiced on my own.

522
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,767
I was feeling very conflicted.

523
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,689
And I had a lot of mixed emotions as well.

524
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,530
When I play table tennis,

525
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,701
I don't think of anything else,
so I wanted to play.

526
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,164
What should we get?

527
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,582
-Sushi?
-Sure.

528
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,834
-Can you tell me now?
-What?

529
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,085
-Can you tell me?
-What?

530
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,045
You said you'd tell me later.

531
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,797
-What's that look on your face?
-What?

532
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,591
What's that look on your face?

533
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,760
-I'm just thinking.
-About?

534
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,721
I'll tell you later.

535
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,810
Well, not yet.

536
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,234
-Your draft beer is here.
-Thank you.

537
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,698
Thank you.

538
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,412
Bon appétit.

539
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,997
-Looks good.
-Soy sauce.

540
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,751
I've never had this before.

541
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,597
-It's good.
-Is it?

542
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
I'm starving. Let's eat.

543
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,727
I'll have some sushi.

544
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,106
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

545
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,409
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

546
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,494
I like it too.

547
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,959
I'm curious.

548
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,752
-What?
-What you were going to say.

549
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,187
Are we going to communicate by breathing?

550
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,699
I just have a lot to think
about right now.

551
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,784
I'm serious.

552
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,372
Q. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?

553
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,833
It's not that I had something to say.

554
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,961
I just wanted to say
we should go on a date again next time.

555
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,632
But I couldn't say it in front of her.

556
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:30,471
Jung-yun never says how he really feels.

557
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,514
It was frustrating.

558
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,810
-It's frustrating. It really is.
-Other boys are being so straightforward.

559
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,937
He must have a lot on his mind.

560
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,400
Where are you going tomorrow?

561
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,569
We're deciding it later.

562
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,155
You're busy.

563
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,531
You keep saying that.

564
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,119
Do you like being busy?

565
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,330
You're not happy?

566
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:56,956
No.

567
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,625
Because…

568
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,044
I was so surprised.

569
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,464
And you feel conflicted
when you're surprised.

570
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,215
-You feel conflicted?
-Yes. I hate it.

571
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,300
So you feel conflicted.

572
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,594
That happens.

573
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,724
You really don't say much.

574
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,684
I can't figure you out.

575
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:23,107
It's rare to meet someone like me. Even if
I don't talk, you can still read me.

576
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:27,528
-I don't know if you don't talk.
-But don't you know even if I don't talk?

577
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,697
-Honestly…
-I need to hear the details.

578
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,533
-People should follow their hearts.
-Is that so?

579
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,535
Like Se-yeon and Ji-min.

580
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,788
They follow their hearts.

581
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,750
I should…

582
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,502
I should learn from them.

583
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,465
Follow my heart…

584
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,554
It's good.

585
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,225
When they told you how they were feeling,
did you have a change of heart?

586
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,686
Nothing changed.

587
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,562
I talked to Ji-min about it.

588
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,272
That you are…

589
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,317
number one in my heart.

590
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,611
That didn't change,

591
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,155
but my perspectives have changed.

592
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,074
Before Se-yeon and Ji-min confessed,

593
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,493
you're all I cared about,

594
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,286
but after Se-yeon confessed,

595
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,247
I started to pay attention to him.

596
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,249
It's the same for Ji-min too.

597
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,251
That's it for now.

598
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,674
Let's order more.

599
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,509
-You want to drink more?
-Are you okay?

600
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,428
-Do you think you can drink one more?
-Yes.

601
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,473
Is there a stronger one?

602
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,310
Didn't you say
you wanted to try a highball?

603
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,062
Hee-ji said it's tasty.

604
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,772
-Sure.
-I trust Hee-ji.

605
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,984
We'll get two Suntory Highballs.

606
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,277
-Two Suntory Highballs?
-Yes.

607
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,611
Okay. Coming right up.

608
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,449
Excuse me. Two Suntory Highballs.

609
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,784
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

610
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,078
Enjoy.

611
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,124
Cheers.

612
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,709
-Cheers.
-Enjoy.

613
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,719
-How do you think your date will go?
-Tomorrow?

614
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,391
I never talked to Se-yeon before
until yesterday.

615
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,393
That was my first time.

616
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,729
I think we're going to talk a lot.

617
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,148
We'll probably eat something.

618
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,277
Don't have too much fun.

619
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,781
-How much fun then?
-Not too much.

620
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,282
-Not too much?
-Yes.

621
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,872
-He finally said it.
-Just a little bit.

622
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,624
But it's not completely satisfactory.

623
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,833
Yet Ji-woo smiled.

624
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,295
Still, that's a big improvement for him.
That's good enough.

625
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,548
You're not going to come back drunk
tomorrow, are you?

626
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,841
What if I do?

627
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,428
You'll be back before 11 p.m., right?

628
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,683
Are you getting jealous?

629
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,775
Do you have a lot on your mind
because you're jealous?

630
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,945
-Come on.
-She asked him straight up.

631
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,363
I dare you to say no.

632
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,657
-Don't just laugh.
-Please say you're jealous.

633
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,616
Just say it.

634
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,868
Do you have a lot on your mind
because you're jealous?

635
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,829
Are you getting anxious?

636
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,499
-Not that much?
-What?

637
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,171
I'm really full.

638
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,881
What?

639
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,638
-He has to tell her.
-He's got to tell her.

640
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,807
Whether it's a date or a friend,
you have to talk.

641
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,482
Are you thinking again?

642
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,902
What if I go out on the day you're home?

643
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,446
That could happen.

644
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,408
Because I'm going out when you're not.

645
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,954
Everyone can go on a date here.

646
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,873
If you want to go on a date

647
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,376
or there's someone
you want to get to know, you can go.

648
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,297
It sounds like I'm giving you permission,
but I don't mind.

649
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,550
-But you need to talk to me about it.
-Okay.

650
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,051
Before or after your date.

651
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,346
If you don't, I'll be mad.

652
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,939
I was very straightforward
just now, right?

653
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,316
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

654
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,696
You frustrating punk.

655
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,698
No, you're not frustrating.

656
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,243
That's just the way you are. I respect it.

657
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,787
But you need to take responsibility

658
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,415
for your frustrating actions. Got it?

659
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,043
It means you shouldn't do that.

660
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,052
-Yes.
-She's scaring him.

661
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,261
"Take responsibility."

662
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,139
"If you keep frustrating me,
I might choose someone else."

663
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,140
"It's up to you."

664
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,143
-Ji-woo is…
-She is just…

665
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,020
She's very patient.

666
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,689
Ji-woo is charming and shrewd.

667
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,485
-I know, that's what makes her charming.
-Jung-yun is like,

668
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,862
"I don't want you to go.
If you go, I'll be jealous."

669
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,740
He wants to say,
"So, I don't want you to go."

670
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,825
-But if he says it,
-It's right up here.

671
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,160
he doesn't know what'll happen.

672
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,120
He's not sure how she'll receive it.

673
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,831
He keeps beating around the bush
because he's not confident.

674
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,875
-That shows he's still young.
-Right.

675
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,544
-He doesn't want to intervene.
-He lacks experience.

676
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,382
Right. He really doesn't have a lot
of experience, so I think he's scared.

677
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,299
This is bad.

678
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,761
It feels like Ji-woo
is helping Jung-yun grow.

679
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,098
I might be getting ahead of myself,
they might not work out,

680
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,768
but things like this pile up
and bring some kind of change.

681
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,189
-When will Se-yeon be back?
-After training.

682
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,607
Maybe around 7 or 8 p.m.

683
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,150
Do you want to eat?

684
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,028
Are we ordering in or cooking?

685
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,947
I'll be the chef today.

686
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,658
You can rest.

687
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,536
-Okay.
-Sit down. Grab your seat.

688
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,830
I'll be the chef today.

689
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,958
What's for dinner tonight, chef?

690
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,378
-I can't tie the apron.
-Let me help you.

691
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,633
She was far away.

692
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,927
-She ran to him.
-She ran to him right away.

693
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,514
Yes, yes.

694
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,099
Okay.

695
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,185
All right. It's perfect.

696
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,250
Ramyeon is also a proper dish, okay?

697
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,002
I don't think ramyeon is a proper dish.

698
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,546
-But bibimmyeon is.
-Bibimmyeon is.

699
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:04,050
-Bibimmyeon is beyond that. You feel me?
-Yes.

700
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,395
Do we get to try your
thinly sliced pork belly?

701
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,980
-Don't be surprised.
-Chef Kim.

702
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,077
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my goodness.

703
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,620
They're so happy.

704
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,455
It's peaceful over here.

705
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,874
-I hope nothing more happens.
-It's therapeutic.

706
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,210
Let's have wine.

707
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,669
-Oh, sure.
-Fruity?

708
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,629
Sure.

709
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,214
We're ready to place an order.

710
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,632
I'll take your order.

711
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,557
Do you have any questions for me?

712
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,103
-You and Ji-woo.
-Ji-woo?

713
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,439
I can kind of tell that
you are interested in her.

714
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,067
I can see that.

715
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,319
Right. I don't care anymore.

716
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,114
You don't care if everyone knows?

717
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,577
Well, nothing is set in stone.

718
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,289
-True.
-I don't know yet. My heart can change.

719
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,126
I might start liking you more.

720
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,252
Me more?

721
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,296
-You want to try?
-It's possible.

722
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,509
What on earth is he saying
all of a sudden?

723
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,802
Keep going.

724
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,804
-Ji-min is…
-Su-hyun, you were right.

725
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,931
-Things can change in just one minute.
-I told you.

726
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,725
Hold on.

727
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,687
This is refreshing.

728
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,940
It feels refreshing to hear you say
something like that.

729
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,108
Really?

730
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,655
You had a talk with Pyeong-seok earlier.

731
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,282
I was curious what you talked about.

732
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,826
-With Pyeong-seok?
-Yes, tell me.

733
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,538
Pyeong-seok's a new student.

734
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,457
When he first arrived,

735
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,417
I didn't have any feelings
for him whatsoever.

736
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,127
I was like, "New student. Cool."

737
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,672
But after moving to House 20,

738
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,926
I wanted to get to know him more.

739
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,514
So I decided to approach him first
and asked what he's doing tomorrow.

740
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,391
And that we should have dinner together.

741
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,352
-So are you going on a date?
-Yes, just a date.

742
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,521
Awesome.

743
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,023
Bam.

744
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,609
When I first saw you,

745
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,738
I thought you'd be the last person
I got close with.

746
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:36,285
Or that we wouldn't become friends
until we graduate.

747
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,745
How come?

748
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,330
You seemed a bit cold.

749
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,750
I thought that way
because you seemed cold.

750
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,503
Of course I think you're pretty.

751
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,506
-And--
-It's too late now, Ji-min.

752
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,840
No, it's not too late.

753
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,717
Pretty, but with a cold vibe.

754
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,928
That's what I thought.

755
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,388
But after we became close,

756
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:01,101
out of all the people here,

757
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,146
I have the most fun when I'm with you.
I'm being honest.

758
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,441
-Me too.
-After we became close,

759
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,361
I realized you're very funny.
You have good reactions.

760
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,695
And you're kind.

761
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,782
Thanks.

762
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,912
Even at this very moment,
I think it's kind of crazy.

763
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,290
On our first day, I probably had no idea
we'd become so close.

764
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,752
That's what I thought too.

765
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,587
I never thought

766
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,882
we'd become close,
but on the second or third day,

767
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,969
I realized our sense of humor is similar.

768
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,096
Then I knew we could be friends.

769
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,057
I thought I should get close to you.

770
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,560
When we first met,

771
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,564
I opened the door,
and you were the first person I saw.

772
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,649
It was you.

773
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
For me, your eyes were super fierce.

774
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:56,240
So when I first entered the classroom,
your face was all I saw.

775
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,619
-"Oh, he's handsome."
-Really?

776
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,332
FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL 19

777
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,292
Oh, my goodness.

778
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,128
-Hi.
-Hello.

779
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,170
Hello.

780
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,756
Hello.

781
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,093
When I first opened the door
and walked in,

782
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:21,557
the first boy I saw was Lee Ji-min.

783
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,768
"Oh, he's handsome."

784
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,647
I want to get to know Ye-rin.

785
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:33,152
When I first saw her, she seemed cold.

786
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,696
I wonder what she'd be like
when we become friends.

787
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,867
It was like, "I want to get to know him."
"We have the same sense of humor."

788
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,909
And now, it's like,

789
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,870
"This is awesome."

790
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,081
We're best friends. Right?

791
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,588
-They're not friends.
-They're not.

792
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,174
-Because there is
-There's something.

793
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,926
a slight sense of push and pull
between them.

794
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,053
It's very subtle, though.

795
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,972
They say they're friends,

796
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,600
-but they're definitely not friends.
-Right.

797
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,644
-That's why I'm excited.
-They're not friends.

798
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,772
-I'll pour you a glass.
-Okay.

799
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,399
Oh, look at this.

800
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,944
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

801
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,154
Thank you.

802
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,783
-The vibe is so nice. Right?
-Yes.

803
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,078
-I really like cozy places.
-The vibe is nice.

804
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,497
-Yeah.
-They have this too.

805
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,166
-What about me? I'm here too.
-Yes.

806
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,709
You make it the best.

807
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,757
What?

808
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,217
What was that?

809
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,470
What's it like to be on a date with me?

810
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,555
The best decision you've ever made, right?

811
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,723
Of course.

812
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,268
-No regrets.
-Me too.

813
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,480
At first, I was planning on spending time
with you as friends,

814
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,190
but this is even better.

815
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,900
-Really?
-Yes.

816
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,540
Why is he so shy?

817
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,749
Oh, my.

818
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,502
I told you. You can never be certain
about anything here.

819
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,464
You're my first date
after I became an adult.

820
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,675
So you're my first date.

821
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,598
-Here's your order.
-Thank you.

822
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,016
This is seasoned brisket.

823
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,185
-You can enjoy it with salad.
-Looks good.

824
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,355
-The cold pasta tastes better mixed.
-Okay.

825
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,314
Enjoy.

826
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,858
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

827
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,984
-Brisket.
-Yes.

828
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,319
-Let me tie my hair first.
-Wine, nice.

829
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,071
Wine.

830
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,410
I need to tie my hair before eating.

831
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,968
Does it look okay?

832
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,052
No?

833
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,476
Take your time.

834
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:12,978
Good?

835
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
Does it look good?

836
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,857
-You look pretty.
-It is? Let's eat.

837
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,651
He fell for her.
He fell for her right there.

838
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,571
-He can't take his eyes off her.
-He totally fell for her.

839
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,781
I don't know what's going to
happen between them.

840
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,285
-Done. Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

841
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,375
-Cheers.
-How do I drink with this glass?

842
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,170
I don't know.

843
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,313
This is the least bitter among
all the ones I've tried.

844
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,565
-Yes. It's sweet and tasty.
-Let's enjoy.

845
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,084
-It's so good.
-Yes.

846
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,394
Do you not like it?

847
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,440
Help me, brisket.

848
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,318
Help her.

849
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,862
Being an adult is hard.
Drinking is hard.

850
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,407
-I like it.
-Really?

851
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,830
Hey, excuse me.

852
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,456
Are you drunk?

853
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,499
-No.
-The cap.

854
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,002
I'm not drunk. I didn't know.

855
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,795
It was closed.

856
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,590
How can I be so dumb?

857
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,690
-What if…
-Yes.

858
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,487
-I go on a dream date…
-Yes.

859
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,365
-Say that I ask you out on that date.
-Okay.

860
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:33,702
Would that feel different

861
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,330
from when I asked you yesterday?

862
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,624
It's completely different.

863
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,750
Really?

864
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:45,339
Honestly, as I spend time with you,
I feel different about you.

865
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,175
Yesterday, we just wanted to go
to the amusement park.

866
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,968
But we were both feeling uncertain.

867
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,347
So, when you sent me a sign,

868
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,724
I was grateful.

869
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,143
It meant you'd use your dream date on me.

870
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,145
Right.

871
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,149
If you ask me now, I'll be delighted.

872
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,361
But no pressure. I wouldn't mind
even if you go with Ji-woo.

873
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,452
When do you plan to go on your dream date?

874
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,414
I haven't thought about it.

875
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,712
If there's something I want to do,
I'd do anything to do it.

876
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,800
It's completely up to you,

877
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:34,513
but just so you know,
I'm willing to go if you ask me.

878
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,520
But if I ask you, we can never go again.

879
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,316
-Right.
-Then you get an option to go with Ji-woo.

880
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,694
I won't let that happen.

881
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,279
You're jealous.

882
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,367
-I like it.
-You can get kind of jealous, right?

883
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,703
Super jealous.

884
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,880
I think I like you more now.

885
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,091
Me?

886
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,970
Yes.

887
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,975
Are you starting to like me more
right now?

888
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,893
Yeah.

889
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,688
I am. What about you?

890
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,024
Nice.

891
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,778
The more I think that we get along,
we do get along well.

892
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,242
It's perfect. We have fun when it's fun,
and we're serious when we have to be.

893
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,289
I'm suddenly worried about Ji-woo.

894
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,042
You are

895
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,004
-starting to like me more, right?
-Yes.

896
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,091
I wish you like me more than Se-yeon.

897
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,844
I wish I can beat him.

898
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,637
You could.

899
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,018
-I think he will have a change of heart.
-Yeah.

900
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,227
Because he's getting tired.

901
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,896
-Now he feels stable.
-Right.

902
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,939
He felt the joy that comes from stability.

903
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,483
This is fun.

904
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,818
I was curious.

905
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:17,949
I wanted to know whether this feeling
I have for you is friendship or love.

906
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,911
I was kind of surprised.

907
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,038
You looked pretty
when you were tying your hair.

908
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,794
Can I untie my hair and tie it again?

909
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,772
-Did you finish it?
-Do you want to finish it now?

910
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,899
-Yes.
-Do you want to share what's left?

911
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,655
It's full.

912
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,370
Oh, no.

913
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,122
-This is bad.
-We'll go back to the house so drunk.

914
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,624
I don't mind.

915
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,556
I can't see clearly.

916
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,724
Try your best.

917
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,853
It feels good getting tipsy.

918
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,021
Give me your glass.

919
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,358
It's barley tea.
I can't see clearly either.

920
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,236
Your aim is way off right now.

921
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,446
That's good.

922
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,790
Okay, I feel a bit more sober now.

923
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,712
The others will be surprised to see
how drunk we are.

924
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,548
-Let's go.
-Let's go home.

925
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,757
Yes, let's go.

926
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,511
It's going the way we want.

927
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,472
-I was totally immersed.
-That was so entertaining.

928
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:08,476
I think there's going to be a big change
in Ji-min's heart.

929
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,397
Today, they were like,
"Let's grab dinner, buddy."

930
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,816
-But after she tied her hair…
-That was no joke.

931
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,484
Do guys really like that stuff?

932
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,528
-We go crazy for it. Seriously.
-Really?

933
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,990
-Is that true?
-I don't know.

934
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,659
But if they're already attracted
to each other,

935
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,036
-it feels…
-You go crazy?

936
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,957
Personally, if a girl ties her hair
in front of me, I can't help but stare.

937
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,667
-You go crazy?
-Like Ji-min?

938
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,836
-Not that serious.
-Ji-min was…

939
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,797
Like Su-hyun said,
it only takes a split second.

940
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,507
So much can change in a split second.

941
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,676
Ji-min is honest, and Ye-rin is too.

942
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,470
-They're just…
-They were perfect.

943
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,890
-They were honest with each other.
-Right. I like this couple.

944
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,017
-I enjoyed watching them.
-Right.

945
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,436
Be careful.

946
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,522
-What's going on?
-What?

947
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,777
-Why are you back so early?
-What? I think we were out for 3 hours.

948
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,362
Someone's here.

949
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,072
Who?

950
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,406
Is it Ji-min and Ye-rin?

951
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,200
Why did they…

952
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,828
-Did you drink?
-A lot.

953
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,498
You drank a lot.

954
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,959
-What?
-What's wrong?

955
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,293
Is Ye-rin drunk?

956
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,545
Hee-ji, you should go help her.

957
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,549
Are you okay?

958
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,717
Ye-rin.

959
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,887
-He can barely stand.
-We drank a whole bottle.

960
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,056
-What's up with you?
-I don't smell alcohol on him.

961
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,349
I can sober up.

962
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,475
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

963
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,143
Where to?

964
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,353
Ji-min, let's go.

965
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,563
-I'll be upstairs.
-Okay.

966
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,525
Get changed. Wash up with cold water
and rest on your bed.

967
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,484
Okay, okay.

968
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,112
How much did you drink?

969
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,700
EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IS HARMFUL

970
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,951
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT DRINKING TOO MUCH,
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR DREAM DATE

971
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,328
-Come here.
-That's right.

972
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,666
-I agree.
-I agree. Count me in.

973
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,085
Who wrote…

974
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,505
-It just popped up.
-It just popped up.

975
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,757
It says right there.

976
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,884
You'll lose your dream date
if you drink too much.

977
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,222
Does two people sharing one bottle
count as excessive drinking?

978
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,475
-It means don't get drunk.
-Know your limit.

979
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,893
So stop before you get drunk?

980
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,697
You need to be in bed.

981
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,286
-Ye-rin, just eat this.
-That looks good.

982
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,662
-Eat just this.
-Okay.

983
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,206
Don't put any alcohol near her.

984
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,211
Thank you.

985
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:46,509
You should eat to sober up fast.

986
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,138
You've got to stay alert
when you're not home.

987
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,433
I only had one glass and a half.

988
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,436
That might be too much for you.

989
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,646
-It all depends on the person.
-He's right.

990
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,650
You want more? You seem to like it.

991
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,780
Eat mine. You can finish it.

992
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,371
-Drink only half a glass of wine, okay?
-Okay.

993
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,373
Not full, but only half.

994
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,833
Yes.

995
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,506
-Do you want to take a shower?
-Yes.

996
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,344
I going to take a shower.

997
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,013
-Don't sleep in the shower.
-Okay.

998
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,556
Let's go.

999
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,017
SANG-WON & SEO-HYEON'S DREAM DATE

1000
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,311
-It's going to be so much fun.
-I know.

1001
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,562
Lotte World Adventure?

1002
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,773
-They're finally going.
-I'm so jealous.

1003
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,983
-It'll be so pretty at night.
-Yeah.

1004
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,027
And it's just the two of them.

1005
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,949
No way. I can't believe this.

1006
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,202
-I signed up as soon as I saw it.
-I know.

1007
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,746
Oh, your dream date
will be with somebody else.

1008
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,498
Hey.

1009
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,750
-What…
-Let's talk in the car.

1010
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,756
-Hello.
-Hello.

1011
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,094
-I'm so excited.
-Me too.

1012
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,512
-Are you excited?
-Totally.

1013
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,764
-I'm glad.
-This is going to be fun.

1014
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,058
How do I look today?

1015
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,728
You're wearing black, white, and denim.

1016
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,023
-Like it?
-Your fashion. I do.

1017
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,778
-What about me? Not my fashion.
-Of course I like you.

1018
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,614
This is intense.

1019
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,908
-What?
-Is that how you…

1020
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,452
Okay.

1021
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,037
-I should stay on my toes.
-Why?

1022
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,457
I should stay on my toes.

1023
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,042
-Is there something you want to do there?
-Me?

1024
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:48,131
I want to take a picture there.
That place where everyone takes a picture.

1025
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,842
-The carousel or the castle?
-The castle.

1026
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,386
-There was always a long line.
-It's very long.

1027
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,805
I never got to take a picture there.

1028
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,390
Just two of us there?

1029
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,231
-Need any help?
-I'm good.

1030
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,234
Can you just clean the table?

1031
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,321
What? You want to take over?

1032
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,990
I'll do it.

1033
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,951
Wash your hands and go.

1034
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,664
-I'm really going to hit the shower.
-Go shower.

1035
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,876
Chef Kim.

1036
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,213
Chef Kim, are you tired?

1037
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,883
-You look tired.
-A little.

1038
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,468
Your ears are still red.

1039
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,471
Why are my ears so red?

1040
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,306
Why are your ears always red?

1041
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,725
I wonder why.

1042
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,066
That was really good today.
I didn't eat much, but I'm full.

1043
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,901
Right.

1044
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,695
You were good at cooking.

1045
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,698
Do you cook often?

1046
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,493
-Sometimes.
-Sometimes?

1047
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,662
Sometimes.

1048
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,249
I like trying recipes.

1049
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,627
It doesn't really roll up.

1050
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,671
You're so muscular.

1051
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,679
-Pyeong-seok is…
-Oh, Pyeong-seok.

1052
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,722
Pyeong-seok.

1053
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,560
-That's nothing special…
-But that makes your heart flutter.

1054
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,900
Thank you.

1055
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,860
It won't go up easily.

1056
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,614
Thank you.

1057
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,994
It's getting clean.

1058
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,290
Final check.

1059
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,962
-They look great together.
-Why do they look like newlyweds?

1060
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,881
-They're driving me crazy.
-Tell me about it.

1061
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:54,966
They're so cute.

1062
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,330
Hello. I am…

1063
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,666
-I'm…
-We're on our way to go bowling.

1064
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,710
We're going bowling.

1065
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,420
Doesn't it sound fun?

1066
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,099
He's going through the pictures.

1067
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,479
That's cute. He's looking at the pictures
from the date before going to bed.

1068
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,605
He is…

1069
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,315
He's so innocent.

1070
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,322
How was it?

1071
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,950
-Is this everyone?
-What are you doing?

1072
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,161
Let me get changed first.

1073
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,209
-You're finally up.
-Are you going to take a shower?

1074
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,878
-Did you sleep?
-Me? No, I was awake the whole time.

1075
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,172
-And that was changed!
-Did you drink?

1076
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,840
-It changed.
-What changed?

1077
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,385
Come here. Did you see the warning?

1078
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,220
I think it changed 'cause of us.

1079
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,681
It says we'll lose our dream date
if we drink too much.

1080
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,641
I think we caused that.

1081
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,851
Don't drink too much.

1082
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,853
I couldn't even walk straight.

1083
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,524
-Do you even remember?
-What? Remember what?

1084
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,277
-Yeah, I remember.
-You sure you didn't forget everything?

1085
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,739
-I didn't.
-Your brain is reset.

1086
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,910
Is my heart supposed to pound this fast
when I'm drunk? You know?

1087
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,620
I had to touch my chest. I didn't know.

1088
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,247
-Pounding.
-I could hear it.

1089
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,332
It was like this.

1090
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,502
When I got undressed to take a shower,
my whole body was red.

1091
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,003
I was so surprised.

1092
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,297
-I went through the photos.
-Yeah.

1093
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,341
I found this photo.

1094
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,510
Did I send you all the photos?

1095
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,720
-I sent you this.
-No.

1096
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,222
-This one.
-That's all you sent me.

1097
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,517
-How come you look good in that picture?
-This one?

1098
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,978
It's like the goldfish meme.

1099
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:16,983
I should stop eating.

1100
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,153
I'll be chubby when I leave this place.

1101
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,571
Chubby.

1102
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,240
-It's dangerous.
-Chubby.

1103
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,411
That's just adorable.

1104
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,294
You want to go upstairs?

1105
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,546
Upstairs? Anywhere is fine.

1106
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,431
-She's watching.
-She's watching them leave.

1107
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,975
-It's obvious that Ye-rin still…
-She still cares.

1108
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,311
-She seems to care more about Se-yeon.
-Yeah.

1109
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,815
It's hard to describe how I feel today.

1110
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,862
What is this feeling?

1111
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,575
I've never had this feeling before
my whole life.

1112
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,952
Nineteen years. Twenty now.

1113
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,373
I don't know what my heart wants.

1114
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,543
I feel like I'm on edge.

1115
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,796
That must be complicated.

1116
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,547
-It's really is.
-Yeah.

1117
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,967
This is actually for the best.

1118
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,971
I'm glad I talked to Ye-rin
about it first.

1119
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:34,435
If I hadn't talked to her
and dragged this out,

1120
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,312
she would've kept having feelings for me…

1121
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:39,106
I can tell that something's different
with the two of them.

1122
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,193
-But why do I feel
-Yeah.

1123
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,612
so confused and conflicted?

1124
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,116
I'm still feeling this way
even after telling her how I feel.

1125
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,579
I don't know
if I did the right thing yesterday.

1126
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,749
Gosh, I don't know.

1127
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,258
When you and Hee-ji were talking,

1128
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,510
I talked to Ye-rin upstairs.

1129
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,928
-Really?
-Yeah.

1130
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,516
She asked me to go on a date
with her tomorrow.

1131
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,059
-She asked you?
-Yes.

1132
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,352
-Ye-rin?
-Yes.

1133
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,020
-Really?
-She said she wants to

1134
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,065
-get to know everyone.
-Really?

1135
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:29,699
And I thought she meant a regular date.

1136
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,367
-Did she mean a dream date?
-Yes.

1137
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,743
-Really?
-Yes.

1138
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,997
I didn't see that coming.

1139
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,457
-Really? The dream date?
-Yes.

1140
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,377
I was like, "What's going on?"

1141
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,963
The dream date.

1142
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,887
What are you going to do
about your dream date?

1143
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:55,349
For my dream date,
I really want to think it through.

1144
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,726
Even if I'm not completely sure,

1145
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,353
I want to go with someone
I feel somewhat certain about.

1146
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,440
Because it means a lot.
I only get one chance.

1147
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,318
Right.

1148
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,660
Se-yeon was kind of

1149
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,039
trying to distance himself from Ye-rin

1150
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,583
-until now.
-Yeah, and now he's…

1151
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,712
But now that
she's getting close to Ji-min,

1152
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,922
he feels…

1153
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,008
-He's not happy about it.
-He has mixed feelings.

1154
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,678
Don't you think that Ye-rin still
has feelings for Se-yeon?

1155
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,807
-I want Ye-rin to be loved.
-Right.

1156
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,727
I want her to get over
her feelings for Se-yeon

1157
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,439
-and just be with Ji-min.
-Right.

1158
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,988
Seo-yeong, are you okay?

1159
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:55,076
Who is it? Oh, it's you.
I'm feeling under the weather.

1160
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,912
I guess we can talk.

1161
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,331
How are you?

1162
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,377
How would you rank the guys
that you like right now?

1163
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,629
There's only one at the top.

1164
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,798
-Pyeong-seok?
-Yes.

1165
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,759
I'm curious.

1166
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:17,098
What do you like about Pyeong-seok?

1167
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,977
He's cute.

1168
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,063
I love his smile.

1169
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,149
And he's shy,

1170
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,777
so I become more curious about him.

1171
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,447
-I want to get to know him more.
-Because you don't know about him.

1172
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,534
I want to know what's on his mind.

1173
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,453
I was curious. He was the one
that I was most curious about.

1174
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,706
So he made you curious?

1175
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,250
-I was curious.
-I see.

1176
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:48,087
And how was Pyeong-seok
when you first started to approach him?

1177
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,340
-I kept asking him questions nonstop.
-Yeah.

1178
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,467
He was shy.

1179
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,594
-I guess he still responded well.
-Yeah.

1180
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,890
-I mean, he didn't ignore me or anything.
-I see.

1181
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,350
What about you?

1182
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,896
At first, I liked Ji-min.

1183
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,776
But after talking to him, I realized
he's nothing more than a friend.

1184
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,282
There's someone I want to get to know.

1185
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,117
-Who?
-Sang-won.

1186
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,368
-Sang-won?
-Yes.

1187
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,745
-Sang-won?
-Sang-won?

1188
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,040
I can see why.

1189
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,835
-Sang-won is so nice when he talks.
-Yeah, he is.

1190
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,797
Because he graduated high school
before we did,

1191
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:36,844
he seems more mature than others.

1192
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:43,142
I mean, it's not like we have to
be attracted to somebody here.

1193
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,561
Just focus on having fun.

1194
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,147
Right. I want to get to know
Sang-won more.

1195
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,986
It's time for a deep talk.

1196
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,831
Yeah.

1197
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,211
It's fun to watch.

1198
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,295
Right?

1199
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,213
For you…

1200
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,049
It's giving me a headache.

1201
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,015
I'm off to the restroom.

1202
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,105
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

1203
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,232
I don't know. No plans yet.

1204
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,194
What are you doing tomorrow?

1205
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,738
-I think I'll go on a date.
-Ji-woo?

1206
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,990
Yeah, they are. I heard earlier.

1207
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,540
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Me? I don't know.

1208
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,043
-It's undecided.
-Try going out with other girls.

1209
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,551
I'm actually going crazy right now.

1210
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,344
Are you tired?

1211
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,429
I'm rather confused.

1212
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,603
-What's wrong?
-Things are so complicated.

1213
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,188
-I'm going up.
-Come up here.

1214
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,024
You have something to tell us
about Jung-yun?

1215
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,822
I have a question, Ji-woo.

1216
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,619
Jung-yun and Se-yeon both
made a move on you at the same time.

1217
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,246
-Honestly--
-Do you like him?

1218
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,706
-Se-yeon?
-Yes.

1219
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:33,085
I don't know. I found him charming
when he told me about his feelings.

1220
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,379
I liked it, and I still do.

1221
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,215
But I don't know.

1222
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,342
Even though

1223
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,720
he confessed his true feelings,

1224
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,639
he doesn't look that way at all.

1225
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,142
-Because he doesn't express it.
-Because he doesn't.

1226
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,521
So, I was like,

1227
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,649
"Is what he said true?"

1228
01:09:56,233 --> 01:10:02,281
What confuses me even more
is that despite all that,

1229
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,658
Jung-yun keeps hiding his feelings.

1230
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:09,330
I can see that he's jealous.

1231
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,166
He just keeps sighing.

1232
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,168
But if I ask him,

1233
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,754
he won't answer.

1234
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:21,008
I want to hear how he feels.

1235
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,593
That's normal.

1236
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:27,473
You wonder if he really likes you
or what he's thinking.

1237
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,852
My feelings for Jung-yun is way bigger

1238
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,730
than my feelings for Se-yeon or Ji-min.

1239
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,067
If Jung-yun expresses his heart,
even a little,

1240
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:44,531
I think he'll keep being my number one.

1241
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,076
But if I ask him about his feelings,

1242
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,913
he says he's shy and avoids answering me.

1243
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,917
I heard what Jung-yun said about you.

1244
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,210
What? When?

1245
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,504
Jung-yun said…

1246
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,089
Yes?

1247
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,328
