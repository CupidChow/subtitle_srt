1
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,137
December 24th.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,641
Nineteen-year-olds, who are turning twenty
in a week, are here.

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:22,564
These young dreamers
will get lessons on life…

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,359
in School 19 to expand their worldview.

5
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,905
They'll receive lessons on cooking,
economics, and human relations.

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,992
They'll learn important things to know
before becoming adults

7
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,162
and spend their last week
as teenagers here.

8
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,248
There is only one rule.

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,876
Dating is not allowed.

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,169
NO DATING

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:48,256
When you're told not to do something,
you want to do it even more.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,676
He kind of caught my attention.

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,722
Why is she looking at me?
Does she like me?

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,142
In class, I couldn't stop looking at him.

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,603
I considered him nothing more
than a friend,

16
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,064
but my feelings for him grew
without me realizing.

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,692
-I'll stay alert.
-Okay.

18
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,277
I'll remember this forever.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,573
You always say the scenery is pretty,
but why do you never say that to me?

20
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:18,036
Once we leave this school,
I'll try approaching her.

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,749
And finally, on December 31st,
the day they all become adults,

22
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,377
their surreal time in House 20 will begin.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,964
Awesome!

24
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,716
It's amazing.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,805
As they spend their first week as adults
together, free from all restrictions,

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,099
what growing pains will they experience?

27
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:45,396
It feels different here
than back at school.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,440
Let's go on a date.

29
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,818
There's something I want to say.

30
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,195
Will you go out with me?

31
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,655
One minute left!

32
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,825
The end of 19 and the start of 20.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,034
-Three.
-Two.

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,285
One!

35
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:04,499
This is about youth who'll experience
the best moment of their lives together.

36
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,709
This is Nineteen to Twenty.

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,545
That was like a movie.

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,755
JEONG SE-WOON, LEE SU-HYUN,
KIM JI-EUN, KYUHYUN

39
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,091
-It looks fun, right?
-It gave me chills.

40
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,552
-Those were some of the highlights.
-I bet.

41
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,972
It was short, but it looked like they're
in a teen film. Right?

42
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,932
-Yes.
-They're all good looking.

43
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,892
-They all look great.
-Yes.

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,311
I wonder what will happen.

45
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,941
After watching that,
I feel like I'd go crazy if I were them.

46
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,152
-Why?
-I can just feel it.

47
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,363
Korea is the only country where

48
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:39,659
everyone becomes adults together on
January 1st regardless of your birthday.

49
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,661
-Everyone turns 20.
-Right.

50
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,373
And they all go crazy together.
It's part of our culture.

51
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,378
Like we saw in the preview,
they have a toast with drinks right away.

52
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,754
-Right.
-My heart is pounding.

53
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,676
Young men and women are spending
a once-in-a-lifetime moment together.

54
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,261
It'll be a wonderful memory.

55
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,430
-I bet it'll be unforgettable.
-Yes.

56
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,974
Back then, I dreamed of buying
a lottery ticket.

57
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,310
-Right.
-Only adults can buy them.

58
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,145
-Yes.
-Really? I didn't know.

59
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,939
-I only had one dream.
-What was it?

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,900
Staying at an internet café past 10 p.m.

61
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,443
At the karaoke and internet café.

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,903
-Right. We couldn't.
-Right.

63
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,946
Back in my days,
we could stay past 10 p.m.

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,992
Back in my days, at 10 p.m.,
we were told, "all minors must leave."

65
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,076
-I…
-I wanted to stay.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,329
I went to an all-girls school.

67
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,498
-I was looking forward to university…
-With boys.

68
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,877
-so I could go to school with boys.
-Right.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,921
They must be excited.

70
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,131
I know. It's a great experience.

71
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,382
I'm jealous.

72
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,432
D-7
UNTIL 20

73
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,856
SCHOOL 19

74
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,407
He must be so excited.

75
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,866
Yeah, he must be.

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,368
It's making me nervous.

77
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,687
SCHEDULE

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,813

TO DO LIST
SELF-INTRODUCTION, CHOOSE CLUB ACTIVITY

83
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,659
MOON SE-YEON

84
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,704
Hello. I'm Moon Se-yeon. I'm 19 years old.

85
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,874
When I'm with strangers,

86
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:37,795
I'm very shy and timid at first.

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:44,177
But when I'm with my friends,
I'm known as the funny guy.

88
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:49,515
When I turn 20, the biggest change
will be my mindset

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,812
because as an adult, I'll need to take
full responsibility for my actions.

90
00:05:54,896 --> 00:06:00,026
I'll be spending my last days
as a teen with new friends.

91
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:04,155
I want us all to have a good time.

92
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,142
Hello. I'm Lim Jung-yun. I'm 19 years old.

93
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:39,816
I'm talkative with people I'm close to,
but when I'm with strangers,

94
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,402
it can be a bit awkward.

95
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,989
In middle school,
I was on the school's sports team.

96
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,826
In high school,
I went to an all-boys school.

97
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,994
I barely had a chance
to hang out with girls.

98
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,081
I only have male friends.

99
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,667
I don't have any female friends at all.

100
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,001
He went to an all-boys school.

101
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,294
-Oh, my.
-Oh, dear.

102
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,088
He might freeze when he sees them.

103
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,422
I know.

104
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
-Still, they're the same age.
-Yeah.

105
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,304
Hello.

106
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,515
Hello.

107
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,730
I was told we can sit anywhere we want.

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,966
Hello. I'm Jeong Seo-yeong. I'm 19.

109
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,387
When I think about turning 20,

110
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,893
I feel sad and excited at the same time.

111
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,061
I want to get my driver's license.

112
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,354
I want to park like this…

113
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,358
I always dreamed of parking a car myself.

114
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,903
Q. WHAT DO YOU THINK
SCHOOL 19 WILL BE LIKE?

115
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,279
I think it'll be fun.

116
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,657
I'm looking forward to it.

117
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,754
Hello.

118
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,293
It's the first time Jung-yun is
in the same class with a girl.

119
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,878
He's just happy to be there.

120
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,088
-It's exciting.
-Yes.

121
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,423
I can tell that he's excited.

122
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,800
He can't hide it.

123
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,480
Hello. I'm Choi Seo-hyeon.

124
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,066
I'm 19 years old.

125
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,486
I still can't believe it.

126
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,198
That I'm turning 20 overnight.

127
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,951
When I turn 20, my dream is
to have a boyfriend in college

128
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,497
and to play drinking games
with my friends.

129
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,499
Q. ARE YOU POPULAR AMONG FRIENDS?

130
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,836
I never say this myself,

131
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,798
but my friends call me
the beauty queen of Sangmyung High.

132
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,223
I was popular for a little bit
when I started high school.

133
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,728
Boys used to line up in front of my class
to see me.

134
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,360
Hello.

135
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,696
Hello.

136
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,744
Hello.

137
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,001
Jung-yun's just happy.

138
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,502
He's just happy to be there.

139
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,589
-I love the flow.
-I have goosebumps.

140
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,591
Hello.

141
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,203
Hello. I'm Oh Sang-won.

142
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm 19.

143
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:09,001
People often say that my personality
is like a Golden Retriever.

144
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,670
They say that

145
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:15,091
because I like meeting new people and I'm
always cheerful like a Golden Retriever.

146
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,845
The last moments of my teen years
mean a lot to me.

147
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,307
I'm becoming an adult,
and a lot will change.

148
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,853
So I want to wrap up my teens
by having fun

149
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,565
with good people who make me happy.

150
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,153
-Hello.
-Hello.

151
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,988
Hello.

152
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,323
Hello.

153
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,910
Hello.

154
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,994
Hello.

155
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,875
-Can I sit here?
-Yes. You can sit wherever you want.

156
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,889
-Hello.
-Hello.

157
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,269
-Hello.
-Hello.

158
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,405
Hello.

159
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,199
This is so awkward.

160
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
I'm Noh Hee-ji.

161
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,586
I'm 19.

162
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,503
HEE-JI

163
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,257
I'm pretty outgoing and comfortable around
both guys and girls,

164
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,634
so I make friends easily.

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,139
My age will now start with a two
instead of a one.

166
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,517
I've always wanted
to do the countdown with friends

167
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,605
and wait outside of a bar until midnight,

168
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,275
and at midnight, enter the bar
with my ID on my forehead.

169
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,568
That's my dream.

170
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:04,825
After I got into high school,
COVID-19 blew up.

171
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,246
It feels like
I lost my high school experience.

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,294
I'm excited to go to school
with new friends.

173
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,257
-Right. They didn't go to school.
-Right.

174
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,342
-They couldn't.
-No.

175
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,552
They also had to wear masks.

176
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,347
I heard some students
don't know their friends' faces.

177
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,390
-Really?
-Right. That makes sense.

178
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,437
-Hello.
-Hello.

179
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,150
-Hello.
-Hello.

180
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,487
-Hello.
-Hello.

181
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,617
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,543
Why's everyone being so formal?

183
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,961
Tell me about it.

184
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:11,392
Hello. My name is Lee Ji-min. I'm 19.

185
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:16,313
I'm pretty popular with girls.

186
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:21,860
I received more Pepero
than my other friends on Pepero Day.

187
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,196
-He's cute.
-He's honest.

188
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,199
-That's important.
-It does show his popularity.

189
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,203
You keep searching under your desk
on Pepero Day.

190
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
-To see if you got any.
-Really?

191
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,874
You check after every period.

192
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
That's sad.

193
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,628
When I turn 20,
I'll go to college and live alone.

194
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm worried about living away
from my parents,

195
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,926
but I'm also looking forward
to living alone for the first time.

196
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,205
Hello. I'm Choi Ye-rin. I'm 19.

197
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,920
My friends often say I'm very chill.

198
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,632
They say I'm more reliable
than their boyfriends.

199
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,971
When I become an adult,
I want to fall deeply in love

200
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,141
because I've never been
in a serious relationship before.

201
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,770
One time, I dated for two days.
The other time, for a week.

202
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,980
My longest relationship was 47 days.

203
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,649
It was so short.

204
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,321
My heart never fluttered for a guy before.

205
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,073
Q. NEVER?

206
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,452
No, maybe that's why I've never been
in a serious relationship.

207
00:15:53,535 --> 00:16:00,125
In Crash Landing on You, when Son Ye-jin
shouts "Ri Jeong-hyeok" while crying

208
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,881
and runs to him, I thought,
"I want to be in love like that."

209
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,222
-Someone's here.
-Are you getting nervous?

210
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,100
-Hi.
-Hello.

211
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,434
Hello.

212
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,645
Hello.

213
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,817
Hello.

214
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,114
I thought she was
going to introduce herself.

215
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,327
Hi.

216
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
-I'm nervous.
-Me too.

217
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,174
-Is everyone here?
-I think so.

218
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,509
-Everyone's here.
-Yes.

219
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,720
Are you nervous?

220
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,232
SE-YEON

221
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,401
JUNG-YUN

222
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,570
SEO-YEONG

223
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,739
SEO-HYEON

224
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,907
SANG-WON

225
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,118
HEE-JI

226
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,328
JI-MIN

227
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,497
YE-RIN

228
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,219
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

229
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:46,440
Spending Christmas Eve, Christmas and
New Years here together will be special.

230
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,649
They'll be special.

231
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,068
Very special.

232
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,118
Hello.

233
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,703
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,413
No need to stand. Don't stand.

235
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,125
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

236
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,043
Hello.

237
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,588
My name is Kim Jung-hyuk.

238
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,215
I'm a novelist.

239
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,593
Do you know what novelists do?

240
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,512
They write novels.

241
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,057
Write novels? Very accurate.

242
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,394
As you know, this is School 19.

243
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,148
We teach young dreamers

244
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,402
what they must know
when they become adults.

245
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,864
Welcome to School 19.

246
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,580
Now, you're going to come here
and introduce yourselves.

247
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:49,878
You can tell us your names,
your dreams and what you like and dislike.

248
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,297
Should we go in order this way?

249
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,674
-Me first?
-Yes.

250
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,801
You look the most energetic.

251
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,727
I'll drop the formalities
since we're the same age.

252
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,356
Hi. My name is Noh Hee-ji.

253
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,650
I like to exercise.

254
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,361
And I hate studying.

255
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,157
But I like studying
for subjects that I like.

256
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,160
I want to become a Pilates instructor.

257
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,998
My mother is a Pilates instructor.

258
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,334
And I think what she does
is really amazing.

259
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,796
I also love teaching people.

260
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,257
That's another reason why
I want to become an instructor.

261
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,261
I really like to exercise,

262
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,515
so my hobbies are cycling,
lifting, and running.

263
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,185
Nice to meet you.

264
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,743
Hi. I am Moon Se-yeon. I'm 19.

265
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,913
I play sports.

266
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm an athlete.

267
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,334
I play table tennis.

268
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,048
I started in Grade 2
and I've been playing for about ten years.

269
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,344
In 2022, my team won
the national high school competition.

270
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,639
I also played as
a member of the youth national team.

271
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:29,228
Starting from 2023, I'll play for
the Jecheon City Hall table tennis team.

272
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,358
My short-term goal is
winning in the pro league next year.

273
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,862
As for my long-term goal, I want to go
abroad, experience what's out there,

274
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,364
and broaden my horizons.

275
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,119
There are a lot of things
I like and dislike.

276
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:51,124
I hope to talk to you all
and get to know you.

277
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,459
Nice to meet you.

278
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,173
Hi.

279
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,009
My name is Oh Sang-won.

280
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,596
I like meeting new people,
so I'm happy to meet you.

281
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,932
There isn't anything
I dislike in particular.

282
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,770
My dream is to work
in the field of robotics.

283
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,191
What's unique about me is that I already
finished my first year of university.

284
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,193
I'll be a sophomore next year.

285
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,487
-Nice to meet you.
-That's so cool.

286
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,117
I'm currently attending POSTECH,

287
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,452
Pohang University of Science
and Technology.

288
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:35,085
In science high schools, you get to
graduate early if you're in the top 40%.

289
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,880
Luckily, I got into university
at the age of 19.

290
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,342
My dream is to become a robotics engineer.

291
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,762
I want to build robots
that can be used daily

292
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,349
to help people's everyday life.

293
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
-That's amazing.
-That's intense.

294
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,938
-So many impressive people here.
-I know.

295
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,569
-Hi.
-Hi.

296
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,324
Hi. I'm Choi Ye-rin.

297
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:11,121
I want to become a flight attendant,
so I want to major in airline service.

298
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,958
My dream is to become a flight attendant.

299
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,754
You get to interact with people who speak
different languages, ride airplanes,

300
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,006
and meet people from various countries.

301
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,675
That's why I want to become
a flight attendant.

302
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:30,682
I plan to learn more about it
by majoring in airline service.

303
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,893
I like Pilates.

304
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,353
-You know what it is, right?
-Yes.

305
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,023
I like Pilates and I don't like…

306
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,400
being on an empty stomach.

307
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,818
I mean, I dislike it a bit.

308
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,029
I just don't like being hungry.

309
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,156
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

310
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,912
Hi.

311
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,872
My name is Lim Jung-yun.

312
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,249
I want to be an actor.

313
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,878
I thought you looked like an actor.

314
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,258
I originally dreamed
of becoming a baseball player.

315
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,428
I played baseball until Grade 10.

316
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
I grew tired of it eventually,

317
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,810
and I realized I couldn't keep going,
so I quit.

318
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,190
I've always wanted to act,
so I decided to give it a go

319
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,526
and started this year.

320
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,779
Since I'm still new to acting,
I'm trying extra hard in my classes.

321
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,449
and I'm open to trying out
all different roles and genres.

322
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,786
I hope to become an actor
who will have a long and stable career.

323
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,165
And I like watching soccer.

324
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,919
There isn't anything I hate in particular.

325
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,672
About soccer…

326
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,424
You only like watching it? Not playing?

327
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,468
I don't like playing soccer that much.

328
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,803
-Watching only?
-Yes.

329
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,929
Next.

330
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
Hi.

331
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,310
My name is Lee Ji-min.

332
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,020
I'm practicing Taekwondo right now.

333
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,355
That's my major.

334
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,650
I want to become a sports instructor.

335
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
I've always enjoyed all kinds
of physical activities

336
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,115
like soccer, taekwondo, baseball and more.

337
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,660
That influenced me
to find my dream in sports.

338
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,708
I want my students to remember me
as a friendly and good teacher.

339
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,168
That's my goal.

340
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,255
What I like is food.

341
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,548
Steak is my favorite.

342
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,676
What I don't like is being selfish.

343
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,387
Thanks.

344
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,016
All right.

345
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,728
-Hi.
-Hi.

346
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,231
I'm Jeong Seo-yeong. I'm 19.

347
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,484
I also want to be an actress.

348
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,281
I want to be an actress.

349
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:59,206
It's very fun and interesting
to learn about a character's life.

350
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,835
I want to become a memorable actress.

351
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:10,091
What I like is my puppy.

352
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,094
And I also don't like being hungry.

353
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,807
We totally clicked. Nice to meet you all.

354
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,228
Okay.

355
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,606
Hi, I'm…

356
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,566
My name is Choi Seo-hyeon.

357
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,195
I like fast food.

358
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,492
I don't like eggplants.
And my dream is to be an architect.

359
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,869
Nice to meet you.

360
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,249
I want to be an architect.

361
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,963
I once visited my dad's studio,
and I saw a beautiful house.

362
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,466
Since then, I've wanted
to become an architect,

363
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,301
so I can build pretty houses.

364
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,680
I love taking pictures.

365
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:03,311
I often work on floor plans
or draw buildings.

366
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:09,901
I want to build comfortable
and pretty spaces where people can rest.

367
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,114
That was an unexpected twist. Cool.

368
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,038
The most memorable person was Seo-hyeon.

369
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,374
She wants to become an architect.

370
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,627
I've never met anyone with that dream.

371
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,630
I hope I'll have a chance
to get to know her.

372
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,760
Hee-ji was memorable because she wants
to become a Pilates instructor.

373
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,095
…a Pilates instructor.

374
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,224
I do Pilates for fun too.

375
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,393
I was glad to meet her.

376
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:50,817
Jung-yun was the most interesting to me
because I like watching soccer too.

377
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,445
And I like watching soccer.

378
00:26:54,863 --> 00:27:00,452
When he said he likes watching soccer,
it piqued my interest.

379
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,705
Se-yeon said he was an athlete.

380
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,333
I want to talk to him more.

381
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,960
Q. ANY OF THE GIRLS MEMORABLE TO YOU?

382
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,421
Why… One second.

383
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,967
They're all pretty.

384
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:24,684
Didn't he just blink six times
in one second?

385
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,810
Yes.

386
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,396
-He's nervous.
-He must be very nervous.

387
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,441
The fact that they all know
what they want to do…

388
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,902
-I know. That's very cool.
-That's amazing.

389
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,945
-I found Se-yeon impressive.
-Me too.

390
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,740
He played as a member of
the youth national team.

391
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,700
We might see him in the future Olympics.

392
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,910
Right.

393
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,746
He looks like he would want
to become a model or an actor.

394
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,997
I agree.

395
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,040
I know. He's so cool.

396
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,666
-For me, Sang-won.
-Right.

397
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,129
Yes, majoring in robotics.
It's amazing that he goes to POSTECH.

398
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,299
It's not easy to get into robotics.

399
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,761
-He'll be a leader in the field.
-Right.

400
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,972
I thought Ye-rin
was full of unexpected twists.

401
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,476
-She wasn't as shy as I thought.
-Right?

402
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,896
She seemed open-minded.

403
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,106
She showed good reactions.

404
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,734
She seemed very cheerful.
I expected her to be calm and quiet.

405
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,778
-Right.
-That was unexpected.

406
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,323
I learned a lot about you all.

407
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,284
First of all, many of you
don't like being hungry.

408
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,329
We'd better feed you well.

409
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,792
School 19 has one rule.

410
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,795
The rule is quite daunting.

411
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
NO DATING

412
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,982
-"No dating"?
-"No dating."

413
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,151
"No dating"?

414
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,321
You are not allowed to date
in this school.

415
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,658
No way.

416
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,536
That will be hard at their age.

417
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:11,916
Since it's the school rule,
please respect and adhere to it.

418
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,837
I was like, "What?"

419
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,423
I thought, "What is this?"

420
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,384
Everyone here is good-looking.

421
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,096
No dating is too much.

422
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,059
When you're told not to do something,
you want to do it even more.

423
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,396
I wondered if that's possible.

424
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,149
I always follow the rules.

425
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,904
-She's…
-I bet she'll be the first to break it.

426
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,405
People who say that always…

427
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,740
Get a boyfriend first.

428
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,867
It's very hard.

429
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,163
When you're told not to do something,
that's all you think about afterwards.

430
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,164
Right.

431
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,835
I'm going to assign your seats.

432
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,545
You'll sit in alphabetical order.

433
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,424
I'll call your names.
In front, it's Ms. Noh Hee-ji.

434
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,468
-It's my seat.
-Next is Mr. Moon Se-yeon.

435
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,469
Here?

436
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,138
The two of you can sit here.

437
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,976
Next is Ms. Jeong Seo-yeong
and Mr. Oh Sang-won.

438
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,478
You can sit there.

439
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,482
Ms. Choi Seo-hyeon and Mr. Lee Ji-min.
You can sit in front.

440
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,527
Next is Ms. Choi Ye-rin
and Mr. Lim Jung-yun.

441
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,695
You can sit here.

442
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:28,243
SEO-YEONG, SANG-WON

443
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,078
HEE-JI, SE-YEON

444
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,913
-Hi.
-The table tennis player.

445
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,709
YE-RIN, JUNG-YUN

446
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,961
Hi.

447
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,550
It's in alphabetical order.

448
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,844
So? Do you like your seatmate?

449
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,470
SEO-HYEON, JI-MIN

450
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,722
-Yes. Hi.
-Hi.

451
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,143
Let's have a short break.

452
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,436
-Okay.
-Okay.

453
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,692
-Aren't you nervous?
-Me? I'm cold.

454
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,695
The heat pack is all cold now.

455
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,364
I probably have one.

456
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,375
This is still warm.

457
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,459
Really?

458
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,545
-Right?
-It's warm.

459
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,922
Keep this one in your pocket.

460
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,935
Are your hands dry?

461
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,103
A little.

462
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,897
Do you want hand cream?

463
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,403
-Do you want some?
-Just a little.

464
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll put it on the back of your hand.

465
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,075
Is this enough?

466
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,035
Yeah, thanks.

467
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,913
I like this scent.

468
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,956
I'm not sure if you'll like it too.

469
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,465
It smells nice.

470
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,549
Yes, it does.

471
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,967
Yeah, right?

472
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,846
Jung-yun is smiling only with his lips.

473
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,432
-He doesn't know what to do.
-He looks so lost.

474
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,269
For the first time in his life,

475
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,730
the girl sitting next to him
gave him hand cream.

476
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,357
-That's so cute.
-That's cute.

477
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,108
-That's cute.
-They're really cute.

478
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,448
-When did you start table tennis?
-In Grade 2.

479
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,242
That's early. I used to play baseball too.

480
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,036
-Baseball?
-I was a baseball player.

481
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,412
I like baseball.

482
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,084
Every time I look at you, I see an actor.

483
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,837
When you went up here
to introduce yourself,

484
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,131
I was going to say
that you look like an actor.

485
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,301
Then you said you want to be one.
I was really surprised.

486
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:59,727
SPECIAL LECTURE
INSTRUCTOR KIM JUNG-HYUK

487
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,729
Hi.

488
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,272
-Hello.
-Hello.

489
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,404
Do you see these graphs drawn here?

490
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:15,284
You will draw out your very own
life graph here.

491
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,704
The four people in the front row,
come up here.

492
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,164
Draw your graph and write your name.

493
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,543
-It goes like this.
-Okay.

494
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:29,549
Sometimes, you should look at your life
from a third-person point of view.

495
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:34,095
If you imagine your life is the line,

496
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,182
you can see the pain
and sorrow from a distance.

497
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,101
And my luck went up.

498
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,571
There's one thing that every school has.

499
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,031
Homework.

500
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,494
You drew graphs of your lives.

501
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,706
Go to the library and pick out
a book you would like to recommend

502
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:08,755
to the person whose graph you liked or
related to. Also, write a letter to them.

503
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,339
That's your homework.

504
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,300
A letter.

505
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,512
Let's have a fun class again next time.

506
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,014
Enjoy your lunch.

507
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,349
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

508
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,936
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Yes. Enjoy your lunch.

509
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,149
-We have homework.
-Yeah, we do.

510
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,735
They'd pick their seatmates.

511
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,695
-Yes.
-It's their first seatmates.

512
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,740
As they take care of each other
and feel closer,

513
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,909
-their feelings will grow.
-Exactly.

514
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,452
It's going to be so much fun.

515
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,795
-Need help?
-Yes.

516
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,215
-Sorry.
-Don't be.

517
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,675
-Here.
-Thanks. What is this?

518
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,013
It's pork cutlet sauce.

519
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,390
Amazing.

520
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,394
Do you like pork cutlets?

521
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,604
-Pork cutlets?
-Yeah.

522
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,855
I wouldn't refuse it.

523
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,858
I love it.

524
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,237
-You love it?
-It's my favorite.

525
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,452
I want to look around.

526
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,497
-Me too.
-It looks like so much fun.

527
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,040
I need to go to the library.

528
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,209
-The library?
-To do my homework.

529
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,046
Who are you going to write to?

530
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,841
Me? I don't know yet.

531
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,592
-Wanna write to each other?
-Sure.

532
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,886
I'll be disappointed if I don't get one.

533
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,513
-Me too.
-Right?

534
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,390
Others could get three or four.

535
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
-I know.
-"Nothing for Ji-min?"

536
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,936
"No one wrote to Ji-min."

537
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,814
-What if that happens?
-That'll be upsetting.

538
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,774
-I'll be disappointed big time.
-Right.

539
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,193
I know my graph is boring.

540
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,904
Mine's boring too.
Mine looks just like yours.

541
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,971
I thought something was missing.

542
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,806
I don't have any kimchi.

543
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,517
Do you want some of this?

544
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes.

545
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,412
I should eat fruits. What am I doing?

546
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,664
I almost closed it.

547
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,168
-Want to go to the snack shop?
-Snack shop?

548
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,253
-Yes.
-Is the snack shop on the other side?

549
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,546
MAIN BUILDING MAP

550
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,714
It is, right?

551
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,009
-It's at the end. Let's go.
-Yeah, that's the opposite side.

552
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,556
Which one's yours? I'll get it for you.

553
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
Mine's on the right. That one.
It's black. Next to your coat.

554
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,896
Hey. It looks so warm.

555
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,606
Do you want to try it on? Try it on.

556
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,149
-Really?
-Yes, try it on.

557
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,698
That is…

558
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,783
He's so cool.

559
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,664
Perfect. It's so warm.

560
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,041
-Does it make you happy?
-It makes me happy.

561
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,129
-My gosh. It's fun already.
-She must look so cute.

562
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,840
-What does that mean?
-Their height difference…

563
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,802
-That doesn't mean anything yet.
-Really? Was it just me?

564
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,471
-It's because they're seatmates.
-You think so?

565
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,099
Maybe they felt comfortable quickly.

566
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,434
-I think Hee-ji's into Se-yeon.
-Me too.

567
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,270
Se-yeon keeps turning his back on her.

568
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,855
When she said she was missing kimchi,
she sounded shy.

569
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,066
It wasn't like her.

570
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,152
-She was too nervous to be herself.
-Yes.

571
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,113
-Makes sense.
-Whatever it is, I like it.

572
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,282
This is fun. I can't wait to watch more.

573
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,658
They're so cute.

574
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,286
Sorry.

575
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,538
So hard to resist.

576
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,750
I hope the snack shop
has lots of good stuff.

577
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,419
I wonder if there's bubble tea.

578
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,255
Bubble tea? Seriously?

579
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,257
-It's here.
-It's the snack shop.

580
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,258
SNACK SHOP

581
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,467
Can I open the door?

582
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,516
Awesome!

583
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't need to bring lunch tomorrow.

584
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,521
-We could eat food from here for a day.
-There are cup noodles.

585
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,149
This is pretty nice.

586
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,609
I want some jelly.

587
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,778
That's what you do in school.

588
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,822
-What?
-Eating in secret.

589
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,658
Something hard to eat like V-corn.

590
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,826
"V-corn"?

591
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,494
I want to eat V-corn.

592
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,662
I'll devour this.

593
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,707
-"Devour"?
-V-corn is really good.

594
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,217
You look like an expert.

595
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,053
I've had it a lot of times before.

596
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,056
-Bye.
-Let's go. Bye.

597
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,976
-Where's the lounge?
-It was next to the snack shop.

598
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,604
Here's the lounge.

599
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,482
Should we look inside?

600
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,110
What?

601
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,236
-What's this?
-What?

602
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,657
LOUNGE

603
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,409
It's nice.

604
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,206
Awesome. It's so nice.

605
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,293
Wait.

606
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,588
Does anyone know how to turn it on?

607
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,131
I don't know. I gave up.

608
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,383
Let me try.

609
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,139
-Hey.
-Are you taking a picture?

610
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,058
No.

611
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,893
That's annoying.

612
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,109
-He took a picture.
-What a waste of film!

613
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,403
Hey!

614
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,363
No. Give it to me. No.

615
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,490
Give it to me.

616
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,159
Let me try.

617
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,787
-Get in.
-Mr. Actor!

618
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,622
Mr. Actor.

619
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,750
-Mr. Actor, get in the picture. Standby.
-Closer.

620
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,128
-Get closer.
-Mr. Actor, smile.

621
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,588
-One, two, three.
-They're F4.

622
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,506
Snap.

623
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,299
Is it F4 because there are four of us?

624
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,593
Is that why?

625
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,679
Right.

626
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,556
-Take a picture of us.
-Sure.

627
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,890
You got this.

628
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,983
You got it this time.

629
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,777
-Perfect.
-Perfect? It'll be a good memory.

630
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,115
OUR FIRST MEETING

631
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,993
-Want to try taking one together?
-Let's all stand.

632
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,371
-Should I take my shoes off?
-Yes, take them off.

633
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,623
Hey.

634
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,837
That's dedication right there. Okay.

635
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,339
Real dedication.

636
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,800
Hang on.

637
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,219
Are we trying it?

638
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,555
-Good luck.
-Yes.

639
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,182
I'm only pressing the shutter.

640
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,353
Where should I go? Your head is…

641
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,063
Come to the center.

642
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,316
One, two, three.

643
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,528
-Did I get everyone this time?
-I think so.

644
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,863
I got a good feeling.

645
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,199
But you might have been cut out.

646
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,243
How does it look? Did it come out okay?

647
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,661
No?

648
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,747
-Guys, we…
-Yes?

649
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,915
It shook.

650
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,333
Sang-won.

651
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,459
Sang-won.

652
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,836
-Do better.
-Sang-won.

653
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,090
-It's a good picture, isn't it?
-Look at this.

654
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,425
I got a good feeling.

655
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,553
-This is the best.
-But Sang-won is…

656
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,641
-It's too…
-It's nice.

657
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,683
OH JEONG LEE LIM MOON CHOI NOH CHOI

658
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,568
-Are you a celebrity, too?
-What?

659
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,654
I was shocked by how pretty you are.

660
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,073
-What are you talking about?
-I'm serious.

661
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,743
Come on, don't say that.

662
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,621
Please don't.

663
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,207
A flight attendant? That's crazy.

664
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,168
"Hello, ladies and gentleman."

665
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,755
-I dreamed of it once.
-Of being a flight attendant?

666
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,049
-Every girl does.
-It's a fantasy.

667
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,051
-It's amazing.
-At least once.

668
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,636
Noh Hee-ji.

669
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,265
Sounds like, "No easy."
That's how you can remember it.

670
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,725
To make it more easy to remember?

671
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,143
-Yes, No Easy.
-I see.

672
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,895
Oh my God.

673
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,022
What's going on?

674
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,774
-Join us.
-Her eyes are so big.

675
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,443
If you see her from the side,
they're just…

676
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,867
I found Ye-rin most surprising.

677
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,997
She was the complete opposite
of what I expected her to be.

678
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,248
-I agree.
-Me too.

679
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,418
-The complete opposite.
-I'm different once I get close to people.

680
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,003
Let's become close.

681
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,629
-Nice to meet you.
-Once we get close…

682
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,923
We'll see.

683
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,883
Everyone looks so kind.

684
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,677
-They all look kind.
-Everyone's kind.

685
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,178
Everyone is.

686
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,015
The one who looks like a bear.
What's his name?

687
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,891
My seatmate.

688
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,560
Sang-won.

689
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,979
-What's he like?
-He's…

690
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,858
He's really kind. He seems gentle.

691
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,193
Right. When we were taking the picture,
he was…

692
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,528
I also noticed.

693
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,116
The face of the person holding it
will look…

694
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,868
-Right.
-They'll look like this.

695
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,162
-You look ugly.
-He even took his shoes off.

696
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,538
He stood on the chair.

697
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,915
-I thought…
-That was impressive.

698
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,418
In the lounge,

699
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:54,632
Sang-won even took his shoes off
to stand on the chair

700
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,425
and take the group picture.

701
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,885
That was very cool.

702
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,889
-It was very cool?
-Was it?

703
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,267
Everyone has a different perspective.

704
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,479
I thought he was just enthusiastic,
but they found him cool.

705
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,523
-He won their favor.
-Yes, from doing his best.

706
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,109
-Ji-min, the one who…
-What about you?

707
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,194
-Se-yeon?
-Yes.

708
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,029
He's the most…

709
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,906
-Handsome?
-Yes.

710
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:23,494
-I agree.
-He looks like he's from a web drama.

711
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,204
Do you agree?

712
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,084
I like guys who have large monolid eyes.

713
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,586
Se-yeon fits my ideal type.

714
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,714
See?

715
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,466
-You were right.
-He's the hottest.

716
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,927
She was shy in front of him.

717
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,178
Right.

718
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,555
What are you like in a relationship?

719
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,599
-Me?
-What are you like when you're dating?

720
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,810
I think it's more fun
only if I really like him.

721
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,230
-Dating is like…
-You set aside time for them.

722
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,816
It's more exciting that way.

723
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,236
If I don't like the guy,
I don't want to do anything.

724
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,321
-I don't even want to hold his hand.
-Right.

725
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,324
If I like someone, I just go for it.

726
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,702
At first, I watch him, and if I like him,

727
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,912
-You go for it?
-I do.

728
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,873
-Right for it, bam.
-That's unexpected.

729
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,041
You're bold.

730
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,171
I never really fell for a guy before,

731
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,299
so I don't know what it's like.

732
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,427
-Really?
-Girls like this always date first.

733
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,470
You never know.

734
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,978
Do you think you'd date someone here?

735
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,906
It's a different story
when it comes to dating.

736
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,286
Some guys are boyfriend material
and some are bestie material.

737
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,955
-I can see that.
-I agree.

738
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,499
Right.

739
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,334
A bestie.

740
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,462
A bestie.

741
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,505
I want a bestie.

742
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,259
I'll focus on studying
while I'm in school.

743
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:08,640
I'm too busy to date anyone.
That can wait until I become an adult.

744
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,645
She's funny.

745
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,024
We'll see what happens, Ye-rin.

746
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,402
-How was it when you first came in?
-It was awkward.

747
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,029
It was only the two of us at first.

748
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,614
-Just you two?
-When I walked in,

749
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,532
I wondered if I should sit next to him.

750
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,659
We sat together,
so I talked to him the most.

751
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,661
And he was like, "It's cold."

752
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,332
So I thought, "He's pretty shy."

753
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,878
I think Hee-ji is the mood setter.

754
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,589
I dropped the formalities
after she said she'd drop them.

755
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,840
If she didn't say that,

756
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,093
we would've been more formal, like,
"Hello. My name is…"

757
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,182
I'll drop the formalities
since we're all same age.

758
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,685
I liked that she did that.

759
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,104
-Saying we should drop it.
-She broke the ice.

760
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,565
Hee-ji and I became close pretty fast.

761
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:00,943
I'm…

762
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,987
Who do you want to get to know the most?

763
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,115
I…

764
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,036
-What's going on?
-Based on the first impression.

765
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,413
It's just the first impression.

766
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,958
-Right.
-Just based on the first impression.

767
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,460
Let me think about it for a second.

768
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,629
-Hurry.
-I choose Seo-yeong.

769
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,673
-Seo-yeong?
-Yes.

770
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:28,136
She has a small face and looks like an
actress. I was surprised when I walked in.

771
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,806
That was partly why
I rushed to take a seat.

772
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,516
Because I was flustered.

773
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,189
Hello.

774
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,900
Hello.

775
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,826
Seo-yeong? I choose Seo-hyeon.

776
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,704
-Seo-hyeon? My seatmate?
-Seo-hyeon.

777
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,542
I want to get to know Seo-hyeon more.

778
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,420
She's seated on the other side.
She's the furthest from me.

779
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,214
Because of that,
I barely had a chance talk to her.

780
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,174
I didn't get to talk to her much.

781
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,430
From now on, I hope I get more chances
to get close to her.

782
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,015
-You say Seo-hyeon?
-Seo-hyeon.

783
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,851
For me, it's Ye-rin.

784
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,146
Ye-rin kept asking weird questions
during her introduction.

785
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,440
-She's a bit goofy.
-She's goofy.

786
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,983
-Is she?
-Yes.

787
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:27,904
I noticed that Ye-rin is a bit goofy.

788
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,575
I thought she was funnier than she looks.

789
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,743
Pilates…

790
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:37,706
I want to talk to her first
and get to know her.

791
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,000
They'd be great together.

792
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,461
A goofy girl and a calm boy.

793
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,131
Did you get your driver's license?

794
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,550
-Oh, right. You haven't?
-No.

795
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,802
-My birthday has to pass.
-That's right.

796
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,013
My birthday just passed.
I didn't have time.

797
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,057
When was your birthday?

798
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,850
-When's your birthday?
-December 10th.

799
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,602
-Really?
-It's December 10th?

800
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,519
It just passed.

801
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,396
I'll ask the girls their birthdays.

802
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,231
-Ask them. They're here.
-Yes.

803
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,525
-Long time no see.
-Good to see you.

804
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,613
-Long time no see.
-Yeah.

805
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,572
It's been so long.

806
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,244
You had the camera?

807
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,289
I brought it. It was in the lounge.

808
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:24,753
Hi.

809
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,763
-The way he looks at her.
-What was that?

810
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,099
-But the rule is no dating, right?
-Right.

811
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,017
-We should…
-We're too invested.

812
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,268
-A fling is okay.
-We…

813
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,938
-A fling is okay.
-That's okay.

814
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:47,609
ECONOMICS
INSTRUCTOR LEE HYUN

815
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,615
-Hi, everyone.
-Hello.

816
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,283
Hello.

817
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,119
-Hello.
-Hello.

818
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,622
I'm going to start. Can you take a seat?

819
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,707
Yes.

820
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,041
My name is…

821
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,963
Lee Hyun. Just one syllable.

822
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,048
I'm actually a reporter.

823
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,093
I usually cover economics.

824
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,637
The title of my lecture today is

825
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,681
"My Money"…

826
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,433
My purchase?

827
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,936
"My Life," not my purchase.

828
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,646
"Life".

829
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,231
That's the title.

830
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:31,862
A hashtag for people who lead their life
with their own economic power

831
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,239
would be, "My Money, My Life."

832
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:40,287
I wanted to talk about how to gain
economic power and lead your own life.

833
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,375
That's how you become a real grown-up,
so that's why I came up with this title.

834
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,044
The real game starts at 20.

835
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,759
You have more time than I do.

836
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,386
Let's think about
how to use this time wisely.

837
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,682
Since it begins when you turn 20
and it continues until you turn 30 and 40,

838
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,435
how are you going to use your time
to manage money?

839
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,271
Let's think about that today.
Then what's next?

840
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,106
Ji-min, are you tired?

841
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,316
What? No.

842
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,779
-Sorry.
-What? Don't be.

843
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,405
-It's hard.
-Guys.

844
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,532
-That's for people in 30s.
-They're yawning.

845
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,659
-It's too early for them.
-Teach us instead.

846
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,953
This is so beneficial for us
who are in our 30s.

847
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,373
Next is, make a nest egg.

848
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,001
Unexpected events occur in life.

849
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:41,556
I felt sleepy in economy class,
because we had just eaten lunch.

850
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,350
I dozed off.

851
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,187
The choice is yours.

852
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,608
The next lifehack is even more practical.

853
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,318
Writing your employment contract.

854
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,153
An employment contract is a must.

855
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,074
An employment contract is a list
of your working conditions.

856
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,575
-They're playing.
-Oh, my.

857
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,160
Did she write that she's sleepy?

858
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,162
-What did she write?
-Show us!

859
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,747
-That is…
-Show us!

860
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,588
They might just tell you
how much they'll pay you and…

861
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,884
In economy, Ye-rin wrote
that she was sleepy. I found it funny.

862
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:24,099
I was falling asleep, so I wrote,
"I'm so sleepy…" and showed him.

863
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,727
It was my first time doing that
with a girl in class. It was fun.

864
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,479
It was his first time.

865
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,439
That's so cute.

866
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,816
He's like a younger brother.

867
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,776
-"Doing that."
-So cute.

868
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,070
He might misunderstand.

869
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,114
-He might think she likes him.
-Right.

870
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,782
-Right.
-He could.

871
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,701
I hope he gets to experience everything.

872
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,785
Try everything.

873
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,330
That's all for today.

874
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,375
I have an announcement.

875
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,334
That is,

876
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,046
you were asked what CA you want, right?

877
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,717
We have made two clubs.

878
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,468
One is table tennis club.

879
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,139
Play like this.

880
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,267
And the other is astronomy club.

881
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,686
-Astronomy.
-Astronomy?

882
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:14,441
Table tennis club will be led by Se-yeon.

883
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,402
And for astronomy club,

884
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,029
-Sang-won.
-Okay.

885
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,407
I thought Sang-won would be a perfect fit.

886
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,075
-Right.
-For the rest of you…

887
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,036
The clubs are first come, first serve.

888
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,913
The first four people to come get in.

889
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,708
Think about which club you want to join,
and when you're ready,

890
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,919
you can go to the club rooms.

891
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,172
I want to be in both.

892
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,757
Me too. Can I be in both?

893
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,008
I know, right?

894
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,719
What should I do?

895
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,557
Life is a series of decisions to make.

896
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,645
I want to play table tennis
and see the stars.

897
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,771
Can I do both?

898
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,397
I like watching stars.

899
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,274
Then you'll like it.

900
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:00,111
I mean, I'm not sure what we'll be doing,
but we might assemble a telescope

901
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,947
-and see the stars.
-Sounds fun.

902
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,616
-What are you going to do?
-What?

903
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,578
I'm joining the astronomy club.
Are you coming?

904
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,663
Me too.

905
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,083
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my. What was that?

906
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,377
-She was whispering.
-When did they get so close?

907
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,879
-"What are you going to do?"
-Did I miss something?

908
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,592
ASTRONOMY CLUB

909
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,188
I became the leader of the astronomy club.

910
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:39,609
The sense of responsibility
made me feel pressure.

911
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,237
TABLE TENNIS CLUB

912
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,832
I know table tennis the best among them.

913
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:59,754
I'll teach them and have fun.

914
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,722
It's not easy.

915
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,849
Some people might be disappointed.

916
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:11,850
I know.

917
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,477
-What if we all choose the same club?
-That's unlikely.

918
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,438
-Right? It'll be about even.
-Yes.

919
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,857
Stars or sports?

920
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,942
-That is the question.
-The question.

921
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,154
I'm going to run.

922
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,822
Do you want to see?

923
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,741
Let's go.

924
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,784
What? Wait for me.

925
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,827
You have to push it.

926
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,121
Slow down.

927
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,626
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

928
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,800
I want to talk to Seo-hyeon more
in the club.

929
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,219
I want to get to know her more.

930
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,516
The person I want
in the table tennis club is Ye-rin.

931
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,436
-Who's coming?
-Who's coming? I can't wait.

932
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,979
This is so thrilling.

933
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,232
Club activity one and two.

934
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,406
This is astronomy.

935
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,407
Is this astronomy?

936
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,243
Table tennis?

937
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,788
Seo-hyeon. Which one will you choose?

938
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,667
