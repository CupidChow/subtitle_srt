PYEONG-SEOK & HEE-JI'S DATE

13
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,266
It smells good.

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,267
I smell fritters.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,186
What should we get?

16
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:05,982
Orijin.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,487
Suntory Whisky.

18
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,405
Senju.

19
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,408
No, I'm still not used to it.

20
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,327
Being an adult.

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,039
-It's different.
-It's okay. You have to get used to it.

22
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,165
It's okay.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,668
-Sashimi for two.
-Sashimi.

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,669
-And sukiyaki.
-Okay.

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,796
Okay.

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,006
You can order.

27
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,300
Excuse me.

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,261
Excuse me.

29
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,222
We're ready to order.

30
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,557
Are you ready?

31
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,434
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,228
We'll get number two…

33
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,063
-Sukiyaki.
-Kansai-style sukiyaki.

34
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,442
-And we'll have two highball drinks.
-Okay.

35
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,277
-Two?
-Yes.

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,363
Do you have your ID with you?

37
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,948
Here.

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,951
Okay. Thank you.

39
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,244
It's coming right up.

40
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,328
-Yes.
-Thank you.

41
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,914
-Cute.
-They put it in their phone cases.

42
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,124
Right. You need that.

43
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,792
Kids put it in their cases now.

44
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,335
I should do that too.

45
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,172
-Here are your drinks.
-Thank you.

46
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,635
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,473
It's so nice.

48
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,477
-Doesn't it smell good?
-Yes.

49
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,730
Should I mix it?

50
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,566
My first highball.

51
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,695
Look how this is shaped.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,614
What's this?

53
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,453
Cheers.

54
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,047
It's good.

55
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,466
It's really good.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,218
I like it.

57
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,054
So this is the taste of adulthood.

58
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, we're adults now.

59
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,352
My first time drinking at a restaurant.

60
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,313
It was my first time
having that kind of food.

61
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,065
A lot of firsts.

62
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,277
It meant a lot to enjoy those moments
with Hee-ji.

63
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,989
It felt strange

64
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,034
because he was just a friend from school.

65
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,076
Cheers.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,496
But we were on a date.

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,876
It felt strange but nice at the same time.

68
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
Yes, cabbage. I like cabbages.

69
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,508
I'll add a lot.

70
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,387
-Cabbage.
-I think that's enough.

71
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,305
Okay.

72
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,431
Yes.

73
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,184
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

74
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,074
This is really good.

75
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,160
It's sweet.

76
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,995
I like it.

77
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,165
Good food makes me happy.

78
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
Having this konjac
is making me want to go to Busan.

79
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,718
-Busan?
-Yes.

80
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,929
What places have you traveled to?

81
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,390
Almost all places in Korea.

82
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,726
-In Korea?
-Yes, but I've never been abroad.

83
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,563
Where was your favorite place in Korea?

84
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,024
Seoul.

85
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,696
What?

86
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,950
This feels like a trip to me.

87
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,453
I'm such a country bumpkin.

88
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,331
That's cute.

89
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,252
-Seoul?
-The night view is really pretty.

90
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,421
It's even prettier on a bike.

91
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,964
-You can see a lot more.
-On a bike?

92
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,968
I bike often, too.

93
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,553
What kind of bike?

94
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
A road bike.

95
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,391
-What? Really?
-Yes.

96
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,937
We should go biking together.

97
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,485
I'll take you somewhere scary.

98
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,117
I used to ride a fixie.
Do you know fixies?

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,036
Of course I do.

100
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,998
-Did you use to ride it too?
-Yes.

101
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,754
I got into trouble
riding it without brakes.

102
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
Oh, right.

103
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,217
Do you exercise?

104
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,886
-Me?
-Yes.

105
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,848
I used to exercise every day after school.

106
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,683
I learned hapkido when I was young.

107
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,310
-Really?
-Yes.

108
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,401
This is fun.

109
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,947
This egg is really tasty.

110
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,659
I dip gyukatsu in this too.

111
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,788
-Have you ever tried it before?
-What?

112
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,997
Gyukatsu.

113
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,998
"Gyukatsu"?

114
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,503
"Gyuka"? Gyukatsu?

115
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,589
-That's so cute.
-He sounds so cute.

116
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,716
-That's cute.
-Is he saying like Pikachu?

117
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,469
"Gyuka"? Gyukatsu?

118
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,805
What's gyukatsu?

119
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,353
-"Gyu"?
-Let's get it next time.

120
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,982
You're going to dream about gyukatsu now.

121
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,451
-"Gyuka?"
-"Gyukatsu."

122
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,246
Pyeong-seok's making a lot of memes.

123
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,914
-Well…
-It's nice to watch them.

124
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,167
Hee-ji and Pyeong-seok's date is perfect.

125
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,461
-It's perfect.
-Everyone's dates should be like this.

126
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,630
-They have chemistry.
-Yes.

127
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,174
They both enjoy riding a bicycle for fun.

128
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,426
They feel comfortable with each other.

129
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,970
Do you want beer?

130
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,264
Let's start with beer.

131
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,391
Enjoy.

132
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,476
-Let's enjoy.
-Cheers.

133
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,400
Ye-rin's going to drink a lot tonight.

134
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,652
-Go for it.
-Yes.

135
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,406
That way, you can have
a deep conversation.

136
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,118
You need alcohol for that.

137
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,286
Hurry up and drink.

138
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,122
To our twenties.

139
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,707
-To our twenties.
-To our twenties.

140
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,168
Drink.

141
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
Here.

142
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,218
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

143
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,896
As I drink, I wonder,
"Why do people drink?"

144
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
Are you sleepy?

145
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,693
Let's eat and sober up.

146
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,237
All right, then.

147
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,197
Now…

148
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,075
Let's just finish this.

149
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
-Are we going outside?
-Let's go out.

150
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,664
Do you want to stay together

151
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:24,128
or split into two and take turns to talk?

152
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,255
-I'm fine either way.
-Me too.

153
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,424
Let's split into two and take turns.

154
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
-Take turns with everyone?
-Yes.

155
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,345
Are they making a segment for themselves?

156
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,262
That's cute.

157
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,473
-Se-yeon knows how to lead the show.
-Cute.

158
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,601
-He's good at it.
-I can't wait.

159
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,812
Are you ready?
Do you want to get some fresh air?

160
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,772
Let's go.

161
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,070
-It's…
-Can you spin it 360 degrees?

162
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,905
-What?
-Spin it 360 degrees.

163
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,281
-In 360 degrees?
-Yes.

164
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,701
You're drunk.

165
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,834
We spent a week in school,
and it's been a day in here.

166
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,462
How are things in general?

167
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,799
I think…

168
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,925
Yes.

169
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,179
At School 19, I was like,
"Whatever, things will work out."

170
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,641
I was like, "I want to focus on school.
What are you going to do about it?"

171
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,434
But after coming here,

172
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,479
we have dream dates and all that,

173
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,191
so I feel like I have to improve.

174
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,734
-Right.
-You know what I mean?

175
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,153
I'm like, "Do I need to do something?"

176
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,781
"Should I be honest with myself?"

177
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,745
I have a lot on my mind too.

178
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,543
When we were in school,

179
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,671
there was the no-dating rule.

180
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,756
I thought,

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,927
"I can just have fun
with other people as friends."

182
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,014
-I never thought I'd feel this way.
-Right.

183
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,810
Are you saying you have feelings
for someone?

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,646
When I was in school,

185
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:12,486
my heart fluttered when I was around you.

186
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,451
You know, there's something I realized
after coming here.

187
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,579
I thought I had no emotions.

188
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,249
I was like,

189
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,043
"Heart flutter? What's that?"

190
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,837
I've never been
in a serious relationship before.

191
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,469
I was surprised
because you made my heart flutter.

192
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,598
Ever since what happened in the library,

193
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,892
you've been my number one.

194
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,144
You always come first for me.

195
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,399
Since we talked in the library,
you've been my number one.

196
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:02,620
Back in school,
I spent the most time with you.

197
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,579
Right.

198
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:09,126
I had a great time with you,
and we made a lot of memories.

199
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,673
So you were my number one too.

200
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,346
He's talking in the past tense.

201
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,765
-"You were…"
-"You were…"

202
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,769
So you were my number one too.

203
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,689
-It used to be me?
-Yes, it used to be you.

204
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,945
But when we were in school,
a lot of things changed.

205
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,199
I wanted to get to know others as well.

206
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,536
I wanted to talk to this person

207
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,996
and that person.

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,708
But being here, I realized…

209
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,295
It feels like we are just focused
too much on one person right now.

210
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:59,343
That's why I need more time
to think about this.

211
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,511
Right.

212
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,353
I just want to tell you
that you shouldn't feel pressured at all.

213
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,604
Right.

214
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,566
That's what I wanted to tell you
on the Ferris wheel.

215
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,817
But it was almost over.

216
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,070
We're still getting to know each other.

217
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,238
You can explore more.

218
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,451
-The decision is up to you.
-Right.

219
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,035
So,

220
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:30,291
even if you go on a date
with someone else,

221
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,793
I won't be disappointed.

222
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,885
I should be true to my feelings.

223
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,429
That's what I think.

224
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,807
I'm trying to stay true
to my emotions too.

225
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm trying to figure out
who I'm attracted to,

226
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,604
and who's on my mind right now.

227
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,691
It's hard.

228
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,152
Let's be honest with ourselves.

229
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,158
That was a great conversation.

230
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,244
How can they have
such a mature conversation at that age?

231
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,996
Ye-rin's really considerate.

232
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,333
Just like how we didn't know,
she probably didn't know either.

233
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,002
She thought, "Se-yeon probably
feels the same way about me."

234
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,253
I don't think she knew.

235
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,590
She was like,
"You've had my heart the whole time."

236
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,426
Then he said he wanted
to get to know other people.

237
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,136
And she said no pressure.

238
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,389
That was very mature of her.

239
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,350
Right. But is she really okay?

240
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,061
I've thought about it.

241
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,147
She's probably not okay.
How can she be okay?

242
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,608
-He's her first crush after all.
-Right.

243
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,194
She knows how sweet he is.

244
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,947
She says she doesn't mind
even if he treats someone

245
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,990
like he treated her, but she will mind.

246
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,703
But he can't date her
just because he feels bad for her.

247
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,121
Right. That's the worst.

248
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,291
It was a great chance
for them to talk about it.

249
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,170
They had the perfect conversation
in the perfect timing.

250
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,129
Right.

251
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,714
I like it here.

252
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,091
-You like it here?
-Yes.

253
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,760
Any questions for me?

254
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,306
I wonder what will be revealed
at midnight.

255
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,642
No one knows.

256
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,560
That's true.

257
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,063
What's your ideal type?

258
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,232
-Me? I don't have one.
-No?

259
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,275
No.

260
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,944
-You don't have an ideal type?
-No.

261
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,740
Is there anything you want to know
about me?

262
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,961
Is there anybody you want to go on a date
with besides me?

263
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,254
No.

264
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,381
-Really?
-Yes.

265
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,968
What if you include me?

266
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,763
Would you want to go on a date with me?

267
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,516
Including you?

268
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,060
It's a secret.

269
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,744
I'll tell you later.

270
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
Do you want to go on a date with me?

271
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,546
Do you want to?

272
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,468
-Sure.
-Sure.

273
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,390
What do you want to do tomorrow?

274
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,934
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

275
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
I just want to spend time with you.

276
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,820
Ji-woo's made up her mind.

277
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,239
-It's over.
-She's as firm as a rock.

278
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,076
-It's over.
-She won't change her mind.

279
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,162
-Did you see them making eye contact?
-Yes.

280
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,914
They maintained eye contact.

281
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,999
Their eyes were locked on each other.

282
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168
SEO-YEONG & JI-MIN'S DATE

283
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,295
-That looks good.
-That looks good.

284
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,797
It's…

285
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,508
It's our first time dining out.

286
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,426
I know.

287
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,387
I was starving.

288
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,597
You only had ramyeon today.

289
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,016
Right. I usually only have one meal a day.

290
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,946
-It's going to be delicious.
-I'm hungry.

291
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,955
-What do you think of House 20?
-House 20?

292
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,499
-It's more fun than I expected.
-More fun?

293
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,084
-More than you expected?
-Yes.

294
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,961
Was school more fun or House 20?

295
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,464
Honestly, I would say school
if we only had PE.

296
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,425
For all other days, I'd say House 20.

297
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,677
Because partying is so much fun.

298
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,013
What about you? What's more fun?

299
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,557
I'd say House 20.

300
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,726
-House 20?
-In House 20,

301
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,311
we have more options.

302
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,314
We can go on a date and stuff.

303
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,192
-It's nice. I like it.
-Yes.

304
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,075
Ji-min doesn't care.

305
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,035
It's suffocating.

306
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,995
He only cares about the food.
He's not talking.

307
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,913
As if they'd been dating
for like eight years.

308
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,498
Yes, exactly.

309
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,048
Thank you.

310
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,468
Let's eat.

311
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,844
-Enjoy.
-Let's eat.

312
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,476
Here's the white wine you ordered.

313
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,273
Enjoy.

314
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,417
When should we head back?

315
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,753
I don't know.

316
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,755
You don't know?

317
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,674
I'm going to go to bed early
and wake up at midnight.

318
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,511
-That's your plan?
-Yes.

319
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,137
To see what will be revealed?

320
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,223
I want to hang out before I go to bed.

321
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,518
I don't want to miss it.

322
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,978
I hate missing out.

323
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,730
-I can tell.
-Yes.

324
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,660
Our conversation…

325
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,579
SEO-YEONG

326
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,040
It seemed he didn't want to carry on.

327
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,503
I got the feeling he was struggling
to come up with things to talk about.

328
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,423
I knew that was it for us.

329
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,052
It made me realize
we were nothing more than friends.

330
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,101
Ji-min, if you were going to act
like that, you shouldn't have gone.

331
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,062
I can see that Seo-yeong's struggling.

332
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,064
Meanwhile,

333
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,860
Ji-min's showing
he's not interested in her.

334
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,486
He's making it obvious.

335
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,823
He should've just said it
instead of making her realize it.

336
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:22,953
If he agreed to go on a date with her,
he shouldn't have wasted their time.

337
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,497
-He should've tried his best.
-He's avoiding being honest with her.

338
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,874
-Right.
-That's a shame.

339
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,459
-Right.
-Yeah, the way he acted was disappointing.

340
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,878
Seo-yeong did her best.

341
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,630
She was remained true to her feelings
until the end.

342
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,965
She did the right thing.

343
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,050
SANG-WON & SEO-HYEON'S DATE

344
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,260
It's gonna be so good.

345
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,555
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

346
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,640
Let's get started.

347
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,267
Time to eat yukhoe.

348
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,858
It's so good.

349
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,069
-It's amazing.
-You have to try it .

350
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,988
Do you like sushi?

351
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,489
Yes.

352
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,707
-If you're happy, let's drink.
-I'm in.

353
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,751
With one hand.

354
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,386
-Oh, no.
-Is it bitter?

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,055
It tastes awful.

356
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,849
Eat the food then.

357
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,437
This is good.

358
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,022
What do you do for fun?

359
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,191
-Do you watch movies?
-I do diamond painting.

360
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,150
Diamond painting?

361
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,860
I wanted to bring it here.

362
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,487
I can do it all night.

363
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,698
I went to buy something on December 31st.

364
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,369
I didn't know what diamond painting was
before you did AMA.

365
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,412
Then it caught my attention.

366
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,914
I was like, "So that's what it is."

367
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,625
There are so many kinds.
There are ones with stickers too.

368
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,335
It's really pretty. You should try it.

369
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,087
-Would you help me?
-Of course.

370
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,422
I have a question.

371
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,590
-Can I ask you?
-Sure.

372
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,467
What's your ideal type?

373
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,927
-My ideal type is…
-Yes.

374
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,805
I don't have one in particular.

375
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,309
But I think I like people
with pretty eyes.

376
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,519
-Pretty eyes?
-Yes.

377
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,396
That's hard.

378
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
-What?
-That's hard.

379
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,731
-It is, isn't it?
-Yes.

380
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,025
-It is. Pretty eyes?
-Yes.

381
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,820
-What about their character?
-Their character?

382
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,035
Someone who can make my heart flutter.

383
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,124
-That's hard.
-It is. It's definitely hard.

384
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,417
But here's the thing.

385
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,461
I don't have a specific type.

386
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,340
There are people
I feel naturally attracted to.

387
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,802
That sounds complicated.

388
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,472
I don't know what I want either.

389
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,891
So I'm…

390
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,477
You don't know what your heart wants?

391
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,564
Exactly. What about you?

392
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,691
I don't have an ideal type either.

393
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,736
If I like someone,

394
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,238
she becomes my ideal type.

395
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,121
What are you looking forward to the most
in college?

396
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,456
-Me?
-Yes.

397
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,790
College festivals?

398
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,168
Festivals? They're fun.

399
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,587
It's also fun to go
to other schools' festivals.

400
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,339
-Should I be excited?
-You should.

401
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,300
Freshman year is fun.
Ask your seniors to treat you.

402
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,346
What do you say? Do you just ask them?

403
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,432
We have a tradition.
We call it a "meal promise."

404
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,560
It's usually two seniors and two juniors.

405
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,981
The seniors pay for the meal
and the juniors pay for the cab and café.

406
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,275
-That's how we become friends.
-I see.

407
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,446
When you ask the seniors to buy you a meal
and talk to them for a few hours,

408
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,114
you become friends.

409
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,409
Reality hit me
after I got into university.

410
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,871
Because I prefer making friends
in depth and breadth.

411
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,583
But a lot of people take friendship
more lightly than I expected.

412
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,836
But I realized
I can't worry about all that

413
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,297
because I've met so many people
since I entered college.

414
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,635
Sang-won's going to be a sophomore.

415
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,679
He sounded like someone senior to me.

416
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,765
He looked mature.

417
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,228
After talking to him,

418
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,773
I'm confused

419
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,442
whether he's a crush or a good friend.

420
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,236
It's confusing.

421
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,072
I think I'll understand

422
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,366
my feelings for him

423
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,993
if I go on more dates with him.

424
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,745
I'd like to spend more time with him.

425
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,166
It's confusing.

426
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,877
She's confused
between friendship and a crush.

427
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,755
So she wants to spend more time
with Sang-won.

428
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,424
If she keeps going on dates
with him for that reason,

429
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,301
she might end up seeing only him.

430
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,553
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

431
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,429
-She changed her mind after the date.
-Right.

432
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,347
She did.

433
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,432
They're getting more and more confusing.

434
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,393
-I'm not sure about them.
-Yeah.

435
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,105
Let's go.

436
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,820
You're fine, but why am I--

437
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,905
Why are you back so early?

438
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,532
-We only had dinner.
-Join us.

439
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,201
-Everyone is downstairs.
-Is there food?

440
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,787
-There's still a lot.
-We didn't eat. We were resting.

441
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,998
-That sounds exciting.
-What are you doing?

442
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,543
-We…
-You didn't answer my question.

443
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,044
I said it was a secret.

444
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,964
-You said…
-I said it was a secret.

445
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,048
You said you didn't know.

446
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,733
-Where's everyone?
-They're talking upstairs.

447
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,287
-Whose is this?
-Mine.

448
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,499
She put it on even before you answered.

449
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,551
-This yukhoe is good.
-I know, right?

450
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,805
Are they coming back now?
Weren't you the last ones to leave?

451
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,475
-Yes.
-We came back first.

452
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,810
I bet the four of you had fun.

453
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,188
Yes. Where's Se-yeon?

454
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,107
-He's talking.
-What are they still talking about?

455
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,734
They've been talking for so long.

456
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,032
This is good.

457
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,204
At the time,

458
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,832
I was worried and upset. I was afraid

459
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,709
they had grown closer

460
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,963
while I was gone.

461
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,131
I wasn't exactly happy about it.

462
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,883
I'm full.

463
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,551
But it's good.

464
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,685
Is there anyone you're interested in?

465
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,646
-Interested?
-Yes.

466
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:06,940
Aside from me.

467
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,195
-No.
-No?

468
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,822
Not yet.

469
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,741
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

470
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,913
It's hot in here.

471
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,085
My cheeks are hot from laughing so much.

472
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,965
My face turns red when I laugh.

473
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,137
-Does it hurt?
-No, when I laugh,

474
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,847
my face turns so red.

475
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,473
I have

476
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,058
very small dimples.

477
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,643
Dimples? Right.

478
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,480
I've always had a deep dimple
on my left cheek.

479
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,316
It looks like a jujube.

480
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,361
Try poking it.

481
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,369
You remind me of my dad. He…

482
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,496
-Does he have a dimple too?
-Yes.

483
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,332
I used to poke my cheeks

484
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,709
to get dimples when I was young.

485
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,669
My mom got mad at me.

486
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,177
Dimples can be charming.

487
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,848
Now that I think about it,
I think all girls have dimples.

488
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,225
I only noticed yours, though.

489
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,813
-Pyeong-seok.
-Oh, Pyeong-seok.

490
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,775
-In front of Hee-ji…
-That's who he really is.

491
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,695
He's good at expressing himself
with the person he likes.

492
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,572
Pyeong-seok, you're making me dizzy.

493
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,866
I only noticed yours, though.

494
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,660
-Because it's so deep?
-Yes.

495
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,168
Right. You have long eyelashes.

496
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,841
They're really long. This long.

497
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,552
All the boys have long eyelashes.

498
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,390
I only noticed your eyelashes, though.

499
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,141
They're really long.

500
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,727
What are they doing?

501
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,270
What are you doing?

502
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,563
What are you two doing?

503
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,983
Next to your eyes…

504
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,194
-The moles?
-You have two moles.

505
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,238
I want to draw a mouth underneath them.

506
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,826
It looks like you have four eyes.

507
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,244
They're all looking at me.

508
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
I used to hate them so much.

509
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,747
-You hated them?
-Yes.

510
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,998
But they're charming.

511
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,837
I used to cover them up
with colored pencils.

512
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,756
You colored over them?

513
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,885
Now that I think about it…

514
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh, gosh.

515
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,264
That's so funny.

516
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,141
When did we get so comfortable
with each other?

517
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,226
We got really comfortable.

518
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,772
At first, I couldn't even talk to you.

519
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,816
I only said things like,

520
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,319
"Yes." "Right."

521
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,738
This was you.

522
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,322
Was I like that?

523
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,453
You were so shy.

524
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,455
You were shy.

525
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,209
I'm good at smiling, but not at talking.

526
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,337
At first, I wouldn't talk a lot

527
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,423
because of my accent.

528
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,799
Really?

529
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,135
But I love your accent.

530
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,431
I don't know anyone who has an accent.

531
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,018
Am I the first person you met from Daegu?

532
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,811
Right, you're the first one.

533
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,107
That just caught my attention.

534
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,235
I think it looks like you.

535
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,573
I just want to put it in my pocket.

536
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,826
It'll fit right in my pocket.

537
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,747
Take it.

538
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,208
-You…
-If you want to put it in your pocket,

539
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,795
-do it.
-I really want to.

540
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,092
I should try to look cool.

541
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,595
-What?
-I should try to look cool.

542
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,014
A guy can't be just cute.

543
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,311
This is bad.
I should try to be more manly.

544
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,355
I look forward to it.

545
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,901
I can't wait.

546
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,238
-No, being cute is everything.
-That's his strength.

547
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,281
-I mean it.
-That's his strength. He's so cute.

548
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,533
-Right.
-He's so cute.

549
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,618
He's cute and cool. He's got it all.

550
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,371
Can't they just start going out tomorrow?

551
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,747
Exactly.

552
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,416
It doesn't seem
like they want to see other people.

553
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,668
-No, it doesn't.
-Right.

554
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,588
It's awkward to have time

555
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,508
-to talk, right?
-Yes.

556
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,510
What did you guys talk about?

557
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,011
-With Se-yeon?
-Yes.

558
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,515
We talked about who we're interested in.

559
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,560
Did you tell him you find him
most attractive?

560
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,061
-To Se-yeon?
-Yes.

561
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,896
-I said…
-That you like him now?

562
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,649
Yes, since the library,

563
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,944
he's always been my number one.

564
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,448
But Se-yeon and I are both worried

565
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,451
that our relationship
might already seem set.

566
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,205
So we are careful doing things together.

567
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,748
I mean, it's not like we're dating.

568
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,502
It's not like we're in love or anything.

569
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,464
It's just that he made my heart flutter.

570
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,717
-Right.
-It's not that I'm in love with him.

571
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,926
Right.

572
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,178
That's true.

573
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,392
I don't care if anything changes
at any moment.

574
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,061
I want to get to know everyone.

575
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,938
-I just want to have fun.
-Right.

576
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,025
It's not that I'm trying to seduce them
or anything.

577
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,110
I just want to talk to everyone.

578
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,278
Right.

579
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,447
That was the right attitude at first.
For now.

580
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,700
-I don't think I'll regret it.
-That's also true.

581
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,161
You're still going out tomorrow, right?

582
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,205
I don't know who I should go with.

583
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
Do you want to talk to us?

584
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,878
-About what?
-Do you want to join?

585
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,922
-Sure.
-What were you talking about?

586
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,214
-We?
-It's just…

587
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,967
-Who we're attracted to and stuff.
-Just talking.

588
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,636
About the person we like.

589
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,680
What about you?

590
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,349
Me?

591
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,184
-I don't know how you feel.
-Well, I…

592
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,811
All I want to do is…

593
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,316
just drink and party.

594
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,611
-He can't say it in front of Jung-yun.
-Oh, no.

595
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh, right.

596
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,781
How can he say it in front of him?

597
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,950
…just drink and party.

598
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,288
I just want to have fun for a week
before I leave.

599
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,917
-Wait. That's sad.
-You might fall for someone before that.

600
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,087
I'm sympathizing with you
and it's making me sad.

601
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,673
Ji-min, why are you sad?

602
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,093
But it's okay for Ji-min to tell Jung-yun.

603
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,928
-That he likes Ji-woo?
-Yes.

604
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,513
He won't be able to say it.

605
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,598
-He can't.
-He can't say it.

606
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,267
Ji-min should stop being so passive

607
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,853
and be honest.
He should try something at least.

608
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,898
But he can't say no or express himself.

609
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,150
-I bet Ji-woo has no idea.
-That's disappointing.

610
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,028
-Ji-woo has no idea.
-That Ji-min likes her.

611
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,781
You guys…

612
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,033
Hey, girl.

613
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,411
-Sit down.
-Yes, ma'am.

614
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,163
-What's bugging you?
-Nothing.

615
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
-Then why are you so serious?
-I'm not.

616
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,044
I kind of hope that
everyone's feelings will change.

617
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,797
We act as if the couples
are already fixed.

618
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,467
I just want everything to change
while we stay in House 20.

619
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm going to meet everyone
while I stay in House 20.

620
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,141
Go on a date with everyone

621
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,351
to get to know everyone.

622
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,478
I might learn something new about them.

623
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,313
-Right.
-You have a point.

624
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,565
Are you proud of me?

625
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,026
Are you?

626
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,194
I'll give you an air pat.

627
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,823
Are you worried about all of us?
How nice of you.

628
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,366
Well done.

629
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,493
Did you know who I like?

630
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,495
-That you like Ji-woo?
-Yes.

631
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,039
-It's just…
-I'm sorry,

632
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,082
but you made it so obvious.

633
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,334
I couldn't help it.

634
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,754
You're always looking at her.

635
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,756
It just happens.

636
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,259
Are we allowed to talk about this?

637
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,261
It's fine.

638
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,304
Right?

639
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,930
-It's okay to talk about it.
-But…

640
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,435
There's something I want to ask.

641
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,395
What if I end up leaving House 20

642
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,314
without falling for anyone?

643
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,274
That's what I was worried about too.

644
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,942
I don't care about what others think.

645
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,029
I'm having fun here by myself.

646
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,906
So when I leave,

647
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,574
I think I might be alone.

648
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,119
"Anyone who's interested in Choi Ye-rin,
raise your arm."

649
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,704
-"One, two, three."
-"Three."

650
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,831
"No one. Please leave."

651
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,500
-"Please leave."
-"Goodbye."

652
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,961
Ji-min, you're hilarious.

653
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,671
-Ji-min's funny, isn't he?
-Yes.

654
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,216
Do you want to have dinner
with me tomorrow?

655
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,592
-Dinner?
-Are you down?

656
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,511
-A meal?
-A meal. What do you want to eat?

657
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,512
Gukbap, obviously.

658
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,431
-Seriously?
-Just joking.

659
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,768
I can already imagine
how we'll spend time.

660
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,604
-Yes.
-I can imagine it already.

661
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,149
They'll become real buddies.

662
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,151
Right. Wait, you never know.

663
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,986
-Right. You never know.
-You really don't.

664
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,988
You never know at that age.

665
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,032
I can't believe we finished it.

666
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,118
-I know.
-Let's go.

667
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,828
Wait.

668
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,037
I got it.

669
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,705
You're good to go.

670
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,290
Thank you.

671
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,086
-That was really good.
-I know. I'm tired.

672
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,296
I'm falling asleep.

673
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,341
That was fun.

674
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,801
-Totally.
-Was it fun?

675
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,219
It was so good.

676
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,556
-Was it any fun?
-It was so much fun.

677
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,474
It was really fun.

678
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,852
-I…
-Now I know that

679
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,105
good food is a must to ask you out.

680
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,318
I liked our deep conversation.

681
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,324
I have something for you.

682
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,451
I got you a gift.

683
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,996
Really?

684
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,747
-What?
-Should I be excited?

685
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,918
I gave you a hint during dinner.

686
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,336
Oh, really?

687
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,297
I'll give it to you later.

688
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,757
What is it?

689
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,634
Is everyone in the living room?

690
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,596
-It's empty.
-Maybe they're downstairs.

691
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,308
Are we the first ones to be back?
I don't like that.

692
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,810
I know. Should we go out again?

693
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,312
Do you want to?

694
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,479
Why don't you

695
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,481
stand here and look over there?

696
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,066
-Okay.
-Over there.

697
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,776
Do you see those three stars?

698
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,822
They're the three stars of Orion.
They form the belt.

699
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,909
-They look like hands.
-Those three over there?

700
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,619
-Oh, yes.
-That's the hand.

701
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,996
-I can see them clearly now.
-Yes.

702
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,416
-Isn't it cold? Let's get inside.
-Yes.

703
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,919
Awesome. You're…

704
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,129
You're pretty cool.

705
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,631
-I'm pretty cool?
-Yes.

706
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,757
Thank you.

707
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,885
Daddy's home!

708
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,889
-Is anyone home?
-Maybe they all went out.

709
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,683
Really? Then…

710
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,102
-Will it be awkward in here?
-It's not awkward at all.

711
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,021
This is my first time in here!

712
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,940
-Let's talk here.
-Are we the first ones here?

713
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,857
Yes.

714
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,945
Something big is going to happen.

715
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,865
-I can't wait.
-Right.

716
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,702
-What did you guys talk about?
-Well…

717
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,955
We talked about a lot of stuff.

718
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,916
We had a long conversation because…

719
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,963
This might take a while. Do you have time?

720
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,339
Yes. Don't worry.

721
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,674
-I…
-Yes.

722
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,094
What do you think?

723
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,930
Who do you think I'm into?

724
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,890
-Ye-rin.
-What do you think?

725
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,434
I thought you and Ye-rin
had feelings for each other.

726
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,312
-I know how Ye-rin feels.
-Right.

727
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,524
So I thought

728
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,610
you two were on the same page.

729
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:08,202
Before you got here,
Ye-rin and I did a lot of things together.

730
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,998
We spent a lot of time together.

731
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,711
I realized Ye-rin is a nice person.

732
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,045
But…

733
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,258
I don't know what I want.

734
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,634
You don't?

735
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,929
But there must be something
your heart wants.

736
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,644
You.

737
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,147
Oh, my gosh!

738
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,862
That's crazy.

739
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,367
You.

740
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,289
When I…

741
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,334
first saw you,

742
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,462
I thought it wouldn't
be easy for us to become friends

743
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,797
because you seemed shy.

744
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,425
I thought it wouldn't be easy.

745
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,552
But somehow we were left alone

746
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,429
-Right.
-in the table tennis room.

747
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,223
We were joking around.

748
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,434
-I could feel that you felt awkward.
-Yes.

749
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,437
-It was so awkward.
-Right.

750
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,482
But when we were together,

751
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,693
-I…
-It was fun.

752
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,070
Yes, it was fun.

753
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,112
It was fun.

754
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,115
I wanted to get to know you more.

755
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,079
Then, we were partnered

756
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,081
-for the dancesport class.
-Right.

757
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,334
I don't know if it was just me…

758
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,421
But when we were holding hands,

759
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,802
we could have let go right away.

760
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,806
We could've let go,

761
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,685
but we held hands for a few more seconds.

762
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,188
I'm curious if you felt that too.

763
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,401
Honestly, I didn't want to let go.

764
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,694
Really?

765
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:11,242
I liked it, so I didn't want to let go.

766
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,787
If you didn't feel that way,

767
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,331
and I was holding your hand
because I liked it,

768
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,625
-I apologize--
-No.

769
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,377
I liked it too.

770
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,466
-You did?
-Yes, because…

771
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,468
Gosh, I'm sniffing.

772
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,888
I felt it too. We could've let go.

773
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,766
-Right.
-But you were holding my hand.

774
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,610
If it weren't for the dancesport class,

775
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:51,532
we might not be having this conversation
right now.

776
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,159
That was it for us.

777
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,411
Right. That was it.

778
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,621
We'd only talked briefly
in the table tennis room.

779
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,294
I never realized you felt this way.

780
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,007
I thought you only saw me as a friend.

781
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,050
After we talked during lunch,

782
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,428
I thought

783
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,513
you and I were…

784
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,308
So I never realized you felt this way
until now.

785
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,395
Now, can I ask

786
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,982
about you and Jung-yun?

787
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,526
-Me and Jung-yun?
-Yes.

788
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,831
They're taking forever.

789
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,463
Are you getting anxious?

790
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,598
When I first met Jung-yun,
I expected him to be cold.

791
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,641
I see.

792
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,060
I thought he'd be hard to approach.

793
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,189
When we went to Wolmido,
he happened to be next to me.

794
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,691
So I talked to him first.

795
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,654
So we kept talking.
Then at the Ferris wheel,

796
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,573
only you and Jung-yun were left.

797
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,701
I didn't care who I'd ride it with.

798
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,829
But no one picked me.

799
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,748
Ye-rin chose you first.

800
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,293
So I ended up riding it with Jung-yun.

801
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,753
On the Ferris wheel,

802
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,465
I could see how he felt about me.

803
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,426
-Did you know there would be new students?
-No.

804
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,095
How did you feel when you saw me?

805
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,846
-I was thrilled.
-What?

806
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,640
I was thrilled at the news.

807
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,933
-Really?
-Yes.

808
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,185
That's all that matters.

809
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,483
I think we became very close
in the Ferris wheel.

810
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,153
Things became less awkward after that.

811
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,324
I realized it yesterday.

812
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:02,162
When I saw you and Jung-yun standing close

813
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,290
and talking to each other,

814
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,166
I…

815
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,795
wasn't exactly happy about it.

816
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,215
It kept bugging me.

817
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,093
I wouldn't feel that way

818
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,805
if I had no feelings for you,
or if I wasn't interested in you.

819
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:20,848
Right.

820
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,226
Jung-yun told you how he feels about you.

821
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,605
That's why you see it that way.

822
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:32,610
But I'm finally telling you about it.

823
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,614
I just want you to know

824
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,408
that I'm interested in you,

825
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,453
and I want to get to know you.

826
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,913
Okay.

827
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,041
I can't believe it.

828
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,376
I had no idea how you felt about me.

829
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,295
-Is that a good thing?
-Yes!

830
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,839
Let's go on a date.

831
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,763
Do you want to go on a date
the day after tomorrow?

832
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,514
The day after tomorrow?

833
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,725
I said I'd go out with Jung-yun tomorrow.

834
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,685
Tomorrow…

835
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,856
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

836
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,485
Let's go on a date the day after tomorrow.

837
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,698
Why did you have to join later?

838
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,492
You made me feel so confused.

839
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,663
I'm so grateful right now.

840
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,874
You're so cool.

841
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,169
I'm being honest about how I feel.

842
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,837
Yes.

843
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,757
We talked for too long.

844
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,302
I haven't felt this for a while.

845
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,681
Like in dancesport class.

846
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,975
-Can I let go now?
-Yeah.

847
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,853
-Can I let go now?
-Yeah. Let's go.

848
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,271
Let's go.

849
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,443
How do I…

850
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,655
-What?
-What are they doing?

851
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,572
Are they dating?

852
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,574
-That's crazy.
-Oh, my gosh.

853
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,035
Se-yeon was very cool and honest about it.

854
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,371
-Right. He looked so cool.
-Yeah, he was so cool.

855
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,373
-Seriously.
-Also, I thought

856
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,417
Ji-woo's decision was set in stone.

857
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,836
-But it crumbled into sand.
-Exactly.

858
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,671
-It was just sand.
-Right.

859
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,256
Not even pebbles, just sand.

860
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,551
At first, Ji-woo said she was interested
in Se-yeon and Jung-yun.

861
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,346
She thought Se-yeon wasn't interested
in her at all.

862
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,808
Now that he's showing her interest,
she's really happy.

863
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,685
She's still shy, but happy.

864
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,187
It was the first time
I've seen Ji-woo flustered.

865
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,940
Ji-woo talked to Jung-yun a lot

866
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,316
and approached him first.

867
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,485
Whereas Se-yeon

868
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,821
asked her out

869
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,448
when she wasn't expecting it.

870
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,200
Se-yeon suddenly made her heart flutter.

871
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,578
I think Ji-woo fell for Se-yeon big time.

872
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,581
How can you not get swayed
after a confession like that?

873
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,041
Things are starting to change.

874
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,755
I wonder what everyone's doing.

875
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,133
Drinking?

876
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,759
Right?

877
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,262
-They must be drinking.
-Probably.

878
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,890
It was so good.

879
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:11,727
Fist bump.

880
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,442
I think it's my habit. I keep doing this.

881
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,239
You shouldn't make a fist like this.

882
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,533
See? You make a fist like this.

883
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,911
-How do you do it?
-Make a fist.

884
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,373
-Relax this finger.
-Relax.

885
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,167
-Make a fist like this.
-Like this?

886
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,585
Fold it.

887
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,670
-Like this?
-There.

888
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,923
-There.
-Like this?

889
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,259
-There.
-Got it.

890
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,638
Don't strain this finger.

891
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,393
-I make a fist like this out of habit.
-Right. People do that.

892
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,564
-This looks so cool.
-You have to make a straight line.

893
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,899
As straight as you can.

894
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,401
-Like this?
-That way you won't hurt your hand.

895
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,746
A fist.

896
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,873
I'll never forget this.

897
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,384
You're back. What are you doing?

898
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,903
I thought,

899
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,363
"How can they talk for so long?"

900
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,784
I was a bit surprised.

901
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,914
The people who were waiting outside,
Ye-rin, Ji-min and Jung-yun…

902
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,833
-Yes. They're all involved.
-Exactly.

903
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,460
Wait. They share a room.

904
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,922
-I've never seen Jung-yun act like that.
-You're right.

905
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,091
-How are they going to share a room?
-So awkward.

906
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,596
What?

907
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,056
Want to drink beer outside?

908
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,225
Let's go, buddy.

909
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,644
-Won't you be cold?
-I'm fine.

910
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,354
Tell me if you're cold.

911
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,699
I never thought

912
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,327
-this would happen.
-What?

913
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,040
When we were
talking about first impressions

914
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,292
before Ji-woo came and
there were only four girls,

915
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,336
you said you were still getting
to know them.

916
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,005
-Right. I didn't know back then.
-You said you weren't sure.

917
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,633
Then when Ji-woo joined,

918
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,719
-you expressed your feelings right away.
-Right.

919
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,306
Anyway, I can feel

920
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,518
that you have feelings for Ji-woo.

921
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,605
But that doesn't mean I should give up.

922
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,399
-You shouldn't do that.
-Right.

923
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:08,570
I thought I should tell her

924
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,864
about how I feel.

925
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,075
Those are two different things.

926
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,207
But I don't…

927
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,001
want to ruin our friendship

928
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,545
because of Ji-woo.

929
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,881
-Right.
-We never know what's going to happen.

930
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,467
Don't think too much about it.

931
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,053
-I won't.
-Just be honest with yourself.

932
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,098
That's why I decided
to pluck up my courage

933
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,391
and tell you.

934
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,310
I wanted to have an honest talk with you.

935
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,937
Though it wasn't so easy.

936
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm getting thirsty.

937
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,492
This is…

938
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,995
After talking to Jung-yun,

939
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,748
I felt relieved.

940
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,168
Just as I expected,

941
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,545
he was cool about it.

942
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,090
That was nice of him.

943
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,469
I thought, "So that's how you feel?"

944
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,762
JUNG-YUN

945
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,181
I thought the way he talked to me

946
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,143
was brave and amazing.

947
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,646
But I'm not planning on letting him win.

948
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,777
Can I talk to you for a moment?

949
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,282
Can you guess what it is?

950
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,492
-Yes, I've been thinking about it.
-Really?

951
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,828
I got this for you.

952
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,663
DIAMOND PAINTING

953
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,124
-I had no idea.
-I got you a surprise.

954
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,792
No way.

955
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,463
-But I didn't get you anything.
-A gift?

956
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,926
I'm so touched.

957
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,805
-My goodness.
-You can do it alone

958
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,433
-or we can do it together.
-Let's do it together.

959
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,477
-Tomorrow.
-Let's do it when we're home.

960
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,772
-It's a gift for you.
-Thank you.

961
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,440
-Do you like it?
-Totally.

962
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,442
-I'm glad.
-I wanted to do it so badly.

963
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,862
Easy, easy, No Easy.

964
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,405
-How did it go?
-Good.

965
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,408
-Se-yeon.
-I didn't see that coming.

966
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,786
-I was surprised too.
-Moon Se-yeon?

967
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,330
-What did you talk about?
-I had no idea.

968
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,956
-Where?
-Let's sit here.

969
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,541
-Let's take a seat here.
-Here?

970
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,338
-I had absolutely no idea.
-Okay.

971
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,632
Did he want to talk to you first?

972
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,384
Yes, because there were
only the four of us left.

973
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,429
We decided to have a serious conversation.

974
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,557
-Let's take a seat.
-Sure.

975
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,019
What time is it?

976
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,145
It's 11:59 p.m.

977
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,230
Only a minute left.

978
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,858
-It's time.
-It's midnight. The dream date.

979
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,027
"Every midnight,

980
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,112
dream dates will be revealed."

981
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,406
"Only one dream date ticket per person."

982
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,700
We should save it.
We can only use it once.

983
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,662
Saving things isn't always the best idea.

984
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,997
I wonder what the dream date is.

985
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,958
I can't wait to see what it is.

986
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,377
The dream date is…

987
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,129
-Amusement park.
-Yes, I'm guessing the amusement park.

988
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,006
-Skating.
-Oh, skating.

989
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,550
There might be an overnight trip.

990
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,802
-An overnight trip?
-There could be.

991
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,263
I think there could be an overnight trip.

992
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,014
I want to go camping.

993
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,517
-That's a good idea. I want to go camping.
-Me too.

994
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,520
As a good girl,
I can't go on an overnight trip.

995
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:32,065
If this is first come first served,
do I have to run for it?

996
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,359
But you have to reach an agreement first.

997
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,862
-You have to reach an agreement.
-With your date.

998
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:37,821
Is that so? I see.

999
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,614
What time is it now?

1000
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,157
-Midnight.
-It's midnight.

1001
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,796
-What?
-What's going on?

1002
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,507
-Their reaction is that big?
-What is it?

1003
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,932
DREAM DATES: FULL RENTAL OF
LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE, STARGAZING

1004
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,934
STARGAZING

1005
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:13,148
FULL RENTAL OF LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE

1006
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,900
-See?
-Lotte World Adventure.

1007
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,234
The whole place to themselves.

1008
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,111
-The whole place.
-Only to themselves?

1009
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:19,487
We never did that before.

1010
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,906
I know. We want it too.

1011
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,949
We'll never get a chance
in the future either.

1012
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,285
-Rent the whole place.
-We want to do it too.

1013
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,538
-That is a dream date.
-I want to go too.

1014
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,832
-Hey.
-Hey.

1015
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,167
Me!

1016
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,877
Lotte World Adventure!

1017
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,712
-Lotte World Adventure.
-Full rental!

1018
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,634
-Ji-woo.
-That's amazing.

1019
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:46,181
We all expected an amusement park.

1020
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,600
But I didn't know they'd rent
the whole place for us.

1021
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:52,646
I thought I'd never get that chance again.

1022
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,190
I want to go if I can.

1023
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,484
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1024
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,361
"What's this?"

1025
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,821
"It really is a dream date."

1026
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,115
I thought,

1027
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,701
"Only the two of us
in Lotte World Adventure?"

1028
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,663
I didn't want to miss it.

1029
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,414
Do you want to use it now?

1030
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,916
-Do you want to?
-Shall we?

1031
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,084
That's amazing.

1032
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,378
-Are you sure?
-I want Lotte World Adventure too.

1033
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,797
-It's first come first served.
-Wait.

1034
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,715
-Do it.
-What are you doing?

1035
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,217
It's first come first served.

1036
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,719
What the heck? I'm going home.

1037
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,223
-Go watch the stars.
-First come first served.

1038
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,975
Should I erase it?

1039
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,978
Erase it. Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1040
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,938
Did you reach an agreement?

1041
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,398
-Yes.
-We agreed.

1042
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,691
If you did…

1043
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,318
-Right away.
-We agreed to do it.

1044
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,654
Does that say Oh Sang-won or Lim Jung-yun?

1045
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,864
-Lim Jung-won.
-It looks like Lim Jung-yun.

1046
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,242
What does that say?

1047
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,453
I'm seeing Lim Jung-yun.

1048
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,788
Whatever.

1049
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,709
Almost nobody

1050
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,629
gets to be alone with their date
in an amusement park.

1051
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,756
It's the definition of a dream date.

1052
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,050
I thought it would be nice
to go with Ji-woo.

1053
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,469
So I really wanted to go.

1054
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,222
I was too late.

1055
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,189
If you're going to hesitate,
I'm writing my name.

1056
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,942
I'd do rock-paper-scissors,
but there's no competitors.

1057
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,944
-Jung-yun, do rock-paper-scissors.
-Shall we?

1058
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,195
Go for it if you want.

1059
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,739
Are you in?

1060
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,948
I'm in.

1061
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,994
Find a partner and get her consent first.

1062
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,704
-Find a partner.
-He already did.

1063
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,998
-Can singles go together?
-I'm in too then.

1064
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,917
-You have to find a partner.
-Singles are going together.

1065
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,544
I'll win rock-paper-scissors.

1066
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,379
Seo-hyeon,
we're doing rock-paper-scissors.

1067
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,715
Seo-hyeon,
we're doing rock-paper-scissors.

1068
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:44,924
Why?

1069
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,177
This is no ordinary rock-paper-scissors.

1070
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,304
Lotte World Adventure depends on it.

1071
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,848
If we go, we should ride
that roller coaster five times.

1072
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,183
Wait, then we can't go on
another dream date?

1073
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,519
-This would be it for me
-Really?

1074
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,897
Who? Who's challenging us?

1075
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,523
-Me.
-I'll do it.

1076
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,692
I also want Lotte World all to myself.

1077
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,655
Jung-yun, if you want to go,
find a partner.

1078
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,949
-Get your partner's consent.
-You need her consent.

1079
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,493
-Should I join?
-It's a circle.

1080
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,329
I'd go. It's Lotte World Adventure.

1081
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,415
If I was selfish, I'd just go.
But I couldn't be so harsh.

1082
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,043
Don't be so selfish. That's not good.

1083
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,170
I'll leave it to you guys.

1084
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,091
Sang-won and Seo-hyeon.
You should decide it now.

1085
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,385
If they have to wait,
they'll only become more desperate.

1086
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,305
-Se-yeon doesn't want them to go.
-He did on purpose.

1087
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,182
-He doesn't want them to go.
-No matter what.

1088
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,559
He's afraid Jung-yun and Ji-woo
will go together.

1089
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,228
If you want to go, then go.

1090
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,772
If we play rock-paper-scissors,
it'll never end.

1091
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,524
-Right. Just go.
-It'll never end.

1092
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:43,900
Awesome.

1093
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,985
-That's awesome.
-Life is a series of choices.

1094
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,612
Life is on a first come,
first served basis.

1095
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,949
-Just tell us how it goes.
-I'm so jealous, Sang-won.

1096
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,492
No one's down for stargazing?

1097
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:56,329
If we don't choose it now,
does someone lose the chance?

1098
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,164
I want to go see the stars.

1099
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,542
-Are you going?
-Pyeong-seok, are you going?

1100
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,503
Are we going to wake up
and see your name on it tomorrow?

1101
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,504
Maybe.

1102
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,673
-Right now…
-Let's call it a night.

1103
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,924
It's 12:17 a.m.

1104
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,093
Let's talk for a bit more and wrap up.

1105
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,678
Yes. Let's wrap up.

1106
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,638
I'm going to wash the dishes.

1107
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,349
I'd really like to have Lotte World
all to myself.

1108
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,101
But we were late.

1109
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,353
-Too late.
-You need your partner's consent.

1110
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,188
You agreed.

1111
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,107
-I'm in any time.
-Yes.

1112
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,817
For Lotte World Adventure,

1113
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,485
-my answer is always yes.
-Okay.

1114
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,155
Are you happy that we got that spot?

1115
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,739
Are you happy that we got that spot?

1116
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,993
I wanted to celebrate so much,

1117
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,370
-but I felt bad for the others.
-Right.

1118
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,496
I had no choice.

1119
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,039
I'm starting to feel bad.

1120
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,416
Me too.

1121
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,084
-But…
-Why do you feel bad?

1122
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,502
I feel really bad.

1123
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,172
Just tell us if you ride
that roller coaster three times in a row.

1124
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,299
-You need to tell us all about it.
-Okay.

1125
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,384
I wouldn't mind as long as you tell us.

1126
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,427
Sure.

1127
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,846
What are you doing?
Jung-yun and I'll do it.

1128
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,223
-Right. You guys didn't eat.
-You can stop.

1129
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,559
We're almost done. Go clean the table.

1130
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,812
You must be overly excited
to go to Lotte World Adventure.

1131
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,359
I'm jealous.

1132
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,743
What should I do?

1133
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,836
I don't know if this is right.

1134
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,590
No, don't think too much about it.
You're overthinking it.

1135
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,426
I'm getting confused.

1136
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,304
It's not about Se-yeon, but about me.

1137
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,307
What did you talk about with Se-yeon?

1138
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,476
-With Se-yeon.
-With Se-yeon?

1139
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,810
So…

1140
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,188
You can tell me anything, really.

1141
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,276
It was a new topic.

1142
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,861
What's that?

1143
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,863
Se-yeon said…

1144
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:01,454
there's someone
he wants to get to know more.

1145
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,209
He said he wants to go on a date
with you and me.

1146
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,710
That's what he said.

1147
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,256
He said he likes you more now,

1148
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,341
but he also wants to get to know me too.

1149
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,307
Why am I so sad all of a sudden?

1150
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,684
Don't be sad.

1151
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,019
Stop.

1152
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,188
I don't know what I want.
It's so complicated.

1153
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,483
This is my first time.
This usually never stresses me out.

1154
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,571
Don't think too much about it.

1155
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,990
Just do what you want.

1156
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,957
-Right.
-Yes.

1157
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,917
-She's right.
-She feels…

1158
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:52,213
It seemed Ye-rin was overcoming it fine.

1159
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,798
-But turns out she wasn't.
-No.

1160
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,843
The person who made your heart flutter

1161
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,387
suddenly shows interest in someone else.

1162
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:03,141
No matter how many times you go
through it, you can never get used to it.

1163
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,934
Even if you're not 19 or 20,

1164
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,478
-it's difficult for anyone.
-It's just sad.

1165
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,189
-Your heart sinks.
-Right, you can feel your heart sink.

1166
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,150
-You feel a void inside.
-Yes.

1167
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,485
Ye-rin's experiencing it
for the first time.

1168
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,114
She's starting to learn
what it means to be in love.

1169
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,325
It's okay for her to admit that she's sad.

1170
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:26,247
DAY TWO AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

1171
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,127
-You look like a snowman.
-You're Santa Girl.

1172
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,756
What's the point? I'm not going
to Lotte World Adventure like this.

1173
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,549
What are we doing today?

1174
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,635
Stargazing sounds…

1175
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,219
Stargazing would be fun,

1176
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,388
but the amusement park
overshadowed everything.

1177
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,600
It was nothing compared
to Lotte World Adventure.

1178
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,353
So is anyone going to look at the stars?

1179
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,646
Probably not.

1180
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,106
We had to submit it
by 9 a.m. this morning.

1181
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,567
-Is it past 9 a.m. already?
-Probably.

1182
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,278
-Isn't it?
-Does that mean one person lost a chance?

1183
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,404
Yes.

1184
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,865
Is that gone?

1185
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,742
That one? Yes, it's gone.

1186
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,204
LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE
OH SANG-WON

1187
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,914
STARGAZING

1188
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,015
We'll pass out after running five laps.

1189
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,561
Can you keep running?

1190
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,355
I'm the tough guy from Daegu.

1191
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,859
Let's make it back in 30 seconds.

1192
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,541
Good job.

1193
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,379
Keep it up.

1194
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,507
Come on.

1195
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,466
You can do it.

1196
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,139
It's only the morning.

1197
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,724
This is too much.

1198
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,183
Nice.

1199
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,104
Great workout, guys.

1200
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,105
Good job.

1201
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,400
The sky is so clear today.

1202
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,943
The weather's so nice.

1203
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,653
Perfect weather for Lotte World.

1204
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,030
Right. You're going
to Lotte World Adventure today.

1205
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,032
Can you film a vlog?

1206
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,367
When are you leaving?

1207
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,119
I heard we're leaving at 8 p.m.

1208
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,037
That's very late.

1209
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,832
Did you tell Ye-rin
what you told me earlier?

1210
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,710
I did in front of the fire yesterday,
didn't I?

1211
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,003
You did.

1212
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,047
When I came back,
I felt something strange in the air.

1213
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:40,965
Really?

1214
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:44,302
I couldn't tell what was on Ye-rin's mind.

1215
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,098
It's not like things got awkward
between me and Ye-rin.

1216
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:54,520
But I had no idea Se-yeon felt that way,
and I just found out.

1217
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,438
I was surprised.

1218
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,064
Right. I was surprised too.

1219
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,317
-But…
-Yes?

1220
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,152
you're the only guy I can talk to

1221
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,613
among the boys.

1222
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:07,200
-That means you're clearly not into me.
-No!

1223
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,036
That's not true.
Why do you think I gave you the book?

1224
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,163
I enjoy listening to other people.

1225
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,334
What do the boys talk about?

1226
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,877
Does Se-yeon ever talk about me?

1227
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,922
Answer me honestly.

1228
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,048
Se-yeon…

1229
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,926
He didn't tell me.
I heard it from someone else.

1230
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,596
There are people Se-yeon's interested in,

1231
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,097
and you're one of them.

1232
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,102
I'm grateful to Se-yeon.

1233
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,940
So, until now, I liked him the most.

1234
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:44,070
But there was nothing
between me and Pyeong-seok.

1235
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,156
I want to get to know Pyeong-seok.

1236
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,282
Right.

1237
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,161
I'm not sure if I should
go on the dream date

1238
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,413
with Pyeong-seok or Se-yeon.

1239
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,708
If I go with Pyeong-seok, I'm afraid
it'll drive Se-yeon away from me.

1240
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,876
That's true.

1241
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:03,047
When you ask someone
go to on a dream date with you,

1242
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,757
it means a lot.

1243
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,885
I want to go
with both Se-yeon and Pyeong-seok.

1244
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,804
I want to go so badly with them.

1245
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,265
And…

1246
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,770
But if I choose to go with one of them,

1247
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,814
I can't go with the other.

1248
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,023
That's how I see it.

1249
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,609
So, are you saying
if you ask one of them first,

1250
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,445
the other one won't ask you?

1251
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,530
That can happen.

1252
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,784
If Se-yeon asked someone else
to go on a dream date with him,

1253
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,411
I wouldn't ask him.

1254
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,954
-Right.
-He can go with someone else,

1255
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,664
but if he does, I won't ask him.

1256
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,541
I hear you. To be honest,

1257
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,836
I wanted someone to ask me
to go on a dream date with me.

1258
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,297
I would feel upset if Seo-hyeon
asked someone else out.

1259
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,798
I mean, of course I'd be upset.

1260
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:46,799
But…

1261
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,844
But you'd rather go with someone you want?

1262
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,680
Of course. I can't help it.

1263
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:56,058
I always put myself first.

1264
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,103
But I care
about what others think too much.

1265
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,689
You don't have to worry
about others so much

1266
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,149
when it comes to your feelings.

1267
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,943
You shouldn't feel hurt
from being considerate.

1268
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,778
That's what I think.

1269
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,702
No one will know how you feel
unless you say it.

1270
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,455
Just hoping that someone
will know is selfish.

1271
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,126
Just follow what your heart says.

1272
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,253
You're right.

1273
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,213
I don't know.

1274
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:34,889
After talking to Sang-won, I was
even more confused about my feelings.

1275
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,349
Se-yeon is too complex.

1276
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,727
And I don't know
how to approach Pyeong-seok.

1277
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,774
Let's have strawberries.

1278
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,150
Let's have strawberries.

1279
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,487
Ji-min, that's so colorful.

1280
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,198
What's up with the color?

1281
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,241
-We have matching outfits.
-Really?

1282
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,910
Yes, we're matching.

1283
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,122
-That looks so good.
-That looks so good.

1284
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,290
Let's eat!

1285
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,960
-This is really good.
-It's sweet.

1286
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,797
Ji-min, did you pass out last night?

1287
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,009
I was dead tired yesterday.

1288
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,470
I just watched YouTube videos in my room.

1289
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,888
He was watching YouTube alone.

1290
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,100
Why is that making me feel sad?

1291
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,017
What?

1292
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,020
After my conversation with Ji-min,

1293
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,105
I felt so…

1294
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,524
I can relate to him.

1295
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,986
Did you have
a deep conversation last night?

1296
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,945
Yes.

1297
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,071
When?

1298
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,197
-What?
-When?

1299
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,574
What do you mean? You were there too.

1300
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,121
You and I should talk today.

1301
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,664
Okay.

1302
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,669
Never mind.

1303
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,588
Never mind.

1304
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,341
Nothing happened.

1305
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,765
-Is this okay?
-I've never been here before.

1306
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,059
Last time, I talked to Ye-rin in here.

1307
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,769
Really? What did you talk about?

1308
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,771
-That I can't tell you.
-Oh, sorry.

1309
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,482
-Okay. Let's talk.
-Sure.

1310
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:10,651
Okay.

1311
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,946
I want to go on the dream date with you.

1312
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,449
If I ask you, will you say yes?

1313
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,021
