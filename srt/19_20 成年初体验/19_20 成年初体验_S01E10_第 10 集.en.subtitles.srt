00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
SE-YEON

00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,022
JUNG-YUN

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
SEO-HYEON

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,528
SANG-WON

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
HEE-JI

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
JI-MIN

00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,118
YE-RIN

PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,638
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,143
SEO-YEONG & SANG-WON'S DREAM DATE

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,650
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,652
It's exciting to have the theater
to ourselves.

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,404
Yeah, this is exciting.

16
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,908
There it is.

17
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,328
Awesome.

18
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,579
It's luxurious.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,001
This is quite fancy.

20
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,468
This is great.

21
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,888
-It's nice. Let's have some popcorn.
-That looks good.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,723
Caramel popcorn is the best.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,268
What genre do you like? Oh, it's starting.

24
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,489
Here, put your name down
and your birthday and…

25
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,282
The pager number.

26
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,077
You get a free video
if you give them your pager number.

27
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,205
-That's exciting.
-That's how you get a guy's number?

28
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,458
They can talk
because they're the only ones there.

29
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,626
-Right.
-You're right.

30
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,169
-Nice.
-They can talk while watching.

31
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,088
-It's like watching at home.
-Right.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,799
Your voice is pretty.

33
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,137
That's way too sweet.

34
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,514
It's going to give me cavities.

35
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,807
I know.

36
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,189
Hey.

37
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,993
Are they fighting over her?

38
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,078
I saw this scene somewhere.

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,747
Not this movie,
but I think I've seen this scene.

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,374
At the house.

41
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,257
First of all, it was really cool that
we had the whole theater to ourselves.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,302
It was nice, just as I expected.

43
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:02,223
I think it was more enjoyable
because we were able to talk freely

44
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,728
about what we were feeling or thinking
while watching.

45
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,231
-This place has a nice vibe.
-Yeah.

46
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,692
-So pretty.
-How can this be so pretty?

47
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,820
What did you think of our date today?

48
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,323
-It was fun.
-Yeah.

49
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,533
I think we get along pretty well.

50
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,620
We get along better than I expected.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,288
To be honest,

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,500
if you're okay with it,
I want to go on another date with you.

53
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,045
-I'd be honored. Anytime.
-Good.

54
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,380
Seo-yeong's very bold.

55
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,382
-She really is.
-Yeah.

56
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,428
To be honest,
I have a lot of questions for you.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,432
Okay. Ask away.

58
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,102
Who do you like and in what order?

59
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,188
In order?

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,023
To tell you the truth,

61
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:57,195
I've been only certain about my
number one. I'm not sure about the rest.

62
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,864
-You know who my number one is.
-Seo-hyeon?

63
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,075
It's obvious. But other than her…

64
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,702
What about you?

65
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,828
-Me?
-Yes.

66
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,373
Can you guess?

67
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:13,127
-You can be honest.
-To be honest, I was surprised.

68
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,547
When you asked me out yesterday,
I was caught off guard.

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,299
-It did?
-The thing is,

70
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,343
I never got the feeling

71
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,847
that you were trying
to get to know me better.

72
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,225
-Right.
-Yeah, so…

73
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,479
-To tell you the truth,
-Yeah.

74
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,776
I thought about it after talking to
the other girls. I realized,

75
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,989
"Sang-won is the one who I felt the most
comfortable with during my stay here."

76
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,199
-Yeah, I realized that.
-Right.

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,910
Compared to the others,

78
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:53,042
I didn't have to worry and try so hard
to make conversation with you.

79
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,586
So that's why?

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,425
Yeah. So I wanted to get to know you more
and get closer.

81
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,386
But it seemed like you were closer
with somebody else,

82
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,055
so I didn't really have a chance.

83
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,474
-Oh, right.
-Then I mustered up the courage.

84
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,563
Don't you think

85
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm quite honest?

86
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm seeing a different side of you today.

87
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,072
-In a good way.
-In a good way?

88
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,490
That's good.

89
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,410
I've never tried pickled tomato before.

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,330
-I like tomatoes.
-Me too.

91
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,296
Tomatoes could taste like this?

92
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,422
It's so good.

93
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,758
This is the best dish
I've eaten on a date so far.

94
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,468
-I mean, I've only been on one.
-Right.

95
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,802
But this is the best.

96
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,679
I'm glad to hear that.

97
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,641
That means it's number one.
That's not so bad.

98
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,060
Yeah, you're number one.

99
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,438
How does it feel to be number one?

100
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,733
I'm honored.

101
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,320
You are so funny.

102
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,615
-This is good.
-I know.

103
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,118
I don't think I can say that
I fully enjoyed the date.

104
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,746
I was feeling a bit uncomfortable.

105
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,458
Seo-yeong knows that I have feelings
for somebody else.

106
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,252
I don't want to go on dates with her
while I'm feeling that way.

107
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:23,132
I want to talk to her more,
but I don't want to go on another date.

108
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,760
-Makes sense.
-Really?

109
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,305
Before when Sang-won talked about
the type of people he dislikes,

110
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,391
he said it was people
who make him confused.

111
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,768
I guess Sang-won

112
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,645
-was uncomfortable.
-Yeah, he was.

113
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,771
That might be it.

114
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,106
Do you think

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,776
Seo-yeong is too late?

116
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,319
Relationships are formed already.

117
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,320
You never know.

118
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,572
So many things happen in a single day.

119
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,824
-You never know.
-Right.

120
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
Now I don't trust anything.

121
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,459
-This is crazy.
-I love it.

122
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,545
Wait. I'm shocked.

123
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,587
What? You're cold?

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,964
No, I said I'm shocked.

125
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,174
By how pretty this is.

126
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,594
It's so pretty.

127
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,348
-Isn't it nice and comfortable?
-Totally.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,353
-There's something I'm worried about.
-Yes?

129
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,524
Sang-won and I were
in the Room of Truth, and…

130
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,776
-Did you talk?
-Yes.

131
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,778
He was like, I'm the only…

132
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,196
He wants?

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,740
Yes. That's pretty much what he said.

134
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,036
Really? He's really eloquent
and good at expressing his feelings.

135
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,913
So I just feel confused.

136
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,042
-I want to get to know everyone.
-Right.

137
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,715
But I can see that he has been feeling
this way for me since the very start.

138
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,758
In my opinion,

139
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,639
it's obvious that Sang-won likes you.

140
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,310
But it seems like you became
too comfortable with him.

141
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm also not sure if this is a
friendship or romance.

142
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,360
I think I'll know how I really feel
after going on dates with other guys.

143
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,779
The difference between the way
I feel about Sang-won

144
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,327
and how I feel
when I'm on a date with other guys.

145
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,414
I have a lot on my mind tonight.

146
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,668
I wish everyone would stop worrying

147
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,879
and just be happy.

148
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,215
-But we all have so many problems.
-For sure.

149
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,800
-We all do.
-We all have so much on our minds.

150
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,344
I don't have any, though.

151
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,262
I can tell.

152
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,847
You guys are so cute.

153
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,432
-What?
-I mean it.

154
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,645
Now that the no-dating rule is lifted,
it's like you guys are really dating.

155
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,315
I feel like the two of you will go on
a dream date together,

156
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,442
then not go on a dream date
with anybody else.

157
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,279
What about you?
Who do you want to go with?

158
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,990
For the dream date?
I was thinking Jung-yun.

159
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,826
Jung-yun?

160
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,703
This is unexpected.

161
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,748
It's fun hanging out with Jung-yun.

162
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,959
-You bicker, but it's still fun, right?
-Yes.

163
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,460
-Right?
-Yes.

164
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,840
It's fun when I'm with Jung-yun.

165
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,509
I feel more comfortable too.

166
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:17,848
I felt that way yesterday and today.
I think we got closer.

167
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:24,188
If there's a dream date I want to go on,
I want to go with Jung-yun.

168
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,149
Jung-yun's popularity is rising.

169
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,693
Funny people are popular.

170
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,529
Seo-hyeon looks very comfortable
around Jung-yun.

171
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,947
And she becomes playful.

172
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,534
She looked different
when she was with Sang-won.

173
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,328
It can be hard to tell
if you like him or his humor.

174
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,039
I have to ask him before midnight.

175
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,624
Should I do it now?

176
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,795
Wait.

177
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,384
He's sleeping.

178
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,678
He's fast asleep.

179
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,556
-Is he alone?
-Yes.

180
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,561
I need to talk to him.

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,398
Go. I'll wait for you in the room.

182
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey!

183
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,790
Jung-yun.

184
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,723
How come no one's here?

185
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,567
Got some sleep?

186
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,485
Yeah.

187
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,571
-What about Seo-hyeon?
-She got up just now.

188
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,871
-She said she has something to say to you.
-Me?

189
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,456
She said she tried to wake you up.

190
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,962
She tried to wake you up,
but you were fast asleep. She couldn't.

191
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,464
Good job, Hee-ji.

192
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,425
-Hee-ji helps them a lot.
-I wish she was my friend.

193
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
Are you inside?

194
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,556
What?

195
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,141
Were you trying to wake me up?

196
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,185
-Yes.
-Why?

197
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,145
-Do you have plans for tomorrow?
-No.

198
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,063
Nothing?

199
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,314
No, nothing tomorrow.

200
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,066
Nothing? Tomorrow?

201
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,528
Do you want to go on a dream date
or a casual date?

202
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,445
What?

203
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,030
Let's go on a dream date or a casual…

204
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,032
-With you?
-What do you think?

205
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,659
-I have nothing tomorrow.
-Nothing?

206
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,744
-Are you down?
-Sure.

207
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,163
Okay. Let me put makeup on first.

208
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,290
Did you just get up?

209
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,459
A while ago. About 20 minutes ago.

210
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,919
I just got up.

211
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,463
You came over to say that?

212
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,381
Yes.

213
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:59,802
I knocked on the door
and kept calling you.

214
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,638
-I passed out like this.
-You didn't wake up.

215
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,348
-Yeah.
-Who told you?

216
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,349
Hee-ji.

217
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,687
Okay.

218
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,821
Hee-ji…

219
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,868
-Nice shot, Hee-ji.
-Yes.

220
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,119
Nice shot, Hee-ji.

221
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,538
She's talked about it since school.

222
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,456
Right.

223
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,876
She said she wanted to
get to know everyone.

224
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,629
She's finally getting to know someone
other than Sang-won.

225
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,715
I'm getting a good feeling about them.

226
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,175
Me, too.

227
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,801
Things are getting messy.

228
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,053
-Let it get messy!
-It's getting interesting.

229
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,763
Just let it get tangled and messy!

230
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,390
Were you bored?

231
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,308
Yes.

232
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,768
Seriously.

233
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
I was really bored.

234
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,272
Where did you go?

235
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,440
A comic book cafe.

236
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,524
A comic book cafe?

237
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,526
We really didn't do anything.

238
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,069
You didn't do anything?

239
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,489
We just sat there super seriously.

240
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,451
I want to go on a dream date.

241
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,286
It's time for something big.

242
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,121
It's about time.

243
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,415
Lotte World Adventure was too impressive.

244
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,292
I think it was.

245
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,502
Right?

246
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,845
That hair looks good on you.

247
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,976
You can meet my eyes now.

248
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,074
I want to draw something here.

249
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,494
Do you want to? Let's go.

250
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,371
Really?

251
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,665
It's going to be fun.

252
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,710
Where do you want to sit? Here?

253
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,130
This room is very big.

254
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,049
Right, it's for five people.

255
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,057
Let's do this.

256
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,667
You have really long eyelashes.

257
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,670
Wait…

258
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,223
Where did…

259
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,933
Where did they go? The basement?

260
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,314
You must be cold.

261
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,024
Bathroom.

262
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,321
-They're here.
-Who?

263
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,530
The ones that went on a date.

264
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,407
Is it Sang-won?

265
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
No, it's Se-yeon.

266
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,743
I'm too lazy to go out.

267
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,669
Where on earth is he?

268
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,425
Where is he? Where…

269
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,929
-What?
-Come here.

270
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,809
Are my clothes too dark?

271
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,811
No, they look good on you.

272
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,813
Thanks.

273
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
Have a seat here.

274
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,533
It's messy here.

275
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,165
Did you have fun on the date?

276
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,587
The date? We didn't do much
other than eating dinner.

277
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,674
It was nice to eat something good.

278
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,259
You can be honest.

279
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,095
It was nice to eat something good.

280
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,141
So when are we going on a date?

281
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,103
When do you want to go?

282
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,980
Do you want to go?

283
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,524
We should. Then we can talk a lot.

284
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,695
It'll be nice to go out

285
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,864
and grab something good.

286
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,118
I'm contemplating.
Who I should go on the dream…

287
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm curious about you.
I don't know what's on your mind.

288
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,334
I just want to know
who you want to go on a dream date with.

289
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,544
I see.

290
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,338
I want to make the decision carefully.

291
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,216
Going on a dream date is special.
But for me,

292
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,470
I think what's more important is to go on
the date with someone I want to go with.

293
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,141
That's why I'm going to choose carefully.

294
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,934
-You…
-What?

295
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,396
You've changed so much.

296
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,189
What?

297
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,611
She's cute.

298
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,780
What?

299
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,995
Well…

300
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,329
You've changed.

301
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,248
I'm disappointed.

302
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,254
See? You're not even looking at my eyes.

303
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,922
-I can't.
-You keep…

304
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,633
-How can I look at you when you say that?
-You keep…

305
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,052
I… You…

306
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,596
-You keep pushing me away.
-Okay, so…

307
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,523
I wasn't going to care
about you getting to know other girls.

308
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,652
I tried not to, but I can't help it.

309
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
How about you?

310
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,365
Do you not feel jealous?

311
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:02,664
After I talked to you last time,
I've been trying to be more careful.

312
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,211
Honestly, I could get to know
other people. But I…

313
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm just being careful right now.

314
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:20,933
I just wanted to talk things out
with Se-yeon as soon as possible.

315
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,269
But he gave me very vague answers.

316
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,480
His answers were unclear.

317
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,109
He was being so cold. It feels like…

318
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,237
we are drifting apart.

319
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,534
You're so good at it.

320
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:44,832
I'm back.

321
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,208
Hey.

322
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
You're so late.

323
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,592
Did you watch six movies or something?

324
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,344
You're home so late.

325
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,596
That's funny.

326
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,223
That doesn't feel so bad.

327
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,516
What doesn't?

328
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,726
-Seeing you react like that.
-What?

329
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,437
Do you have plans tomorrow?

330
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,232
I probably do.

331
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,608
-You do?
-Yes.

332
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,653
All right. You're busy.

333
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,696
What?

334
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,907
I should do something.
I stayed home and did nothing today.

335
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,826
I was home today,
so I should go out tomorrow.

336
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,452
I was going to ask you
to stay home with me.

337
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,538
-Who are you going with?
-What?

338
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,206
-Who?
-I don't know.

339
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,880
Well,

340
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,176
-What?
-I want to talk to more people.

341
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,052
That way, I can…

342
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,013
But…

343
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,140
I can make up my mind.

344
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,809
Even after all that,
I hope that you pick me.

345
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,103
Right. That way, it's easier…

346
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,522
-What? What did you say?
-What?

347
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,608
-You didn't hear me?
-I did, but…

348
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,487
I don't know how you feel right now,
but even after your other dates,

349
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,239
I wish…

350
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,949
I wish you'd still choose me.

351
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,416
After hearing that…

352
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,379
I thought that was a bit too much.

353
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,759
I had no chance to spend time

354
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,511
with anyone else.

355
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,056
I've never gone on a date
with anyone else.

356
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,519
Since I am in that situation, I think
I was caught off guard when he said,

357
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,522
"I hope you'll still choose me
in the end."

358
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,026
-Goodness.
-What now?

359
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,611
Then why was she jealous?

360
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,947
-I don't think she was that jealous.
-She wasn't.

361
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,448
She was just being nice.

362
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,617
Really? You get jealous just to be nice?

363
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,035
She was being nice.

364
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,247
No wonder Sang-won is confused.

365
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,625
Yes. I don't think he'll catch on
to what's going on right now.

366
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,876
-He won't.
-Exactly.

367
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,797
I'll sit there.

368
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,048
Yes.

369
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,341
I'm going for it today.

370
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,346
Okay.

371
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,598
These guys…

372
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,851
I'm just going to watch.

373
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,229
You have to grab with your right hand.

374
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,981
Hey, look at them.

375
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,274
They are so ready.

376
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,900
What? I won't be able to get it.

377
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,235
-Sit down.
-Sit down.

378
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,323
Everyone, I'm going to sit back and watch.

379
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,993
This is all about who sits closest.

380
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,663
You need to sit close to it.

381
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,249
-You need to come 20 minutes earlier.
-You're all going to lose.

382
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,167
-Right.
-If you do that…

383
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,128
What are you doing?

384
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,463
Should I hide the pen?

385
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,381
Yes.

386
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,841
We'll still get it.

387
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,884
-How?
-I can beat Ji-min easily.

388
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,429
-I'll throw him on the floor.
-Hey!

389
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,973
-Hey.
-What?

390
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,350
-What are you doing?
-What!

391
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,268
Hey, sit down.

392
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,729
-It was right there, but it's gone now.
-What?

393
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,730
It's gone.

394
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,648
Hey, it's my lip balm.

395
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,317
I'll erase everything.

396
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,571
-You can't play like this.
-This is not fair.

397
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,614
-Come on.
-Busted.

398
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,700
Are you hiding it in your sock?

399
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,327
You're putting it in your sock?

400
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,870
-Oh, come on.
-I can see you.

401
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,039
It's behind his ear.

402
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,292
Oh, Jung-yun!

403
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,586
-What time is it?
-Now?

404
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,503
It's 11:55 p.m.

405
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,963
-It's 11:55 p.m.?
-It's 56 now.

406
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,467
-Let's not act like kids. Be a gentleman.
-Right. We're adults now.

407
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,218
I've never seen Jung-yun sitting up front.

408
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,057
-It's funny how Pyeong-seok's doing that.
-Hey, let's be gentlemen.

409
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,808
Have a duel like gentlemen.

410
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,061
Do you want to write letters
to each other?

411
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,645
-What?
-Want to write letters?

412
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,235
DREAM DATES:
TRIP TO BUSAN, TRIP TO GYEONGJU

413
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,447
TRIP TO BUSAN

414
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,659
TRIP TO GYEONGJU

415
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,454
-Busan? Let's go!
-Let's go.

416
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,289
-Go.
-Don't miss it.

417
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,125
-It'll be an all-day trip.
-Don't miss it.

418
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,710
-Yes, if it's that far.
-They should go.

419
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,299
-No.
-Sit down.

420
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,510
-Are you in? What?
-No.

421
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,512
-Sit down.
-I'm the host. Sit down.

422
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,639
-Back in your seats.
-He says he's the host.

423
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,390
Hurry up and sit down.

424
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,558
I like them both.

425
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,811
That's crazy.

426
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,562
Now, the trip to Gyeongju.

427
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,480
That's awesome.

428
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,982
-Don't you write your name.
-Anyone for Gyeongju?

429
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,320
So, who wants the trip to Gyeongju?

430
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,823
Anyone down for the trip to Gyeongju?

431
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,283
Trip to Gyeongju.

432
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,660
Trip to Busan?

433
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,246
Busan?

434
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,707
Let's come back in 30 minutes.

435
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah, let's do that.

436
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,213
There might be people
who haven't reached an agreement yet.

437
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,341
-Then now…
-This is tough.

438
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,677
-It takes four to five hours.
-Yeah. To Busan.

439
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,471
-Are you not interested?
-I will…

440
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,723
I'll stay here.

441
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,902
You might ride a helicopter.

442
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,779
-A plane?
-That's possible.

443
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,364
A plane?

444
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,076
Where's the pen? Who has the pen?

445
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,956
Sit down.

446
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,041
-What do you prefer?
-Me?

447
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,376
I like both.

448
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,128
The one that…

449
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,672
Are we going on a dream date tomorrow?

450
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,590
Yes.

451
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,717
Where do you want to go?

452
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,844
-What?
-Where do you want to go?

453
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,596
Wanna go?

454
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,889
I'm not sure.

455
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,433
-But they all like it.
-I know.

456
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,480
Should we let them go?

457
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,441
Should we?

458
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm fine with either one.

459
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,950
Isn't Busan better?

460
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,118
Four hours by car?

461
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,370
-It's going to take all day.
-Right.

462
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,914
How are we getting there?

463
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,916
Let's see what our competitors do first.

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,127
But it seems no one has
reached an agreement yet.

465
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,811
He's hesitating because Ji-woo's watching.

466
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,814
But at this point, if Jung-yun goes…

467
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,360
Ji-woo's probably experiencing emotions
she's never felt before.

468
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,196
Ji-woo wanted Jung-yun
to make himself clear.

469
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,699
He probably shouldn't go.

470
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,077
Where do you want to go?

471
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,622
Are you going to write your name?

472
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,915
-Yes.
-Okay.

473
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,251
-You can just come with me.
-I can?

474
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,002
-You don't want to?
-I just need to go?

475
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,672
You could use your ticket later.

476
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,090
Right.

477
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,523
Both will be tough schedule-wise.

478
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,275
Let's hurry up.

479
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,111
Write your names and go to bed
if you're going tomorrow.

480
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,993
This is a dream date, so…

481
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,209
-You're sad, aren't you?
-I am.

482
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,628
I was…

483
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,547
-I feel like crying.
-Me too.

484
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,341
I was surprised.

485
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,013
Why is this place making me feel so…

486
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,646
I was surprised too.

487
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,775
-That's not it.
-I…

488
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,364
I'm not crying because of anyone.

489
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,367
This place is just so tough.
You know what I mean?

490
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,661
I don't know what they want.

491
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,289
Oh, no.

492
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,751
Oh, no.

493
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,586
I mean…

494
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,340
Do you know what really hurt my feelings?

495
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,467
What?

496
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,218
-What is it?
-I…

497
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,722
When I said I wanted to go,

498
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,891
he wasn't that…

499
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,809
I think I'm going to cry.

500
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,771
He was never that enthusiastic.

501
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,024
But he was sitting up front today.
So I thought

502
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,736
he sat there for me.

503
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,407
I couldn't believe my eyes.

504
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,702
-Them talking about where to go?
-Yeah.

505
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,086
Where's everyone?

506
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,755
They all left.
Ye-rin and Ji-woo went in there.

507
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,382
Are they talking?

508
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,842
-I don't know.
-Why?

509
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,095
I don't know.

510
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,015
I don't know.
I'm giving up my graduation for this.

511
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,642
-You're right.
-You're right.

512
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,019
-What are you doing?
-What?

513
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,397
-What are you doing?
-It's a secret mission.

514
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,357
-It's a strategy meeting.
-What strategy?

515
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,817
Are you two going together?

516
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,652
-Yes.
-Yes?

517
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,698
What? What's so funny?

518
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,784
-You two?
-Yeah!

519
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,328
-What?
-What?

520
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,122
-What?
-What?

521
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,582
-What's so funny?
-What?

522
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,793
-That's hilarious!
-What?

523
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,004
-What?
-What?

524
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,006
-What?
-What?

525
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,427
-There must be a reason.
-Tell me about it.

526
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,594
What should I…

527
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,811
You know, I feel so hurt.

528
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,524
Why is he being so frustrating?

529
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,026
Not just him, but…

530
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,320
But we have to miss our graduation.

531
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,574
-Mine's on the 6th, so I'm not going.
-Are you going?

532
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,409
So I'm thinking.

533
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,411
What's wrong?

534
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,955
You look like a sad duckling.

535
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,332
Something must be troubling you.

536
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,086
Graduation…

537
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,422
Graduation…

538
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,466
Then you can't go, Ji-min.

539
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,800
Whether it be Busan or Gyeongju.

540
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,801
Me?

541
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,929
I'm in between.
Should I miss my graduation or not?

542
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,975
If I go to Busan, I'll miss it.

543
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm going to sit here.

544
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,482
-Do you want to go upstairs?
-Sure.

545
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,943
-I've thought about it a lot.
-Okay.

546
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,654
I've thought about it so much.

547
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,157
Ji-woo and I had
a serious conversation before, right?

548
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,328
I asked Ji-woo if she'd go on a date
with me if I ask her.

549
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,413
She said yes.

550
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,874
But I've thought about it.

551
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,253
I want to go with you.

552
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,923
-With me?
-Yes.

553
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,428
-Let's go.
-Yes, go!

554
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,597
I want to go with you.

555
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,558
-With me?
-Yes.

556
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,852
So if I ask you, would you go?

557
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,648
-Of course.
-Will you?

558
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,485
If I'm being honest,
I like you the most right now.

559
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,446
Yeah, so…

560
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,741
-Why are you crying?
-I can't stop it.

561
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,496
Don't cry.

562
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,873
I'm going with you.

563
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,750
I saw some tissues around here.

564
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,389
Thank you.

565
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,851
Why are you crying? Let's sit here.

566
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
Are you okay?

567
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,230
Why are you crying?

568
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,524
-I don't know.
-What?

569
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,733
I don't know.

570
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,323
Cry all you want.

571
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,827
We can talk after you calm down.

572
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,415
This is perfect timing.

573
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,834
That's perfect timing.

574
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,385
Don't cry.

575
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,180
The stairs.

576
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,850
Don't come up here.

577
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,811
-Are you talking up there?
-Go back. Don't come up here.

578
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,232
-Good job.
-Ji-min!

579
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,151
That's the best scene ever.

580
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,944
-So cool.
-"Don't come up here."

581
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,738
-"Don't come up."
-"Don't come up."

582
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,744
-How does Gyeongju sound?
-What?

583
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,203
Are you okay with Gyeongju?

584
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,955
-I'm fine with it.
-Are you?

585
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,917
Could you tell me why you're crying?

586
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,419
-Why I'm crying?
-Yes.

587
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,671
It's just that

588
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,966
I got mixed emotions.

589
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,053
I'm getting emotions
I've never felt before.

590
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,221
You know what I mean? It makes you think.

591
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,642
Just…

592
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,268
So you suddenly felt less tense?

593
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,021
Yes, and…

594
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,150
I feel bad, but also thankful.

595
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,777
Why do you feel bad?

596
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,071
It's just…

597
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,910
Did you think I'd ask Ji-woo?

598
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,666
I thought you might.

599
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,751
Because to be honest,

600
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:47,048
we did go on a date
but it was more as friends, you know.

601
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:54,263
I never thought your emotions
would change so fast in such a short time.

602
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,519
I like you more.

603
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,356
But you haven't gone out with Ji-woo.

604
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,234
You're sure you don't need to?

605
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,361
Yes, I'm sure.

606
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,906
Going with you is more fun.

607
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,953
That's why I asked you.

608
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:23,626
If you use your dream date on me, I can't
use mine on you. You know that, right?

609
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,044
It's okay.

610
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,840
I trust that you won't suddenly

611
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,759
change your mind after your dream date.

612
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,972
You're so cool, Ji-min.

613
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,348
-What?
-You're cool.

614
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,934
I trust you.

615
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,188
I felt so bad,

616
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,190
but so thankful.

617
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,484
I was still focusing on

618
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,364
Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon more.

619
00:33:54,073 --> 00:34:00,455
So I wasn't completely sure
about my feelings for Ji-min.

620
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,959
But in that situation,
I realized my true feelings.

621
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,879
And I started to like Ji-min way more.

622
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,883
-That was nice timing.
-Timing is so important in love.

623
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:16,763
Ji-min totally fell for her
after their date.

624
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,722
Totally.

625
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,058
I think Ji-min made up his mind.

626
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,351
-At first, it was Seo-yeong.
-Right.

627
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,521
-Then Ji-woo, and now it's Ye-rin.
-Then Ji-woo.

628
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,607
-But Ji-min…
-I shouldn't list them.

629
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,025
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, I shouldn't.

630
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,569
Ji-min got to know everyone.

631
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,363
-He talked with all of them.
-He was the boldest one.

632
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,741
-Yeah, he was.
-But Ji-min was

633
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,786
also comforted by Ye-rin.

634
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,206
When he was having a hard time,
Ye-rin suddenly stepped in

635
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,249
-and comforted him.
-Right.

636
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,001
-You're right.
-This time,

637
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,503
when Ye-rin's struggling,

638
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,380
-They comforted each other.
-Ji-min comforted her.

639
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,467
-I hope they make it work.
-They can support each other.

640
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,885
It could develop that way.

641
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,679
But can we do all these

642
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,681
in a day?

643
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,559
It'll be too late if we leave at six.

644
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,687
-It'll be 11. If we ride that
-It'll be 11.

645
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,148
-and get ready…
-Have dinner there…

646
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,067
It's going to be exactly 24 hours.

647
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,485
One full day.

648
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,320
When we get back, it's basically…

649
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,280
-It'll be like 4 a.m.
-It'd be early morning.

650
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,367
Is it okay to sleep in the next day?

651
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,121
I'm really bad at resisting sleep.

652
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,541
-Same here. I'm not sure if I can do it.
-I don't think I can get up.

653
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,627
Even getting up at nine is hard.

654
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,753
Me, too.

655
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,713
-Today, I--
-Let's talk in private.

656
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,714
In private?

657
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,759
It's too open here.

658
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,137
So funny.

659
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,680
It is.

660
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,808
All right.

661
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:46,936
Yes.

662
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,066
-Do you think you can do it?
-What?

663
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,362
-Getting up early for the date.
-I could, but you…

664
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,156
-I can't do it.
-No?

665
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,075
-If you can't, we can't go.
-Then…

666
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,786
I need to go out tomorrow.

667
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,955
-Let's go on a casual date.
-Sure.

668
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,250
-That gives us more time.
-Right.

669
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,502
-That might be more fun.
-Yes.

670
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,672
How do you feel?

671
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,716
It bugs me,

672
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,010
but there's nothing I can do.

673
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,055
I can't tell her to stay.

674
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,682
-Right.
-Yeah…

675
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,768
You just seemed quite bitter.

676
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,853
Me?

677
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
Of course I am.

678
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,065
The thing is,

679
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,401
I've been asking Seo-hyeon out, right?

680
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,528
-But she never asked me out.
-Right.

681
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,740
But this time, she asked him out first.

682
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,033
So I do feel hurt.

683
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,826
I do…

684
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,872
But it's okay. She's using her chance.

685
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,207
It makes sense.

686
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,627
It really does.

687
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,928
Wait.

688
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,221
Where are you going?

689
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,513
One second.

690
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:14,941
Jung-yun was very enthusiastic
about the dream date today.

691
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,859
-He was sitting up front too.
-Yeah.

692
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,820
-And he said all that stuff to me.
-Right.

693
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,323
So I thought he was going to go with me.

694
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,410
But he's going with Seo-hyeon.

695
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,334
-Today…
-He's never been like that for me.

696
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,518
They talked today.

697
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,062
-What? With Seo-hyeon?
-Seo-hyeon…

698
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:57,608
Seo-hyeon asked Jung-yun
to go on date with her.

699
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:02,238
She asked him about the dream date,
and I think that's why…

700
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,836
Did Se-yeon see that?

701
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,213
He must feel conflicted too.

702
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,518
What's going on?

703
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,562
What's wrong?

704
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,483
I don't like him now.

705
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,111
Why are you crying?

706
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,790
When I saw Ji-woo crying
right in front of me,

707
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,376
I was so flustered.

708
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,628
We had a nice date that evening.

709
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,965
And then to see her cry like that

710
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,637
because of what Jung-yun did,

711
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:14,769
it made me realize
that their relationship is serious.

712
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,155
-What?
-What?

713
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,740
Do you want to talk?

714
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,533
Okay.

715
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,538
-I was going to tell you something.
-Go ahead.

716
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,792
You're going on a date
with Ji-min tomorrow, right?

717
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,961
-I'm not sure about that.
-Oh, really?

718
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,879
So…

719
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,508
-But it doesn't matter.
-It's not about that.

720
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,135
-Seo-hyeon asked me.
-I don't care.

721
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,804
So,

722
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,181
since I have nothing tomorrow…

723
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,266
-Go.
-So I said yes.

724
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,352
What?

725
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,812
But…

726
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,480
I don't mind.

727
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,401
-You should go. It's Busan.
-I'm not going to Busan.

728
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,111
-So Gyeongju?
-We decided not to.

729
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,947
-I…
-You should go on a casual date, then.

730
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,532
-So that you won't be bored.
-So…

731
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,075
Hey…

732
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,035
Have a seat.

733
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,663
-Sit down.
-Okay.

734
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,127
-It's nothing like that.
-It's okay.

735
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,837
Why tell me all this?

736
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,215
-Are you saying I shouldn't?
-Yes.

737
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,508
-I shouldn't?
-No.

738
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,262
Because I'm a bit annoyed.

739
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,518
You're going to make me cry.

740
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,186
-Wait.
-This is so annoying.

741
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,188
Come back. Where are you going?

742
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,441
I don't want to. Just give me a second.

743
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,609
-You don't want to talk?
-I don't want to.

744
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,611
-What?
-I don't want to now.

745
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,529
Ji-woo…

746
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,907
Where are you going?

747
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,187
Everything's messed up.

748
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,522
I think they'll still go.

749
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,193
Seo-hyeon and Jung-yun.

750
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,112
I wonder what Jung-yun's thinking.

751
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,869
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

752
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,330
-I'll go comfort her.
-Okay.

753
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,002
Are you done?

754
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,509
Take me home.

755
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,594
-Why?
-Take me home.

756
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,890
-You know what's funny though?
-What?

757
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,394
I feel like they're playing with me.

758
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,312
Why?

759
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,359
I mean, then he shouldn't have

760
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,861
made it sound like he liked me.

761
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,656
It's so mean.

762
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,660
I just wanted to enjoy my time here.

763
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,372
-I know.
-But they messed with my feelings and…

764
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,506
Right.

765
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,633
I get it.

766
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,095
If I were him, I would've been like,
"We should go."

767
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,597
That's what he should've said.

768
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,892
He tried to explain it to me.

769
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,520
What did he say?

770
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,106
I don't know.
He said they were going to go,

771
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,691
then they decided not to go.

772
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,444
They're going on a casual date,
not the dream date.

773
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,238
Why would he even tell me that?

774
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,784
That's not the reason why I feel so hurt.

775
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,084
What am I doing?

776
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,837
What am I doing here?

777
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,299
My makeup is all gone.

778
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,426
I'm just going to go to sleep like this.

779
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,935
Did you decide to go? Not yet?

780
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,437
We're not going.

781
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,398
It seems Ye-rin's going with Ji-min.

782
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,816
Yes, they both agreed.

783
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
So…

784
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,280
I can't understand Jung-yun.

785
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:41,452
From this point on, I don't even want
to expect anything from him.

786
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,456
She changed her mind just like that?

787
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,126
Probably not.
She's just emotional right now.

788
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,878
So about Ji-woo…

789
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,423
Have you ever seen someone
look that cute when crying?

790
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,466
No, never.

791
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,675
You're good at copying her.

792
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,053
Yes. That's how she cried.

793
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,598
And Hee-ji comforted her.

794
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,600
-Here's the thing.
-He's not proactive.

795
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:11,690
She really wanted him to act that way
to her, but he did that to another girl.

796
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,692
She was disappointed by that.

797
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,986
I bet she's never been jealous
of anyone before.

798
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,281
-She's getting jealous because she's here.
-Yes.

799
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,951
It seems she can't accept
the fact that she's jealous.

800
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,828
That's why she can't express herself well.

801
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,289
-I bet it's her first time being jealous.
-Yeah.

802
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,209
-This is crazy.
-A storm in brewing.

803
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,378
-This is before the actual date.
-I didn't expect

804
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,797
-this whirlwind of emotions.
-If we're feeling this way,

805
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,590
just imagine how they must be feeling.

806
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,384
Why did Ye-rin cry?

807
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,178
-Did she? Why?
-I think she did. Her eyes were red.

808
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,972
Probably because she can finally relax.

809
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,059
She started crying after I asked her
to go on the dream date.

810
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,436
-So I'm going on the date with Ye-rin.
-Okay.

811
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,563
-Tomorrow?
-We're going, no matter what.

812
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,857
I'm giving up my graduation.

813
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,818
-What?
-I want to…

814
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,405
-You said you were going with Ji-woo.
-I want to focus on Ye-rin.

815
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,616
-You decided not to go with her?
-I'm not going with Ji-woo.

816
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,040
I just want to cry.

817
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,793
Jung-yun, what happened?
I don't know what's going on.

818
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,295
Why go on a date with Seo-hyeon now?

819
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,714
I have nothing tomorrow,
so I was like, "Okay."

820
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,050
Then…

821
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,803
That's what happened.

822
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,097
Ji-woo's going to her graduation tomorrow.

823
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,057
It's not tomorrow. It's the 6th.

824
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,517
-Really?
-Yeah.

825
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,602
-Her graduation?
-She's probably free tomorrow.

826
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,603
I had no idea.

827
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,397
I had absolutely no idea.

828
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,274
Right.

829
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,818
-I mean--
-Seriously.

830
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,862
Thinking about it gives me a headache.

831
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,905
Honestly, we should all be selfish.

832
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,366
Right. You should follow your heart.

833
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,453
Why care about what others think?
Just think about yourself.

834
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:54,001
To be honest, just a few minutes
before the dream date reveal,

835
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,961
-I was talking to Ye-rin.
-I saw.

836
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,213
What did she say?

837
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,216
She…

838
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,679
-I can't say it because Ji-min's here.
-It's okay.

839
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,764
-Just say it.
-Ye-rin…

840
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,226
expressed her disappointment.

841
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,811
But I didn't say a lot to her,

842
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,608
because I don't know how I feel yet.
So I kind of gave ambiguous answers.

843
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,778
But she's now going with Ji-min.

844
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
I was confused.

845
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,535
Everything was confusing.

846
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,832
Everyone needs to talk more.

847
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,585
Who do you need to talk to now?

848
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,587
-I went on a date with Ye-rin, right?
-Yeah.

849
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,258
-She asked me to go on a dream date.
-You asked?

850
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,260
-No, she asked me.
-So did you say yes?

851
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,596
-I told her to think about it.
-Right.

852
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,973
She shouldn't be hasty with her decision.

853
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,841
What's on your mind?

854
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,683
I wanted to know why she felt bad.

855
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,352
-She said she felt bad.
-Ye-rin?

856
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,022
She said she felt bad
and cried when I asked her.

857
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,441
-Now I get why she felt bad.
-Why?

858
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:46,655
She asked you, and she asked Pyeong-seok
to go on a dream date with her.

859
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,784
When I heard about what she did,

860
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,078
-I felt betrayed.
-Right.

861
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,708
I made myself clear to her,
but after talking to you guys…

862
00:47:59,001 --> 00:47:59,835
I…

863
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,470
-This is crazy. It's so frustrating.
-It's like a drama.

864
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,348
-My goodness. Ji-min is the sad duck now.
-No.

865
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,643
He said he felt betrayed.

866
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,647
What's your opinion
as a person in the same boat?

867
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,358
-In the same boat?
-I mean, as a guy.

868
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,235
We're not in the same boat.

869
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,112
-Do you think you'd feel betrayed?
-I think

870
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,948
-I might feel betrayed.
-Not that much.

871
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:34,870
He made the decision to go all in.

872
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,582
But he found out Ye-rin had asked everyone
else to go on a dream date with her.

873
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,084
It's been 30 minutes since he said
he'd go all in.

874
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,047
Well, I think Ji-min's taking it too fast.

875
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,591
He feels betrayed for those 30 minutes.

876
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,092
This is like Pandora's box.

877
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,762
-It was best not to know.
-Right.

878
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:57,768
He found it out through others,
not Ye-rin.

879
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,478
-I hope it doesn't get messy.
-Yeah.

880
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,064
They'd be able to talk it out
if they just go on one date.

881
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,858
Ye-rin's number one in his heart now.

882
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,693
I feel bad for them.

883
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,528
All this just over the dream date?

884
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,285
My goodness.

885
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,590
Okay. I've made up my mind.

886
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,467
You have?

887
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,637
I'm going to use her dream date.

888
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,350
-I won't use mine.
-Use Ye-rin's dream date?

889
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
Yes.

890
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,478
What?

891
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,231
-He's going to use Ye-rin's dream date.
-What's he saying?

892
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,275
Can you rewind that?

893
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,695
-I don't get it.
-I can't believe what I just heard.

894
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,447
-I couldn't believe my eyes and ears.
-I missed it.

895
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,658
Can you rewind it?

896
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,911
I'm going to use her dream date.

897
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,373
I won't use mine.

898
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,916
He didn't say, "Use my dream date."

899
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,626
-He's going to use hers.
-Use hers.

900
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,795
"I'm going to use her dream date."

901
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,631
-Don't be like that.
-So he'll make her use hers?

902
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,384
Since she was going to use it
on someone else,

903
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,927
he's making her use it on him.

904
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,595
So that she can't go with anyone else.

905
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,472
Ji-min went all in

906
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,932
-and expressed his heart.
-Right.

907
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,768
-So I think he wants her to express
-Exactly.

908
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,145
-her heart to him now.
-Right.

909
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,106
Hey, I…

910
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,025
-This is frustrating.
-You want to go with Ji-woo, don't you?

911
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,737
-Yes, but she's--
-Then say no to Seo-hyeon.

912
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,697
Ji-woo's always had something, so I…

913
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,199
-You shouldn't go with Seo-hyeon then.
-She said she has plans.

914
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,660
I can't tell her not to go.

915
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,498
This is a problem.

916
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,169
What is going on?

917
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,634
Where's Se-yeon?

918
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,386
I think he went out for a second.

919
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,929
-He went out?
-Yes.

920
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,097
Where's Ji-woo?

921
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,849
I don't know. I haven't seen her.

922
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,934
Ye-rin.

923
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,478
-Meet me upstairs.
-Okay.

924
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,272
-Is she in the room?
-I don't know.

925
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,739
-I have a question.
-Okay.

926
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,533
Did you ask Pyeong-seok to go on
a dream date with you?

927
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,077
Yes, yesterday.

928
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,998
Did you ask Se-yeon if he felt jealous?

929
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,502
Se-yeon?

930
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,799
I did ask him today.

931
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,093
I won't use my dream date.

932
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,136
Why not?

933
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,263
I'm pretty disappointed.

934
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,768
If you want to go, let's use yours.

935
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,149
When I said I felt bad…

936
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,026
-Yes, I know.
-That's what it was about.

937
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,985
I figured.

938
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,784
But if you use your dream date,

939
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:03,703
I'll go.

940
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,131
Just ten minutes ago,
they were sitting right there…

941
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,342
-They were so happy.
-Like a movie.

942
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,303
But

943
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:25,433
I said that to Pyeong-seok
before we went on a date together.

944
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,310
When did you ask him?

945
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,980
I asked him before we went on a date.

946
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,065
-To go on a dream date?
-Yes.

947
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,317
I said that

948
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:42,075
because I had a lot on my mind.
So I decided to take it easy.

949
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,704
I thought it would be a good idea

950
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:50,292
to go on a date with someone I wanted
to get to know instead of someone I liked.

951
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,961
That's not very considerate.

952
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,632
But I didn't want to be considerate.

953
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,093
I don't want to be.

954
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,763
I think I've been considerate enough,

955
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,473
and it only gave me a hard time.

956
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,641
So I'm not going to do it.

957
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,854
I've thought about it a lot.

958
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,106
When I heard that,

959
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,652
I felt resentful toward you and Se-yeon.

960
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,952
It felt like you came to me
after going through all the others.

961
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,248
If you thought about it in my shoes,
you'd agree.

962
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:37,589
When you approached me first,

963
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:41,635
I thought you would probably
start liking Ji-woo more than me.

964
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,262
But after you said all that,

965
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,558
I thought that I could rely on you.

966
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,980
To be honest, that really helped me
process my emotions.

967
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,067
I also don't want to be with someone
who's not committed.

968
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,737
And I don't like anyone
who makes me anxious.

969
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,239
So I hated Se-yeon for that reason.

970
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:09,162
Then after you heard
what I told Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon…

971
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,500
I don't know. You're being like…

972
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,169
I don't know what to do anymore.

973
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,006
I get what you're trying to say.

974
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,218
There's less of a misunderstanding now.

975
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,346
But if I use my date,

976
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,473
I'm not sure whom you'll use yours on.

977
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,267
So I want you to use your chance.

978
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:35,689
I'm confused with my emotions right now.

979
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,734
I wonder if this is really necessary.

980
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,582
I guess we're done talking then.

981
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,298
Where are you going?

982
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,050
Come here. Now.

983
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,511
Come over here.

984
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,390
-Hey. Are you really going to do this?
-I'm serious.

985
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,683
We're using yours.

986
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,561
Don't go.

987
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,980
If you use yours, I'll go.
If not, I won't go.

988
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,819
What's there to think about?

989
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,573
I'm just conflicted. I just…

990
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,784
I can't do anything anymore.

991
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,496
I can't make decisions anymore.

992
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,182
I hate you.

993
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,859
The way that both of them are feeling…

994
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,862
-My goodness.
-What are they going to do now?

995
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,447
-I have no clue.
-So messed up.

996
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:12,577
But then, Ye-rin thought about it
to the end.

997
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,872
She could've just said,

998
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,707
"Okay. I'll use mine."

999
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:22,128
I wonder why she's hesitating.

1000
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,048
I get it because

1001
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,634
Ye-rin's heart fluttered
when Ji-min chose her.

1002
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,554
So she started liking him a bit more
and became more certain.

1003
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,517
But now, he's like,
"I need you to show me that you like me."

1004
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,685
-She's like…
-She feels a bit…

1005
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,854
-I get it.
-She's not there yet. She was comforted

1006
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,900
-because he gave her some certainty.
-Right.

1007
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,444
It seems Ji-min is very passionate.

1008
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,988
-He's passionate.
-He falls for something very fast.

1009
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,615
He's clearly emotional.

1010
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,450
-Yes, he's a bit emotional.
-Yes.

1011
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,244
Ye-rin's still holding onto him.

1012
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,080
-I know.
-She's not letting go yet.

1013
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,793
Do you want a glass?

1014
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,337
Have a glass.

1015
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,840
Everyone has a lot on their minds.

1016
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,926
I don't have much on my mind.

1017
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,847
Maybe it's because
I'm only focusing on one person.

1018
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,398
Did you see me?

1019
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,361
Is it something serious?

1020
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,279
No.

1021
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,030
Great. It's so scary over there.

1022
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,950
-That's life.
-Right.

1023
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,201
It's never easy.

1024
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,412
You must know a lot about life.

1025
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,833
I have a favor to ask. Can you help?

1026
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,880
I hope you remain happy.

1027
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,717
-Please?
-We are happy. Right, sir?

1028
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,806
That's so sweet.

1029
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,643
You're sweeter than strawberry milk.

1030
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,315
So sweet. Good times.

1031
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:13,448
What upset me was Jung-yun's attitude.

1032
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,949
-You know?
-Why?

1033
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:20,622
Because I've always said I wanted Jung-yun
to express himself more.

1034
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,167
I was disappointed by his attitude.
It has nothing to do with you.

1035
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,046
Seriously.

1036
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,299
-I thought I drove a wedge…
-Yes?

1037
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,967
Can I come in?

1038
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,177
Yes.

1039
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,262
You want me outside?

1040
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,598
-No, can I come in? Is it just you two?
-Yeah.

1041
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,516
What is it?

1042
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,893
Why?

1043
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,443
Something's going on between you two.
I want to hear it.

1044
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,821
I just want to make this clear,
and I just told you about it.

1045
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,491
I had so much fun on our date.

1046
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,454
What am I doing here?

1047
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,082
No, you should stay here and talk.

1048
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,835
So the date helped me a lot.

1049
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,755
So, I…

1050
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,803
I get that you still have feelings
for Jung-yun.

1051
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,430
-I told you.
-I get that.

1052
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,977
I get it, but we had a good time
on our date.

1053
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,773
Then you suddenly cried
because of how Jung-yun acted.

1054
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,441
-That makes me feel…
-I'm sorry.

1055
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,819
-She said she felt bad.
-I felt bad.

1056
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,195
It's funny.

1057
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:38,575
I was out on the terrace
because I had a headache.

1058
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,535
-We made eye contact.
-Then…

1059
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,495
I was breaking down inside, too!

1060
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,206
-I totally get that.
-I'm really sorry.

1061
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,425
Where's Ji-woo?

1062
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,801
She's over there.

1063
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:59,804
You should go talk to her.
Is Seo-hyeon downstairs?

1064
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,806
-Se-yeon?
-Seo-hyeon.

1065
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,017
Seo-hyeon's there too.
With Ji-woo and Se-yeon.

1066
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,226
-Are they talking now?
-Yeah.

1067
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,944
Then let's make it easy.

1068
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,779
-I've thought too much about it.
-Right.

1069
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:21,034
-I want to stop thinking.
-We have to gather in six minutes.

1070
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,912
-Can't we just have fun?
-I…

1071
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,251
Wait, it might be a hasty decision.

1072
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,169
Think carefully.

1073
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,171
You might regret it later.

1074
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,505
Regret what?

1075
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,424
Did I jump to conclusions again?

1076
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,384
-No, you're right.
-Am I?

1077
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:44,057
Anywhere? Busan or Gyeongju?
Whatever is still available?

1078
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,101
I don't think it's a good idea
to go out tomorrow.

1079
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,102
Why not?

1080
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,521
Because everything's so messy.

1081
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,774
-What's messy? No.
-I have a feeling

1082
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:57,570
we won't be able to enjoy it, right?

1083
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,701
I have a lot on my mind right now.

1084
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,705
And it was better yesterday,

1085
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,249
because I knew I was into Jung-yun
more than you.

1086
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,879
But I'm getting confused now.

1087
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,924
-It's half and half.
-Is this chicken or what?

1088
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,468
Yeah, basically.

1089
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,054
-Oh, it is.
-That's why things are so complicated.

1090
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,224
If I go with Jung-yun,
I won't stop thinking about you,

1091
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,975
and vice versa.

1092
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:34,190
I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy it.

1093
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,276
-I'll leave the decision to you.
-It's up to you.

1094
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,987
Promise me you'll go
on the next dream date with me.

1095
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,953
I can't believe it.

1096
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,913
They're being really honest.

1097
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,834
I can't believe they don't hesitate
to say they are into two people.

1098
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,545
She's not sure about how she feels.

1099
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,132
She's saying her heart is growing
for Se-yeon,

1100
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,427
but to me, it seems
she's into Jung-yun more.

1101
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,971
-It's Jung-yun.
-It's obviously Jung-yun.

1102
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,639
She likes Jung-yun so much,

1103
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,183
but someone else is doing
what she wants from him.

1104
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,728
-So she's swayed.
-That's why she fell for him.

1105
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,522
She said it's half and half,
but I think it's 80 to 20.

1106
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,316
It's funny to put that into numbers.

1107
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,985
It's never half and half.

1108
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,738
She only said that
because Se-yeon is right there.

1109
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,156
-Exactly.
-Right.

1110
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,367
In fact, she said that in anger
because she's disappointed.

1111
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:44,886
We're all waiting…

1112
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,807
It was 20 percent, but now it's 50.

1113
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,602
Guys. Everyone's waiting.

1114
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,853
Sorry.

1115
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,527
We need to talk about it.

1116
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,154
If you've got the consent

1117
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,406
and you want to go to Busan,
raise your hand.

1118
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,005
No one?

1119
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,381
No one wants to go?

1120
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,259
What about Gyeongju?

1121
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,636
Nobody for Gyeongju, either?

1122
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,393
Does no one want to go,
or do you need more time?

1123
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:38,022
Raise your hand
if you're not going on a dream date.

1124
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:42,401
Raise your hand
if you absolutely don't plan on going.

1125
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,695
I have no plan to go.

1126
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:50,618
Really? Then people who didn't
raise their hands need more time to talk.

1127
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,329
If you need more time,
you should go and talk more.

1128
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,792
If you need to talk more, you should.

1129
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,127
You need to do what you need to do.

1130
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,964
So, let's make it first come, first served
from now on.

1131
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,716
Not everyone wants to go,
so first come, first served.

1132
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,387
If you need to talk to anyone, go.

1133
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,681
That's what we should do.

1134
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,944
Ji-woo.

1135
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,904
-We need to talk.
-Okay.

1136
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,447
Oh, my hair roll.

1137
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,870
Where do you want to go?

1138
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,413
Anywhere you want to go.

1139
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,731
What's on your mind now?

1140
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,649
-Me?
-Yes.

1141
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,444
I have too much on my mind.

1142
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,196
I…

1143
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,659
-Can I be honest with you?
-Yes.

1144
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,286
That's why we're here.

1145
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:16,746
At first,

1146
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,624
you were the only person
I was interested in.

1147
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:24,337
I liked you so much more
than anybody else.

1148
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:30,384
Even when Ji-min and Se-yeon
said they were interested in me,

1149
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,638
I looked forward to the date with you
the most.

1150
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:41,687
I wanted to talk to you the most,
but you didn't talk to me.

1151
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,149
Wait. Is there any tissue?

1152
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,275
Is there any tissue?

1153
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,786
I get it now…

1154
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,047
You didn't talk to me.
You know that, right?

1155
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,006
Yeah…

1156
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,884
-I'll be honest with you.
-Okay.

1157
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:19,809
Seo-hyeon asked me
to go on a date with her tomorrow,

1158
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,519
-and I had a lot on my mind, too.
-Right.

1159
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:28,109
You said you had your graduation, and you
said you were going on a date with Ji-min.

1160
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,487
I thought

1161
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,864
-I shouldn't just waste time at home.
-Right.

1162
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,450
-I was like, "Sure. I'll go."
-Right.

1163
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:43,040
-I didn't take it seriously.
-Right.

1164
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,001
Because there was nothing

1165
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,087
between me and Seo-hyeon.

1166
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,840
It's not like I have feelings for her.

1167
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,009
That's why I didn't hesitate to say yes.

1168
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,472
So…

1169
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:08,774
But I've been asking you
to express yourself to me more.

1170
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,360
The way you were acting before
they revealed the dates

1171
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,739
was the most enthusiastic
you've ever been.

1172
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:17,033
You were sitting up front.

1173
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,161
I was like, "What's going on?"

1174
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,580
In the end, you didn't do that for me.

1175
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,832
I was disappointed…

1176
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,296
because I finally got to see
what I've always wanted.

1177
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,341
I saw it

1178
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,844
today for the first time.

1179
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,930
But you didn't do that for me.

1180
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,020
I like you the most,

1181
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,275
but you…

1182
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,121
You'll never know
unless I tell you, right?

1183
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,082
-Of course I won't.
-Right.

1184
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:11,670
If there's anything I want to tell you,

1185
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,341
I think about it like five times
before I finally tell you.

1186
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:25,059
So I wasn't able to tell you
what you wanted to hear.

1187
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,361
What I want to say is…

1188
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:40,116
You're the only person here

1189
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:45,913
who made my heart flutter.

1190
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,499
I wanted to say this yesterday.

1191
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,000
Why didn't you?

1192
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,131
I felt something that
I didn't feel with anybody else.

1193
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,800
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1194
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:00,803
Why are you saying that now?

1195
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,472
This is driving me crazy.

1196
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,477
You've always been the only one.

1197
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,187
So I was happy the day you came.

1198
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,529
It would've been nice
if you said that yesterday.

1199
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,368
I've never felt like this before.

1200
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:32,042
I'd never been into anyone
like this before.

1201
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:37,965
I've thought seriously about it.
What it would be like…

1202
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,554
I admit that I took too long.

1203
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,600
People get swayed easily, okay?

1204
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,186
You never know when they'll change.

1205
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,730
So, I've changed my mind,

1206
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,231
Jung-yun.

1207
