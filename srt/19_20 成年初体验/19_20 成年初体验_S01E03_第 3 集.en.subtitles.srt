JUNG-YUN

00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
SEO-HYEON

HEE-JI

00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949

YE-RIN

9
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,840
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
Come in.

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,719
Already?

12
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,846
-Now?
-They're here now?

13
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,538
She's cute.

14
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,381
What? There's a guy too?

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,517
There's a guy too!

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,938
He's handsome.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,065
Pretty handsome.

18
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,445
These are the new students.

19
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,656
Can you introduce yourselves?

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,244
My name's Jeong Ji-woo, and my dream
is to become a flight attendant.

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,329
Damn!

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm Jeong Ji-woo, and I'm 19 years old.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,419
I live in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.

24
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,797
My dream is to become a flight attendant.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,259
I want to become a flight attendant

26
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,845
and experience many cultures
and meet various people

27
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,305
while offering quality service
to passengers.

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,392
I'm quite popular.

29
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:28,439
People say I'm pretty and cute when they
first meet me, so they show interest.

30
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:33,236
And they say they like me
because I'm thoughtful.

31
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,530
-Her voice is so cute!
-She's cute.

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,948
I love her confidence.

33
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
She's probably the hottest girl
in Hwaseong.

34
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,958
What I like is watching soccer games.

35
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,841
And there's nothing I dislike.

36
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,346
Ji-woo and I…

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,264
JUNG-YUN

38
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,432
…have the same hobby.

39
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,310
And I like watching soccer.

40
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,646
There isn't anything I hate in particular.

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,274
-They said the same thing!
-Yes!

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,942
They said the same thing.

43
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,447
And I felt a kind of connection to her
as soon as I saw her,

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,407
so I grew interested in her more.

45
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,580
Hi, my name's Kim Pyeong-seok.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,124
I want to become a Hapkido instructor.

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,670
I like sports.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,467
My name is Kim Pyeong-seok.
I'm 19, and I'm from Daegu.

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,845
My dream is to become
a Hapkido instructor.

50
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,183
My father is running a Hapkido center,

51
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,228
and I've competed in numerous competitions
since I was little,

52
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,563
so I have a lot of medals.

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,192
I also won at an international
martial arts competition.

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,655
An international competition?

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,156
He's the strongest here.

56
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,246
I teach children at the Hapkido center.

57
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:13,044
In the afternoons, I drive the van
and go around picking up the students.

58
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:20,677
My friends say that I was hard to approach
at first, but once they got to know me,

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,472
they realized I was fun to be with
and actually a bit clumsy.

60
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,687
Taekwondo and Hapkido.

61
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,106
Taekwondo and Hapkido!

62
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,067
We should choose your seats.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,860
Sit in alphabetical order.

64
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,696
Goodbye.

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,656
-Bye.
-And…

66
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,117
-I'll get that for you.
-Thank you.

67
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,369
-Hi.
-Hi.

68
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,745
Welcome.

69
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,415
I think Pyeong-seok can sit here.

70
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,917
And I think Ji-woo
can sit behind Seo-yeong.

71
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,461
Come here.

72
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,518
We don't move?

73
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,062
I guess not. Why? Do you want to?

74
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,230
No, of course not.

75
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,483
-He's disappointed.
-Jung-yun…

76
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,736
He's obviously disappointed.

77
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,488
Please help the new students adjust.

78
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,825
Let's take a break
before we begin our first period.

79
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,119
Isn't it pretty here?

80
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,871
-What?
-Our school, right?

81
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,247
It's like a university.

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,293
Isn't this awkward?

83
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,421
Jung-yun over there
likes watching soccer, too.

84
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,382
That's why we had that reaction earlier.

85
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,217
Ye-rin has the same dream as you.

86
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,510
-Really?
-Yes.

87
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,138
We have the same dream.

88
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,433
-Cool!
-Yes, it's so cool.

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,853
I was excited to meet Ji-woo.

90
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,940
I was happy to see someone
who had the same dream as me.

91
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,610
I wanted to chat with her.

92
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,527
I was excited.

93
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,616
Hi. What's your dream job?

94
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,117
-An actress.
-Really?

95
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,494
That's so cool.

96
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,079
Yours is a flight attendant?

97
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,830
That's cool.

98
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,333
-So we have new students.
-How fun.

99
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,834
Everyone seems excited.

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,965
SPECIAL LECTURE
INSTRUCTOR SONG GIL-YOUNG

101
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,512
-Hello.
-Hello.

102
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,805
It's nice to meet you.

103
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,641
My name's Song Gil-young,

104
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,435
and what I do is analyze people's minds.

105
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,982
I look through a tremendous amount of data
and read patterns in them

106
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,069
to analyze what people are thinking.

107
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
"Your every move is a message."

108
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:51,577
To give you a suitable question,
I asked this to an AI program.

109
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,163
I know that!

110
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,040
It's really cool.

111
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,169
If I ask for a report,
it just writes it for me.

112
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,421
It's really fun.

113
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,841
He told us about ChatGPT.

114
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:10,847
I talked with my friends about ChatGPT,
saying it was really cool.

115
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,309
Since it's about big data too,
it was an interesting topic.

116
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,147
It can give me a report on
a topic I choose.

117
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,524
It can also solve problems.

118
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,068
-It can code for you too.
-Really?

119
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,863
So it did all these tasks.

120
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,197
So in the future…

121
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,827
Are you sure?

122
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:41,711
I really tried not to be bothered,
but I kept hearing them talking behind me.

123
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,879
So I wasn't

124
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,382
too happy about it.

125
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,635
She's totally bothered.

126
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,514
Ji-woo's appearance might change things.

127
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,975
That's the fun of having new students.

128
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,561
-Right.
-It hasn't been long for the rest, though.

129
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,104
-Right.
-Nothing was fixed.

130
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,064
It's not weird for the pairs to change.

131
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,024
Right.

132
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,775
How about a break?

133
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,776
Okay.

134
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,320
Bathroom break.

135
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,113
Where is it?

136
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,574
It's right outside.

137
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,783
See you later.

138
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,243
Taekwondo and Hapkido.

139
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,375
-It's awkward, right?
-Yes.

140
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
How's it going?

141
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,712
Hey, your dimples are so pretty.

142
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,298
-Ji-woo, right?
-Yes.

143
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,050
-I'm Hee-ji.
-Hee-ji.

144
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,886
Isn't our campus really pretty?
It's like college.

145
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:38,017
Hee-ji came up to me first
and was so friendly.

146
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,853
I remember her the most
since we seemed to click.

147
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,191
-Ji-woo?
-Yes?

148
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,027
-Thank you.
-It's a blanket.

149
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,904
-Thank you.
-It's a blanket.

150
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,490
-Doesn't he look like SHINee Min-ho?
-Yes.

151
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,075
-What? Minho?
-A bit…

152
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,868
-SHINee?
-I'm blushing.

153
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,562
-He's circling her like a satellite.
-Right.

154
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,146
He was never like that.

155
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,148
What do we do with you, Jung-yun?

156
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,902
I never approached a girl before,

157
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,406
so I'm thinking about how
to get close to her.

158
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,992
Isn't this nice?

159
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,494
-Yes.
-I took this too.

160
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,538
And this one too.

161
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,790
Everyone complimented me.

162
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,208
This one is pretty too…

163
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,293
Maybe she's just pretty.

164
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,006
Who is it?

165
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,007
It's Seo-yeong.

166
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,842
Seo-yeong, he says you're pretty.

167
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,802
Really?

168
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,265
That was smooth.

169
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,851
-Take notes, guys.
-Really?

170
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,185
Write it down?

171
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,313
-Yes, and use it on me.
-Write it down.

172
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,897
Really? Say the same line?

173
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,365
He's thinking about what to say to her.

174
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,366
Jung-yun…

175
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,077
-My goodness.
-They're so cute.

176
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,579
It must be difficult.

177
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,956
It's actually not that hard
to talk to someone…

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,791
-But he's anxious.
-Just do it.

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,084
He's thinking too much.

180
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,963
Let's do a brief discussion as well.

181
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,758
Is it better to achieve
your goals as planned

182
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,093
and then move on to the next?

183
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,430
Or is it better to quickly give up if
it doesn't seem right for you,

184
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,557
then adjust your plans and make new goals?

185
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,475
This is your topic.

186
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,352
What do you think?

187
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:51,233
I believe it's better to give up quickly
and come up with new goals.

188
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:57,531
The reason is because I think it's better
to focus on what I want to do first.

189
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,078
And I can try again later if I want to.

190
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,245
All right.

191
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,664
That's great.

192
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,752
I thought she would be pretty quiet.

193
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,340
But she was actually quite well-spoken.
I was kind of surprised.

194
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,300
Jung-yun…

195
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,844
Fall in love.

196
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,972
This is funny because
she's sitting at the back,

197
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,933
-so he has to turn around.
-Yes.

198
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,892
He kept turning.

199
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,312
-He just stayed like that.
-His neck must hurt.

200
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,981
Looks deliciousquirrel.

201
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,696
Nice!

202
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,449
-Can I try one?
-Sure.

203
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,867
Thanks.

204
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,911
-I'll eat this first, then.
-Go on.

205
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,621
-This looks so delicious.
-Right?

206
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,664
What is this?

207
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,001
Have one of these.

208
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,503
-Can I try that?
-Here.

209
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,141
What is it?

210
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
Tomorrow's a field trip.

211
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,852
FIELD TRIP

212
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,771
-I'm so excited. And we have cooking, too.
-Cooking?

213
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,315
SCHEDULE

214
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,859
I'm a good cook.

215
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,527
Really? I'm not.

216
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,822
-You're good at cooking?
-Yeah.

217
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,407
-What can you cook?
-Anything.

218
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,700
-Anything?
-Yes.

219
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,202
-For real.
-Pasta?

220
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,287
Yes.

221
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,122
-And tteokbokki?
-Yes.

222
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,374
I haven't tried it, though.

223
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,919
-All we do is eat.
-I was thinking of learning from my mom.

224
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,756
Guys, we have clubs here.

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,010
Ji-woo and Pyeong-seok,
you have to choose a club.

226
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,846
There's table tennis and astronomy.

227
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,723
Shouldn't we have one in each club?

228
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,016
You have to decide.

229
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,143
Can you see the stars?

230
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,853
I did in high school.

231
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,772
Right, you're in university.

232
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,109
Are you seducing her?

233
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,986
-Are you seducing her?
-What?

234
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,158
You're trying to make her join
the astronomy club.

235
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,367
-You…
-You startled me.

236
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,829
No, I was telling her
we might not see any stars.

237
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,623
Which do you prefer?

238
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,167
-Table tennis.
-Table tennis?

239
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,669
You should decide.

240
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,879
And you, Ji-woo?

241
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,923
-Table tennis.
-Table tennis?

242
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,132
Both want table tennis.

243
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,884
Really?

244
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,678
I'm so sad.

245
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,973
-Our astronomy club's fun.
-Right.

246
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,726
Come to our astronomy club.

247
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,230
Hey, table tennis is really fun.
We have missions too.

248
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,023
Table tennis is awesome.

249
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,400
-Okay, sorry.
-Our teacher's amazing.

250
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,027
We even get massages.

251
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,695
Wait, don't get angry.

252
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,324
Our astronomy club's fun, though.

253
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,243
We even got telescopes yesterday.

254
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,621
Can we see the stars tonight?

255
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,457
Let's try it out!

256
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,504
Nice, we're going to see the stars.

257
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,091
Jung-yun, Ye-rin will be sad
if you sit like that.

258
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,926
Ye-rin's not sad at all right now.

259
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,553
-She's enjoying her meal.
-Oh, really?

260
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,223
Hey, you brought it.
Our class president's here.

261
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,724
I brought it to take photos.

262
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,393
Pyeong-seok has no photo.

263
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,353
I'll take a photo of you, Pyeong-seok.

264
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,854
You never got a photo.

265
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
You don't have to, though. No pressure.

266
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,775
Stay like that. It's cute.

267
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,694
All right, hang on.

268
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,321
Just stay like that. Sit naturally.

269
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,908
-Your smile is great!
-Yes, that's good.

270
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,035
Come on, give us a smile.

271
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,830
Hey, you look so adorable!

272
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,956
No way!

273
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,417
His smile is really cute.

274
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,544
Stay still. Look outside.

275
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,087
This is such a good picture.

276
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,922
CUTE PYEONG-SEOK

277
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,800
Which club will you go to later?

278
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,801
Which club?

279
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
Hey, astronomy is the best.

280
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,096
We have the telescopes ready.

281
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,223
We did all the boring stuff for you.

282
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,808
Was it boring?

283
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,061
No, it was really fun.

284
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,396
It was amazing.

285
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,690
It was really fun. I mean it.

286
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,443
Pyeong-seok, table tennis is really fun.

287
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,737
We can all watch the stars together.

288
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,197
They're trying to get him to join.

289
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,699
Pyeong-seok seems…

290
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,200
He seems quite shy.

291
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,410
Let's go.

292
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,494
Astronomy club.

293
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,667
Awkward, right?

294
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,883
Is there anything you want to know?

295
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,510
Ask me anything.

296
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,222
I'm usually kind of quiet…

297
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,350
What do you think about the others?

298
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,018
Everyone's so nice.

299
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,936
Right?

300
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,313
You look really nice too.

301
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,230
Me?

302
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,191
Yes, I'm nice.

303
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,735
You're admitting it?

304
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,404
There was a really handsome kid.

305
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,073
It was Moon Se…

306
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,449
-Se-yeon?
-Yes.

307
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,202
He looks like a webtoon character.

308
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,747
One of the guys, Se-yeon…

309
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,043
He caught my attention

310
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,504
because he was so handsome.

311
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,090
What did you do yesterday?

312
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,174
Yesterday?

313
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,010
It sounds kind of strange,
but we had a dating class.

314
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,429
-Dating class.
-Dating class?

315
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,518
But I heard that we're not allowed
to date in school.

316
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,229
Right?

317
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,524
Are there any kids who kind of…

318
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,567
seem to like each other?

319
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,029
Well, there are some kids
I'm kind of hoping would date,

320
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,656
because they suit each other.

321
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,579
Pyeong-seok…

322
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,711
seemed a bit shy,
so I kept talking to him.

323
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,338
I was a bit shy.

324
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,591
But my seatmate Hee-ji
helped me out a lot.

325
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,260
She was really nice to me,

326
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,387
so I'm grateful.

327
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
What are you doing?

328
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,198
I'm so sleepy.

329
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,576
I'm so tired.

330
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,960
What time did you sleep?

331
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,587
Me? Hey, sit down.

332
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,883
I fell asleep

333
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,469
at 11:30.

334
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,680
Then I woke up at 1:30.

335
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,265
You must be tired.

336
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,642
-When did you sleep?
-Me?

337
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,188
About 10:30? Or 11?

338
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,147
You slept early.

339
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,357
I felt like I should.

340
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,000
Are you good at sports?

341
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
No, I'm awful at them.

342
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,295
But I like watching.

343
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,798
-Right, you like watching soccer.
-Yes.

344
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,674
I don't like playing it, though.

345
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,637
What kind of soccer games do you watch?

346
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,430
I like Son Heung-min,

347
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,932
-so Tottenham…
-Tottenham?

348
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,226
Me too. I'm a fan of Tottenham.

349
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,436
-You too?
-Of course.

350
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,730
Fist bump!

351
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,775
-Awesome.
-Soccer…

352
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,820
You guys keep talking.

353
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,752
-This is awkward, right?
-No.

354
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,837
I'm totally relaxed.

355
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,922
-You can be honest.
-I mean it.

356
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,841
-No way.
-I can fall asleep here.

357
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm not sure how to react to that.

358
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,098
Why?

359
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,518
-First impressions. Tell me.
-Of you?

360
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,104
Of everyone?

361
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,021
Yes, everyone.

362
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,481
My first impression…

363
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,483
I only saw two people at first. You…

364
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,193
Well, you were at the front.

365
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:17,156
You and the guy at the back
who wants to be an actor.

366
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,241
-Jung-yun?
-Yes.

367
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,203
I didn't get to talk to

368
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,122
the guy who wants to be an actor.

369
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,708
So I want to talk to him a bit.

370
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,085
-What? Jung-yun?
-Really?

371
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,172
You'd normally include the person
you're talking with

372
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,631
when you're asked that.

373
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,549
Right.

374
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,885
But the fact that she mentioned Jung-yun…

375
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,470
-He might finally get a chance.
-Finally.

376
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,848
-He kept circling her without talking.
-Right.

377
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,058
It's difficult to talk to someone

378
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,186
-you like in school.
-Right.

379
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,812
-It's hard.
-I hope he'll find out.

380
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,400
Can you play table tennis?

381
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,526
Of course.

382
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,445
Do you want to play it now?

383
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,487
Now?

384
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,406
-Want to try?
-You're good, though.

385
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,908
That doesn't really matter.

386
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,410
-I want to see you play.
-I'm pretty good.

387
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,537
Really? Let's play, then.

388
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,414
I'm good at this.

389
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,043
How do I hold this again?

390
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,252
There's two ways.

391
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,212
Right, I know.

392
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,005
You do? Which do you want to do?

393
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,632
-Which?
-The better one.

394
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,508
-Better one? Then just do as I do.
-Okay.

395
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
How do I explain this?

396
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,264
Just…

397
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,186
-Hold it…
-Like this?

398
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,021
Right. I get it.

399
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,774
Okay. Got it.

400
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,151
-Yes, right here.
-Okay.

401
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,613
Try it, then.

402
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,949
Let's see how good you are.

403
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,326
-That was a mistake.
-A mistake?

404
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,995
-Another mistake.
-Okay.

405
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,458
I'm good, aren't I?

406
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,002
-Another mistake.
-Another?

407
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,674
-Your turn.
-At least you return.

408
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,550
-Let's try to do 10.
-Aren't I good?

409
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,471
-That was a mistake.
-Ten.

410
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,016
One…

411
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,439
-Another mistake?
-Yes, I was putting on a show.

412
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,652
-I was good.
-You're good.

413
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,987
I was good.

414
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,697
How was it? Is it fun?

415
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,865
-Yes, I guess this club is fun.
-Is it?

416
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,200
-It's fun, right?
-Yes.

417
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
It's fun.

418
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,789
-My gosh.
-She's cute.

419
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,291
Ji-woo's so cute.

420
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,461
It seems like she wants to get closer
to Se-yeon than Jung-yun.

421
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,587
Is it just me?

422
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,799
She seems to be cracking jokes more

423
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,552
to try to get closer to him.

424
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,970
-To Se-yeon.
-To Se-yeon?

425
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,638
Would Ye-rin know this?

426
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,681
She wouldn't.

427
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,767
-She should watch out.
-I bet she's eating right now.

428
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,312
Ji-woo's really charming.

429
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,480
BEAUTY
INSTRUCTOR LEE NA-KYEUM

430
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,441
-Let's go.
-Are we starting class now?

431
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,861
What is this?

432
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,865
Are we drawing on apples?

433
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,626
Here.

434
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,170
Let's get pretty.

435
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,339
I'll draw my eyeliner
all the way to my temples.

436
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,591
-Let's get pretty.
-I'll show you.

437
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,925
I can't do makeup.

438
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,719
Hello!

439
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,638
-Hello!
-Hello!

440
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,849
-Hello!
-Hello.

441
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,018
-It's nice to meet you.
-Hello.

442
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,353
Today,

443
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,107
I will teach you about makeup.

444
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,652
I'm Lee Na-kyeum,
a makeup artist. Hello.

445
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:52,329
I'm sure you see so many makeup tutorials
on YouTube these days.

446
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,248
But more than doing
the same makeup that others do,

447
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:59,002
it's best think about your own image

448
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,129
and the distinctive charm you have.

449
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,924
So with your seatmates…

450
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,137
I want you to try putting makeup
on each other's faces.

451
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,349
And I'll go around and see
how you're doing.

452
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,229
What should I do?

453
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,607
What's this for?

454
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,442
I know this.

455
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,403
Look at me.

456
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,115
Your nose…

457
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,292
I'm getting butterflies!

458
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,254
He can't look her in the eyes.

459
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,755
His heart's going to explode!

460
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,632
Let me see.

461
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,634
You're shining right here.

462
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,636
It's glimmering.

463
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,517
Come here.

464
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,270
I'll do your lashes.

465
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,563
Hang on.

466
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,650
They're curled a bit.

467
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,695
Just a tiny bit.

468
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,780
-Here?
-Yes, just a bit.

469
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,783
Pyeong-seok looked surprised

470
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,828
to see his lashes curled up.

471
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,038
It was kind of cute.

472
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:27,507
I felt shy facing her like that
and seeing her so up close.

473
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,802
If I were him,
I'd fall in love with Hee-ji.

474
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,180
-Me too.
-Me too, if I were him.

475
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,431
Guys would fall for that.

476
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,351
Yes, like some unintentional touching
while doing makeup on him.

477
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,438
-I'd fall for it.
-Yes, my heart would flutter.

478
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,441
-What is all this?
-I love this.

479
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,193
-I'll do it on you.
-You will?

480
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,195
-Sit down, I'll…
-Can I trust you?

481
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,405
Just trust me.

482
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,115
All right.

483
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,408
I'll transform you.

484
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,410
Make me into a cool guy.

485
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,663
-A cool guy.
-Okay.

486
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,664
First…

487
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,339
Great.

488
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,257
What is this?

489
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,801
Are you sure? This…

490
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,678
You're pranking me, aren't you?

491
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,263
No, I'm not. Come here.

492
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,895
You can't tell until I'm finished.

493
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,231
This feels weird.

494
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,445
Something seems off.

495
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,157
You're laughing at me.

496
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,992
No, I'm not. Don't worry.

497
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,455
I can tell by your face.

498
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,291
What do I do?

499
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,836
Is this right?

500
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,549
Hey!

501
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,927
It's the real "highlight"!

502
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,431
-I didn't think it would…
-Remove it!

503
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,683
You overdid it.

504
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,018
Did you use flour instead of highlighter?

505
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,228
What is that?

506
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,649
-What happened?
-I'm sorry.

507
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,320
They have good chemistry.

508
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,447
-They're like besties.
-They're so close.

509
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,700
-What happened?
-I'm sorry.

510
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,034
I mean…

511
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,997
I got pretty close to Jung-yun,
sitting next to him

512
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,498
and joked around a bit.

513
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,375
But I was worried about Se-yeon.

514
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:30,130
I was worried Se-yeon would think
I'm not interested in him.

515
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,675
But I'm still interested in Se-yeon,

516
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,927
so I don't want him to misunderstand.

517
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,597
I actually wanted to try
doing makeup on Se-yeon.

518
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,349
-Sure.
-Come here.

519
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,311
He'll be another victim now.

520
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,063
How can you trust her
after what she did to me?

521
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,774
I do my best in everything, you know.

522
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,192
All right!

523
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,490
You look nice.

524
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,083
While I was putting blush on him,

525
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,461
my face was really close to his.

526
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,962
Then our eyes met,

527
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,091
and that moment felt romantic and rosy.

528
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,469
His cheeks were pink and rosy too.

529
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,637
I liked it.

530
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:25,018
When I'm with Ye-rin,
I like that I don't feel uncomfortable.

531
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,688
It's nice to feel comfortable
and relaxed around her.

532
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,316
-You look great.
-It looks great on you.

533
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,026
You really look good.

534
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,070
-It looks nice.
-You look like a peach.

535
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,906
Why did you do such a good job
on him while…

536
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,074
While this guy here…

537
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,867
Do you hate me?

538
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,953
No, it's just that
I chose the wrong makeup.

539
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,289
This just didn't apply well.

540
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,001
All right, finish up
and return to your seats.

541
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:55,673
Our makeup class wasn't that long,
so I didn't get to teach you a lot,

542
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,051
but I want you to remember

543
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:02,180
that it's best to start off by examining
your own faces first.

544
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,724
That's the message I want to give you.

545
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,935
All right, that's it for today.

546
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,187
-This class only left a scar.
-Thank you!

547
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,773
-Thank you!
-It left a scar.

548
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,651
ASK ME ANYTHING

549
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,822
Guys, we're doing "Ask Me Anything"
in the computer room.

550
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,949
Let's go!

551
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,743
Let's go!

552
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,161
-Let's go!
-That was fun.

553
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,206
I'm nervous. "Ask Me Anything"?

554
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,793
This will be fun!

555
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,878
Sounds fun.

556
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,463
Ta-da!

557
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,506
COMPUTER ROOM

558
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,299
-After you.
-Thanks.

559
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,301
Where's my seat?

560
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,887
-"Choi Seo-hyeon."
-There.

561
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,890
What is that?

562
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,226
-"Pyeong-seok."
-This is my seat.

563
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,312
What is this?

564
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,442
What is this? This is so cool.

565
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,236
What is this?

566
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,992
Hey, the chalkboard is over there.

567
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,870
"Ask Me Anything."

568
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,081
TODAY, THE BOYS WILL ASK
THE GIRLS QUESTIONS

569
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,042
ONLY USE ANONYMOUS NICKNAMES
DON'T REVEAL YOUR IDENTITY

570
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,297
The girls will only answer,
and you guys will ask anonymously.

571
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,757
-We ask the questions.
-Yes.

572
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,010
-"Ask Me Anything"?
-"Ask Me Anything"?

573
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,636
What's that about?

574
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,847
-It's a feature on social media.
-Really?

575
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,893
I hear that kids these days
start dating through this feature.

576
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,021
So it's a social media feature
where you can ask

577
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,773
questions to other people.

578
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,442
But in this School 19 class,

579
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,987
the boys ask the girls
things they want to know

580
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,781
through anonymous nicknames.

581
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:48,036
The point here is that everyone can see

582
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,412
-the answers.
-Everyone?

583
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,123
-So the answers will be revealed.
-Right.

584
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,044
-They'll be asking the new students.
-Ji-woo must receive a lot of questions.

585
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,463
Jung-yun will ask her something.

586
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,050
Ji-woo will get many.

587
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,576
SHEEP_1920: HOW'S YOUR FIRST DAY?

588
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:39,170
I STILL FEEL AWKWARD, BUT IT'S FUN!

589
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,550
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU LIKE?

590
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
SENT

591
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,386
-Isn't that Sang-won's hand?
-Right?

592
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,096
Let's take a guess.

593
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,933
SHEEP_1920: WHAT KINDS OF THINGS
DO YOU LIKE?

594
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,520
ROSÉ TTEOKBOKKI, YUKHOE,
SALMON SUSHI, ROSÉ PASTA, ETC.

595
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,272
We just laughed at the same time.

596
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,067
SHEEP_1920: WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THAT BOOK?

597
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,902
SHEEP_1920: HOW'S YOUR NEW SEATMATE?

598
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,946
SHEEP_1920: WHAT DID YOU LIKE
THE MOST IN SCHOOL?

599
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,990
SHEEP_1920: WHO CAUGHT YOUR EYE FIRST?

600
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,367
SHEEP_1920: HOW ARE YOU SO CHEERFUL?

601
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,327
-There are so many.
-So many…

602
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,371
-He's so curious.
-"Sheep"?

603
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,497
Q. WHO SENT THE MOST QUESTIONS?

604
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,876
The one with the nickname "sheep."

605
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:23,172
After I finished replying to one,
I receive two more questions.

606
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,634
So I was taken aback a bit.

607
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,514
I'm not sure
who would ask so many questions.

608
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,391
It's hard to guess who it is.

609
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,105
HOW IS SCHOOL?

610
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,899
HOW WILL YOU SPEND YOUR LAST WEEK?

611
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,609
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE 20?

612
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,528
I asked a ton of questions
to all the girls.

613
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,863
SHEEP

614
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:51,576
It's hard to have private conversations,
so I asked a lot of questions.

615
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,578
-It's Sang-won!
-It was Sang-won?

616
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,914
I told you it was Sang-won's hands!

617
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,917
-How is he so fast at typing?
-It was Sang-won?

618
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,835
Well, he is a college student.

619
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,092
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GOT THE BOOK?

620
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,305
SHEEP_1920: HOW DID YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU GOT THE BOOK?

621
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,933
I WAS REALLY HAPPY.

622
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,435
THE LETTER WAS ROMANTIC TOO,

623
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,228
SO I FELT HAPPY READING IT.

624
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:23,691
SHEEP_1920: WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
DO YOU WANT?

625
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,195
ONE THAT'S LIKE A FRIENDSHIP?
BUT ALSO ROMANTIC?

626
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,030
This is so fun.

627
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,909
"Like a friendship"?

628
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,786
-Like friends but romantic?
-That's hard.

629
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,412
They seem like opposites.

630
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,498
Girls that age would want that.

631
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,211
SHEEP_1920: IS THERE SOMEONE
YOU WANT TO GET CLOSER TO?

632
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,431
THE NEW STUDENTS!

633
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,440
ANYONE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

634
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,402
ZEBRA_1920: ANYONE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

635
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,530
YES!

636
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,450
She said yes!

637
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,411
She's interested in someone!

638
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,080
-Pyeong-seok?
-She practically confessed her love.

639
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,256
RABBIT_1920: HOW DID YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU GOT THE BOOK?

640
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:38,933
I RECEIVED IT IN PERSON.
IT FELT NICE, AND MY HEART FLUTTERED.

641
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,695
RABBIT_1920: DID YOU WANT TO RECEIVE
A BOOK FROM SOMEONE SPECIFIC?

642
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,451
NOT ANYONE SPECIFICALLY.

643
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,495
BUT IT MADE ME FEEL SOMETHING

644
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,789
THAT I HAVEN'T FELT
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

645
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,542
He can't hide his smile.

646
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,377
That's so cute.

647
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,590
SHEEP_1920: DID ANYONE GIVE YOU A BOOK?

648
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,759
YES!

649
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,389
SHEEP_1920: DID YOU GET IT FROM SOMEONE
YOU WANTED TO GET IT FROM?

650
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,101
YES, I DID.

651
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,359
We're sending questions now, right?

652
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,861
Yes, to their accounts.

653
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,826
I don't do social media much,
so I didn't know about that feature.

654
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,705
So at first,
I was just reading the answers

655
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,291
and wondering what I should ask.

656
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,004
I kept refreshing their feeds,

657
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,965
and I think Ji-woo had a lot of new ones.

658
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,926
RABBIT_1920: CHOSE YOUR CA YET?

659
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:55,927
ZEBRA_1920: CRAVING ANY FOOD?

660
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,345
DOLPHIN_1920: WHEN IS YOUR BIRTHDAY?

661
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,560
IT'S NOVEMBER 26TH

662
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,563
DOLPHIN_1920: HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU DATED?

663
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,734
TWICE!

664
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,487
RABBIT_1920: WHAT'S THE LINE UP
FOR TOTTENHAM'S GAME TODAY?

665
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,364
-That's Jung-yun.
-It's Jung-yun.

666
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,865
I think it's Se-yeon.

667
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,996
OH, IS THERE A GAME TODAY?

668
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,208
RABBIT_1920: AREN'T YOU A TOTTENHAM FAN?

669
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,169
I SWEAR I LIKE SOCCER.

670
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,883
Rabbit keeps asking her questions.

671
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,760
I think it's Se-yeon.

672
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,639
RABBIT_1920: WHAT'S YOUR IDEAL
SOUTH KOREAN SOCCER SQUAD?

673
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:46,686
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU CALM DOWN A BIT?

674
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,521
What is this?

675
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,481
This is pretty fun.

676
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,067
I asked Ji-woo about soccer.

677
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,862
I was teasing her a little

678
00:35:55,945 --> 00:36:01,617
so that she wouldn't
feel awkward during class.

679
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,911
-It was Se-yeon.
-He's Rabbit.

680
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,538
It suits him.

681
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,914
JI-WOO

682
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:13,171
Rabbit kept asking me
questions about soccer,

683
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:18,217
and I liked that he asked a lot
of playful questions.

684
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,469
-Jung-yun, do something!
-Jung-yun!

685
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,597
-Do something.
-Jung-yun!

686
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,811
I was wondering what to ask,

687
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,441
and I thought it would be best

688
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,361
to send some questions to Ji-woo first
since she's a new student.

689
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,240
CAT_1920: ANYTHING YOU'VE BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT RECENTLY?

690
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,536
I'M THINKING ABOUT HOW I SHOULD SPEND
MY FIRST YEAR AS AN ADULT.

691
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,123
CAT_1920: DO YOU WANT TO TRAVEL ANYWHERE?

692
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,792
DA NANG. THE BEACH IS PRETTY. BUSAN TOO!

693
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,964
CAT_1920: WHAT'S YOUR HOBBY?

694
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,509
I LOVE TAKING WALKS
WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC

695
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,429
I like taking walks, too,

696
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:08,476
so I grew a bit more interested in her
since we have the same hobby.

697
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,520
-Jung-yun's really cute.
-Right.

698
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,524
Did he send those only to Ji-woo?

699
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,193
Yes, only to Ji-woo.

700
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,113
Se-yeon's questions
were all sort of

701
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,825
focused on trying to get her
to relax and laugh.

702
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,829
But Jung-yun's asking
pretty serious questions.

703
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,456
I think that's nice.

704
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,334
It's because he already
wants to go traveling with her.

705
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,796
That's why he asked that
and about her hobbies.

706
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,798
-He wants to go with her.
-Yes.

707
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,343
It's more fun since it's anonymous.

708
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,845
-Of course!
-I have no clue who anyone is.

709
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,932
I could tell who asked
some of the questions.

710
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,393
Some were obvious who asked the questions.

711
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,312
-I could tell by how they talk.
-It was obvious.

712
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,607
Our clubs…

713
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,235
-Do you want to do table tennis?
-What about you?

714
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,029
Do you want to join the table tennis club?

715
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,782
Me?

716
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,660
-It doesn't really matter.
-Me either.

717
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
You can choose.

718
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,337
Did you guys choose which club to join?

719
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,463
TABLE TENNIS CLUB
ASTRONOMY CLUB

720
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,090
When will you decide?

721
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,591
-Just now.
-You did?

722
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,843
Did you choose?

723
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,680
Come here, guys. Write your names here.

724
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,516
What's your choice?

725
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,647
Which did they choose?

726
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,734
Pyeong-seok might join Hee-ji.

727
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,194
Yeah, because he feels
comfortable around her.

728
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,504
PYEONG-SEOK CHOSE THE TABLE TENNIS CLUB

729
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:01,922
Yes!

730
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,218
I think Pyeong-seok will do really well
if I teach him.

731
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,262
JI-WOO CHOSE THE ASTRONOMY CLUB

732
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,263
Astronomy?

733
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,474
Good choice.

734
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,434
We'll have fun in our club.

735
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,560
Okay.

736
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

737
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,693
Ji-woo and Jung-yun
are in the same club now.

738
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,487
Yes. I'm shipping you guys.

739
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,491
Let's go.

740
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,284
Good luck today!

741
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,245
Shall we go?

742
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,707
-Is it here?
-I think it's here.

743
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,751
Yes, here it is.

744
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,586
Yes, that's it. You can go inside.

745
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,632
You can sit at the end there.

746
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,719
Ji-woo joined our club,

747
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,931
and we haven't told each other
about our birthdays yet.

748
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,059
Since we're an astronomy club,

749
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:59,939
let's tell each other
our birthdays and our zodiac signs.

750
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,149
My birthday's September 28th.

751
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,361
And I don't remember
what my zodiac sign is,

752
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,738
but I think that I'm a Libra.

753
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:13,077
My birthday's May 24th,
and I'm a Gemini.

754
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,413
-Gemini?
-So you're a Gemini.

755
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,249
My birthday's November 26th,

756
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,292
and I think it's Sagittarius.

757
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,293
Sagittarius.

758
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,171
-My birthday's December 12th…
-Right.

759
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,845
-What was it?
-You don't remember?

760
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,265
I'm sure I knew it.

761
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,393
-He can't remember.
-My memory…

762
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,103
-He can't remember.
-December…

763
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,606
We all talked about our zodiac signs
in our club,

764
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,651
but I was the only one who didn't know.

765
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,237
I went home and looked it up later,

766
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,824
and it was the same as Ji-woo's,
a Sagittarius.

767
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,495
I was surprised, and I liked
having another thing in common with her.

768
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,750
For real?

769
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,752
-Jung-yun…
-That's going too far.

770
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,963
We get it, Jung-yun.

771
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,300
How many things in common
do you need to talk to her?

772
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,593
He's laughing, too.

773
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,054
-He knows it's funny.
-How many more does he need?

774
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,267
Welcome.

775
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,310
Hello.

776
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,895
Come here, Pyeong-seok.

777
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,063
But I'm new here.

778
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,565
He's strict.

779
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,233
-I'll be strict on you.
-Of course.

780
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,902
Like this.

781
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,862
-His posture's good.
-Right?

782
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,281
-Is this good?
-He's a natural.

783
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,824
Okay, let's begin.

784
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,368
You hit too hard.

785
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,995
Remember, just touch it.

786
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,538
-Touch.
-Touch.

787
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,374
Swing, but just touch the ball lightly.

788
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,667
Loosen your grip.

789
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,544
Watch the ball.

790
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:52,343
One, two, three, four,

791
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,095
-five, six…
-No way.

792
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,639
-No way!
-Seven…

793
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,140
-He's so good.
-Eight.

794
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,810
-Nice shot!
-You'll be practicing this a lot.

795
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,853
All right.

796
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,399
After Pyeong-seok joined,
the vibe seemed to change a bit.

797
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,400
It was more fun.

798
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:14,073
I thought, "He's quite athletic
because he does Hapkido."

799
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,991
"It's great that he joined."

800
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,287
"I have another teacher to help me."
That's what I thought.

801
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,665
She's cute.

802
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,667
The way she thinks is cute.

803
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,418
BREAK TIME

804
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,586
Gather round.

805
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,672
Do we have to do something?

806
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,466
We have cooking class tomorrow.

807
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,093
There are several menus.

808
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,762
We get to choose what to cook.

809
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,393
They all seem hard.

810
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,271
We can each choose one that we want to do.

811
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,566
What is this? It's for tomorrow.

812
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,401
-What?
-It's for tomorrow's class.

813
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,237
We have cooking class tomorrow.

814
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,614
-Right.
-We get to choose the menus.

815
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,616
How should we choose?

816
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,828
Let's choose, and do rock, paper,
scissors if there are overlaps.

817
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,162
-Okay.
-I…

818
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,331
Just say what you want to do.

819
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,874
I…

820
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,964
SOYBEAN PASTE STEW, RICE CAKE SOUP, KIMCHI
STEW, POLLACK SOUP, SOFT TOFU STEW

821
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,842
-I get it.
-So they each choose one.

822
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:21,098
The guy and girl who choose the same menu
will pair up and cook together.

823
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,727
Then they'll know who their partner is
in class tomorrow.

824
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,686
Right.

825
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,937
If…

826
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,565
If Ji-woo and Jung-yun pair up…

827
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,692
-It's fate.
-Jung-yun will love it.

828
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,444
"We even like the same food."

829
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,364
They were both Sagittarius and everything.

830
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,158
-They like walks…
-And soccer.

831
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,200
Same introduction.

832
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,161
Any partner in mind?

833
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,245
Me?

834
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,789
You're not sure yet, right?

835
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,251
Is there a guy who gave you
a good impression?

836
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,630
-Everyone's similar.
-Let's be honest.

837
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,590
I mean it. What about you?

838
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,675
Is there anyone?

839
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,094
Sang-won.

840
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,304
For me, Ji-min.

841
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,347
Ji-min?

842
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,473
And her…

843
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,142
-Se-yeon.
-Of course, it's Se-yeon.

844
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,602
She didn't even say it.

845
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,520
You know, Ye-rin's eyes

846
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,773
-look different…
-When I look at him?

847
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,107
The way you look at him…

848
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,942
Since we know stuff…

849
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,445
-Right.
-We can tell…

850
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,197
It's just interesting.

851
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,865
I mean, he's just interesting.

852
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,950
I never felt butterflies before,

853
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,329
but Se-yeon was the first one
to make me feel it.

854
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,164
So he's my first pick, of course.

855
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,459
-I want to feel that again.
-I thought you liked Jung-yun…

856
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,795
With Jung-yun, it's like…

857
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,755
-You and Jung-yun are too…
-Jung-yun…

858
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,590
-Just close friends.
-You're like…

859
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,508
Just besties.

860
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,594
I think it'll be fun
to work with Jung-yun.

861
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,638
-Jung-yun's really funny.
-Really?

862
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,431
-But who knows?
-Right.

863
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,266
I could suddenly like him later.

864
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,267
-Right.
-Totally.

865
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,645
-Right. You never know.
-Right.

866
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,231
They say you can't be "just friends."

867
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,692
-What about you? No one?
-No one?

868
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,609
Me?

869
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,944
Me?

870
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,987
Him?

871
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,406
Pyeong-seok?

872
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,366
-Really?
-For real?

873
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,035
-She's so cool!
-Hee-ji!

874
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,080
So none of them are interested
in the same guy.

875
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,706
I knew it!

876
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,379
She's playful with everyone else,
but she seemed serious with him.

877
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,549
I could tell she was feeling anxious.

878
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,093
But we're not trying to pressure you.

879
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,178
-It's just how we feel.
-You know, right?

880
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,555
We told each other…

881
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,474
that we might suddenly fall
for someone else.

882
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,684
Right.

883
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,354
They all seemed like friends,

884
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,982
so I thought there was
nothing going on yet.

885
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:39,027
But the girls all had someone in mind.

886
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,404
It was a surprise.

887
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,741
But they told me
not to worry too much about it.

888
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,078
So I'm not that concerned.

889
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,789
Ji-woo!

890
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,790
You're so cool!

891
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,459
-She's so cool.
-She's funny.

892
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,544
At that age, I had three crushes.

893
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,212
Before you date, it's fine.

894
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,006
-Right.
-It's okay.

895
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,175
When we talked about our crushes,

896
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:05,262
I'd be like, "This guy's my favorite,
then this guy, then this guy."

897
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,599
But at that age,
your crush keeps changing.

898
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,892
Like every ten minutes.

899
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,768
You had a list of crushes?

900
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,521
I'd have a list of guys I like.

901
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,814
Just innocent crushes.

902
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,024
But our first picks

903
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,775
-couldn't be the same guy.
-Right.

904
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,736
It's okay for the others.

905
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,321
It's okay for the others?

906
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,238
Yes.

907
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,073
School's fun these days.

908
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,575
I want to go back.

909
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,702
So you have rankings?

910
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:33,499
UNTIL 20
D-4

911
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,126

Hi.

920
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,816
Spicy braised chicken?

921
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,558
-Soft tofu stew.
-What's yours?

922
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,101
Rice cake soup?

923
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,777
-Jung-yun's disappointed.
-No!

924
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,363
The pairs all changed.

925
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,157
Hello.

926
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,367
-Hi.
-Hello.

927
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,037
I'm your partner today.

928
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,163
Let's do this.

929
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,456
HEE-JI & SANG-WON: RICE CAKE SOUP

930
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,126
Did you choose the soup?

931
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,420
Is it you?

932
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,380
PYEONG-SEOK & SEO-HYEON: POLLACK SOUP

933
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,761
Those two haven't talked, right?

934
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,804
-Right?
-Who knows what'll happen?

935
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,307
Like Ye-rin said, they could get closer.

936
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,226
-Right.
-They get to talk to each other.

937
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,686
This is a good opportunity.

938
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,730
-Hi.
-Are you a good cook?

939
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,106
JUNG-YUN & SEO-YEONG: SOYBEAN PASTE STEW

940
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,024
Me? Yes.

941
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,692
I'll show you.

942
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,236
-I'll follow your lead.
-Sure.

943
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,701
Is that group soybean paste stew?

944
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,036
Kimchi stew.

945
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:22,501
Ye-rin kept saying
she wanted to do kimchi stew.

946
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,089
Then Se-yeon will be
working with Ji-woo or Ye-rin.

947
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,049
It's like a movie.

948
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,009
-How did this happen?
-Will it happen?

949
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,808
Our partners were chosen
based on the menu.

950
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:42,312
So I was excited thinking about
who my partner would be.

951
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,373
I was waiting by our group table
when Se-yeon came in.

952
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,167
"Could he be my partner?"

953
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,588
I would have loved
to work with Se-yeon,

954
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,259
so I was hoping he would come
to my table.

955
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,683
I'm nervous!

956
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,976
Se-yeon, come on.

957
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,728
My gosh!

958
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,061
