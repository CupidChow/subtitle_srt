What?

12
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,971
-Wait for me.
-I'm against it.

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,098
Slow down.

14
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,437
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

15
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,024
Club activity one and two.

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,865
-This is astronomy.
-Is this astronomy?

17
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,285
Table tennis?

18
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,422
Hello.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,216
-Hello, leader.
-Hello.

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,678
SEO-HYEON AND HEE-JI

21
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,055
Hang on.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:37,972
What?

23
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,099
Poor Sang-won.

24
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,101
He's waiting for Seo-hyeon.

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,901
-Is this astronomy? I'm going here.
-I choose this.

26
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,027
Good.

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,445
Hello.

28
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,114
JI-MIN AND SEO-YEONG CHOSE
THE ASTRONOMY CLUB

29
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,156
Hi.

30
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,036
-CA two…
-What's this?

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,957
I choose here.

32
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,585
JUNG-YUN CHOSE THE ASTRONOMY CLUB

33
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,504
Wait.

34
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,381
She's contemplating.

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,549
Why?

36
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,552
-Se-yeon wants Ye-rin.
-Right.

37
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,983
YE-RIN CHOSE THE ASTRONOMY CLUB

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,406
We already have four people.

39
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,074
You can't join us. Sorry.

40
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,826
-Oh, no.
-Too bad.

41
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,411
-Bye.
-Too bad.

42
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,788
Dang it.

43
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,540
She's going to play table tennis.

44
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,882
The table tennis club was here!

45
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,634
I didn't know.

46
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,347
I was happy, obviously.

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,894
I don't know
if it was for me or for table tennis.

48
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:10,481
Even if it was for table tennis, I'm still
happy because I'm a table tennis player.

49
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,319
If it was for me, I'm grateful and happy.

50
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,529
That's how I felt.

51
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:21,743
When I entered the astronomy club,
it was already full.

52
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:26,748
So I thought I was meant to join
table tennis club, and I was happy to go.

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,917
Q. DO YOU THINK YOU'LL LIKE
THE TABLE TENNIS CLUB?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,127
It's led by Se-yeon.

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,420
It's bound to be awesome.

56
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,298
Welcome.

57
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,426
Let's enjoy studying the stars.

58
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,386
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

59
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,555
-You like watching stars on the rooftop?
-Yes.

60
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,061
We can observe the stars outside.

61
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,812
Where did I put my heat pack?

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,733
We'll have to prepare it.

63
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,984
Thank you.

64
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,695
-It's probably cold.
-Right.

65
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,907
It's going to be fun.

66
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,785
You're all here to see the stars.

67
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,912
I hope you like it.

68
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,748
-Sounds good.
-All right.

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,125
-Well done.
-Well done.

70
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,137
UNTIL 20
D-6

71
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,375
SCHOOL 19

72
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,670
LIBRARY

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,633
TWENTY

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,556
I went straight to the library
in the morning.

75
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,602
As soon as the homework
was assigned, Ji-min said…

76
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,813
Who are you going to write to?

77
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,232
Me? I don't know yet.

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
-Wanna write to each other?
-Sure.

79
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,945
It didn't really matter to me,

80
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,363
so I said sure.

81
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,616
But I keep wanting to know
more about Sang-won.

82
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,245
So I want to write to Sang-won.

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,913
I haven't decided what to do yet.

84
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
-My! See?
-I knew it.

85
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,251
-But why did she choose table tennis?
-Really!

86
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,086
-I know.
-I never expected that.

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,674
It was so cold yesterday.

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,092
-I know.
-It was freezing.

89
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,344
-Do you want to step on the snow?
-Stomp!

90
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,971
Do you want to try?

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,347
But my shoes are new.

92
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,641
I want to step on them.

93
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,351
Let's go.

94
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,939
My lunch bag is heavy today. I like it.

95
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,442
It feels nice.

96
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,277
I have rolled omelets.

97
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,571
I love rolled omelets.

98
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,740
We have PE in the afternoon.

99
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,492
-Right.
-I'm going to eat a lot.

100
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,743
I'm going to eat so much.

101
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,119
Come in.

102
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,871
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

103
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,473
Sang-won came?

104
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,474
Are they meant to be?

105
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,894
-They're running into each other?
-They…

106
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,677
I barely had a chance to talk
to Seo-hyeon yesterday,

107
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,430
but today, I could talk to her
on the way to the classroom.

108
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,558
So I was glad and happy to see her.

109
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,851
-Let's go.
-Okay.

110
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,937
-It's cold again today.
-I know. It'll only get colder.

111
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,690
-Where is it?
-This way?

112
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,817
-Okay.
-Are you bad at directions?

113
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,486
I can't remember routes
after just one visit.

114
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,991
What if you never get
to remember it to the end?

115
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,451
Maybe.

116
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,744
-I can't wait to check out the gym.
-Me too.

117
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,248
-I'm looking forward to PE the most.
-Me too!

118
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,293
-What do you think we'll do in PE?
-Not sure.

119
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,712
-I think we'll play badminton.
-Are you good at it?

120
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,505
I'm awesome.

121
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,299
You said you're good at table tennis.

122
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,259
I'm amazing.

123
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,469
-Really?
-Yes.

124
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,429
-That's why you joined table tennis?
-Yes.

125
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,139
-But…
-Yeah?

126
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,391
-I'm not sure about table tennis.
-Why?

127
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,060
-I should've gone to astronomy.
-Why?

128
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,521
Astronomy sounds like more fun.

129
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,649
-So cute.
-My goodness! Because of him!

130
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,902
-"Because you're there."
-"You're there!"

131
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,403
-Sang-won!
-"You're there."

132
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,490
Astronomy sounds more fun.

133
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,868
-So why didn't you come? You should've.
-I know.

134
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,704
-It's a bummer.
-No.

135
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,082
You saw me behind the door
and went to the other place.

136
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,211
-"Wow, she didn't even hesitate."
-No.

137
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,130
Club activity one and two.

138
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,173
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

139
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,218
-This is astronomy.
-Is this astronomy?

140
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,140
I have to make this clear.

141
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,266
What?

142
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,392
I mean…

143
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,353
-I'm listening.
-I…

144
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,065
Even before the clubs were announced,
I said I'm good at table tennis.

145
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,026
-So…
-Yes.

146
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,113
I just wanted to play table tennis.

147
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
Is that why you chose it?

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,617
That's why.

149
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,370
Okay.

150
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,830
Don't just say okay. You need to trust me.

151
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,791
That is…

152
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,751
If you…

153
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,130
It's fun to talk to Sang-won.

154
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,051
Our laughter never stopped.
I thought we got along.

155
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,557
If I get to choose again,
it'll be astronomy for sure.

156
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,852
That much?

157
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,522
Wasn't that very sweet?

158
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,440
-It wasn't just me, right?
-Yes.

159
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,402
She went like, "No!" She did that.

160
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,030
On the stairs, they both walked slowly.

161
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,948
Yes!

162
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,450
-They liked that moment.
-Yes.

163
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,703
They wanted to enjoy it longer.

164
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,663
-Right.
-That's how it felt.

165
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,249
The first block?

166
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,667
The class president election.

167
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,960
-What?
-Say what?

168
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,295
"To do list."

169
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,589
CLASS PRESIDENT ELECTION,
SPECIAL LECTURE I HOMEWORK

170
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,507
-Anyone wants to be prez?
-Me.

171
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,759
-I want to do it.
-It suits you.

172
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
-It matches you.
-I'll be the class vice president.

173
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,014
You're a perfect fit.

174
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,390
Thanks.

175
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,312
-Hello.
-Hello.

176
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,354
Good morning.

177
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,356
Hello.

178
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
I heard today's going to be fun.

179
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,110
-Why?
-Look what it says. "Dating."

180
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,362
Doesn't that sound fun?

181
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,697
"The Secret of Dating"?

182
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,365
I dated only once in middle school.

183
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,950
-Once in middle school?
-Yes.

184
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,369
Jung-yun had a girlfriend?

185
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,539
-Why?
-It's a shame.

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,082
I was hoping it'd be their first.

187
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,834
Something is…

188
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,835
Jung-yun.

189
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,504
I want to become a relationship expert.

190
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,594
I can teach you.

191
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,512
Sure. Go ahead.

192
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,641
Love expert, teach us!

193
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,975
Yes. Teach us.

194
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,895
I've never been in a real relationship.

195
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,606
I can't!

196
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,484
I can't teach you what I don't know!

197
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,069
I'm looking forward to today.

198
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,989
DATING
INSTRUCTOR LEE YOU-JUNG

199
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,492
-It's the teacher.
-Hello.

200
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,535
-We start at 9 a.m.
-Hello.

201
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,164
It seems you were having a good time.

202
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,336
You were all laughing.

203
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,298
I'm a counseling psychologist.
My name is Lee You-jung.

204
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,883
Do you know what this class is about?

205
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,052
-Love counseling.
-Learn about dating secrets.

206
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,765
Yes. How would you describe love
in one word?

207
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:28,187
To keep the relationship stable,
you need to know the core emotions.

208
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,731
Think about fear and pressure.

209
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,193
Recall your oldest memory.

210
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,195
AN HOUR LATER

211
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,157
Let's talk about your past relationships.

212
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,869
We talked about a lot of stuff today.
Do you all have ideal types?

213
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,456
What do you look for in a partner?

214
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,587
Everyone is looking away.

215
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,844
Everyone's staring into empty space.

216
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,930
Suddenly, we were all like…

217
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,310
We're all avoiding eye contact.

218
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,354
Jung-yun. What about you?

219
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,275
I don't have any data yet.

220
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,945
There must be someone you like.
Like a celebrity or something.

221
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,157
A woman with a beautiful smile.

222
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,618
-A beautiful smile.
-A beautiful smile.

223
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,537
How can you tell?

224
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,914
You just know.

225
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,458
-You can feel it?
-Yes.

226
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,586
-There's a moment you fall for it.
-Yes.

227
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,464
But I haven't fallen for anyone yet.

228
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,344
-No one ever…
-No one stole his heart yet.

229
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,682
Ye-rin, what about you?

230
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,933
-Me?
-Yes.

231
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:54,648
Someone who listens to others and is calm.

232
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,775
Calm.

233
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,070
Sang-won, what about you?

234
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:00,988
Me?

235
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,408
I never thought
about an ideal type before.

236
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,703
I guess I'd like someone I get along with.

237
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,954
In what way?

238
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,500
Someone who would empathize with me.

239
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,586
Then you'd feel closer.

240
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,838
Well…

241
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:24,929
Sang-won said he likes someone bright
and he has a lot in common with.

242
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,891
I thought about whether
I have those qualities.

243
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,936
-I see.
-She was paying close attention.

244
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,521
They're so adorable.

245
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,481
And?

246
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,234
First of all, we have to get along

247
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,195
and understand each other.
Our conversations need to flow.

248
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,364
It's not just about love.

249
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,325
I realized life is all about timing.

250
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,911
When I broke up with my ex,

251
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,164
I was going through
what you'd call a slump.

252
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,335
I couldn't focus on table tennis.
My coach yelled at me that day.

253
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,712
-I couldn't play well.
-Oh, my.

254
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,172
I get what he means.

255
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,007
It wasn't my best day.

256
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,720
I was going to the dormitory
after training at 11 p.m.

257
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,973
Since it was hard to reach me,

258
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,351
my ex sent me a long text
about how upset she was.

259
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,436
I just lost it there.

260
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,314
"This isn't going to work out."

261
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,443
I wrote a long text
that we should break up.

262
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,487
And I sent it.

263
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,033
I listened to Se-yeon's love story.

264
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,329
He doesn't like to be in a relationship

265
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,790
that doesn't respect each other's life.

266
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,126
He's just like me.

267
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,628
That's interesting.

268
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,673
Ye-rin. I noticed you were nodding.

269
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,216
What were you thinking?

270
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,762
I'm new to relationships.

271
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,310
There was a guy
who liked me for a few years.

272
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,227
As ever.

273
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,815
I wanted him to remain a good friend,
but he wanted more than that.

274
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,320
I thought, "Maybe I could trust him."

275
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,072
So we started dating.

276
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,742
But there was no chemistry.

277
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,746
I avoided contacting him
and holding his hand.

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,248
I couldn't even hold his hand.

279
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,834
That happens.

280
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,629
Right.

281
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,841
There was no chemistry,
so when we were breaking up,

282
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,638
I told him, "I can never like you."

283
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,349
-How were you so sure?
-I don't know.

284
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,268
I guess I didn't have
any feelings for him.

285
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,561
No feelings at all.

286
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,397
He couldn't make my heart flutter.

287
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,733
So, chemistry is important for you.

288
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,360
Right.

289
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,278
Jung-yun, what's your opinion?

290
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,989
You were listening carefully.
What was on your mind?

291
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,659
That everyone enjoyed their lives.

292
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,662
-You didn't? Okay.
-I thought…

293
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,997
He's a character.

294
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,709
I thought I should enjoy my 20s.

295
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,755
I haven't dated anyone for three years.

296
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,590
Oh, because you haven't.

297
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:20,229
After listening to their love stories,
I realized they all have a lot to say.

298
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:26,068
I thought I should date
more people from now on.

299
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,821
-Jung-yun.
-Jung-yun.

300
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,781
-How come he didn't?
-Had no chance.

301
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,949
He's in a boys' school.

302
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,243
-And he was an athlete.
-Good luck, Jung-yun!

303
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,455
How do you feel now? Do you feel closer?

304
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,873
-Yes.
-Yes.

305
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,001
You're going to vote
for the class president.

306
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,838
You're voting.

307
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,755
The class president.

308
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,967
Do we have any volunteers?

309
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,389
I'd like to try.

310
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,726
Anyone else?

311
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,394
So, Ji-min for now.

312
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
I'll do it.

313
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,404
I feel confident.

314
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,448
Come out.

315
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,868
This is great.

316
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,913
We also need a class vice president.

317
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,374
Any volunteers?

318
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,793
The class president will pick…

319
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,003
He's going to pick?

320
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,421
-the vice president.
-He is?

321
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,006
I'll choose Hee-ji.

322
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,133
She said she wanted to.

323
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,512
Okay.

324
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,223
-Let's do this!
-Yes.

325
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,311
You should work together
to lead the class.

326
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,938
-I'll do my best.
-Nice.

327
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,608
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy.

328
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,526
Looks deliciousquirrel.

329
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,286
-Ta-da! We can share.
-Hey.

330
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,081
-Looks good, right?
-Hold on.

331
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,165
Hey.

332
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,708
Doesn't it look tasty?

333
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,920
That looks so good.

334
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,464
Everyone's so cute.

335
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,010
I smell ham. Is it ham?

336
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,969
Here.

337
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,556
It was yours? No wonder I smelled Spam.

338
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:29,900
I like it.

339
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,153
We only have physical activities left now.

340
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,781
We have to go to the library.

341
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,407
I have to go, too.

342
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,493
Let's go together after lunch.

343
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,036
I already did.

344
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,415
What? That was fast.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,835
Do you want to go?

346
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,379
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

347
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,345
She's looking at Sang-won.

348
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,805
-What?
-Why?

349
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,399
Q. DID YOU FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK?

350
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,733
I chose

351
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:17,197
the French novel called Will You Be There?

352
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:22,202
I gave it to Seo-hyeon,
the person I wanted to get to know more.

353
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,413
In the post card,

354
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,709
I wrote I want to get
to know her like I said,

355
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,502
and Merry Christmas.

356
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,005
My!

357
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,340
Sang-won is cool.

358
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,550
That's so cool.

359
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,929
Seo-hyeon. Done with the homework?

360
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,931
-Did you do your homework?
-Not yet.

361
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,725
-Really?
-I only borrowed the book.

362
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,976
-Really?
-Yes.

363
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,564
Who wants to go to the library with me?

364
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,399
-The library? Me!
-The library.

365
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,734
Do you want to?

366
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,570
-Let me just brush my teeth.
-Okay.

367
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:01,533
Seo-yeong was looking for
someone who'd go to the library with her.

368
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:06,705
She was someone I wanted
to get to know, so I said I'd go.

369
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:13,295
Can I just tell the person
this book is for him?

370
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,881
You should make it romantic.

371
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,466
Romantic? Got it.

372
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,929
You should hand it to him
or put it in his locker.

373
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:26,183
-Oh, okay.
-In case he misses it, put it on the edge.

374
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,519
-Got it?
-Yes.

375
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,522
-So cute.
-That's deliberate. Cute.

376
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,941
That's deliberate.

377
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,317
She's thorough.

378
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,030
Se-yeon?

379
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,490
Isn't that Ye-rin's jacket?

380
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
You have no choice?

381
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,703
Ye-rin. Shall we go to the library?

382
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,455
-Sure. Let's go.
-Let's go.

383
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,831
See you later.

384
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,958
Is this your jacket?

385
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,751
-Yes, thank you.
-Let's go.

386
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,006
Is Hee-ji left alone?

387
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,926
Se-yeon is very straightforward.

388
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
It's cold.

389
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,306
One second.

390
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,517
Let me check in the mirror.

391
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,855
Good. That's my routine.

392
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,859
We're outside.

393
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,361
Let's go.

394
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,156
Where's the library?

395
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,074
The library?

396
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,450
Do you know?

397
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,077
It's probably around the corner.

398
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,662
I'm counting on you.

399
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,038
SCHOOL 19

400
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,999
-It's our school. "Nineteen."
-School 19.

401
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,002
-Wanna check this out?
-Poetry?

402
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,296
-Yes.
-Like poetry and novels.

403
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,589
-You see…
-Yes.

404
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:45,554
It's not easy
to figure out the book so quickly.

405
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,223
-Right.
-So I'm going to make it simple.

406
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,517
I'll choose what suits me now.

407
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,728
Did you pick one?

408
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,483
WHEN I WAS AT MY MOST BEAUTIFUL

409
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,651
This is my answer.

410
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,572
-Okay.
-Let me see the table of contents.

411
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,011
Take your time.

412
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,095
Okay.

413
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,694
Are they gonna talk through it?

414
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,571
I guess they are.

415
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,119
Found anything good?

416
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,246
I've made up my mind.

417
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,414
-You have?
-Yes.

418
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,582
What is it?

419
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,836
I'll show it to you. Bend down.

420
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,840
What do you think? Good?

421
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,093
It's hard to choose.

422
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,890
Wait. Where did I put it?

423
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,065
-Are you going with your first book?
-What? No.

424
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,775
-Did you change it?
-Yes.

425
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,402
Okay. Are you done?

426
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,032
-Do you need more time?
-No, I'm good.

427
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,450
You're good?

428
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,914
But it'll be…

429
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,915
Yes?

430
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,001
too cold to carry the book over there.

431
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,254
-Let's put it in here.
-No, you can take it.

432
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,297
-Me?
-Yes.

433
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,135
-Is this for me?
-Yes.

434
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,304
You should read it.
It looks like a good book.

435
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,680
-Really?
-Yes.

436
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,226
Oh, my gosh. Se-yeon.

437
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,397
-Is this for me?
-Yes.

438
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,733
You should read it.
It looks like a good book.

439
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,109
-Really?
-Yes.

440
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,611
I SEE YOU LIKE I SEE A FLOWER

441
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,528
Thanks.

442
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,200
It feels so nice.

443
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:59,539
I never expected him to get me a book

444
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,710
because we went to the library together.

445
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,503
Then he said it was for me.

446
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,798
That was pretty romantic.

447
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,551
It was quite romantic.

448
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,887
She thought that was romantic!

449
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,597
-Finally she did.
-Finally.

450
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,514
Book confession?

451
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,059
Nothing's ever been so romantic
to her before.

452
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,273
That looks like you.

453
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,235
-Squirtle?
-Yes.

454
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,738
-Do I look like Squirtle?
-Yes.

455
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,200
And what's this?

456
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,286
I read it, and I really liked the book.

457
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:45,001
It means I see her like she's a flower.

458
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,462
Yes.

459
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:53,009
The title of the book is pretty. So I
thought it's perfect for someone pretty.

460
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,095
That's why I chose it.

461
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,055
Do you want to go now?

462
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,140
-No.
-Do you want to stay?

463
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,934
-Let's stay a little longer.
-Okay.

464
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,314
-My goodness.
-Se-yeon.

465
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,440
-Se-yeon…
-My gosh.

466
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,443
My gosh. I'm getting goosebumps. Se-yeon.

467
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,487
It's The Man Who Laughs.

468
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,573
It's you. You're hot when you laugh.

469
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,869
-You should laugh more often.
-Thanks.

470
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,625
Since I got here,

471
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,837
I never had a chance
to be alone with a girl.

472
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,422
That was the first time.

473
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,758
When we were walking down
the stairs, we found a big mirror.

474
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,803
We stood across the mirror.

475
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,973
Good. That's my routine.

476
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:44,144
Even that was fun and romantic.

477
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,063
That's what happened.

478
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:52,444
That rarely happens in real life.

479
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:56,531
In the library, he said,
"I picked this book for you."

480
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,368
I liked the fact that
it happened in the library.

481
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,537
It was romantic.

482
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,790
Q. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOMEWORK?

483
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,751
I'm going to give it to Sang-won.

484
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,045
Hang on.

485
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,713
-Sang-won?
-"It was romantic."

486
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,798
"But I'm giving it to Sang-won." Why?

487
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,092
I don't get it.

488
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,471
-She's so goofy.
-I want to hear her reason.

489
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,477
I want to give it to Sang-won

490
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,605
because from what I've seen, he's the type

491
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,649
who wouldn't talk about his problems.

492
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,778
So I wanted to tell him
he doesn't have to suffer alone.

493
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,947
Sometimes he can lean on others.

494
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,370
I hope we get close enough
for him to tell me about his problems,

495
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,373
and I can give him advice.

496
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,751
-Like friends.
-Like best friends.

497
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,504
"Tell me all your problems."

498
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,214
Because it's the first time.

499
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,394
So simple.

500
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,190
HOPE YOU LIKE THE BOOK!
MERRY CHRISTMAS

501
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,075
What?

502
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,037
What? How come no one's here?

503
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,750
-It's cold.
-My.

504
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,628
Do you want the last Pepero?

505
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,964
I'll have one. Just one.

506
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,841
Here you are.

507
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,385
-Thank you.
-Sure.

508
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,267
I'm going to sit by the heater.

509
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,395
My body feels so stiff.

510
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,897
I can't wait to get changed
and start stretching.

511
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,108
I feel so restless.

512
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,320
-Do you like to play sports?
-What?

513
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,073
-Do you like to play sports?
-My body makes sounds.

514
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,160
My hip joint makes
that cracking sound a lot.

515
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,371
-Do you like to play sports?
-Sports?

516
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,584
I used to play a sport.
I said I used to dance.

517
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,960
Right.

518
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,629
But I do like to play sports.

519
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,089
Dance?

520
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,007
Yes.

521
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,302
What's that?

522
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,644
-"Echoes of the Day."
-"Echoes of the Day."

523
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,646
What's it about?

524
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,024
There's a letter.

525
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,196
I won't look. Read.

526
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,157
I CHOSE THIS BOOK

527
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,118
BECAUSE I WILL NOT FORGET
THE ECHO FROM YOUR STOMACH TODAY

528
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,077
What does it say?

529
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,084
When I first found it in the drawer,

530
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,462
I was curious who wrote it.

531
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,714
But I was more grateful
that someone wrote to me.

532
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,716
I think it's from Hee-ji.

533
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,721
In the postcard, it says something about
my stomach growling.

534
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,431
I'm suddenly hungrier.

535
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,268
She was next to me,
so she heard my stomach growling.

536
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,773
I wrote to Se-yeon.

537
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,235
His stomach growled.

538
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,111
I thought that was funny.

539
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,032
I'd never forget it, so I chose that book.

540
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,243
That way, he can guess her.

541
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,999
This is crazy. Se-yeon and Ye-rin…

542
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,503
I mean, Se-yeon
made a few remarkable speeches.

543
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,547
He looks gentle,
but he's very straightforward.

544
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,507
-He doesn't hesitate…
-Right.

545
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,176
to express his feelings.

546
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,972
I think Ye-rin had no feelings for him
until this incident.

547
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,598
-Her heart probably fluttered.
-Yes.

548
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,975
-She was shy.
-Right.

549
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
I'm gonna try a library date one day.

550
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,647
-I'm going to do that.
-I want to do it.

551
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,716
SANG-WON'S LOCKER

552
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,654
I kept thinking about Sang-won,
so I gave the book to him.

553
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,157
Although that book…

554
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,909
MY TOMORROW, YOUR YESTERDAY

555
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,537
…didn't have a happy ending,
I remember I enjoyed reading it.

556
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,917
I wanted him to feel how I felt.

557
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,126
So I chose the book.

558
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,087
Q. WEREN'T YOU GOING TO
EXCHANGE BOOKS WITH JI-MIN?

559
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,549
I will talk to Ji-min about it.

560
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:12,305
If he wrote to me,

561
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,350
I'd feel very sorry.

562
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:22,565
I'm not sure how I should bring this up.

563
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,528
That's kind of awkward.
How is she going to tell him?

564
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,572
-I doubt he'd give it to her.
-Ji-min…

565
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,367
Ji-min might have forgotten he said that.

566
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,118
I think Ji-min will write to her.

567
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,788
He went to the library with Seo-yeong.

568
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,414
You never know what'll happen.

569
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,960
It's kind of…

570
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,004
Lonely, but not lonely, yet lonely.

571
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,882
Hi.

572
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,305
Do you want to sit here?

573
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,265
-It's warm here.
-Okay.

574
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,642
Is it warm?

575
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,394
I warmed it up.

576
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,478
Move.

577
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,775
Wonder what we're doing in PE.

578
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,152
I can't wait.

579
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,287
I have something to say.

580
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,206
To Ji-min.

581
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,041
Come here.

582
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,043
What's it about?

583
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,963
-It's scaring me.
-You guys are scaring me.

584
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,507
What's going on?

585
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,092
Why are they having a meeting?

586
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,731
I doubt you can hear them like that.

587
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,898
No, I can't.

588
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,993
What's going on?

589
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,204
They're suspicious.

590
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,041
-My goodness.
-I know I promised.

591
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,625
-Wait. So, tell me.
-Okay.

592
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,712
So I went with Seo-yeong to the library.

593
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,382
She asked me whom I was writing to.

594
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,761
-What's this?
-Have you decided?

595
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,763
What's this? Oh, me?

596
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,057
Seo-hyeon and I agreed to exchange.

597
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,267
-What? Seo-hyeon?
-Yes.

598
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,770
-When we were first assigned,
-Yes.

599
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,774
we thought no one would write to us,
so we decided to write to each other.

600
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,656
-You fool.
-Seo-yeong.

601
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,700
-She's frozen.
-Yes!

602
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,536
Ji-min just realized something went wrong.

603
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,080
"This is wrong."

604
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,458
What book should I pick?

605
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,546
Do you want to write to each other?

606
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,631
Shall we?

607
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,633
-Sure.
-Sure.

608
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,969
What did you say you like?

609
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,971
-I like books about World Wars.
-Okay.

610
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,598
Then I'll go with this.

611
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,644
I told her I'll tell you
I decided to write to her.

612
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,479
I kind of knew this would happen.

613
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,523
What happened?

614
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,903
If there's someone you want to write to,
feel free to.

615
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,864
-Is that what you were going to tell me?
-Yes.

616
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,158
Because I…

617
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,119
-To whom? Tell me.
-It's a secret.

618
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,162
-No, I don't want to.
-But I told you.

619
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,498
Hey, you were obvious.

620
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,291
Still, who?

621
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,545
-Sang-won?
-Oh, Sang-won?

622
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,630
Good.

623
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:38,177
So, I thought
we should write to the person we want.

624
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,512
-Good idea.
-Good idea.

625
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,639
-What a coincidence.
-I know.

626
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,183
I was going to tell you, and you were too.

627
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,019
This is perfect. Sang-won is a nice guy.

628
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,813
-Yes.
-Yes.

629
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,899
This is why the snack shop lady
knows everything.

630
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,985
That's true.

631
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,903
-She's there.
-"That's cute."

632
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,614
It must be fun for her
to hear all their stories.

633
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,789
Someone left it on my desk.

634
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,757
HI, JI-MIN. ENJOY THE BOOK.
I WANT TO KNOW YOU MORE.

635
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,218
HOPE WE BECOME FRIENDS!
BYE, MERRY CHRISTMAS

636
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,371
-She can't hide it.
-She's happy.

637
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,457
Seo-yeong can't lie.

638
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:56,005
I'M WRITING TO YOU HOPING YOUR GRAPH
WILL GO UP MORE. LET'S BE FRIENDS.

639
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:00,635
I picked a book on history
because Seo-yeong likes that.

640
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,347
And Seo-yeong got me Ragdoll,

641
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,807
which I always wanted to read.

642
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:13,189
Ji-min and I agreed
to exchange, so I saw it coming.

643
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,899
But it still felt nice.

644
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,486
-Have you decided?
-No.

645
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,655
To whom should I give the book?

646
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,365
To the person you want.

647
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,325
Or think like this.

648
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,619
Give it to someone who's hard to approach.

649
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,788
It'll give you a chance. That'd work.

650
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,122
There are many reasons.

651
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,210
Whom should I give it to?

652
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,303
Jung-yun is still contemplating.

653
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:48,140
He's not sure who
he should give it to or who he likes yet.

654
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,560
Jung-yun is very timid
because he has no experience.

655
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,561
Right.

656
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,188
One day,

657
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,400
when he meets someone
who expresses her feelings to him,

658
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,860
-he'd fall in love with her right away.
-Yeah.

659
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,904
To the person who shows interest first?

660
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,990
-Right now, he's not sure.
-He's being careful.

661
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,539
GET CHANGED AND GATHER IN THE GYM

662
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,001
Let me open the door for you.

663
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,585
What are we doing?

664
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,504
-I'm curious.
-I can't wait.

665
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,880
Hello.

666
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,257
PE
INSTRUCTOR KANG DO-HYUN

667
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,967
What do you have today?

668
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,385
PE!

669
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,972
My name is Kang Do-hyun.
I'm your PE teacher.

670
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,599
In this class,

671
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,060
you're going to pair up
for an athletic competition.

672
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm going to give each girl two vests.

673
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,067
After spinning ten times
while holding your nose like an elephant,

674
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,822
run to the boy
you want to partner up with,

675
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,907
and give him the vest.

676
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,534
Got it?

677
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,785
It's first come, first serve.

678
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,622
So the first person who gives you a vest
will become your partner.

679
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,126
Decide whom you want carefully.

680
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,963
I think they're going to express
their feelings more now for this.

681
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,549
This isn't going to be easy.

682
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,592
I can't wait.

683
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,267
Why am I nervous? I'm nervous.

684
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,479
Why am I getting nervous?

685
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,860
Get ready.

686
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,531
-One.
-One.

687
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,700
-Two.
-Three, four.

688
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,160
Five, six.

689
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,119
-Five.
-Seven.

690
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,332
They're so fast.

691
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,293
Eight, nine, ten!

692
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,924
-Hee-ji. I knew it.
-It's Hee-ji.

693
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,509
-She'd choose Se-yeon.
-She's running.

694
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,302
-I think it's Se-yeon.
-Yeah.

695
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,480
I'll help you put it on.

696
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,648
HEE-JI CHOSE JI-MIN

697
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,484
Wait. Ji-min?

698
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,111
Ji-min?

699
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,490
Thank you.

700
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,910
Ji-min is athletic.

701
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,330
I also wanted to test my teamwork
with the class president.

702
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,873
That's why I chose him.

703
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,210
-She just wanted to win.
-They're in charge of the class.

704
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,712
-She's just competitive.
-Games are all about winning.

705
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,881
Right. That makes sense for athletes.

706
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,052
One, two, three, four, five,

707
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,680
six…

708
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,974
Nine, ten.

709
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,522
Wait.

710
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,609
YE-RIN CHOSE SE-YEON

711
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,823
-"I will go to you like a flower."
-Great.

712
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,869
Eight, nine, ten!

713
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,457
I'm so dizzy. Who's that?

714
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:10,968
Hello.

715
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,261
SEO-YEONG CHOSE JUNG-YUN

716
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,804
Oh, my gosh.

717
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,556
He already got the vest.

718
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,932
That's really awkward.

719
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,267
Oh, my gosh.

720
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,603
Do you feel confident?

721
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,855
Let's do this, class president.

722
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,611
We'll win and get fried chicken.

723
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,112
Though I don't know the prize.

724
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,995
Ten.

725
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,626
Wait.

726
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,627
Wait.

727
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,301
Where is everyone? Sang-won…

728
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,139
Sorry. I took so long.

729
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,350
Sorry.

730
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,271
-Sorry. I took so long.
-No.

731
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,356
SEO-HYEON CHOSE SANG-WON

732
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,690
I'm so dizzy.

733
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:10,194
Are you okay? You kept moving backward.

734
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,406
It felt strange when Seo-hyeon chose me.

735
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,202
I partnered up
with the girl I wanted in the end,

736
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,955
but I'm not sure
if she felt the same about me.

737
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,625
I was happy but a little iffy.

738
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,878
Sang-won was my first choice
from the start.

739
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:32,633
I thought, "I'm glad I got Sang-won."

740
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,054
That's really cool.

741
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,099
When there's only one person left,
it's hard to think that way.

742
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,268
She thinks she won him.

743
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,061
-I know. She was just last.
-Yes.

744
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,231
-That's wonderful.
-You're right.

745
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:54,196
The first game is the three-legged race
with your partners.

746
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,864
-Three-legged race.
-Not a problem.

747
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,866
Never played it before.

748
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,867
Never?

749
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,578
No rush.

750
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,998
There's the halfway point.

751
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,958
Pass the halfway point,

752
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,752
and the team
that reaches the flag first wins.

753
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,670
Okay!

754
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,381
How should I hold you?

755
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:13,716
Hold onto me.

756
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,010
I shouldn't hold onto you.

757
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,220
You should hold me and lean on me.

758
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,472
-Like this?
-You can do that if you want.

759
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,642
Take two steps holding onto me.

760
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,019
One, two, three.

761
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,978
Don't go yet.

762
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,982
-Wait, it's one, two, three, one.
-Okay.

763
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,192
-Okay? One, two, three.
-Yes. One…

764
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,820
-That's how you move. Okay?
-Yes.

765
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:35,738
Okay.

766
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,531
-Do you want to try?
-Hold my shoulder.

767
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,490
Ready?

768
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,825
-So…
-Wait.

769
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,787
-Can you do it?
-Look at them.

770
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,206
-One, two.
-Look at them.

771
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,333
Stop. Turn.

772
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,585
-They're very good.
-What just happened?

773
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,211
How are they doing it?

774
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,213
They're athletes.

775
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,550
-One, two.
-One, two.

776
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,135
No way. Hey.

777
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,094
-Go.
-Let's go.

778
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,347
One, two.

779
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,641
-Oh, my gosh.
-Want me to take bigger strides?

780
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,476
-So tiring.
-I'll go on your pace.

781
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,769
I'm so tired.

782
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,520
-One, two.
-One, two.

783
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,358
-One, two.
-One, two.

784
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,818
-I'm so tired.
-All you need is strength.

785
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,075
Are you okay?

786
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,370
Don't mind the others.
Just keep your pace.

787
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,080
Second place? No, first place.

788
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,040
-First place.
-First place or nothing!

789
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,959
We need to watch out for them.

790
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,503
The green.

791
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,505
They can't do anything about it.

792
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,548
They were like Usain Bolt.

793
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:37,966
Get ready.

794
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,474
-Go.
-One, two.

795
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,102
-One, two.
-One, two.

796
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:52,439
-One, two.
-One, two.

797
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,941
-Hop.
-Hop.

798
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:54,942
-One, two.
-Okay.

799
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,944
One, two. Two.

800
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,779
HEE-JI & JI-MIN TANGLED UP

801
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,448
-One, two.
-One, two.

802
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,159
-One, two.
-One, two.

803
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,369
One, two.

804
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,537
One, two.

805
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,831
-One, two.
-One, two.

806
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,834
One, two.

807
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,714
SEO-HYEON & SANG-WON FIRST PLACE

808
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,049
Forget it. Let's just go.

809
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,510
HEE-JI & JI-MIN SECOND PLACE

810
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,387
We're last.

811
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,015
Get the flag. Don't miss it.

812
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,393
SEO-YEONG & JUNG-YUN THIRD PLACE

813
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,311
-We have to get the flag?
-The flag.

814
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,524
Hurry up and get it.

815
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,151
YE-RIN & SE-YEON FOURTH PLACE

816
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,987
First place goes to Team Red!
Congratulations.

817
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,488
Nice.

818
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,699
-Good.
-That was perfect.

819
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,785
We came up with a plan to hop.

820
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,164
We were going to hop
when we passed the halfway point.

821
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,748
It worked perfectly.

822
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,376
I was happy to win
the first place with Sang-won.

823
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,962
-Good job.
-We got the flag first.

824
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,255
It's not over yet.

825
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,090
We still have the second game left.

826
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,135
The second game is partner dodgeball.

827
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,261
What is it?

828
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,305
-Partner dodgeball.
-Partner dodgeball.

829
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,599
Have you heard of bodyguard dodgeball?

830
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,976
First and fourth places are a team,

831
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,605
and second and third places are together.

832
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,565
That's how you're going to play.

833
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,027
I'll explain it to you.
You must stay within the red line.

834
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,696
You're going to stand in a line.

835
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:25,616
Only the person in front
can throw the ball.

836
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,451
And the most important part,

837
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,661
you aren't eliminated if
the front person is hit.

838
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,747
You must hit the person in the back.

839
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,083
-Hey.
-Hi, team red chili paste.

840
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,295
-I'm scared of the baseball player.
-Me too.

841
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,172
-His fastball is 130km/h.
-They're scary.

842
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,716
They have the eagle eye
and the baseball player.

843
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,551
I'm so scared!

844
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,428
-Sorry.
-Don't be.

845
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,597
We're safe. I'm getting all the balls.

846
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,184
I can take hits.

847
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,436
Okay.

848
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,941
-I haven't played this for so long.
-Same.

849
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,943
I'll block them all.

850
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,698
-Just watch your feet.
-Okay.

851
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,326
-That seems exciting.
-That looks fun.

852
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,662
-The fact someone's protecting you.
-Yes.

853
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,747
-That's romantic.
-Yes.

854
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,541
Get ready.

855
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,924
I'm suddenly getting scared.

856
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,051
Watch the line.

857
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,554
Gosh.

858
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:30,847
Gosh.

859
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,935
So close.

860
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,735
-I'll do my best.
-Okay.

861
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,905
Hey. That's cheap.

862
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,323
Hey!

863
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,661
That was scary.

864
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,580
-What?
-Line out.

865
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,623
-What?
-You stepped on the line.

866
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:58,959
Line out.

867
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,545
Let it slide just for once.

868
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,839
-No.
-What are we? Fools?

869
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,218
-Good shot.
-Good shot.

870
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,887
-Line out.
-Sorry!

871
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,390
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

872
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,142
-I'm scared.
-Get ready.

873
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,566
-Sorry.
-Nice.

874
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,236
Hurry!

875
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,495
Hold me.

876
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,002
-Here.
-Nice.

877
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:42,919
Here.

878
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,297
Sorry.

879
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,800
-That's so cool.
-He blocked it.

880
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,636
-So fast.
-He protected her.

881
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,348
-"Come here."
-He's doing his best to block it.

882
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,851
Are you okay?

883
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,107
Nice.

884
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,736
Nice.

885
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,279
You got hit! Out!

886
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,907
-Sorry.
-It's one on one.

887
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,825
You never know. It's not over yet.

888
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,204
If you hit them now, you win.

889
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,121
Get ready.

890
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,756
-Okay. Slowly.
-He's flying.

891
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,842
-Seo-hyeon.
-Sorry.

892
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,886
-My bad.
-Slowly.

893
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,104
Don't hit me!

894
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,067
Nice!

895
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,694
Nice!

896
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,747
-Way to go!
-That was close.

897
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,833
Did she get hit?

898
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,252
-Too bad.
-Still, they were good.

899
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,336
They did their best.

900
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,298
We were amazing.

901
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,342
-Are you okay?
-That was perfect.

902
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,594
-Where did you get hit?
-My stomach.

903
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,721
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

904
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,806
I should've caught it.

905
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,602
I did my best.

906
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,439
But Ye-rin still got hit.

907
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,275
I failed to protect her.

908
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,739
It might have hurt. I felt sorry.

909
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,782
Just wrap it around.

910
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,868
Is that supposed to be there?

911
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,828
Come here.

912
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,042
I guess my hair was messy.

913
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:50,088
He fixed my hair.
At that moment, Se-yeon was…

914
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,801
"Did you just make my heart flutter?"

915
00:50:55,635 --> 00:51:00,390
I want to get closer to Se-yeon,
so I can feel that again.

916
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,602
-Well done.
-Really.

917
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,563
Good job.

918
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,025
Sang-won is very tall.

919
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,236
When he held me…

920
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,866
I've never met any male friend
who's tall like him,

921
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,035
and I've never felt protected before.

922
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,497
I felt like a princess.

923
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,209
Well done.

924
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,170
We are

925
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,923
both athletic.

926
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,550
We're both very competitive.

927
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,511
It was so much fun.

928
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,514
Nothing made my heart flutter in class.

929
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,684
All I thought about was winning the game.

930
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,853
Rather than romantic feelings,

931
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,147
I was amazed by Hee-ji.

932
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,526
She was faster and better
than I thought. I was amazed.

933
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,486
Q. ANY HEART FLUTTERING MOMENT?

934
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,655
No.

935
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,368
I should try to talk to them more

936
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,579
and get to know them.

937
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,956
-Good job.
-Good job.

938
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,543
-Jung-yun is…
-That's okay.

939
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,628
He's busy adapting to the new environment.

940
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,922
He's never been to coed school before.

941
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:19,636
But coed school isn't so hard to adapt to.

942
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,474
When you're 19 or 20,
your emotions change so quickly.

943
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,893
-Right.
-You feel flustered by something trivial.

944
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,979
This might change his feelings.

945
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,772
Your feelings can change any time.

946
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,941
Right. That's the fun part.

947
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,112
-It's the next day.
-Right.

948
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:43,368
UNTIL 20
D-5

949
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,913
-Jung-yun. Had a good rest?
-No.

950
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,540
-Why not?
-I couldn't rest well.

951
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,083
-How come?
-It was uncomfortable.

952
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,544
-Why? Did you work out again yesterday?
-Yes.

953
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,754
You can never hold back.

954
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,214
From today, I start--

955
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,924
-Start exercising?
-No, training.

956
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,342
-Your training begins?
-Yes.

957
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,427
-After this?
-After this.

958
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,889
-I shouldn't fall behind.
-That's amazing.

959
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,767
So, who did you want to give the book to?

960
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,604
-You had someone in mind.
-Yes.

961
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,938
Didn't I tell you?

962
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,566
No, you didn't.

963
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,569
Is it okay to say it?

964
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,447
-Do you have one?
-Yes.

965
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,449
I gave it to Sang-won.

966
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,783
Sang-won?

967
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,370
You and I chose
the same person. I did too.

968
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,166
But not because I like him.

969
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,712
Don't worry, girl.

970
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,672
Why? What do you mean?

971
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,382
Is there a guy you like?

972
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,720
But I don't know
how it'll turn out because it's…

973
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,223
-Confusing.
-Your feelings?

974
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,100
-Yes…
-You think you're going too fast?

975
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,896
They're just friends.
The boys are nothing more than friends.

976
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,399
No matter how nice they are,
they never made my heart flutter.

977
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,611
But my heart fluttered
in the library yesterday.

978
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,695
Who was it?

979
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,239
-Se-yeon?
-Yes.

980
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,202
What happened?

981
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:12,082
So, that day, after school,
I was on my bed.

982
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,501
I usually don't think before going to bed.

983
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,044
Then Se-yeon popped in my head.

984
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,422
I couldn't stop thinking
about the time in the library.

985
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,132
What did you do?

986
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,801
He gave me the book there.

987
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,721
-Se-yeon?
-Se-yeon gave me the book.

988
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,306
No, you can take it.

989
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,393
He gave me the book
like we were in a drama.

990
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,688
-Is this for me?
-Yes.

991
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,023
You should read it.
It looks like a good book.

992
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,566
-Really?
-Yes.

993
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,360
Do you want to go now?

994
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,362
-No.
-Do you want to stay?

995
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,072
-Let's stay a little longer.
-Okay.

996
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,411
When I said let's go, he wanted to stay.

997
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,246
I kept thinking about that.

998
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,581
-Why?
-Do I really get flustered this easily?

999
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,375
Why did he want to stay?

1000
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,543
I don't know!

1001
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,753
Wait.

1002
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:06,886
Hey.

1003
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,639
He's playing with my heart. He…

1004
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,683
-He…
-He's guilty for that.

1005
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,518
Totally. He deserves a life sentence.

1006
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,901
-My. She couldn't sleep?
-Really?

1007
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,112
What? But she said
her heart never fluttered before.

1008
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,072
Her heart fluttered
as soon as she got here.

1009
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,117
-Is everyone here?
-I think so.

1010
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,372
-Hello.
-Hello.

1011
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,999
It seems like you guys are having fun.

1012
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,710
Good.

1013
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,296
How's school?

1014
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,298
-Having a good time?
-Yes.

1015
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,466
Yes.

1016
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:49,471
Today, we have a new student.

1017
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,805
We have a new student.

1018
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,105
I never

1019
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,316
saw that coming.

1020
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,694
-I bet they're excited.
-My goodness.

1021
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,198
Is it a girl or a boy?

1022
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,826
-Nice. I'm getting excited.
-Me too.

1023
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,631
-It's one each!
-There are two!

1024
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,426
This will be a game changer.

1025
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,556
I'm getting excited.

1026
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,067
Come in.

1027
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,694
Already?

1028
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,905
-Now?
-They're here now?

1029
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,373
