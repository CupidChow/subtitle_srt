NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,558
About that…

13
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,227
One second.

14
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,896
Actually, never mind.

15
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,522
I'll come back later. Bye.

16
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,693
Oh, my.

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,653
What's wrong?

18
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,202
Oh, my goodness.

19
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,626
My goodness.

20
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,879
-My goodness.
-That's so scary.

21
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,673
-Seriously.
-It's like a horror story.

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,634
-I have goosebumps.
-For real.

23
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,970
Oh, my.

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,139
What's wrong?

25
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,766
-This is ridiculous.
-What is?

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,311
Those two? What's ridiculous?

27
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,860
This is so ridiculous.

28
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,238
Look, I…

29
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,534
I told Seo-hyeon
as objectively as possible,

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,080
and I didn't count my feelings
or Sang-won's feelings in when I did.

31
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,874
I told her she should take things easy.

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,336
And Sang-won showed up and told her
not to be swayed by what I said.

33
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,801
-Do they know you're in here?
-No.

34
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,805
I was in the restroom and…

35
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
I'm sorry, but can you go

36
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,479
and tell them you have something
to say to Seo-hyeon?

37
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,190
-I need to talk to her.
-To Seo-hyeon? Okay.

38
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,988
-Just make Sang-won leave.
-Okay.

39
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:47,083
Hey. I need to…

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,378
There's something I need to tell
Seo-hyeon, so…

41
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,838
-You want me to leave?
-Yes.

42
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,340
Was it a serious conversation?

43
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,968
-It's fine. You two can talk.
-Okay.

44
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,678
Call me when you're done.

45
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,306
Yes, sorry about that.

46
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,391
What's going on?

47
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,521
I heard everything.

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,566
Didn't you know I was in the restroom?
Come here.

49
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,026
I need to tell you something.

50
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,110
I'll give you guys some privacy.

51
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,821
-Oh, no…
-I'll give you guys some privacy.

52
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,781
-Didn't you know I was in there?
-No.

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,576
I heard everything he said.

54
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,535
Come sit here.

55
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,787
Hey, I'm like…

56
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,332
I can tell you everything.
I have nothing to hide.

57
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,250
Sit. I heard everything you said.

58
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,419
I'm touched.

59
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,545
-Seriously?
-Yes.

60
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,006
Seo-hyeon, I just made up my mind.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,345
I just realized that friendship is
all that matters to me here.

62
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,764
-Really?
-Yes, I'm disappointed in him big time.

63
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,266
When you walked out, it was like…

64
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,727
Felt like a movie?

65
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,896
I was like, "What is going on?"

66
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,446
Sit down and wait.

67
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,200
What did you talk about?

68
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,826
About what I'm feeling now.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,456
-How's your situation going?
-What?

70
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:10,959
-Me?
-Yes.

71
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,211
-Good?
-Yes.

72
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,509
Why are you down?

73
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,179
It's just that you looked tired.

74
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,597
-Me?
-Yes.

75
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,724
-Now?
-Now and earlier.

76
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,725
-Earlier?
-Yes.

77
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,394
-When?
-The whole time.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,854
The whole time? On the date? No.

79
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,565
Come on. You're worrying about nothing.

80
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,359
Why?

81
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,236
Don't worry.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,197
I was so worried about you.

83
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,784
Who else is home?

84
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,287
Hee-ji's there. Where's Seo-yeong?

85
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,204
-Who?
-Seo-yeong.

86
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,122
Seo-yeong.

87
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,540
-Where is she?
-Not sure.

88
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,042
Why?

89
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,712
Isn't she in the room?

90
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,921
That's not good.

91
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,006
The room? Why not?

92
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,842
Nothing.

93
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,595
-What's wrong?
-What?

94
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,931
Can you check if Seo-yeong's
in the girl's room?

95
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,641
-What's wrong?
-What?

96
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,311
-I wish I'm wrong.
-What?

97
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,563
What? What's going on?

98
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,731
What is it?

99
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,982
I'll tell you later.

100
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,822
Oh, you scared me.

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
What's going on?

102
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,542
I'm anxious. She's not coming back.

103
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,130
Maybe she's in the room.

104
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,631
What did you say?

105
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:45,303
Seo-hyeon talks to Seo-yeong
a lot about what she's going through.

106
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,097
I thought whatever Seo-yeong said
wouldn't help me.

107
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,310
So I told her she shouldn't take what
Seo-yeong says too seriously.

108
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,604
I think she's in the room.

109
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,189
-I know.
-She's not coming back.

110
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,857
She's in the room.

111
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,695
Oh, no. Sang-won.

112
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,907
Was she in the room?

113
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,742
Was she in the room?

114
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,535
Was she in the room?

115
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,288
I mean, was she in the room?
Say something.

116
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,372
I bet she was.

117
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,958
-She was. She heard everything.
-What happened?

118
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,668
-She heard everything.
-What happened?

119
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,545
What do you think?

120
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,007
I mean, of course she's upset.

121
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,675
He was talking behind her back.

122
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,136
-So she was in the room.
-She heard everything.

123
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,429
My goodness.

124
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,519
I think I'm about to lose it, guys.

125
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,067
What the heck!

126
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,736
Man, I think I'm going crazy.

127
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,407
Stop!

128
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,332
Even we're like this.

129
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,042
-It'd be worse for them.
-Yeah.

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,503
They need to watch this.
They'd be shocked.

131
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,839
-Must be tough for them.
-I bet.

132
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,758
Watch your mouth.

133
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,220
First of all, I felt bad.

134
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,431
I shouldn't say anything
that would offend others.

135
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,102
I was too focused on my feelings
while I was talking.

136
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,230
I think I said those things
because I felt a bit anxious.

137
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,941
So I said I was sorry
and talked to her privately.

138
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay. What are you sorry about?

139
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,072
Have a seat.

140
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,493
After I talked to her and came outside,
I realized you weren't there.

141
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,911
So I was like, "No way!"

142
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,623
You'd probably know if you heard me.

143
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,793
It wasn't really about you.
It was more about how anxious I am now.

144
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,254
I think I was feeling a bit impatient.

145
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,548
Whatever my intention was,

146
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,510
I talked behind your back and
you heard it.

147
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,347
Regardless of my intentions,
it must've hurt your feelings.

148
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,017
So I want to apologize to you

149
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,562
for talking behind your back like that.

150
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,522
-Okay.
-I'm really sorry.

151
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,690
Okay, all right.

152
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,736
Okay. Let's go.

153
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,621
At first, I still felt offended
even after he apologized.

154
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,500
But when I thought about it,
he sounded sincere.

155
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:26,088
I was grateful
about how he apologized with sincerity.

156
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:32,929
So I thought highly of him for doing that.

157
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,973
-Seo-yeong is a nice girl.
-She's very mature.

158
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,434
She didn't get mad at him for saying that.

159
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,187
I guess Sang-won was very anxious.

160
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,980
As you probably all know,

161
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,775
when you're anxious
or you focus too much on your emotions,

162
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,693
it's hard to consider how others feel.

163
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,488
Sang-won said that Seo-hyeon felt cold.

164
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:55,493
I'm sure he kept thinking,
"Maybe it was because of this,"

165
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,702
and became nervous.

166
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,789
-He exaggerated it in his head.
-Yes.

167
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,460
It's not exactly a big mistake,

168
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:09,507
but she ended up hearing it,
and he apologized right away.

169
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,678
He admitted it, accepted that he was wrong
and apologized right away. He was cool.

170
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,681
-What?
-What?

171
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,604
-I'm sorry. And I was worried.
-Why? Why are you sorry?

172
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,985
You haven't been in a good mood
since yesterday.

173
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,862
-Me?
-Yes, you seemed like it.

174
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,535
I even wondered
if I was giving you a hard time.

175
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,706
-Not at all.
-Really?

176
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,623
Yeah.

177
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,417
When I'm…

178
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,461
with you,

179
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,006
I can't stop smiling.
You never give me a hard time.

180
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,009
It's impossible to have such feelings.

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,678
-Really?
-Yes.

182
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,180
That's a relief.

183
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,182
I'll sleep well tonight.

184
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,227
That's cute.

185
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,897
During the drive back,
I was thinking of all sorts of things.

186
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,233
"What if she can't come back?"

187
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,903
-"That'd drive me crazy."
-That's absurd.

188
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,780
I had fun today.

189
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,993
It's been fun since you joined.

190
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,995
Every single day was fun.

191
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,331
What a coincidence

192
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,000
that we got to sit together.

193
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,627
I was so happy.

194
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,379
I think Pyeong-seok can sit here.

195
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,298
Come here.

196
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,098
Isn't this awkward?

197
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,066
What if…

198
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,655
you sat next to someone else?

199
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
I would've talked even less.

200
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,578
I wouldn't even have smiled.

201
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,581
You do it all the time.

202
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,295
-Not true.
-It's true.

203
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,215
But even if we weren't seatmates…

204
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,806
Do you like me?

205
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,856
"Do you like me?"

206
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,401
Do you like me?

207
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,200
That's all that matters.

208
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,452
Stop smiling.

209
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,337
Seriously.

210
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,472
What are you doing?

211
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,182
I mean…

212
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,143
What?

213
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,770
Why do you keep taking
ugly pictures of me?

214
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,732
What?

215
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,942
It's only for me to look at.

216
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,153
Come on.

217
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,700
So round.

218
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,852
Both look pretty.

219
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,732
Come in.

220
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,275
You see…

221
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
It's okay. Come in.

222
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,070
Where's Pyeong-seok?

223
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,197
Is he beside you?

224
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,160
Sorry. I'll be quick.

225
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,207
What… What are you doing?

226
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,835
I know I'm not welcome here,
but don't make it so obvious. I'll go.

227
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,546
I only looked at him.
I wasn't trying to make him leave.

228
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,094
Your hair.

229
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,974
You look like a puppy shaking off water.

230
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,436
Time really flies.

231
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,858
I don't know how I'll go on next week.

232
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,611
I won't be able to carry on.

233
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,867
I'll get it for you.

234
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,661
-No, I'm…
-You're carrying the eggs.

235
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,788
You first.

236
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,293
They're here.

237
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,466
They bought something.

238
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,135
-What did they buy?
-What did they buy?

239
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,763
What did you buy?

240
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,557
Did you buy snacks?

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
They bought some stuff.

242
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,768
Nice.

243
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,562
-What's this?
-Perfume.

244
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,064
What took you all day?

245
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,525
We had pork belly today.

246
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,194
Good job. What's this?

247
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,195
Give me a second.

248
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,324
Okay.

249
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,784
-Hey, Ji-woo.
-Yes?

250
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,203
-Can we talk? Just take off your jacket.
-Okay.

251
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,289
-Give me a sec.
-Okay.

252
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,838
Go, Jung-yun!

253
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,798
Go!

254
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,300
-Do you want one?
-No.

255
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,471
I'm so tired.

256
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,557
I nearly passed out.

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,267
It's because you came back late.

258
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,686
It's because I went grocery shopping.

259
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,814
-Where did you go?
-The place we went to last time.

260
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
This room feels like my room now.

261
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,904
Take it then.

262
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,322
Should I?

263
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,491
Why are you mad?

264
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,327
-I'm not.
-Let me take this.

265
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,581
I just wanted to know what you did.

266
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,374
We made perfume.

267
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,669
I don't like it.

268
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,797
-Doesn't smell good.
-Se-yeon made it for me.

269
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,925
-I don't like it.
-We made it for each other.

270
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,302
You don't? I love it.

271
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,014
What did you do today?
You went climbing, right?

272
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,391
Climbing? You think I could enjoy it?

273
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,228
If it weren't for you,
I would've mastered climbing by now.

274
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,106
-I almost got recruited.
-Why are you mad?

275
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,983
-I'm not.
-I want to pet you.

276
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,568
-I'm not mad.
-Why are you mad?

277
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,486
I said I'm not.

278
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,864
You should've asked me out earlier.
Wait. You didn't even ask me out.

279
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,076
He was already talking to you
when I was away for a second.

280
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,286
He's expressing his feelings now.

281
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,163
-He's going out of control.
-Yeah.

282
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,915
He's being bold all of a sudden.

283
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,166
Good.

284
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,670
-Why are you mad?
-I'm not.

285
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,339
-You're just suddenly acting cold to me?
-No.

286
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,217
So, how was it?

287
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,511
Tell me.

288
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,222
-I loved the scent.
-No, not that.

289
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,640
Not that.

290
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,557
-How I felt?
-Yes.

291
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,561
I couldn't wait to go on a date with you.

292
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,604
Why?

293
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,232
I told you. I wasn't satisfied with
our last date.

294
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,902
But I enjoyed both dates with Se-yeon.

295
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,947
So I couldn't wait to spend time with you.

296
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,664
I bought strawberries.

297
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,170
Honestly, I thought…

298
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,007
you chose Se-yeon.

299
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,676
What? For a date?

300
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,636
-Not the date, your heart.
-My heart?

301
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
So…

302
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,434
if you'd moved on to him,

303
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,270
I was going to cancel the date tomorrow.

304
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,774
-You were going to call it off?
-If you moved on and chose him.

305
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,401
-Why?
-If your feelings changed.

306
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,111
-For the past two hours…
-Look.

307
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,238
I wanted to ask you about how you felt.

308
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,743
I told you that I was looking forward
to our date tomorrow.

309
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,497
But you were going to call it off?

310
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,251
Fine, don't. Just kidding.

311
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,841
Just ask if I want right or left.

312
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,135
I'll write the name

313
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,179
and say, "Ji-woo, let's go."

314
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,346
-I'll do this.
-Okay.

315
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,766
Ji-woo is very honest.

316
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,645
-She told him that she enjoyed the date.
-She told him everything.

317
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,898
But she also told him that she missed him.

318
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,900
Right. She told him everything.

319
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,110
It seems Ji-woo really likes Jung-yun.

320
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,905
-She likes him a lot.
-She feels comfortable around him.

321
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,198
-She can't hide it.
-Right.

322
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,866
Didn't they look like a couple?

323
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,701
-Right.
-Yeah, like a squabbling couple.

324
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,787
-Yeah.
-A lovely couple.

325
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,623
They looked like two college students
in a relationship.

326
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,333
Let's watch here.

327
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,086
-Sure. It's fun to watch.
-Let's watch.

328
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,102
The dream date will be announced soon.

329
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,269
What's the time?

330
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,188
I can't miss the dream date this time.

331
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,731
-Is it midnight?
-Yes.

332
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,483
Let's go.

333
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,530
The competition's going to be intense.

334
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,448
-Three teams.
-It's intense.

335
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,909
-This date is the most important.
-Very important.

336
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,244
I wonder what they'll be.

337
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,122
-Did everybody get consent?
-Yes.

338
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,748
Got it.

339
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,084
Show me the dream date.

340
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,961
Please reveal…

341
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,421
the dream date!

342
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,924
Ta-da.

343
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,387
-Okay.
-So funny.

344
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,097
Ta-da!

345
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,685
DREAM DATES:
AN OVERNIGHT TRIP TO JEJU ISLAND, GLAMPING

346
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,690
AN OVERNIGHT TRIP TO JEJU ISLAND

347
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:14,695
GLAMPING

348
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,657
-Hey. No.
-That's crazy.

349
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,659
No. Sit down.

350
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,035
-Crazy.
-First come, first served.

351
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,953
-I can't?
-No.

352
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,248
But seriously…

353
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,960
-This is crazy.
-That's insane.

354
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,128
I really want to go.

355
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,754
-We must go.
-Sit down.

356
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,965
Sit down first.

357
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,677
-First, who wants to go?
-Me.

358
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,720
-Jeju?
-Me!

359
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,804
-Me.
-Me.

360
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,681
-Anywhere.
-Jeju.

361
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,394
-Right.
-Jeju no matter what.

362
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,522
-I want to go to Jeju so bad.
-So, two teams?

363
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,443
Hee-ji and Pyeong-seok,
hurry up and choose.

364
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,904
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

365
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,449
The winners choose what they want.
Next winners get what's left.

366
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,742
And nada for the losers.

367
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,203
-Sure.
-That's a good idea.

368
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,496
Gosh, if I miss this…

369
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,624
Rock, paper, scissors?

370
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,877
-One person from each pair.
-Do it all together.

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,504
Both people can do it. Right.

372
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,131
Just do it.

373
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,676
Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors.

374
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,470
Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors.

375
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,597
One person from each team.

376
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,390
One person from each team. Okay.

377
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,517
No way.

378
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,479
This is getting fun. Good job.

379
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,522
Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors.

380
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,607
Rock, paper, scissors.

381
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,320
All right, we have two teams left.

382
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,279
Nice.

383
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,492
The other two chose rock
when I chose paper.

384
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
So I was the winner.

385
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,749
When Ji-min played paper,
I suddenly saw a halo shining on him.

386
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,042
"Ji-min!"

387
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,127
Then I realized

388
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,755
I was hugging Ji-min even before I knew.

389
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,633
I was surprised.

390
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,053
It's okay.

391
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,515
It's Hee-ji and Jung-yun now.
Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors.

392
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,393
Rock, paper, scissors.

393
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,769
Jung-yun wins.

394
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,854
It's okay.

395
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,112
I'm so jealous.

396
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,197
-That's crazy.
-Jeju sounds fun.

397
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,867
It's cool how one person
from each team was left.

398
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,869
That was funny. One from each team.

399
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,331
What a shame.

400
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,583
It's a shame.

401
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,585
Good job, Ji-min.

402
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,963
You guys are so cute.

403
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,798
We need to go pack up.

404
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,925
Sure. Go pack up.

405
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,928
See you tomorrow.

406
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,182
That was cool.

407
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,225
See you tomorrow.

408
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,354
They were…

409
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,606
good options.

410
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,984
-I know.
-Whatever it is tomorrow…

411
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,695
What if we both get disappointed?

412
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,866
-It's fine.
-Yes.

413
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,581
You're worse than me at the game.

414
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,501
Rock, paper, scissors.

415
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,798
You're worse than me.

416
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,133
I'm really bad at it.

417
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,928
It's okay.

418
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,849
Man…

419
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,186
It's crazy. This is insane.

420
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,896
We're going on an overnight trip.

421
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,898
-What?
-We're going on an overnight trip.

422
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,483
An overnight trip…

423
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,361
Why are you so happy?

424
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,905
It's understandable.

425
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,116
-A trip to Jeju.
-I think that's the best one

426
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,660
-among all the dream dates.
-Exactly.

427
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,496
That was awesome.

428
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,917
They are so cute.

429
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,877
Hey, if you guys don't shower now,

430
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
-Okay.
-I'm going to.

431
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,672
I couldn't be happier.

432
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,926
AN OVERNIGHT TRIP TO JEJU ISLAND: JI-MIN
GLAMPING: JUNG-YUN

433
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,155
Jeju Island sounds crazy.

434
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,532
It's crazy.

435
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,867
Who would have imagined that
you'd go to Jeju?

436
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,161
-It's legendary.
-I never saw that coming.

437
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:42,129
DAY FIVE AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

438
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,971
JI-MIN & YE-RIN'S DREAM DATE

439
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,390
-Jeju!
-I'm so happy.

440
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,850
I'm so happy too.

441
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,352
I haven't been to the airport for so long.

442
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,645
Me too.

443
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,149
-I haven't been to Jeju for so long.
-Are you happy to be here with me?

444
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,233
Of course.

445
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,527
You're cute.

446
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,028
-What?
-You're cute.

447
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,238
-Me?
-Yes.

448
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,489
Stop it.

449
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,285
I'm so jealous.

450
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,245
Your first trip with the opposite sex.

451
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,622
-I know.
-They must be excited.

452
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,959
That sounds fun. They'll never forget it.

453
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,004
We're in Jeju.

454
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,755
I can't believe it.

455
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,009
I love it.
I really wanted to come to Jeju Island.

456
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
I wanted it so bad.

457
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,514
-I was really desperate yesterday.
-Me too.

458
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,183
I'm excited.

459
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,944
My hand looks delicious today.

460
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,906
-Right?
-Yes.

461
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,742
-Is this what you wanted?
-Yeah.

462
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,496
-I don't like that.
-What?

463
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,708
Give me your hand. Interlock our fingers.

464
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,251
-Do you like this?
-Yes.

465
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,212
I like it too.

466
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,505
Cute!

467
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,467
That was so natural.

468
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,429
When you interlock your fingers,
it feels like a shackle.

469
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,473
-A shackle?
-A shackle?

470
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,599
On each other.

471
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,735
-That's right.
-Good.

472
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,948
-Do you have cold hands and feet?
-Yes.

473
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,200
-I see.
-You don't.

474
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,326
I'm like the sun.

475
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,453
I like that. I'm like ice.

476
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,371
I'm fire.

477
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,499
You'll melt me.

478
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,627
I don't have a lot of dating experience,

479
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,297
and even when I was in a relationship,
I usually didn't hold hands.

480
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,094
Then, when I saw Ji-min's hand,
I felt like holding it.

481
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,223
I just felt like holding his hand,
so I did.

482
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,059
I was feeling shy,
and I think Ji-min noticed.

483
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,687
He covered our hands with the jacket.

484
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,231
So I was really thankful.

485
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,525
I was very nervous.

486
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,404
My hands are usually very warm,

487
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,282
so I wanted to hold her hands
and warm them up.

488
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,704
-How do you feel?
-Me?

489
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,541
Holding your hand? I like it.

490
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,128
I like it because it's you.

491
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,005
Yeah?

492
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,631
I like that.

493
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,469
I like how you're honest
about your feelings.

494
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,264
When you're mad,
I can see that you're mad.

495
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,434
When you're disappointed or happy,
I can see that.

496
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,438
I don't know. I thought that was cute.

497
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,482
They say it means you really like
the person if you find them cute.

498
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,611
-You're really cute.
-Me?

499
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,654
Yes.

500
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,575
-I'm cool.
-You're cool. But you're cute too.

501
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
I think that's why

502
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,289
I want to know how you're feeling more.

503
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,792
-That means you like me.
-I guess I do.

504
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,172
This is nice.

505
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,054
Make some noise.

506
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,431
Ji-min, it's so pretty.

507
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,391
Look at the color of the water.

508
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,935
It's so nice.

509
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,065
-We're so lucky.
-Oh, my.

510
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,526
Look at the color.

511
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,029
-It's so pretty.
-It's so clear.

512
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,530
This is Jeju Island.

513
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,824
It's so nice.

514
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,248
It's so pretty.

515
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,213
I love it. I love the sea.

516
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,841
-I'm so happy.
-Yes.

517
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,010
I can't be happier. This is so good.

518
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,972
It'll be so funny
if we get into an argument an hour later.

519
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,766
"What did you say?"

520
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,935
"What did you just say?"

521
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,353
Then, I'll apologize.

522
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,688
Okay.

523
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,149
This is so pretty.

524
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,901
Let's take lots of pictures.

525
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,528
Look at the wave.

526
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,446
After you, princess.

527
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,740
This is so nice.

528
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,335
One, two, three.

529
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,921
Wait. I can't keep my eyes open.

530
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,132
I can't open my eyes.

531
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,384
-I can't keep them open.
-Look here.

532
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,510
One, two, three.

533
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,892
-Hand.
-Hand.

534
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,445
This beach is where love blooms. Right?

535
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,788
-Two, one.
-Two, cha-cha-cha.

536
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,332
-One, two, cha-cha-cha.
-One, two. Wait.

537
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,753
-One, two.
-One, two, cha-cha-cha.

538
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,385
What's this?

539
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,181
-We should do it too. Grab a stick.
-We'll do better.

540
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,724
Ji…

541
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,810
Min.

542
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,355
Rin.

543
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,315
Ji-min.

544
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,566
Ta-da.

545
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,860
Oh, you can see it.

546
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,364
JI-MIN ♡ YE-RIN

547
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,574
This is romantic.

548
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:51,623
While we were walking,
we wrote Ji-min heart Ye-rin.

549
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,624
I thought

550
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,834
it felt like

551
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,003
we were in a relationship.

552
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,757
I really wanted to go to the beach,
but when I got there,

553
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,345
Ye-rin was all I could see.

554
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,849
This is the happiest I've felt
since moving into the house.

555
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,852
It's like we did all that for this moment.

556
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,563
If I weren't here with you,
it wouldn't have been fun.

557
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,195
It'll taste better with this view.

558
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,197
This is Jeju Island.

559
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,741
-The bracelets we bought earlier…
-Yes.

560
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,951
Let's put them on now.

561
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,118
-Sure.
-Ta-da.

562
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,578
-Give me one.
-Okay.

563
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,913
I'll put it on for you.

564
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,998
Like this…

565
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,129
This is hard.

566
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,967
Is this good? Like this?

567
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,134
-Yeah.
-Is it okay?

568
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,178
How's the size? Help me put it on.

569
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,894
Like this…

570
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,982
It's not easy.

571
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,693
You got it. What do you think?

572
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,319
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

573
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,320
-Looks good.
-Let me see.

574
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,033
-It's so pretty. Let's take a picture.
-Let's…

575
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,828
-Now? With this?
-Yes.

576
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,040
What do you think?

577
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,543
-It's so nice.
-Right?

578
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,254
I never wear accessories.

579
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,797
-Keep this on.
-I'll keep it on.

580
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,965
Promise me.

581
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,967
It's so pretty.

582
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,471
This looks good.

583
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,432
Bon appétit.

584
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,142
Enjoy.

585
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,154
It's good.

586
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,617
This tastes like…

587
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,285
Is this what black pig tastes like?

588
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,912
Seriously. This is black pig?

589
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,204
This is so good.

590
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,583
It's the best meat I've had recently.

591
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,586
Take them all.

592
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,756
Oh, yeah!

593
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,972
Do you like big pieces?

594
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,432
I'm so happy.

595
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,684
-That's how you eat it.
-This is what you live for.

596
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,524
-What?
-You're cute.

597
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,114
If I visit Jeju again,
I'll totally come back here.

598
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,491
-Me too.
-Together?

599
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,326
I'd love that.

600
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,162
Sounds good.

601
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,040
I'm so happy.

602
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,000
Look at that.

603
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,463
-You only looked at the meat, right?
-Yes.

604
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,507
Let me check out the view.

605
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,054
Ji-min, enjoy the sight like this.

606
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,849
It's so pretty.

607
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,270
-Let's take lots of pictures before we go.
-Okay.

608
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,984
What was I like as a class president?

609
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,114
You were pretty serious
when everyone was being rowdy.

610
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,116
When all of us were in the photo booth,

611
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,619
you were like, "What's going on?"
Because it was so hectic.

612
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,872
-Oh, the photo booth? At Wolmido?
-Yeah.

613
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,041
Yeah, I was pretty awesome.

614
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,003
At the time, you were interested
in Seo-yeong, weren't you?

615
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,046
-No.
-Why not?

616
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,341
I told you.

617
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,469
Right. That was when Ji-woo joined.

618
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,929
Let's not talk about it.

619
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,181
It upsets me.

620
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,561
But I chose you in the end.

621
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,605
It's not final yet.

622
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,025
What does that mean?

623
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,403
Let's eat.

624
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,741
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

625
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,910
This conversation left nothing but scars.

626
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,538
Don't talk about other girls.

627
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,623
It upsets me.

628
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,084
Okay.

629
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,170
Let's get back to eating.

630
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,302
-Ye-rin seems like the jealous type.
-Yes.

631
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,137
I think they both are.

632
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,725
Do you think they're having fun
on Jeju Island?

633
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,352
Jeju…

634
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,396
The glamping team will leave soon too.

635
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,190
Yeah, they'll leave soon.

636
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,693
You're going on a dream date
with Ji-woo tomorrow?

637
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,614
Who knows?
Even if we don't go on a dream date,

638
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,699
I'm going to have a talk with her.

639
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,909
It's the last day anyway.

640
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,746
-You look so pretty today.
-Yeah?

641
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,247
You look very pretty.

642
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,541
It's for the dream date.

643
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,877
-Glamping.
-Glad I look okay.

644
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,836
Have fun.

645
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,382
-It's a shame you didn't get to go.
-Yeah.

646
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,718
-You wanted to go on a dream date.
-You didn't?

647
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,638
I did, but there's nothing I can do.
So no regrets.

648
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,807
Today's dream dates are the best ones.

649
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,100
Even if they aren't great,

650
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,560
-the dream date…
-It's meaningful.

651
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:10,316
GLAMPING: JUNG-YUN

652
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,778
They're going glamping.

653
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,488
Oh, yes.

654
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,074
Can we also go glamping for our date?

655
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,867
Come with us.

656
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,078
You can follow us on foot.

657
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,454
Have fun.

658
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,331
-See you later.
-Have fun glamping.

659
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,874
-Bye.
-Have fun.

660
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,042
Have fun.

661
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,003
-Have fun.
-Have fun.

662
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,463
-Bye.
-Bye.

663
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,466
-See you tomorrow.
-I feel like we're family.

664
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,096
-My babies.
-Good times.

665
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,391
He said see you tomorrow.
Shall we come back tomorrow?

666
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,184
JUNG-YUN & JI-WOO'S DREAM DATE

667
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,563
Have fun!

668
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,647
Bye.

669
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,234
-It's like I'm going to the army.
-The army?

670
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,069
Have a good time!

671
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,740
Where am I…

672
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,412
-I can't wait.
-I can't wait to watch them.

673
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,788
It's a very important day.

674
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,665
I think I'll enjoy watching them.

675
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,793
-I'm not sure.
-Yeah. I think I'll feel anxious.

676
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,963
-Their conversations didn't go well.
-Really?

677
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,965
Lots of things will be settled today.

678
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,471
You don't have your bangs today.

679
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,973
That's right. I don't.

680
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,766
-Yeah, you don't.
-What do you think?

681
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,526
-It looks good.
-Thanks.

682
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,278
Sure…

683
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,160
-Tomorrow is the last night.
-Yeah.

684
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,536
Already.

685
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,041
Don't I look like I have a lot on my mind?

686
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,626
Don't I look like I have more?

687
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,169
In a different way.

688
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,005
But I organized my thoughts yesterday.

689
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,759
Really?

690
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,638
I'm going to ask you later.

691
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,141
-I can tell you now.
-Then, tell me.

692
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,061
-Tell me.
-I…

693
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,190
It's true that Se-yeon makes
my heart flutter,

694
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,359
and that I have feelings for him.

695
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,653
But I'm still…

696
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,283
I'm going to nap a bit.

697
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,674
-What?
-Nothing.

698
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,470
Even if someone does something romantic,

699
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,973
I'm like, "I wish that was Jung-yun."

700
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,517
"I wish Jung-yun did that to me."

701
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,811
That crosses my mind.

702
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,275
I realized it yesterday.

703
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,988
It's true that I have feelings
for Se-yeon,

704
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,827
but it's nothing compared
to what I feel for you.

705
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,459
Nice shot.

706
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,671
When Jung-yun takes one step,
Ji-woo takes ten steps.

707
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,089
That's right.

708
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,465
She's very honest.

709
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,304
The weather's nice.

710
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,639
The weather's nice.

711
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,433
-The weather is really nice today.
-Yeah.

712
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,148
It'll be cold when the sun sets.
Do you have gloves?

713
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,858
I have you.

714
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,736
-You want mine?
-I'm saying you're with me.

715
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,196
I'm okay because I have you.

716
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,994
Tell me if you're cold. I have two pairs.

717
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,829
I don't need gloves.

718
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,250
She doesn't need gloves!

719
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,627
You can hold her hands.

720
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,962
He said he has two pairs.

721
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,922
Don't make her say that three times.

722
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,507
Jung-yun, come on.

723
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,099
I was really nervous this morning.

724
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,851
What did you do this morning?

725
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,354
Nothing. I was nervous about going out.

726
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,897
-I see.
-I was like,

727
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,982
"What if she finds it boring again?"

728
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,942
"What if she stops talking?"

729
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,569
-You need to…
-What?

730
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,865
You need to practice expressing yourself.

731
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
-I'll help you.
-Help me.

732
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,161
I'll ask about every little detail.

733
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,463
Is there anything to do?

734
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,049
Yeah. Is there something we can do?

735
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,425
Do you want to go outside?

736
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,386
Let's go.

737
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,938
-Can I borrow a jacket?
-A jacket?

738
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,441
-Yeah.
-I don't have one. I'm too hot. Take this.

739
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,155
Here.

740
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm not.

741
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,957
-Did you bundle up?
-Yes.

742
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,711
I like this swing chair.

743
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,851
-Are you going on a date?
-What?

744
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,519
-Do you have a date?
-No.

745
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,020
-No?
-No.

746
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,064
You should go on a date with me.

747
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,360
I'd like that.

748
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,577
It's cute.

749
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,622
My round face is doing this.

750
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,917
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

751
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,252
What are they doing?

752
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,171
That posture means
he'll open up about everything.

753
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,300
-You can tell a lot
-Yes.

754
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,051
-from his pose.
-Guard down.

755
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,969
"Guard down."

756
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,021
We're on a ride. So fun.

757
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,981
The pirate ship.

758
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,568
Hands up.

759
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,778
We're here for the pirate ship.

760
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,572
The pirate ship.

761
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,871
-Let's get some food.
-Sure.

762
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,052
It feels different to eat with just
the two of us…

763
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,597
at home.

764
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,849
The first bite… Wait, is it too hot?

765
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,569
Here.

766
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,286
Okay, okay.

767
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,426
This is pretty fun.

768
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,722
Back then,
I was bored because you weren't there.

769
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,224
What?

770
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,562
I didn't hear you.

771
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,521
Back then…

772
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,983
it wasn't fun because you weren't here.

773
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,293
Last night,

774
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,337
even though it was very minor,

775
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,091
I felt that Ji-woo

776
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,054
was leaning towards Jung-yun.

777
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,016
I noticed it.

778
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,933
LAST NIGHT

779
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,562
When we were sitting inside
looking outside,

780
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:31,191
there was a long silence.

781
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,195
The way Ji-woo was sitting
and the direction she was facing…

782
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,699
They were very minor things,

783
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,911
but I could feel that Ji-woo and Jung-yun
have feelings for each other.

784
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,751
Right now, my heart is…

785
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,503
not…

786
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,592
Wait. I'm sorry.

787
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:52,981
I have no idea why I'm feeling this way.

788
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:59,738
Regarding my feelings toward Ji-woo,
I've been telling myself,

789
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,990
"It's fine."

790
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,535
"That is understandable."

791
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,161
But it still makes me sad.

792
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:14,378
I think I've been doing my best.

793
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,213
I have been true to my feelings.

794
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,966
And until it's over,

795
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,176
I will stay that way.

796
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,471
I feel like I'm finally starting to

797
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,851
get a hold of my own feelings
and become stronger.

798
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:40,320
He's in a love triangle,
and he has to live with them.

799
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,697
He has to watch them.

800
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,282
-He has no choice.
-Yeah, and…

801
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,994
He's probably more sad
because he feels like he's losing both.

802
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,122
-His friend and…
-The person he likes is

803
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,042
developing feelings for someone else,
and he has to watch it.

804
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,336
-He has no choice.
-Yeah.

805
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,173
Se-yeon is doing his best.
He expressed his feelings.

806
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,425
He's doing his best,
but it's not working out.

807
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,762
I think he suddenly got overwhelmed
with various emotions.

808
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,348
Yeah, it's definitely
a mixture of emotions.

809
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,766
I'm sad to see him crying.

810
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,477
-I know.
-He's having a hard time.

811
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,145
He looked strong.

812
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,898
I guess he was overwhelmed.

813
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,198
-It's really pretty.
-I know.

814
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,285
It's pretty over there.

815
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,705
The sea is so vast.

816
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,458
It's endless.

817
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,835
-Yeah.
-I can't see the end of it.

818
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,254
It's amazing.

819
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:43,091
If I was floating on a tube over there,
could you still find me?

820
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,343
Of course.

821
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,678
-How?
-With my eyes.

822
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,930
How good is your vision?

823
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,723
It's actually terrible.

824
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,687
-You're very reliable.
-I will find you with my heart.

825
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,233
-Let's go to the lighthouse over there.
-Sure.

826
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,401
-That's the photo spot.
-I'd love to.

827
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,155
Ji-min, take me with you.

828
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,539
Be careful

829
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,124
on the stairs.

830
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,293
Be careful.

831
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,837
It's really pretty.

832
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,592
Let's take a nice picture.

833
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,304
-Is my hand cold?
-Yes.

834
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,098
Both our hands are.

835
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,767
They'll get warm soon.

836
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,898
-We're here.
-Is it there?

837
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:40,816
Yes.

838
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,152
This is nice.

839
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,782
-I'll take a picture of you.
-Let's take a picture.

840
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,369
Ready? Nine, eight…

841
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,745
What do you want to do?

842
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
Find your balance.

843
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,463
I almost fell down.

844
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,425
-It's a good picture.
-That looks good.

845
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,885
Three, two, one.

846
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,265
What do you think? That was
a nice staged photo.

847
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,559
-What do you think?
-I love it.

848
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,602
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

849
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,816
-It's so pretty.
-I know. I'm glad we came.

850
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,529
-Ji-min.
-Yes?

851
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,699
Come!

852
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,159
Want me to hug you?

853
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,664
Look at your face.

854
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,545
-They're cute.
-Look at them!

855
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:49,009
Ji-min wants to act cool,
but he's actually not.

856
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,177
That's so true.

857
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,012
-That's so cute.
-That is.

858
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,101
I'm feeling a bit shy.

859
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:01,897
It's okay.

860
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,152
Let's go take a picture.

861
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,820
I'm so embarrassed.

862
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,324
Why did you suddenly want to do that?

863
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,325
Suddenly…

864
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,619
You suddenly felt like it?

865
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,302
I really like this picture.

866
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,429
-Me too.
-These two.

867
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,391
-This. And this! These two.
-Yes.

868
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,352
-They're epic.
-This and the one in the middle.

869
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,646
"Four pictures from Pyeong-seok."

870
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,231
Let me see.

871
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,318
I haven't checked them out yet.

872
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,741
He's so bold.

873
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,034
I'm more bold.

874
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,412
So annoying.

875
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,125
I think he'll be so cool when he asks.
Like, "Hee-ji, let's go."

876
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,961
-I can do it cooler.
-Cooler?

877
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,129
-Yes.
-How?

878
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,423
Are you going to do a backflip
or something?

879
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,425
That's a clown.

880
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,636
Knock over the others, one by one.

881
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,850
"Ye-rin, I choose you."

882
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,812
The others will be on the ground.

883
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,440
Help me, Pyeong-seok. I mean…

884
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,734
Help me, Pyeong-seok. I mean…

885
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,402
Help me, Ji-min.

886
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,742
-That's not good.
-That's bad.

887
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,869
That's bad.

888
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,204
Help me, Pyeong-seok. I mean…

889
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,914
Help me, Ji-min.

890
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,958
Ji-min, come on.

891
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,588
What was that? Pyeong-seok?

892
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,216
No, I mean we talked
about Pyeong-seok earlier.

893
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,927
-Okay.
-It's not what you think it is.

894
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,846
How could you mix up the names?

895
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,649
-Ji-min.
-Yes?

896
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,567
We're here.

897
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,320
I see.

898
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,157
I want to go eat with Ji-min.

899
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,909
Isn't that cute?

900
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,620
I want to go eat with Ji-min.

901
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,455
Isn't it cute?

902
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,083
Why? What's wrong?

903
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,002
-What?
-What's wrong?

904
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,128
What's the matter?

905
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,088
Nothing.

906
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,427
He can never hide it.

907
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,888
He's not willing to hide it. He can't.

908
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,848
Ji-min is so funny.

909
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,101
I don't like it when you don't talk.

910
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,228
Suit yourself.

911
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,235
I can't control my feelings.

912
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,071
I'm pretending to be okay,
but I'm not in a good mood.

913
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,407
Why? I actually don't like it

914
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,245
when someone whines about every single
thing. But it's cute when you do it.

915
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,288
-So don't stop.
-No.

916
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,000
-Right. He's disappointed,
-Right.

917
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,044
but he knows he looks petty.

918
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,838
-That's so cute.
-Just say it.

919
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,394
This is interesting.

920
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,480
You're the one person
who I didn't think I'd get close to.

921
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:36,403
Honestly, I didn't really think
that I would start liking you as a guy.

922
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,407
-I'm very lucky.
-You're now my puppy.

923
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,243
Puppy Lee.

924
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,419
Why do you like me?

925
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,838
-You?
-Yes.

926
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:01,678
You're not like the other girls.

927
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,596
Me?

928
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,100
I think you're very special.

929
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:14,816
What about you?

930
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,864
I felt that you were someone
I could lean on.

931
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:24,492
When I was having a hard time,
you came to me.

932
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,496
When you came to me,
I was finally able to see things clearly.

933
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,752
And you started caring about me more

934
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,129
as we spent more time together.

935
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:39,841
As you started liking me more,
you started to treat me differently.

936
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,594
I felt that and it was comforting.

937
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,388
That's a relief.

938
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,685
When we're together,
we never stop laughing.

939
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,604
I beg you to stop being so funny.

940
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,316
But we're serious
when we have to be serious.

941
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,484
I think…

942
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,446
that's the reason we're here now.

943
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,532
I agree.

944
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,577
Do you think we click?

945
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,788
Totally.

946
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,956
Totally?

947
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,209
-That's all that matters.
-Totally.

948
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,963
Tomorrow is our last day.

949
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,423
-Really?
-Tomorrow is the last night.

950
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,633
Why?

951
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,343
We're leaving on the 7th.

952
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,178
Wasn't it the 8th? It was the 7th?

953
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,058
-I'm glad we got to know each other
-No way.

954
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,978
before it's over.

955
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,856
We'll keep seeing each other.

956
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,859
Let's make it even better.

957
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,447
It's only the beginning.

958
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,242
Let's leave after this.

959
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,702
Shall we?

960
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,538
Let's go to bed early
so we can meet early.

961
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,455
Okay.

962
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,542
Let's spend time together
from early tomorrow.

963
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,378
-Let's meet early tomorrow.
-We're apart for just a bit.

964
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,256
Yeah.

965
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:10,557
GLAMPING SITE

966
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,227
It's beautiful.

967
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,816
This is so nice.

968
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,526
There's… Wait.

969
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,156
I love it.

970
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,490
So nice.

971
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,493
-Awesome.
-No way.

972
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,456
It's so nice.

973
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,626
-Why go all the way to Jeju?
-This is Jeju right here.

974
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,669
This is Jeju Island.

975
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,922
This is Jeju Island right here.

976
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,549
This is Jeju Island right here.

977
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,177
-Do you want to go outside?
-Shall we?

978
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,724
I don't know how much charcoal
we need to use.

979
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,684
I better look it up on YouTube.

980
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,437
Here we go.

981
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,731
-Good luck.
-So this…

982
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,024
You can do it.

983
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:07,906
Oh, my.

984
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,366
-Oh, my.
-Wait.

985
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,202
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

986
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,661
This suddenly…

987
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,081
This isn't what I expected.

988
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,292
Is this right?

989
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,379
I don't even know.

990
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,510
Does it usually take this long?

991
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,513
This isn't easy.

992
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,182
Will I get to start a fire
before today is over?

993
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,725
I don't mind eating the meat raw.

994
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,564
I think I got it.

995
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,485
-You got it?
-Yes.

996
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,530
This isn't easy.

997
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,740
You're doing great.

998
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,367
-Really?
-Yes.

999
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,619
-Let me try it again.
-Sure.

1000
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,870
-Okay.
-You can do it.

1001
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,214
This is driving me crazy.

1002
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,842
Is this even working?

1003
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,344
Maybe we should use the torch
to cook our meat.

1004
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,305
Do you want to roast it
on that fire instead?

1005
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,890
-Should we?
-One by one?

1006
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,811
This is crazy. Where do I…

1007
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,771
Are you the one?

1008
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,524
Is it you?

1009
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,069
-It's working.
-Right?

1010
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,863
It caught fire.

1011
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,532
It looks good.

1012
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,245
-It's nice.
-It is.

1013
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,709
-Do I open it?
-What do you want to eat first?

1014
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,295
-Let's open this first.
-Sure.

1015
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,381
Korean pork.

1016
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,133
Cook it well.

1017
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,554
-I'm nervous.
-Don't be.

1018
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,015
I can still eat it even if it's not good.

1019
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,768
It's cooking.

1020
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,355
-Are you tired?
-No.

1021
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,816
-You're not tired?
-I'm not.

1022
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,992
-Good job.
-Let me cut it.

1023
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,328
-Good job.
-There's a lot.

1024
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,789
We did it.

1025
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,710
-Yeah, it worked.
-I know.

1026
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,878
That looks good.

1027
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,467
Here. Try.

1028
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,387
-It's good.
-Is it?

1029
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,764
I'll try the pork belly.

1030
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,648
-This is better than I thought.
-It's so good.

1031
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,948
Which one do you prefer,
pork shoulder or belly?

1032
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,449
The pork shoulder.

1033
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,951
-It's tender, isn't it?
-Yes.

1034
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,037
The pork shoulder is really tender.

1035
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,084
-I need to do some research for next time.
-Yes.

1036
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,175
-It's good.
-Yes.

1037
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,596
There's a cat.

1038
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,639
Oh, my.

1039
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,057
I told you there's one.

1040
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,142
So cute.

1041
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,646
-Did you just see his snot?
-What?

1042
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,314
-He had snot like this.
-Really?

1043
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:29,691
What's he doing?

1044
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,859
-Is he cold?
-He's so cute.

1045
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,072
You look like a cat.

1046
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,448
No.

1047
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,784
You look like that cat.

1048
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:45,456
You even act like a cat.

1049
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,125
You look like…

1050
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,460
Let me see you.

1051
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,380
You're shy like a cat too.

1052
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,136
It's a full moon tonight. Look.

1053
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,096
It's very round.

1054
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,314
-This is making me zone out.
-I was about to say that too.

1055
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,774
Is it too high?

1056
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,237
-Do you stare at the fire like this?
-I know.

1057
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,405
It's their first time.

1058
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,617
-Aren't you supposed to do this?
-Yeah. You sit back and watch.

1059
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,870
Aren't you supposed to talk to each other?

1060
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,831
-They're staring at it.
-They're just staring and zoning out.

1061
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,458
That's cute.

1062
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,792
They're so into it.

1063
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,669
This is really pretty.

1064
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,671
-Does it make it do this?
-No.

1065
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,214
-Or does it change color?
-It changes color.

1066
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,092
-Let me try.
-Okay.

1067
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,510
Throw that in.

1068
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,887
-Like this?
-Throw that in.

1069
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,681
-Nothing's happening.
-Wait.

1070
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,522
-That's crazy.
-That's crazy.

1071
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,649
-That's crazy.
-So pretty.

1072
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,566
Right?

1073
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,240
It makes me zone out.

1074
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,242
Campfire zone out.

1075
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,788
No wonder people do that, right?

1076
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,665
Yeah. I really get that.

1077
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,711
It's amazing.

1078
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,424
Do you want to try this?

1079
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,218
-Marshmallow?
-Yes.

1080
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,552
Let's eat marshmallows.

1081
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,556
Aren't you too far from it?

1082
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,974
It's fine.

1083
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,477
It's like a selfie stick.

1084
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,647
-It stretches out?
-It's like a selfie stick.

1085
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,315
It gets super long.

1086
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,150
-Yeah, it's super long.
-How long…

1087
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,862
You could take a video with this.
Like this.

1088
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,823
Is this how you do it?

1089
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,618
So cool.

1090
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,578
It's working pretty well.

1091
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,706
You're pretty good at it.

1092
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,250
Of course.

1093
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,835
That looks good.

1094
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,132
No way.

1095
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,299
It's perfect.

1096
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,472
How is it?

1097
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,559
It's sweet.

1098
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,935
Do you not like sweets?

1099
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,062
It's too sweet.

1100
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,899
-It's good.
-It tastes like dalgona.

1101
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,736
How do you feel right now?

1102
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,155
-I'm having fun. I'm enjoying it.
-You're having fun?

1103
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,782
-It's fun as much as it's difficult.
-Yes.

1104
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,243
-Difficult things are more memorable.
-True.

1105
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,745
How long will you remember this?

1106
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,414
How long?

1107
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,544
Maybe 30 years? Is that too long?

1108
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,714
-Why only 30 years?
-For 30 years.

1109
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,091
-People usually say forever.
-Oh, forever.

1110
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,302
I can tell you never had
a girlfriend before.

1111
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,054
It's a compliment.

1112
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,432
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1113
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,645
It's fun. I need to learn
how to start a fire for next time.

1114
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,064
Next time? Who are you going to come with?

1115
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,402
-You need to say, "You."
-You.

1116
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,946
You're so inexperienced.

1117
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,909
You want to say those things
but just can't, right?

1118
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,828
What? I know it all.
I know it all in theory.

1119
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,371
You only know in theory.

1120
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,082
This marshmallow knows better.

1121
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,418
What are you saying?

1122
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:19,879
It's sweet.

1123
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,257
-Shall we go in?
-Shall we?

1124
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,967
Let's go.

1125
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,511
Let's go.

1126
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,014
-It's nice in here.
-Yes.

1127
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,016
This is so nice.

1128
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,019
It's therapeutic.

1129
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,606
Just sitting here like this…

1130
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,693
-It really is a dream date.
-Yes.

1131
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,278
I won.

1132
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,075
If I'd lost, we wouldn't be here.

1133
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,161
Good job.

1134
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,707
We turned twenty, came for glamping,

1135
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,585
got to barbecue
and stare at the pretty fire.

1136
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,128
-It's a memorable night.
-Right.

1137
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,840
-I don't want to start a fire again.
-Right.

1138
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,299
It was cool and fun.

1139
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,385
It was fun because it was challenging.

1140
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,220
It was fun because it was romantic.

1141
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,055
It was fun because I was happy.

1142
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,895
Tomorrow is the last day.

1143
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,859
How do you feel now?

1144
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,445
I told you my honest feelings earlier.

1145
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,446
Now?

1146
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,907
It's nice.

1147
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,578
What is?

1148
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,000
What's nice? When I ask you this,

1149
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,960
what are you supposed to say? "You."

1150
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,253
You.

1151
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,088
If I ask, "What are you looking at?"

1152
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,466
You're supposed to say,
"Because you're pretty." Okay?

1153
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,010
You need to learn.

1154
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,513
"What are you doing?"
"Thinking about you." Get it?

1155
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,141
-That's basic.
-I do that a lot.

1156
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,685
I think about you a lot.

1157
01:04:58,936 --> 01:04:59,896
-Really?
-Yeah.

1158
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,064
In the beginning,

1159
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,193
when we were still in school,
I went home and…

1160
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,906
I thought of you a lot, too.

1161
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,408
-I did it even more.
-Thinking about me?

1162
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,035
Even when I lost playing games,

1163
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,078
I told my friends…

1164
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,373
that I was still happy.

1165
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,583
That's what I said.

1166
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,252
-Really?
-Yes.

1167
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,131
I was really happy too.

1168
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,301
I even told my mom

1169
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,012
that I rode the Ferris wheel
with a handsome boy.

1170
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,850
-While I was working out with my brother…
-You told him?

1171
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,187
I said to him, "I have met…

1172
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,274
the girl of my dreams."

1173
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,777
Then he said,

1174
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,488
"Shut up and focus on the workout."

1175
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,532
So…

1176
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,036
-Then…
-Yeah?

1177
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,581
-Now that the no-dating rule is lifted…
-Right.

1178
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,087
What if…

1179
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,339
I choose you?

1180
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:10,758
Then…

1181
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,762
it'll be a new beginning.

1182
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,557
It will be.

1183
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,063
What's wrong with me?

1184
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,274
Aren't I super honest?

1185
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,819
I'm only like this with you.

1186
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,537
She'll make Jung-yun cry.

1187
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,205
Why is he turning his head?

1188
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,207
He can't even look at her.

1189
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,250
But that's true.

1190
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,002
-Yeah.
-She only does this to him.

1191
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,546
-She's bold.
-She's different.

1192
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,594
Why do you keep laughing?

1193
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,180
I can't seem to stay still.

1194
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,311
-This is fun.
-Yeah.

1195
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:10,234
During the two weeks at school
and at the house, I've had fun every day.

1196
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:13,654
-There was one day I didn't want to go.
-When?

1197
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,614
The day after you first came.

1198
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,867
Why?

1199
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:22,580
I wanted to talk to you, but I couldn't.

1200
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,082
I didn't say a single word to you
on our first day.

1201
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,183
Right. I wondered if I could

1202
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:46,854
-ever get to talk to you.
-Right.

1203
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:50,900
But now, we're here on a dream date
like this.

1204
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,278
Tell me about it.

1205
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:56,989
It's amazing.

1206
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,157
It's surreal.

1207
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,159
Yeah…

1208
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,246
When we were talking on the bed,

1209
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,458
I think we told each other

1210
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:13,047
how we really felt for each other.

1211
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,050
We kept looking at each other
when we talked.

1212
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,968
I thought that was romantic.

1213
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:19,970
By the way,

1214
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,391
why me?

1215
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,143
-Why do you like me?
-What?

1216
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,520
Why do you like me?

1217
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,979
At first…

1218
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,609
I just liked you.

1219
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,987
We also click when we talk.

1220
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,074
That's why.

1221
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,748
Tell me more about it. Make me happy.

1222
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,838
What about you?

1223
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,758
First of all, you're handsome.

1224
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:01,971
You're handsome. So your first impression…

1225
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,436
-Your smile makes my heart flutter.
-What?

1226
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,107
-What?
-Your smile makes my heart flutter.

1227
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:14,984
I'm talking about you.

1228
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:23,826
You're…

1229
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,494
cute.

1230
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,912
You're cute.

1231
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,124
This is good.

1232
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:36,172
He was a bit awkward,
but I could see that he was trying.

1233
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,800
I was happy that he was making an effort

1234
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,844
to change for me.

1235
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:46,974
My first dream date was way better

1236
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,685
than I expected.

1237
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,901
Since Jung-yun was new to this,

1238
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:01,363
he didn't know how to express himself,
and Ji-woo figured that out.

1239
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,158
At first, she was disappointed,
but then she realized it.

1240
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,284
"That's who he is."

1241
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,703
-"I'll lead you."
-"I'll teach you."

1242
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,372
Jung-yun will learn a lot from Ji-woo.

1243
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,416
I'm learning too.

1244
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:13,626
Are you?

1245
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,336
-Every day.
-I'm learning too.

1246
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,004
I'm learning from her every day.

1247
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,505
She's very honest.

1248
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,180
Are you going to fall again?

1249
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,350
What? You're back.

1250
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,143
-Hey.
-You're back.

1251
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,938
What were you doing?

1252
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,606
-What?
-What did you do?

1253
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,149
-What did we do?
-We were hanging.

1254
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,192
We were hanging.

1255
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,111
Where's everyone?

1256
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,196
They're still out.

1257
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,614
-All of them are still out?
-Yes.

1258
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,913
-I think they're having dinner outside.
-What?

1259
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,706
I think they're all having dinner.

1260
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:55,834
Is it cold outside?

1261
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,419
Is it?

1262
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,297
When I returned from the gym,

1263
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,967
it was night,

1264
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,971
but Ji-woo and Jung-yun weren't back yet.

1265
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,933
I kept thinking about Ji-woo
after I came home.

1266
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,654
So I waited.

1267
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,952
I wasn't sure how to talk to her
about the dream date.

1268
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:35,666
Well, I made my plans clear

1269
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,919
to Ji-woo.

1270
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:44,800
So I spent some time alone to collect
my thoughts before I talk to her.

1271
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,055
That was fun.

1272
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,640
-Yes, it was.
-That was crazy.

1273
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,058
-Really.
-It was no joke.

1274
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,229
We did face a challenge
while starting the fire, but…

1275
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,814
Even that was perfect.

1276
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:00,774
It was trial and error.

1277
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,319
-That made it more memorable.
-Right.

1278
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,197
What are you looking at?

1279
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,659
What are you looking at?

1280
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:14,038
-What?
-You.

1281
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,884
Time flew by today.

1282
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,594
-I know.
-Right?

1283
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,346
Time went so slow yesterday.

1284
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,931
I know. It went so fast.

1285
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:50,366
With you…

1286
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,494
Are you going out tomorrow?

1287
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,663
-If it's with you.
-Me?

1288
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,502
Are you sure you won't go out
with someone else tomorrow?

1289
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,545
-I'm going to reject them all.
-Really?

1290
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,682
We're home already?

1291
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,435
Time flies.

1292
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,902
We're home.

1293
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,906
What are you doing?

1294
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,492
Let's go downstairs.

1295
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,917
You're back. Come here.

1296
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,919
-You guys didn't go anywhere?
-We didn't.

1297
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,337
-Hi.
-Hi.

1298
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,422
What did you do?

1299
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,340
-Us?
-You must've bought meat and…

1300
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,926
-Is it a secret?
-You're back early.

1301
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,011
Look at them smile. It's a secret.

1302
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,221
It's not a secret.

1303
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,014
-It's not a secret.
-No, it's not.

1304
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,475
-Are you going to stay here?
-We're going to eat.

1305
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,310
-Are you going to eat?
-Upstairs.

1306
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,104
We ordered jokbal and bossam.

1307
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,397
That's crazy.

1308
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,482
I'll go get changed.

1309
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,153
Let's eat.

1310
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,113
That looks good.

1311
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,656
-Join us.
-Come.

1312
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,035
It's good.

1313
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,871
I wonder what it's going to be today.

1314
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,831
-What?
-I wonder what it's going to be.

1315
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:23,459
Who can sign up for it today?

1316
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,586
-For what?
-The dream date.

1317
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,505
If you're talking about possibilities,
a lot of people can.

1318
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,973
Do you want strawberries?
I'll go get them. You can eat.

1319
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,211
You're back early.

1320
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,587
Today? Yes.

1321
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,088
What did you do?

1322
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,841
Today? We went to the glamping site

1323
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:14,927
and grilled meat.

1324
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,096
And we talked inside.

1325
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:20,599
Then, we came home.

1326
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,186
Where's the knife? There it is.

1327
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,328
What about our dream date?

1328
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:49,086
I am planning not to go on any more dates.

1329
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,673
I went on two dates with each of you.

1330
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:08,021
What did you do today?

1331
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,108
Me? I rested.

1332
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,609
I took a rest.

1333
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,778
Did you rest? Did you go to the gym?

1334
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,572
-Yes.
-Yes?

1335
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,908
Why do you not want to go on a date?

1336
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:20,867
Are you tired?

1337
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,870
Because I went on two dates
with each of you.

1338
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,333
I think not going on any dates tomorrow
will help me decide…

1339
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,796
I mean, I just think that'll be best.

1340
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,427
-You think so?
-Yes.

1341
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,473
I'll wash them for you.

1342
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,559
-What?
-I'll wash them for you.

1343
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:46,768
You'll wash them?

1344
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,397
Then…

1345
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,276
I see.

1346
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,789
Ji-woo.

1347
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,249
Ji-woo's feeling bad.

1348
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,417
I bet.

1349
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,253
But that's the right thing to do.

1350
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,422
It is, but Se-yeon must be disappointed.

1351
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,215
He waited until now.

1352
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,968
Se-yeon only thought about the dream date.

1353
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,429
I know. He didn't use his chance.

1354
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,767
I told him that I won't go
on a dream date with him.

1355
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,602
You told him?

1356
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:10,537
I think one of the saddest moments
in life is when you feel powerless.

1357
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,373
-Me too.
-When you want to do something

1358
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,418
but realize there's nothing you can do.

1359
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,503
The emotion you feel at that moment…

1360
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,214
It's so tough. It's tough,
yet you can't resolve it.

1361
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,966
-Right.
-There's nothing you can do.

1362
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:26,094
No one would fully understand
how Se-yeon feels.

1363
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,513
I think it's a very complex emotion.

1364
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,314
A minute left.

1365
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,986
DREAM DATE: HOTEL DAYCATION, DINNER CRUISE

1366
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:44,488
-Hotel… Cruise?
-Cruise?

1367
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,281
"Hotel daycation"?

1368
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:52,579
HOTEL DAYCATION

1369
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:57,459
HOTEL DAYCATION

1370
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:04,508
DINNER CRUISE

1371
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,967
What should we do?

1372
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,262
I want the cruise.

1373
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,937
I'll do it.

1374
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:18,772
I'll do it.

1375
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,190
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

1376
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:21,733
Rock, paper, scissors.

1377
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,738
Noh Hee-ji.

1378
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:33,161
A hotel daycation is nice,
but Hee-ji and I

1379
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:37,332
had enough of that at home.

1380
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:42,003
The cruise sounded more tempting,
so we decided to go with the cruise.

1381
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,258
Anyone down for the hotel vacation?

1382
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,551
Anyone?

1383
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,602
-Are we done?
-We're done.

1384
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,814
-If you want to rest, go.
-You can go if you want.

1385
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,859
Goodnight. Sleep tight.

1386
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,027
Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

1387
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,275
I think I need to talk to Se-yeon.

1388
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,656
We'll be upstairs, so you can talk.

1389
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,950
-Here?
-Yes, you can talk here.

1390
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,332
This is hard. It's painful. I'm in agony.

1391
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,963
Guys, let's go upstairs.

1392
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,173
If we talk…

1393
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,425
We'll make room for them.
Let's go upstairs.

1394
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,386
-Why did you call me?
-What?

1395
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,472
Why did you call me?

1396
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:30,695
You were in here.

1397
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:32,906
-Isn't it cold in here?
-No.

1398
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,533
It's better than before.

1399
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,108
