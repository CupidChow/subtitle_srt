00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
SE-YEON

2
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,022
JUNG-YUN

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
SEO-HYEON

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,528
SANG-WON

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
HEE-JI

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
JI-MIN

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,118
YE-RIN

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,287
JI-WOO

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,497
PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:55,221
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,600
Who will it be between the two?

13
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,685
Se-yeon or Ji-min?

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,107
Our partners were chosen
based on the menu.

15
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,612
So I was excited thinking about
who my partner would be.

16
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,990
GROUP 4:
SOFT TOFU STEW & STIR-FRIED CHICKEN

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,254
I was waiting by our group table

18
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,506
when Se-yeon came in.

19
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,717
"Could he be my partner?"

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,805
I would have loved to work with Se-yeon,

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,809
so I was hoping he would come to my table.

22
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,654
Hey.

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,405
Okay.

24
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,624
Where is it?

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,086
-Did you read the sign?
-Yes, kimchi stew.

26
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,840
He won rock, paper, scissors.

27
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,424
YE-RIN & SE-YEON: KIMCHI STEW

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
He's with Ye-rin?

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
It worked out.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,055
Ye-rin, stop smiling.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,564
I was like, "Are we meant to be?
Is it destiny?"

32
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,823
Whenever we had to pair up,

33
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,201
I often paired up with Ye-rin.

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,247
I thought, "Is this a coincidence
or are we meant to be?"

35
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,000
-You said you're good at cooking.
-What?

36
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,460
You said you're a good cook.

37
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,963
You can make steamed eggs.
I can't cook at all.

38
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,132
I'm terrible. I'll do my best.

39
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,842
I'm counting on you.

40
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,555
Wait.

41
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683
-Your partner is Ji-min.
-Yes.

42
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,395
He's late.

43
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,566
He's making me wait.

44
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,864
-Hi.
-It's Ji-min.

45
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,949
Hey.

46
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm this group.

47
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,495
-Hi.
-Hi.

48
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,998
JI-WOO & JI-MIN: SOFT TOFU STEW

49
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,709
-They look awkward.
-So awkward.

50
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,754
It's not awkward at all. We're close.

51
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
It's true.

52
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,009
She's new. I know her the least.

53
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,887
I thought I should take this chance
to get to know her.

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,889
I was glad to pair up with her.

55
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,476
-Why did you choose this?
-Me?

56
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,395
Because I wanted chicken.

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,523
-Can you make it?
-No, I like it.

58
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,734
-Really?
-I can't make it, but I like it.

59
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,653
-I'll make it good for you.
-Really?

60
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,987
-Count on me.
-I'm glad.

61
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,073
-I'll do my best.
-Sure.

62
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,450
They all have new partners.

63
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,535
-I want to see…
-Se-yeon and Ye-rin.

64
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,164
-They'll enjoy it even if it's not good.
-Yes.

65
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,458
Let me introduce myself.

66
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,586
Hello. I'm Lee Nan-woo.
The CEO of Now Cooking.

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,837
Nice to meet you.

68
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,674
Let's put on our aprons first.

69
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,968
The apron.

70
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,594
Which color?
They have these.

71
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,263
Why don't you…

72
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,893
-This looks good on you.
-You look good in light colors.

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,106
What?

74
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,610
Is this right?

75
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,365
I like it.

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,621
Help each other with the aprons.

77
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,000
Good. I'll tie it for you.
I'm good at tying ribbons.

78
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,256
Perfect. Tie mine.

79
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,633
Can you tie a ribbon?

80
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,307
-Done.
-Okay.

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,058
Good. It's perfect.

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,020
-We're the first to be ready.
-We're first.

83
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,439
They can't even tie their aprons.

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,654
I haven't had a chance to talk
to Pyeong-seok yet.

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,242
I thought it'd be a good chance
to get to know him.

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,872
The first thing we need to do
is prep the anchovies.

87
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,293
If you see black stuff, remove it.

88
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,379
-We can do it.
-We'll be the best.

89
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,090
-What?
-We'll be best at it.

90
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,091
I agree.

91
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,927
-Let's surprise the others.
-Okay.

92
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,138
They might faint.

93
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,474
Make them faint?

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,478
-Looks good.
-What?

95
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,275
-Is this it?
-Yes.

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,903
I'm good at it.

97
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,113
You?

98
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,366
-Done. It's neat.
-Yes, it's perfect.

99
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,994
-We're slow.
-Yes.

100
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,370
Oh, no.

101
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,122
Take your time.

102
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:19,587
I'm going to wipe the kelp with a cloth
and place it in the water.

103
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,301
Squeeze it hard.

104
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,934
-Good.
-So pretty.

105
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,231
Put it in the water.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,535
-All right.
-Done.

107
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,874
Why are you making that noise?

108
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,751
They have great chemistry.

109
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,045
-It's better than expected.
-So cute.

110
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,259
Aren't I good?

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,479
Here's the chicken.

112
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,236
Try to touch it.

113
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,036
It's the drumstick.

114
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,543
Do you like drumsticks?
Enjoy, Pyeong-seok.

115
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,421
I was scared of Seo-hyeon at first.

116
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,382
She turns out to be funny.

117
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,344
After cooking, we got closer.

118
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,473
When we were cooking,

119
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,559
he was very sweet at times.

120
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,643
Okay.

121
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,103
So pretty.

122
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,564
He's somewhat playful.

123
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,527
I think we got close after that.
I'm happy about it.

124
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,030
I'll give you a mission.

125
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,991
-Okay.
-You can work on the sweet potatoes.

126
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,034
Cut them?

127
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,245
I'll slice the onions.

128
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,084
-Be careful.
-Okay.

129
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,135
You're so good at it.

130
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,846
I'll scoop it out.

131
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,807
It looks good already.

132
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,311
Awesome.

133
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,649
-Add that in and stir-fry.
-Okay.

134
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,573
-Can I try this?
-Sure.

135
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,159
-The anchovy broth--
-Please. Is it good?

136
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,410
It's good.

137
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,328
Yes!

138
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,789
-It's not bad.
-I knew it'd be.

139
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,707
Of course.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,127
Ji-woo was a good cook,

141
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,088
so we were able to cook without issues.

142
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:13,135
Our teamwork when we were cooking
was better than average.

143
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
Why is this so firm?

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,234
Cut here.

145
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,445
Not in the front, in the back.

146
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,115
I didn't know carrots were so hard.

147
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,158
Do you want it?

148
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
Give me the weird piece.
I'll eat it.

149
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,166
-Is it good?
-Yes.

150
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,378
This is the sample.

151
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,883
You can have like two more.

152
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,140
After I ate it, I realized,
"Se-yeon fed me."

153
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,934
"Oh, my."

154
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,938
It was good. The carrot tasted sweet
when Se-yeon fed it to me.

155
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,857
Did he put honey on it?

156
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,610
Ye-rin's so cute.

157
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,321
-She's into him.
-She's fallen for him already.

158
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,823
Rub it carefully.

159
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,783
You must marinate bulgogi beforehand.

160
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,411
-Good.
-Does it feel good?

161
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,330
-Not bad.
-You do this while I do that?

162
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,373
-Sure.
-I'll do this.

163
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,499
You can slice.

164
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,003
-It smells really good.
-Really?

165
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,756
Is this yukhoe?

166
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,091
It smells like yukhoe.
I want to eat yukhoe.

167
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,092
How are we…

168
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
-It feels weird.
-Do I leave this out?

169
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,891
We don't need this.

170
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,359
-What?
-"Only half"?

171
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,653
I already added the whole thing.
Should be fine.

172
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,237
-I already put it.
-I did too.

173
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,698
-No, take it out.
-Why?

174
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,617
-I added it.
-I added it, so what?

175
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,494
So I added it already.

176
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,537
You added it again. Hey.

177
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,415
What do I do?

178
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,209
I already added it so you shouldn't.

179
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,586
Hey.

180
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you want to add sesame oil?
It's savory.

181
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,384
Let's add sesame oil.

182
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,095
-Add more.
-Sure. Do what you like.

183
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,389
Here…

184
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,269
After cooking class,
I started liking Se-yeon a lot more

185
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,189
because when I say I want to do something,
he'd let me do it

186
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,776
If I was struggling, he'd do it for me.

187
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,320
Are you okay? No, don't.

188
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,659
-Good.
-Thank you.

189
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,828
"Where should we go for our honeymoon?"

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,747
"What about the wedding dress?"

191
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,041
That's what I was thinking.

192
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,585
"Honeymoon"?

193
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
Ye-rin, you're like me.

194
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,257
-Wedding dress?
-She knows their kids' names too.

195
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
Can you move my hair back?

196
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,225
-Like this?
-Is it behind my ear?

197
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,103
Hang on.

198
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,234
It's back.

199
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,036
I fed her vegetables like carrots

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,038
just nonchalantly.

201
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,836
I cooled soup for her to taste it.

202
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,760
I think we became
closer after cooking.

203
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,348
That's so cute. They added meaning to it.

204
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,393
-Everything they do…
-It's their first time. It's new.

205
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,437
Done.

206
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,439
Let's add more?

207
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,066
Add a spoonful of sesame oil.

208
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,902
Just pour it. I'll say stop.

209
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,575
-It looks perfect. Look.
-I know.

210
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,368
It looks like restaurant food.

211
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,204
We just opened a restaurant.

212
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,707
Isn't this crazy?

213
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,042
That looks amazing.

214
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,337
Try the squid.

215
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,258
It's so good.

216
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,516
Is it good?

217
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,267
It's done.

218
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,353
Let's make a heart.

219
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,690
-What do you think?
-Good job.

220
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,944
Let's clean up.

221
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,364
Cleaning up
is the most important part of cooking.

222
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,448
My grandma said that.

223
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,575
Good.

224
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,245
Nice.

225
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,288
-Ji-woo, is the meat ready?
-What?

226
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,165
-Yes.
-Give me a bite.

227
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,627
Let's try the stir-fried chicken.

228
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,420
I haven't tried it yet.

229
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,299
Please.

230
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,844
Is it good?

231
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,638
Our food is the best.

232
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,348
When we were cooking together,

233
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,059
Ji-min entertained me.

234
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,728
We became closer than the first day.

235
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,607
I wanted to get to know him better.

236
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:25,030
At first,
I thought they got the wrong partners

237
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,991
because they seemed off.

238
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,578
But they learned something new
about each other.

239
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,413
-They had a good time.
-Yes.

240
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,291
-I could tell Se-yeon and Ye-rin…
-Yes.

241
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,002
fell for each other big time.
It was nice to see.

242
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,379
What surprised me was Seo-hyeon and…

243
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,964
-Pyeong-seok.
-Pyeong-seok.

244
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,176
They were enjoying it so much.

245
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,263
Pyeong-seok never seemed
so comfortable until now.

246
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,098
-It was nice to see.
-Yes, it was.

247
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,269
-Field trip?
-I love it.

248
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,939
Are we taking that bus?

249
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,234
I'm going to sit in the middle.

250
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,654
-Hello.
-Hello.

251
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,162
-Hello.
-Hello.

252
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,580
I'll sit in the back.

253
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,748
The bus looks…

254
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,458
-It's exciting.
-It looks like it.

255
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,085
-You can have snacks and drinks.
-It's romantic.

256
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,378
This is going to be fun.

257
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,925
-It's nice.
-I haven't been on a bus in so long.

258
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,972
I never went on a field trip
in high school.

259
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,099
-Really?
-Isn't that the same for everyone?

260
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,311
I've never been on a school trip
or a retreat.

261
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,646
-Me too.
-Same here.

262
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,980
None of us has.

263
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,108
-Really?
-Probably.

264
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,194
-Right.
-Due to COVID-19.

265
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,282
I heard we were going on a field trip,
but I didn't know where we were going.

266
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,161
I was looking forward to it.
I was excited.

267
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,412
It meant a lot

268
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,291
because I've never been on one
with friends before.

269
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,594
"Wolmido, 2.8 km."

270
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,889
"Wolmido Dock."

271
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,891
"Wolmi Theme Park."

272
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,228
-I knew it.
-I told you we'd be going to a theme park.

273
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,562
Wolmido?

274
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,481
-I'm from Incheon.
-Really?

275
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,525
A lot of people visit Wolmido.

276
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,276
-Disco Pang Pang?
-I've been on it.

277
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,947
-It's my first time here.
-It's going to be fun.

278
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,532
I can see it.

279
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,493
-I see the Ferris wheel.
-Yes.

280
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,786
This is going to be fun.

281
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,790
-It's going to be so much fun.
-It's going to be fun.

282
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,251
-Adults are so cruel.
-Why?

283
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,379
They take them to a place like that
and tell them not to date.

284
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,131
Just endure for a bit.

285
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,009
Right. Just a few days to go.

286
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
We're here.

287
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,054
See you later.

288
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,565
That looks fun.

289
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,027
It's crazy.

290
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,320
I didn't know it was so small.

291
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,406
Did it look big
because I was younger?

292
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,033
I've never been here before.

293
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
-It's your first time?
-Yes.

294
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,746
-What do you want to ride first?
-Disco Pang Pang.

295
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,207
-Let's go on Disco Pang Pang first.
-Let's ride five at a time.

296
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,877
-Let's split the team.
-Sure.

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,213
-Let's start.
-Get ready, up.

298
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,675
-It didn't work.
-Get ready, up.

299
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,927
-Get…
-It didn't work.

300
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,555
You four choose one.

301
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,556
-Sure.
-Sure.

302
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,767
-One come here.
-The one with the hand up.

303
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,227
-We had our hands up.
-Yes.

304
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,898
-We need one more. Who wants to?
-Someone needs to come.

305
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,317
-Who wants to come?
-Someone needs to.

306
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,235
-Anyone.
-Like this?

307
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,154
-What do I do? Do I go?
-Your call.

308
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,614
What do I do? Do I go?

309
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,242
Okay. We'll ride it first.

310
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,994
Sure. Good luck.

311
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,455
Oh, no. Seo-yeong's sad.

312
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,915
-Look at her.
-He chose Ji-woo.

313
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,959
-Ji-min.
-She's disappointed.

314
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,545
Okay. We'll ride it first.

315
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,297
-Sure. Good luck.
-Let's go.

316
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,841
-I'm getting nervous.
-I'm scared.

317
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,303
-I never rode it before.
-We'll probably wipe the ride clean.

318
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,888
-It's my first time.
-It'll be fun.

319
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,892
-Good luck.
-Enjoy.

320
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,814
-You have to save me.
-I'll hold you.

321
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,275
-I'll hold you. Ji-woo!
-Okay.

322
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,822
-It'll be my first time riding it.
-It'll be fun.

323
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,990
-I'm excited.
-Me too.

324
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,202
Bye, Ji-woo.

325
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,788
Don't be like that.

326
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,083
Oh, my God.

327
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,837
-Oh, my God.
-It's scary.

328
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,588
Why am I getting scared?

329
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,590
-Enjoy!
-Bye.

330
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,343
-Higher!
-What's wrong with you?

331
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,974
Jung-yun, show them how cool you are.

332
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,977
-My goodness.
-Help!

333
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,691
I'm going to fly off.

334
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,614
-Ye-rin.
-Ye-rin!

335
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,615
Come here.

336
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,747
Come here.

337
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,137
Ji-min's good at this!

338
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,431
-It's faster than I thought.
-Faster!

339
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,683
-Faster!
-Go faster!

340
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,853
You're crowded here.

341
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,732
Don't stay there. Come down here.

342
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,775
I'll push you to the other side.

343
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,820
Come down.

344
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,989
Oh, my gosh.

345
00:19:59,072 --> 00:19:59,907
She's moving down.

346
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,954
Good job, DJ.

347
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,249
Come down.

348
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,375
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,503
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,965
-Oh, my.
-What's going on?

351
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,175
Oh, my goodness.

352
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,177
She's right next to you.

353
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,678
-Hold here.
-Please.

354
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,475
-Can you keep going?
-What?

355
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,060
Can you keep at it?
I'll help you.

356
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,315
I'll shake it to the side.

357
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,401
See? She's moving.

358
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,363
Perfect. Just a bit more.

359
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,367
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

360
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,619
Hold on tight.

361
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,791
I think this is good enough.

362
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,419
Ji-woo was sitting next to me, and the DJ

363
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,964
bounced the ride on purpose

364
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,925
and made Ji-woo fly next to me.

365
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,844
It was thrilling.

366
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,806
I couldn't think of anything.

367
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,766
-Oh, my goodness.
-When…

368
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,852
-unexpected situations occur…
-Really?

369
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,438
When a thrilling moment
arrives unexpectedly,

370
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,690
it's more thrilling.

371
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,901
Ji-min was bouncing around too.

372
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,322
Yet, he held me and asked me
if I was okay.

373
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,449
That was nice of him.

374
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,037
Did you all have fun? Bye now.

375
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,206
Ye-rin, are you okay?

376
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,166
Are you okay?

377
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,460
It was really scary.

378
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,213
-Are you okay?
-It was really scary.

379
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,631
You were enjoying it.

380
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,009
Do you think we can do it?

381
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,511
-I'm scared.
-Me too.

382
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,637
Do we go this way?

383
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,097
Keep going. Go for it.

384
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,349
We can do it.

385
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,146
People who wanted to go faster are here.

386
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,399
Let's sit down.

387
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,401
-Let's sit here.
-Okay.

388
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,196
-Please go fast.
-It'll be fun to watch.

389
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,199
Oh, my.

390
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,577
-They look very close.
-I know.

391
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,247
-That's really scary.
-It's scary.

392
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,708
I can't do it. Can you?

393
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,418
-I've never been on it.
-Want to?

394
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,419
-That one?
-Yes.

395
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,963
-Let's go for it.
-What?

396
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,340
-Let's ride it.
-What?

397
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,967
-Sure.
-Okay.

398
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,552
-Let's ride the pirate ship too.
-Yes.

399
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,387
-I like pirate ships.
-Sure.

400
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,807
-Oh, no!
-Jung-yun!

401
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,310
I'd forgotten about Jung-yun.

402
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,520
Sorry. I completely forgot about you.

403
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
He didn't do anything.
We couldn't help it.

404
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,274
Jung-yun, this is…

405
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,985
-Go fast!
-Go fast!

406
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,820
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

407
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,830
Please!

408
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,676
Both sides…

409
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,679
Look at Seo-hyeon.

410
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,850
Please!

411
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,395
It hurts.

412
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,272
Hold here.

413
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,028
Are you okay?

414
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,572
Hold it.

415
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,867
I'll let go if it hurts.

416
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,370
He's holding her arm.

417
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,163
"I'll let you go if it hurts."

418
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,707
That's nice of him. That's considerate.

419
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,584
Sang-won is so cool.

420
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll let you go if it hurts.

421
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,757
-They're holding hands.
-Who?

422
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,093
-Sang-won and Seo-hyeon.
-Really?

423
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,813
Are you okay?

424
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,484
I never knew Disco Pang Pang was…

425
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,278
How can it be so thrilling?

426
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,573
After Disco Pang Pang, Ji-min and…

427
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,408
-Ji-woo.
-Ji-woo.

428
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,910
-They're close.
-There's something between them.

429
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,704
-After cooking.
-I know.

430
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,998
We should continue watching.

431
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,501
-Let's go on the pirate ship.
-Sure!

432
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,211
This is going to be fun.

433
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,672
I'm going to scream like crazy.

434
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,674
I'll make your eardrums burst.

435
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,260
-Do you want to sit here?
-No.

436
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,972
-What?
-It's starting like that?

437
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,307
Do we put our hands up?

438
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,435
-Let go.
-No hands?

439
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,149
Hey!

440
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,485
This is so much fun.

441
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,864
Higher!

442
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,662
This is awesome.

443
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,290
Help!

444
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
Stop!

445
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,680
-I want more.
-More please!

446
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,141
Hey!

447
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,234
It's so crowded.

448
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,195
Get closer.

449
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,114
Nice.

450
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,784
Good.

451
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,204
-Good. It's cute.
-Yes.

452
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,747
-I know.
-It's so cute.

453
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,458
It's a good picture.

454
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,835
It looks nice.

455
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,878
It's pretty.

456
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,384
-I'm hungry.
-Let's get something to eat.

457
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,344
We can eat here.

458
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,179
That looks good.

459
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,265
I'll get everything from here to here.

460
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,936
That looks so good.

461
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,521
Thank you.

462
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,856
This is amazing.

463
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,496
-Do you like it? Is it good?
-Yes.

464
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,832
-Oh, my.
-He's feeding her.

465
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,960
-This is a dating field trip.
-I'm jealous.

466
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,551
It's the ocean. The winter ocean.

467
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,345
It's beautiful.

468
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,097
It's terrific.

469
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm getting sentimental, guys.

470
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,144
-Me too.
-It's beautiful.

471
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,647
I feel like I'm dreaming. I love it.

472
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,983
-Do you like the ocean?
-What?

473
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,444
-Do you like watching the ocean?
-Totally. You?

474
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,572
-I love it too.
-Do you like seeing it or swimming in it?

475
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,574
-Both.
-I don't like playing in it.

476
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,659
-What? You don't like playing in it?
-No.

477
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,162
-Really? We should go together.
-Going in the water…

478
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,331
-Do you know Pohang?
-Yes.

479
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,083
I'm from Pohang. I like water.

480
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,168
I like seafood.

481
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,045
Hoe? I love it.

482
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,463
-I like that too.
-Grilled clams.

483
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,840
I like swimming
and watching the water.

484
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,426
The sun looks beautiful.

485
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,094
It's amazing.

486
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,847
-It's so pretty.
-It's…

487
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,559
-I want to take a picture.
-It's crazy.

488
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:28,229
Let's try taking a selfie here.

489
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,566
-Let's try.
-Let's ask someone.

490
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,777
Let's make a V-sign.

491
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,154
One, two, three.

492
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,991
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

493
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,203
I'll remember this forever.

494
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,538
I hope we can come back next year.

495
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,083
-We should do that.
-Sounds good to me.

496
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,627
-That's a very nice memory.
-Yes.

497
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,712
-They're young.
-I want to join them.

498
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,136
Have you been here before?

499
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,889
-I said I haven't.
-Did you?

500
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,557
From the start…

501
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,770
-Jung-yun.
-Jung-yun.

502
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,271
He initiated a conversation at last

503
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,816
She said no.

504
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,694
You don't have good memory.

505
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,780
I usually have good memory.

506
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,907
Do you only forget the things I say?

507
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,328
After the pirate ship, I lost my memory.

508
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,081
It's so pretty.

509
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,041
It's the Ferris wheel.

510
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,846
We're going to ride it now.

511
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,640
Only two at a time.
Let's choose our partners.

512
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,350
Good. Do you want to go together?

513
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,977
-Yes?
-Sure.

514
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,230
How should we pair up?

515
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,857
How should we choose?

516
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,609
-Those who want to go together first.
-All right.

517
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,404
People who want to ride it first
should go now.

518
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,281
Those two. Go.

519
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,949
-Off they go.
-What's going on?

520
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,201
Honestly, I wanted to ride it with her.

521
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,246
The Ferris wheel is a long ride.

522
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,291
That will give me a chance to talk to her.

523
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,293
So I asked Seo-hyeon to come with me.

524
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,795
You two can go together.

525
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,255
-Next--
-Us two.

526
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,923
You two? Okay.

527
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,093
Pyeong-seok.

528
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,471
-Pyeong-seok.
-He's surprised.

529
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,055
Hee-ji's leading him.

530
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,432
Hee-ji's tough.

531
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,684
-Even I'd fall for her.
-Me too.

532
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,810
She's enthusiastic.

533
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,024
I was grateful

534
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,110
when Hee-ji said she wanted
to ride the Ferris wheel with me first.

535
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,657
I wonder how long he'll stay shy.

536
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,037
I chose him
because I wanted to hear him talk.

537
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,331
Let's ride it.

538
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,458
Oh, my God.

539
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,005
Honestly, if I had to choose one,
it'd be Se-yeon.

540
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,301
-We could play a game to decide.
-Sure.

541
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,552
Who wants to go with me?

542
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,805
-Anyone.
-Girls…

543
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,973
Girls versus boys or…

544
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,267
What am I saying?

545
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,313
A boy and a girl?

546
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,565
-It's up to you.
-You decide.

547
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
That's funny.

548
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,278
Anyone want to go with me?
Anyone?

549
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,703
Whatever. I'll go
with whoever's left.

550
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,206
Choose who you want to go with first.

551
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,167
-Ji-min.
-Ji-min!

552
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
Ji-min's swayed.

553
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,089
That's disappointing.

554
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,718
We could play a game to decide.

555
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,598
You seem like you have someone in mind.

556
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,562
Say it. You have to say it now.

557
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,355
-Now.
-No.

558
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,190
No, let's just do it.

559
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,818
-Okay. Let's go.
-With whom?

560
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,029
Okay. Let's go.

561
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,781
Let's go.

562
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,492
-Oh, my.
-Okay.

563
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,163
-Oh, my goodness.
-Oh, no.

564
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,957
I see why Ji-min's doing that.

565
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,460
-Because he had a connection with Ji-woo.
-Yes.

566
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,753
She's not even his girlfriend.

567
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,672
-Right.
-He didn't do anything wrong.

568
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,718
-The rest of you. Hurry up and decide.
-Want to play a game?

569
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,269
Hang on.

570
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,272
You two go. I'll go with him.

571
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,609
Because Jung-yun and I are seatmates.

572
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,320
Right? We have lots of time to talk.

573
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,071
-Okay.
-Let's do that.

574
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,158
-Let's go with that.
-Let's go.

575
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,492
Let's go with that.

576
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,120
-Oh, Jung-yun.
-Because…

577
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,039
Jung-yun's holding his hands.

578
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,000
-Jung-yun, now is the time.
-He was praying.

579
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,002
Now is your chance.

580
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,006
That moment, I thought, "Nice!"

581
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,093
I haven't really gotten to talk
to Ji-woo yet.

582
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,680
I wanted to ride it with her.
It worked out for me.

583
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,892
It's finally settled.

584
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,061
They all paired up

585
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,398
with the people
they were interested in at first.

586
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,900
-Right.
-Yes.

587
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,276
When there were four left…

588
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,112
When Ji-woo, Ye-rin,
Se-yeon and Jung-yun were left,

589
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,075
we could see how they should pair up.

590
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,495
But they were rather hesitant.

591
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,374
I found Ye-rin absurd.
She had someone in mind from the start.

592
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,250
-I think I get it now.
-Get what?

593
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:47,090
Ye-rin was expecting Se-yeon
to ask her first.

594
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,633
-Right.
-So, to the end…

595
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,592
She waited?

596
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,928
-Since she was left at the end--
-She took him.

597
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,347
She was like, "I'll say it first."

598
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,850
I think Se-yeon wanted to ride it
with someone else.

599
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,769
Things were going good with Ji-woo.

600
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,147
Ji-woo's involved with a lot of people.

601
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,941
Ji-woo has chemistry with everyone.

602
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,610
-Ji-woo is taking the school by storm.
-Ji-woo…

603
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,989
She's involved
with Se-yeon, Jung-yun and Ji-min.

604
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,701
-She's shaking up the game.
-Exactly.

605
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,877
It's so pretty.

606
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,841
-It's really pretty.
-I want to come here again.

607
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,010
-Me too.
-It's my first time in Incheon.

608
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,344
-It's your first time?
-Yes.

609
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,388
-But you live in Seoul.
-Yes.

610
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,181
-Still?
-Yes.

611
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
-Cool.
-Where do you live?

612
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,351
In Seoul. Near Sinchon.

613
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,813
I left home at around 7:45 a.m. today.

614
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,358
-I woke up at 6:40 a.m. today.
-Where in Seoul do you live?

615
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,111
-Nowon.
-Nowon?

616
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,988
Near Nowon.

617
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,324
That's a bit far.
That's far from school too.

618
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,327
About 30 minutes away from school.

619
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,205
But last time, it took me an hour.

620
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,167
-It must be tiring.
-I should do my best.

621
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,252
-And wash my hair.
-You look nice.

622
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,795
Thank you.

623
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,339
I'm not used to compliments.

624
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,759
I can never get used to compliments.

625
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,635
-I should compliment you more.
-No.

626
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,887
Why not?

627
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,597
-Never.
-Never?

628
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,265
-Does it make you awkward?
-Totally.

629
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,517
-That doesn't sound so bad.
-Don't.

630
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:28,191
I felt a bit more shy
because it was just the two of us.

631
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,277
I sat across from Seo-hyeon.

632
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,821
I was very nervous.

633
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,115
Oh, my.

634
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,118
Why is it moving fast now?

635
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,536
-It feels faster.
-I know.

636
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,205
It's moving so fast.

637
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,665
-I want to stay here longer. It's fast.
-Me too.

638
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,210
It's a shame.

639
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,337
Maybe it'll go around once more?

640
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,590
Oh, right. I think it said two rounds.

641
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,218
Really? It'd be nice
if we can get two rounds.

642
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,303
-I know.
-I don't want to get off.

643
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,474
What?
What's wrong?

644
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,352
What's the matter?

645
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,688
It's nice.

646
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,360
Let's look at the ocean.

647
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,200
I rode it when I was really young.

648
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,084
Where did I ride it?

649
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,253
-Where did you ride it?
-Me?

650
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,255
In Daegu.

651
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,007
Daegu? I've never been to Daegu before.

652
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,885
-Daegu.
-Daegu.

653
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,805
Daegu.

654
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,393
-Is he shy?
-Pyeong-seok never talks.

655
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,397
-In front of a girl he likes…
-That might be it.

656
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,941
I don't know what he's like yet.

657
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,112
All I know about Daegu
is their honey rice cake.

658
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,655
-Really?
-Yes.

659
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,824
I wanted to go there for that.

660
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,747
It's so pretty. I should take a picture.

661
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,500
One, two, three.

662
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,836
It's not working.

663
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,173
We can't miss this chance.

664
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,968
-No film?
-My plan is ruined.

665
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,094
No. I think…

666
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,224
That's not it.

667
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,897
Let's try that again.

668
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,481
-There are some left.
-It's…

669
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,150
Want to try it again?

670
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,739
We got it.

671
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,116
We did it.

672
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,369
In one, two, three.

673
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,915
We did it.

674
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,957
Let's take a selfie.

675
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,920
Wait. How do I hold it?

676
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,421
Like this.

677
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,634
In one, two, three.

678
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,097
-Do I look here?
-Yes, where did you look?

679
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,682
I looked here.

680
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,312
It's okay. It'll be fine.

681
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,940
After the field trip,

682
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:19,070
I think I like Pyeong-seok this much more.

683
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,198
Q. WHAT'S APPEALING ABOUT PYEONG-SEOK?

684
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,494
It's his smile.

685
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,580
We didn't talk much.

686
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,917
I wanted to ask
if she was interested in anyone.

687
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,962
But I was too shy.

688
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,172
-Really?
-See that?

689
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,801
-He's shy.
-He was shy.

690
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,012
That's so cute.

691
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:50,726
I thought Pyeong-seok was interested
in Seo-hyeon.

692
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,979
But he treated her as a friend.

693
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,522
Because he was shy.

694
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,691
He was nervous in front of Hee-ji.

695
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,695
Pyeong-seok needs more time.

696
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,240
You should give him more time.

697
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,037
We're up here.

698
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,581
-It's going down pretty fast.
-I know.

699
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,511
Did you go to coed school?

700
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,054
-Yes.
-Did you?

701
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,222
I'm jealous.

702
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,724
-You go to an all-boys school?
-Yes.

703
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,101
-Where?
-Both middle and high school.

704
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,228
-I go to Nam High.
-Nam High?

705
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,855
-Namyang High School.
-Oh, Namyang.

706
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,400
So it's Nam High. I go to Nam High.

707
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,778
Where's Namyang High?

708
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,780
-Where is it?
-Hwaseong.

709
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,740
Hwaseong?

710
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,161
I know Hwaseong.

711
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,122
-I've visited--
-You didn't know I lived there?

712
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,915
I didn't know. You never told me.

713
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,211
When I introduced myself at first,
I said I'm from Hwaseong.

714
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,174
When I introduced myself,
I said I live in Hwaseong.

715
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,677
I go to Hwaseong often.

716
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,554
-Why?
-I used to go there often.

717
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,805
Why?

718
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,099
I used to play baseball.

719
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,895
-How would I know?
-There's a baseball stadium there.

720
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,104
You don't play anymore?

721
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,232
-Because it's tough.
-It's tough.

722
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,986
I see. I didn't know.

723
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,322
What?

724
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,534
Hey, a soccer field.

725
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,746
-It's the soccer field.
-Do you like it?

726
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,415
-I love soccer. I watch it often.
-Really?

727
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,708
Did you watch it last night?

728
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,544
-I watched it last night.
-Last night? Who won?

729
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,171
-They tied.
-Really?

730
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,257
-Did Son Heung-min play?
-Yes, he wore a mask.

731
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,259
-Still?
-Yes.

732
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,596
-That must not be easy.
-Right.

733
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,514
Yes.

734
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,725
-What's your height?
-Guess.

735
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,519
People usually get it at once.

736
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:03,109
Is it 158 cm? Or 162 cm? No?

737
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,986
Or 161 cm?

738
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,822
-Did I get it?
-Yes.

739
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,032
But that's…

740
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
with my shoes off.

741
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,578
-You're tall.
-I'm pretty tall.

742
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,455
Let me guess your height.

743
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,707
I think you are the tallest.

744
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,418
Around 1…

745
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,547
Around 180 cm?

746
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,426
-In the morning.
-It changes?

747
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,137
It's 180 cm in the morning,
and 179 cm at night.

748
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,597
-Average is 179.5 cm.
-You're tall.

749
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,433
The average?

750
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:40,354
At first, he seemed cold and quiet.

751
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,482
But he was playful on the Ferris wheel.

752
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,110
He laughed at my comments too.

753
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:50,656
He seemed interesting.
I want to get to know him better.

754
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,785
-Did you know there would be new students?
-No.

755
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,121
How did you feel when you saw me?

756
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,664
-I was thrilled.
-What?

757
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,791
-I was thrilled at the news.
-Really?

758
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,709
Yes.

759
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,378
Finally.

760
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,797
That was the most intense expression
he's made.

761
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,008
I was surprised by how boldly he put it.

762
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,886
-How did you feel when you saw me?
-I was thrilled.

763
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,180
-What?
-I was thrilled at the news.

764
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,389
-Really?
-Yes.

765
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,319
That's all that matters.

766
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,701
Right now,
I'm interested in Ji-woo the most.

767
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,370
We became closer after talking.

768
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,999
I'm starting to become more
interested in her.

769
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,793
We're halfway.

770
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,798
I don't want to go. I want to stay here.

771
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
I thought it'd be scary,
but it's not.

772
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,638
-Right?
-Yes. It's nice.

773
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,557
It looks like a painting.

774
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,728
It's really pretty.

775
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,776
You always say the scenery is pretty,
but why do you never say that to me?

776
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,036
But… Open the window.

777
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,040
Open the window.

778
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,878
It's hot in here.

779
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,974
I think I just wanted Se-yeon
to tell me I was pretty.

780
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,434
I was embarrassed
after asking that question.

781
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,019
I couldn't look at him.

782
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,816
At that moment,
I became a robot and froze.

783
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,860
I couldn't get a hold of myself.

784
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,124
I have a question.

785
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,378
-Never mind.
-Are you going to say something weird?

786
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,005
I won't ask.

787
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,800
It's okay. Ask away. I'll answer it.

788
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,469
-Honestly?
-I'll answer it honestly.

789
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,637
Really?

790
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,100
I…

791
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,645
never thought about getting the book
from you.

792
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,688
Okay.

793
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,647
But…

794
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,609
how did you decide it?

795
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,988
Back then, we had just met
and you had a seatmate.

796
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,042
Ever since we met,

797
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:54,006
I always said you were the prettiest,
and that I liked you.

798
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,802
Even before going to the library,

799
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:04,350
I thought about getting you
a book with a good title.

800
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,019
So I got you a book that matches you.
That's all.

801
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,735
I didn't have romantic feelings
for the person I gave my book to.

802
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,237
So I thought that might be the case
for him too.

803
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,698
"Am I putting too much meaning
in the book?"

804
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,660
I was worried.

805
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:27,581
I was relieved to hear what he said.

806
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,293
He didn't give it to me for no reason.

807
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,590
You know, I'm not sure.

808
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,384
-Me neither.
-Right.

809
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,844
-Ye-rin is clear.
-Ye-rin is clear.

810
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,931
But Se-yeon sounds like
he's talking in the past tense.

811
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,684
-He said he means it.
-Right.

812
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:51,105
But there were certain actions he made
when he was thrilled.

813
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,607
-But I don't see them now.
-I'm worried.

814
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:59,071
Ye-rin's asking questions
to confirm his feelings.

815
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,491
Maybe Ye-rin felt that too
without realizing it,

816
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,244
so she's asking him
those questions to check.

817
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,954
-Right.
-That's what I think.

818
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,582
-This is getting tense.
-I can never guess.

819
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,168
One thing is clear.
Ye-rin's into him more.

820
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,380
Awesome.

821
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,812
This is my first time riding it.

822
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,314
-Me too.
-My first time with you.

823
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,288
You were forced to choose me earlier.

824
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,331
-No.
-No?

825
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,058
Let me ask you one more question.

826
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,104
-Is there anyone you like right now?
-Anyone I like?

827
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,567
Say no if you don't have anyone.

828
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,781
-I'm not sure yet.
-Not sure?

829
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,162
I'm not sure.

830
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,795
When will it go down?
I'm so scared.

831
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,186
It breaks my heart.

832
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:55,979
Oh, no.

833
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,067
Ji-min's doesn't have feelings
for her anymore.

834
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,401
He's really honest.

835
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,320
He's very honest,

836
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,657
but at the same time,
it's disappointing and embarrassing.

837
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,160
But at that age, they're not like,

838
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,455
"What I say and do now will
bring this result later."

839
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:19,419
They're too young to worry about that.
He's just true to his emotions.

840
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,421
It's normal to be honest.

841
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,466
Ji-min can't lie

842
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,593
-when he's not into anyone.
-Right.

843
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:31,557
I think he really doesn't have
any feelings for her now.

844
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,933
-He didn't look at her.
-No.

845
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,103
He kept looking outside.
Seo-yeong must've been disappointed.

846
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,314
She's not used to getting treated
like that yet.

847
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,234
-Right.
-Seo-yeong hasn't expressed

848
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,820
her heart to anyone else
other than Ji-min.

849
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,738
-Right.
-So…

850
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,324
-she looks sadder.
-Yes.

851
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,119
UNTIL 20
D-3

852
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,245
Three days left.

853
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,387
Hello, class president.

854
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,139
Hi.

855
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,309
Who broke the rule?

856
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,020
-Look.
-What?

857
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,354
NO DATING
FOLLOW THE RULES!

858
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,189
-Was it you?
-No.

859
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,485
-I have a big problem.
-A big problem?

860
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,112
Come here. I'll give you advice.

861
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,947
-Tell me.
-So the thing is…

862
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,325
-You see…
-You can tell me everything.

863
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,412
-You know Seo-yeong?
-Yes.

864
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,707
I told you I was interested in her before.

865
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,208
-But…
-Yes?

866
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,086
I think that was it.

867
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,839
-Yes?
-Yes.

868
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:50,636
It was awkward when everyone led us
to go on the Ferris wheel together.

869
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,512
-You didn't want that?
-No, I…

870
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,515
Who did you want to ride it with?
Be honest.

871
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,435
I'll tell you. Honestly,
I wanted to ride it with Ji-woo.

872
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,355
Then you should've asked Ji-woo.

873
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,232
Why did you say you'll ride it
with whoever's left?

874
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,985
-Why?
-I didn't want to break Seo-yeong's heart.

875
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,986
That's true.

876
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,030
-It'd break her heart.
-Of course.

877
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,865
She asked me
if I was interested in anyone.

878
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,117
-Seo-yeong?
-So I said,

879
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,079
-"I don't know."
-You said you don't know?

880
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,624
It'll be awkward today.

881
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,419
-I'm worried about it.
-It's okay. Over time…

882
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,088
But it's not your fault.

883
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,341
But we all just met.
We're still getting to know each other.

884
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,302
It's nothing weird.
You didn't do anything wrong.

885
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,683
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

886
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
-Hello.
-Hi.

887
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,020
Your hair looks different.

888
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,108
Jung-yun. Come sit here!

889
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,319
Hey. Join us.

890
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,821
Pyeong-seok. Hurry up.

891
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,576
Pyeong-seok,
how did you get to ride with Hee-ji?

892
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,412
I really wanted to ask you.

893
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,330
Everyone's so straightforward.

894
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,165
Hee-ji asked me first.

895
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:06,253
-Who did you want to go with?
-You never said it.

896
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,088
Hee-ji.

897
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,590
That's cute.

898
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,384
I love it.

899
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,052
-Oh, my goodness.
-This is it.

900
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,554
This is what I wanted.

901
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,681
Hee-ji makes you feel comfortable.

902
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,598
What about you?

903
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,601
-What? What about me?
-What about you?

904
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,854
-What about me?
-Any change of heart?

905
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,564
Me? Any change of heart?

906
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,358
Hey, let's hear from Jung-yun first.

907
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,445
-How was it yesterday?
-It was great.

908
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,409
I can't listen to this.

909
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,786
I can.

910
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,081
-Hello.
-Hi.

911
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,503
-Did you rest well yesterday?
-Yes.

912
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,265
-Here.
-Thanks.

913
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,399
I'm going to sit over there.

914
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,862
Okay.

915
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:17,324
-Where did you say you live?
-Guess. I said it with my introduction.

916
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,953
If I were her and you don't know, I'd cry.

917
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,914
-I know.
-You're the only one who doesn't know.

918
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,415
I couldn't hear you.

919
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,211
It sounds like the name of a planet.

920
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,924
-Hwaseong. Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.
-Yes.

921
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,092
Sorry.

922
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,599
-Hello, vice president.
-I missed you.

923
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,852
-I missed you so much.
-Everyone does.

924
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,604
I missed you so much.

925
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,148
Hey, vice prez.
I think someone broke the rule.

926
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,025
That was written when I got here.

927
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,239
Who is it? Look at me. Hang on.

928
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,782
Look me in the eye.

929
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,243
Look me in the eye.

930
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,370
What?

931
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,373
-She's checking who broke the rule.
-Who broke the rule?

932
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,125
What?

933
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,421
Is it you?

934
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,090
-It's you two.
-It's you two.

935
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,217
Why are you…

936
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,803
It's you. Don't try to lie to us.

937
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,097
-What's going on?
-It's you two.

938
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,015
-It's you two.
-Next.

939
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,893
Hey, can you give me the Polaroid?

940
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,770
Oh, that's right.

941
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,273
-Polaroid…
-Pyeong-seok, is it you?

942
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,525
Wait. Why did you look at Pyeong-seok?

943
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,694
Why didn't you check Pyeong-seok?

944
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,237
If you do…

945
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,157
How can the class vice president do that?

946
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,826
Vice prez, don't break the rule.

947
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,538
NO DATING
PENALTY WILL BE IMPOSED IF CAUGHT

948
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,415
-Let's go.
-Take out your card.

949
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,332
Let's go.

950
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,170
-What's this?
-The chicken skewer model.

951
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,256
-What's this?
-The chicken skewer model.

952
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,134
-You look like a chicken skewer model.
-"Skewer model."

953
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,428
-Who's this?
-This is nothing.

954
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,599
This is wrong. Please.

955
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,437
-No.
-What about it?

956
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,771
-What?
-What's wrong with it?

957
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,232
-It's a good pic.
-The chicken skewer looks nice.

958
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,276
-Right?
-The chicken skewer looks nice.

959
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,611
Come here.

960
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,072
No, come here.

961
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,617
-What are they doing?
-That's really cute.

962
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,911
This is good.
Did Pyeong-seok take it?

963
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,580
-What are you two doing?
-You two…

964
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,790
What were you two doing?

965
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,293
-Isn't this cute?
-What were you two doing?

966
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,003
Put it next to "No Dating."

967
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:38,089
Just write who they are.

968
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,841
I think I know who they are.

969
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,344
Like that?

970
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,390
-That's shrewd.
-Nice. That's how you do it.

971
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,186
You're enjoying it so much. That's cheese.

972
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,104
Yes, you're right.

973
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,898
-It's cheese.
-I thought it wasn't.

974
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,066
Cheese stir-fried chicken.

975
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,526
-No, it's chicken skewer.
-Pyeong-seok looks cute.

976
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,903
Apparently, that's cheese.

977
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,238
Is that why she fell for Pyeong-seok?

978
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:07,827
I wasn't talking to you. What?

979
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,788
No way.

980
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,707
Someone winked at me yesterday. And you?

981
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,168
-Are you jealous?
-Who was it?

982
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,378
-Pyeong-seok.
-Really?

983
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,963
Right. He winked at me too.

984
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,590
-What should I do?
-Pyeong-seok, wink at me.

985
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,468
Hee-ji, is that why?

986
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,763
I should've taken a picture or filmed it.

987
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,681
They're cute.

988
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,807
They're so cute.

989
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,560
Pyeong-seok admitted he likes Hee-ji.

990
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,562
-Right.
-He ended up saying he likes her.

991
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,606
Pyeong-seok's good at hiding it.

992
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,524
I know.

993
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,484
He announced it to his friends.

994
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,903
-You can't help but fall for her.
-Right.

995
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,322
-She was so straightforward.
-Right.

996
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,368
-Do you think Ji-woo likes anyone?
-I don't know who's in her heart.

997
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,161
-No?
-She's the same in every moment.

998
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,413
To everyone.

999
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,415
Right. She treats everyone the same.

1000
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,668
I think Ji-woo is still
getting to know them.

1001
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,629
Ji-woo was from Hwaseong,
and now she's going nationwide.

1002
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,549
Everyone would know she lives in Hwaseong.

1003
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,385
-Want to play table tennis?
-I'm in.

1004
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,140
-Wait.
-My mistake.

1005
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,058
That was a missed serve.

1006
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,893
Okay, missed serve.

1007
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,028
-Nice, Ye-rin.
-Se-yeon, are you watching?

1008
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,907
Are you watching this, Se-yeon?

1009
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,870
-Sang-won's in the astronomy club.
-This is crazy!

1010
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,038
Seriously.

1011
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,706
Pyeong-seok.

1012
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,416
"Love and Table Tennis."

1013
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:42,047
You all have someone
who's caught your attention, right?

1014
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,715
-Yes.
-You all have at least one.

1015
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,594
Tell me about how you got to like them
and anything thrilling that happened.

1016
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,762
Are you a teacher?

1017
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,139
Let's talk about it.

1018
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,933
-You should be here.
-Exactly.

1019
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,393
I had two yesterday.

1020
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,813
Who?

1021
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,023
Who?

1022
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,098
