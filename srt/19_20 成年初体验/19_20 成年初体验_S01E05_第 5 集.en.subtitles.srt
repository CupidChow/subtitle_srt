SE-YEON

JUNG-YUN

00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
SEO-HYEON

00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,528
SANG-WON

00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
HEE-JI

00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
JI-MIN

PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:55,221
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,765
I had two yesterday.

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,433
Who?

14
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,101
Who?

15
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,478
Who?

16
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,021
Ji-min and…

17
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,814
-Jung-yun?
-Yes.

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,983
Why was that?

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,234
Ji-min…

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,819
-Ji-min…
-He was so sweet.

21
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,362
He's so sweet and friendly.

22
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,531
-Right.
-And when we were cooking…

23
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,657
You cooked together.

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,992
-It was fun.
-I get it.

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,913
And I was really embarrassed
when we were on the ride,

26
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,331
but he kept comforting me,

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,916
-saying it was okay.
-Really?

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,542
He even held my hand.

29
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,586
So I…

30
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,921
That was you guys!

31
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,339
YESTERDAY, WOLMIDO

32
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,090
Let me know. I'll help you.

33
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,051
Hold here.

34
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,427
Please.

35
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,054
Can you keep at it? I'll help you.

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,349
I didn't notice, though.

37
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,435
-I didn't either.
-Right.

38
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,646
I didn't think he was holding you at all.

39
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,731
-He was.
-That's a surprise.

40
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
Oh, Seo-yeong…

41
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,820
Seo-yeong…

42
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,821
She's worried.

43
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,239
She seems anxious.

44
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,157
Jung-yun…

45
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,576
What about Jung-yun, then?

46
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494
Jung-yun?

47
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,747
-We talked quite a lot yesterday.
-Really?

48
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,667
We kept talking
until we got to the Ferris wheel,

49
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,004
and even while we rode the Ferris wheel.

50
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,842
-But this is all really difficult…
-Right.

51
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,594
-I have no clue how I feel.
-Right.

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,556
-This is hard.
-You and Sang-won,

53
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,641
-what did you talk about?
-So we…

54
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,771
We just made small talk, then time flew by

55
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,774
and we wished we could keep riding.

56
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,276
-That's great.
-So…

57
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,945
I felt a bit shy
when he said stuff like that.

58
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,196
-He said that?
-Yes.

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,948
-It's not just how you felt?
-He did?

60
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,324
I mean, we both did.

61
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,326
-We both said stuff like that.
-Hold on.

62
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,371
-I have something to brag about too.
-What?

63
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,083
When the Ferris wheel doors opened,
Se-yeon said,

64
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,002
"Just one more round."

65
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,712
We even held the door closed.

66
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,756
-So it wouldn't open?
-What?

67
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,466
Really?

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,552
We didn't click, though.

69
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,553
Why?

70
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:02,557
To be honest, I asked him.
This is a secret, though.

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,767
I asked if he was interested in anyone.

72
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,728
-You asked Ji-min?
-Yes.

73
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,062
He said he's not sure yet.

74
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,564
He said he's not sure?

75
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,899
-He did?
-Yes.

76
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,483
So I'm not sure about him.

77
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,195
I've been confused about his feelings
ever since then.

78
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,450
I think it's possible
for feelings to change.

79
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
What about you?

80
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,785
I think so too.

81
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,745
Me too.

82
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,622
Your feelings can change.

83
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,040
-You're right.
-I agree.

84
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,334
Lots of things will change
when we leave here.

85
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,129
We might have more time to spend alone.

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,132
-And since we're seeing new things,
-Right.

87
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,885
our feelings about the guys could change.

88
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,802
Right.

89
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,889
We could be surprised…

90
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,142
In a good way or a bad way.

91
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,604
During our cooking class yesterday,

92
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,859
I felt like
I wanted to joke around with Pyeong-seok

93
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,612
and tease him a bit.

94
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:03,534
But I'm not sure
if I just think he's a cute friend,

95
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,788
or if I'm actually attracted to him.

96
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,043
-This is getting interesting.
-This is fun.

97
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,586
This is a bit surprising.

98
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,005
I thought she and Sang-won
were practically dating.

99
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,632
-Right.
-Me too.

100
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,802
She doesn't seem to like him
as much as Sang-won yet.

101
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,762
The feeling is so different.

102
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,180
But Ji-woo…

103
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,558
Well, Jung-yun seems
to really like Ji-woo.

104
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,062
But Ji-min also seems
to like her the most.

105
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,231
Ji-woo's holding the key now.

106
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,483
I think she likes Jung-yun more.

107
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,901
-Really?
-Really?

108
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,822
Yes, because Ji-min
expressed his feelings more,

109
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,949
like asking to hold her hand.

110
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,784
That's why she's interested.

111
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,538
But Jung-yun hasn't
actually done anything,

112
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,415
although he's making some effort.

113
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,792
-Right.
-Despite all that,

114
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,627
she's attracted to him.

115
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,797
And Jung-yun caught her eye
when she first arrived.

116
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,801
Still, Ji-woo doesn't seem sure
about either of them yet.

117
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,470
She just seems a bit curious about them.

118
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,513
-Yes, right.
-Right.

119
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,390
She keeps saying she's not sure.

120
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,101
So maybe whoever's bolder
will win her affection.

121
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,730
Anyway, it seems like
one of them will end up sad.

122
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,607
DANCESPORT
INSTRUCTOR: AN HYE-SANG, KIM DONG-GU

123
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,609
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

124
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,946
We're the instructors
for today's dancesport class,

125
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,239
An Hye-sang…

126
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,282
And Kim Dong-gu.

127
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,580
Today we'll learn the cha-cha,
which is a Latin dance.

128
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:36,085
Dancesport is a partner dance
where a man and a woman dance together.

129
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,464
So today, we'll be partnering you up

130
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:44,302
into pairs who we think
dance well together.

131
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,679
Everyone shout, "Let's do it!"

132
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,389
-Let's do it!
-Great.

133
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,309
Are you standing in pairs
with your seatmates?

134
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,685
-Yes.
-Seatmates?

135
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,686
-Yes.
-Then…

136
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,315
-Boys, stand to the right of the girls.
-Right.

137
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,816
-Come to this side.
-Here.

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,693
Come this way. Like this.

139
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,028
-Let's do this.
-Like this.

140
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,405
-Like this. Okay.
-In a zigzag line?

141
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,574
Yes, like this.

142
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm so bad at dancing. What about you?

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,119
I can dance a bit.

144
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,621
What? Really? Okay.

145
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,582
We'll do it in this order.

146
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,044
Since it's a partner dance,
you have to hold each other.

147
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,213
The boys will get ready like this,

148
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,174
and the girls
will hold their partners like this.

149
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,676
Shall we try it, then? Get ready!

150
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,599
Hold your partner
and get ready to dance now.

151
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,560
Shall we try it, then? Get ready!

152
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,145
Get ready!

153
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
No, not like that!

154
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,818
Ready?

155
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,950
This is awkward.

156
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,409
Where are you looking?

157
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,079
-All right.
-Isn't this right?

158
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,163
Is this right?

159
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,207
Look at me. Boys…

160
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,416
Should we try too?

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,752
This is your partner's height.

162
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,506
How can you dance
if you hold your partner like this?

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,887
Now, move your left foot forward.

164
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
And girls, move your right foot back.

165
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,102
-Okay. Now go!
-Right foot back?

166
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,186
-One…
-Go back…

167
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,229
-Two…
-…and forth.

168
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,814
-One, two, three.
-Cha-cha-cha.

169
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,859
Now, the boys…

170
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,821
This time, the boys step back
and the girls step forward.

171
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
Go!

172
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,324
-One, two…
-Go back and forth.

173
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,410
-Cha-cha-cha.
-Cha-cha-cha.

174
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,953
I think you've got it.

175
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,707
Now the girls will step forward.

176
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,875
Go!

177
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,793
-Cha-cha-cha.
-Cha-cha-cha.

178
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,711
Go!

179
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,964
Go forward?

180
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,592
We messed up!

181
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,220
-Hang on.
-Wait.

182
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,181
-Wait. Sideways?
-Let's step sideways.

183
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,183
One, two, three.

184
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,851
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

185
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,104
All right, let's try it.

186
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,566
-This is hard.
-Once more!

187
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,817
Get ready.

188
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,652
Place your foot…

189
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,822
Our eyes met and we held hands too.

190
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,657
My hands were really cold.

191
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,368
But Pyeong-seok's hands were warm.

192
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,371
That's what I remember.

193
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,041
All right, up here.

194
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,001
We're going to do a rotation.

195
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,712
The boys will move
to the girl on their right.

196
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,464
ROTATION TO CHOOSE DANCE PARTNERS

197
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,424
Then I'll watch you dance

198
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,136
and decide which pairs
dance the best together.

199
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,679
-What do we do?
-Understand?

200
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,644
Let's try again.

201
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,480
And then… Go! Cha-cha-cha.

202
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,773
PYEONG-SEOK & HEE-JI

203
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,234
-Two, two, two.
-All right, get in line.

204
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,029
They want to do more.
They're practicing by themselves.

205
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,699
It's like they're trying to show
they're a good pair.

206
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,536
Cha-cha-cha.

207
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,622
-Two, two, two.
-All right, get in line.

208
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,499
-Get in line.
-Cha-cha-cha.

209
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,875
-Let's go.
-Now backwards.

210
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,669
-One…
-You're practicing so hard.

211
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,505
Come on, let's stand there.

212
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,840
-It's so hard.
-I can't get the hang of it.

213
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,218
Now, number one…

214
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,637
-They're not letting go.
-Their hands…

215
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,306
They don't want to let go.

216
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,726
You with her.

217
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,271
And three goes with four. The boys switch.

218
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,188
Let's go.

219
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,399
Bye.

220
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,239
-Let's do this.
-I'm here.

221
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,283
Let's do this.

222
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,119
Mychew.

223
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,787
You want one?

224
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,872
It's Seo-hyeon and Pyeong-seok.

225
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,250
This is strange too.

226
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,002
Those two…

227
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,628
What's happening now?

228
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,923
Ready, go!

229
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,468
One, two, one, two, three.

230
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,178
One…

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,514
Two!

232
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,890
One, two.

233
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,810
Three. One, two, three.

234
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,814
Okay.

235
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,940
One…

236
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,321
-One, two.
-Is this right?

237
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,448
I don't know either.

238
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,871
Pyeong-seok was taking it really seriously
with such a straight face,

239
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,789
but his dance moves

240
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,836
were really fancy, so it was surprising.

241
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,212
He started to seem

242
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,174
like a cute guy.

243
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,677
She's fallen for him.

244
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,180
If he seems cute, you've fallen for him.

245
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,931
Let's change!

246
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,142
Let's rotate now.

247
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,602
Bye.

248
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,063
-Don't get annoyed with me.
-Hello.

249
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,231
-I'm really bad at this.
-That's okay.

250
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,693
When our teacher said
she'd choose our partners,

251
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,280
I immediately hoped it'd be Ji-woo.

252
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,492
-Wow, he's made up his mind.
-It's kind of cool

253
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,327
that he's focused on one girl.

254
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,912
I might fall.

255
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,499
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

256
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,750
All right.

257
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,711
-Hey, you're good.
-Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

258
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,754
How do we do this?

259
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,340
-Two, three, cha-cha-cha.
-Girls, step forward!

260
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,550
Twice.

261
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,094
He's so anxious!

262
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,637
He's totally frozen.

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,348
-He doesn't know what do do.
-Where are you looking?

264
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,808
One…

265
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,186
Two, three.

266
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,147
Twice.

267
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
-Three times.
-Good.

268
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,484
-Hey, we did well.
-You're good.

269
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,111
We're so good.

270
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,821
That was the best so far.

271
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,197
We were really good.

272
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,784
Everyone, you have to be able to do this
or you can't graduate.

273
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,701
Okay, switch!

274
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,204
-What?
-You can't graduate.

275
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,664
Ready?

276
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm so bad at this.

277
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,667
-Like this.
-Cha…

278
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,710
-Cha-cha.
-That's right.

279
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,587
-Don't hold my fingers.
-What?

280
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,090
-Hold my hand.
-I was doing this. Like this?

281
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:01,178
I want Ji-woo to be my dance partner.

282
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,014
-Ji-min…
-Ji-woo…

283
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,850
Ji-woo's really popular.

284
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,226
Ji-woo…

285
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,063
-Two, three.
-Three, one, cha-cha-cha.

286
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,773
One, two, three.

287
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,109
One, two, three.

288
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,153
One, two, three.

289
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,654
-We did it.
-We did?

290
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,364
Go back.

291
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,866
Then turn.

292
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,075
Okay, nice.

293
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,286
Great.

294
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,912
Boys, move.

295
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,914
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

296
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,042
-The teacher's mad.
-She's mad.

297
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,752
-"Boys, move!"
-"Boys, move!"

298
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,838
She can tell that they're not dancing.

299
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,465
-Yes.
-They're fooling around.

300
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,216
She's regretting her decision.

301
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,384
She might be.

302
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,969
She's yelling, "Go!"

303
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,346
-Oh, my.
-Good job.

304
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,140
-Change partners.
-I'm quite good.

305
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,850
-I'm really bad.
-Let's do this.

306
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,268
Cha-cha.

307
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,021
Se-yeon's dancing with Ji-woo now.

308
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,940
It seems like he's
a little interested in her too.

309
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,942
This could turn into a love square.

310
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,819
What do I do?

311
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,739
Back, forward, then cha-cha-cha.

312
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,284
Forward, back, cha-cha-cha.

313
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,704
You have to move your hand
when you step back.

314
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,247
Right. Okay.

315
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
Two, three. One, two, three.

316
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,544
Two, two, three.

317
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,296
Cha-cha-cha.

318
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,380
Wait…

319
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,050
Wait…

320
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,766
-I can't do this.
-You guys…

321
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,852
Hurry. Move straight to the next person.

322
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,978
Hurry.

323
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,897
Move straight to the next person.

324
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,856
Let's go!

325
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,399
Let's go!

326
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,279
-Good job.
-Good job.

327
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,698
-They're not letting go.
-Look…

328
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,408
Looks like Ji-woo didn't let go.

329
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,371
Let's go!

330
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,627
-Good job.
-Good job.

331
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,711
Are you good?

332
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,757
-Watch out, I'm good at this.
-Okay.

333
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,594
Like this.

334
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,228
I haven't practiced going backward yet.

335
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,106
-You haven't?
-All right, everyone.

336
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,944
I'll tell you who your partner will be.

337
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,822
-We'll consider your height.
-Seo-yeong.

338
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,991
Seo-yeong and Pyeong-seok.

339
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,284
SEO-YEONG & PYEONG-SEOK PARTNERED

340
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,662
You two are partners,
so you can practice together.

341
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:36,750
Next, Sang-won is quite tall,
so he'll be partners with Seo-hyeon.

342
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,043
SANG-WON & SEO-HYEON PARTNERED

343
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,170
And Hee-ji will dance with Ji-min.

344
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,547
HEE-JI & JI-MIN PARTNERED

345
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,257
-Class president! Hi.
-Hey.

346
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,550
-Hey.
-Hi.

347
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,679
Oh, shoot.

348
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,681
-Why are we always last?
-Right?

349
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,692
When we were at Wolmido,

350
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,572
Jung-yun, Ji-woo, Ye-rin, and I
were the last ones at the Ferris wheel.

351
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,118
I thought,
"There's something going on here."

352
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,918
Se-yeon, Jung-yun,

353
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,419
Ji-woo…

354
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,256
Who will be partners
with Ji-woo this time?

355
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
Se-yeon will dance with Ji-woo.

356
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,266
Se-yeon and Ji-woo.

357
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,770
This time…

358
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,148
-This is crazy.
-They're partners.

359
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,692
-We have to be good.
-Right.

360
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,277
-We have to be the best.
-Yes.

361
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,737
We should win the prize.

362
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,364
I'm really good at this.

363
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,407
While watching them…

364
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,867
JUNG-YUN

365
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,161
…I thought, "That should've been me."

366
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,626
Let's start.

367
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,378
-Okay.
-Focus.

368
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,505
-We can do it, right?
-Like this…

369
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,215
To be honest,

370
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,677
I wanted to dance with Ji-woo.

371
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,097
-See?
-I knew it!

372
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,306
-I knew it!
-No way.

373
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,601
I was right!

374
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,561
We knew it too!

375
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,397
We all…

376
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,564
We all knew.

377
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,899
Then Ji-woo…

378
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,863
I had a lot of opportunities
to spend time alone with Ye-rin.

379
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,451
But since I didn't with Ji-woo…

380
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,996
I can do it. Let's go.

381
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,502
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

382
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,212
-Turn this way.
-Like this?

383
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,256
-Yes. Let's go again.
-Once more.

384
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,800
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

385
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,389
-Why are you stepping forward?
-Sorry!

386
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,473
I'm sorry!

387
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,100
Let's start over.

388
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,185
We'll keep trying until we get it.

389
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,606
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

390
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,525
One, two. I don't think that's right.

391
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,901
Let's start over.

392
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,987
One, two, three.

393
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,488
Two, two, three.

394
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,658
Are we doing okay?

395
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,579
You're looking at the floor,
so you guys are wobbling a bit.

396
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,663
-Look up.
-Okay.

397
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,206
Look into each other's eyes.

398
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

399
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,211
Imagine that your partner is the world's

400
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,715
prettiest or handsomest person.
Like Kim Tae-hee and Won Bin.

401
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,509
Do that as you dance.

402
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,886
Ready, go!

403
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,513
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

404
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,932
Two, three. Now move your hands.

405
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,351
Keep your head up. That's it.

406
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,270
-Move your hands.
-And…

407
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,983
One, two, three, cha-cha.

408
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,651
What are you talking about?

409
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,530
Why are you suddenly dancing?

410
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,157
Oh, right.

411
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,159
The others are doing well.

412
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,329
One, two.

413
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,749
Cha-cha-cha.

414
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,459
Nice, thank you!

415
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,127
Wow, thank you!

416
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,754
I don't get the beat.

417
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,464
This is quite fast.

418
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,757
It's quite fast.

419
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,342
We're in trouble.

420
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,765
No, we're the prettiest
and handsomest people.

421
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,650
SE-YEON

422
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,736
We couldn't look into each other's eyes.

423
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,323
It felt kind of different

424
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,493
looking at her so up close.

425
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,663
-We got this.
-Should we just make something up?

426
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,331
-Let's make up new moves.
-Okay.

427
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,084
All right. You're Won Bin…

428
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,211
-You're Kim Tae-hee.
-All right.

429
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,554
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

430
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,391
One, two, three, cha-cha.

431
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,350
One…

432
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,521
Cha-cha-cha-cha.

433
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,939
Cha-cha-cha-cha.

434
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,441
This is crazy.

435
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
Let's just have fun!

436
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,209
We were like,
"Whatever. Let's just have fun."

437
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,336
We were running around

438
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,673
and avoiding eye contact
because we were shy.

439
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
JI-WOO

440
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,467
But I enjoyed that feeling.

441
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,346
And I felt shy holding his hand.

442
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:48,103
I thought it'd be awkward dancing with
Ji-woo because of her personality.

443
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,190
But she was actually
quite energetic and silly,

444
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,734
so she was pretty cute.

445
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,071
It's not like my feelings
have changed significantly,

446
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:03,202
but I think my feelings might have

447
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,954
changed just a little bit.

448
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,956
It's hard to explain.

449
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,961
We can tell how Se-yeon feels.

450
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:13,921
Yeah.

451
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,882
Compared to when he's
with Ye-rin, he seems

452
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,010
-much more excited and happy.
-Right.

453
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,095
They're not letting go.

454
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,181
Right, it's been over ten minutes.

455
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,474
Right?

456
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,559
-Their hands will be sweaty.
-Yes.

457
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,398
It seems like Ji-woo's finally showing
a reaction to someone she truly likes.

458
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,860
She played table tennis with Se-yeon
earlier on,

459
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
but this seems different.

460
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,405
She kept joking around.

461
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,282
-Right. She was playful.
-But now,

462
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,785
she's acting a bit embarrassed and shy.

463
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,041
ASK ME ANYTHING

464
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,086
ASK ME ANYTHING

465
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,297
TODAY, THE GIRLS WILL ASK
THE BOYS QUESTIONS

466
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,382
"Ask Me Anything."

467
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,968
-It's the other way today.
-It's the opposite.

468
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,056
-This time, the girls will ask the boys.
-Yes.

469
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,100
Where's my seat?

470
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,851
Mine's the first desk.

471
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,354
-The first seat.
-Where's my seat?

472
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,360
All right, let's study hard today.

473
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,205
The questions they ask today…

474
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,665
They'll be important.

475
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,792
There will be a lot of pointed questions.

476
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,260
BEAR_1920: WHAT SPORTS DO YOU LIKE
BESIDES TABLE TENNIS?

477
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,057
SOCCER

478
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,644
MONKEY_1920:
HI, I WANT TO GET CLOSER TO YOU

479
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,980
HI! LET'S GET CLOSER!

480
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,691
DEER_1920: HOW TALL ARE YOU?

481
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,943
180 CM IN THE MORNING, 179 AT NIGHT

482
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,280
BEAR_1920: WHY ARE YOU SO FUNNY?

483
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,825
I DON'T THINK I AM

484
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,369
DEER_1920: WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

485
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,622
A BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL PERSON?

486
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,001
SOMEONE I CAN TALK TO
AND RELAX WITH WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER

487
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,212
RACCOON_1920: HOW'S YOUR SEATMATE?

488
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,883
SHE'S FUN. DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT I THOUGHT SHE'D BE LIKE

489
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,058
RACCOON_1920: PYEONG-SEOK!

490
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:38,273
DID YOU CALL ME?

491
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,610
DEER_1920:
WHAT ACTIVITY DID YOU LIKE THE MOST?

492
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,280
EVERYTHING WE DID AT WOLMIDO

493
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,658
RACCOON_1920: HOW'S YOUR SEATMATE?

494
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,577
Raccoon must be Hee-ji.

495
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,454
Isn't it her?

496
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:58,168
MY SEATMATE'S SO FRIENDLY AND NICE

497
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,712
BEAR_1920: WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

498
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,256
I LIKE EVERYTHING

499
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,717
DEER_1920: DO YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON ANYONE?

500
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,804
GIVE ME 500 WON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

501
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,263
-"Deer."
-"Deer."

502
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,431
Is that Hee-ji?

503
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,145
DEER_1920: ATTRACTED TO ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?

504
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,608
YES!

505
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,152
DEER_1920: WHAT MAKES YOU DISLIKE SOMEONE?

506
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,072
NOTHING, REALLY

507
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,704
DEER_1920: WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

508
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,971
SOMEONE WHO SMILES A LOT,
SPEAKS NICELY, AND LIKES SPORTS!

509
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,516
Hee-ji is obviously his type.

510
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,977
-Deer?
-Deer was Seo-hyeon?

511
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,603
-Seo-hyeon?
-She was Deer?

512
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,898
Good at sports and smiles a lot.

513
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:07,320
It was obviously Hee-ji, so I was

514
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,906
a bit disappointed.

515
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,663
DEER_1920:
DO YOU THINK YOUR FEELINGS WILL CHANGE?

516
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,168
I'M NOT SURE

517
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,670
I saw Pyeong-seok's answers.

518
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:32,220
SOMEONE WHO SMILES A LOT,
SPEAKS NICELY, AND LIKES SPORTS!

519
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:42,022
Pyeong-seok's type seemed kind of like me,

520
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,149
so I smiled when I read it.

521
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,693
"It's me."

522
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,320
"I knew it."

523
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,240
DEER_1920: ATTRACTED TO ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?

524
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,830
DEER_1920:
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP DO YOU WANT?

525
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,458
ONE WHERE WE CAN RELY ON EACH OTHER

526
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,752
ONE THAT'S LIKE A FRIENDSHIP?
BUT ALSO ROMANTIC?

527
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,796
DEER_1920:
DO YOU THINK YOUR FEELINGS WILL CHANGE?

528
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:15,347
I DON'T THINK SO. NOT AT THE MOMENT

529
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,809
-It seems that way.
-He's so cool.

530
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,311
He seems so reliable.

DEER_1920: WHAT MAKES YOU DISLIKE SOMEONE?

532
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,531
WHEN THEY'RE BEING RUDE

533
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,244
BUT THAT RARELY HAPPENS.
MAYBE WHEN THEY CONFUSE ME?

534
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,373
Sang-won said he doesn't like it
when girls confuse him.

535
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:47,212
I'm actually open to talk to
different guys,

536
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:52,968
but I'm worried Sang-won will be confused
about my feelings for him.

537
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,513
I think I'll have to hold back a bit.

538
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,313
DEER_1920: WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

539
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:12,570
SOMEONE PLAYFUL WITH DOUBLE EYELIDS

540
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,283
PENGUIN_1920: BEST MEMORY FROM
COOKING CLASS OR THE FIELD TRIP?

541
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:22,914
WHEN I SUCCEEDED
IN COOKING WITH MY PARTNER!

542
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,043
MONKEY_1920: WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO DO
IF YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND?

543
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:33,174
TAKE A WALK AT NIGHT HOLDING HANDS

544
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,805
MONKEY_1920:
WHO MADE THE BEST FIRST IMPRESSION?

545
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,685
WELL… THE NEW STUDENT?

546
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,896
Oh, no.

547
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,606
Everyone can see it.

548
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,321
WELL… THE NEW STUDENT?

549
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:12,756
WHO MADE THE BEST FIRST IMPRESSION?

550
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:18,928
Ji-min made his text really tiny,
so Seo-yeong couldn't read it.

551
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,889
-Really?
-She can't enlarge it?

552
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,182
You can't enlarge it.

553
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,559
You can't zoom in on it.

554
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,900
THE ONE WHO GAVE YOU THE BOOK AND LETTER,

555
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,070
DO YOU LIKE HER?

556
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,284
DO YOU LIKE ANYONE?

557
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:47,582
When we were riding the Ferris wheel,
I asked if he liked anyone.

558
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,417
I thought that maybe

559
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,921
he said there was no one
because I was with him.

560
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,757
So I asked him again anonymously.

561
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,428
MONKEY_1920: DO YOU LIKE ANYONE?

562
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,980
HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE

563
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:22,909
I didn't answer the question
about who I'm interested in…

564
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,537
because Jung-yun and Ji-woo are close.

565
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,170
Seo-yeong still seems interested
in Ji-min.

566
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,964
Right.

567
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:41,428
Seo-yeong wants to believe
Ji-min's feelings haven't changed.

568
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,430
Right. She wants a confirmation.

569
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,103
BEAR_1920:
WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST IN SCHOOL?

570
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,815
IT WAS NICE TO SEE THE OCEAN AT WOLMIDO

571
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,236
PENGUIN_1920: WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

572
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,281
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THEM HAS TO BE NICE

573
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,993
RACCOON_1920:
DO YOU USUALLY EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS

574
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:10,582
TO GIRLS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

575
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:17,255
I HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE,
SO I DON'T KNOW

576
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,802
PENGUIN_1920: DID YOU LIKE COOKING?
WANT TO TRY MAKING ANYTHING ELSE?

577
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,431
NOTHING IN PARTICULAR

578
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:32,187
PENGUIN_1920: WHAT MADE YOU LIKE
THE PERSON YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

579
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,569
I JUST LIKED HER AS SOON AS I SAW HER

580
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,739
I was curious about Jung-yun.

581
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:48,870
So I asked him the most questions
and read all his answers.

582
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,625
PENGUIN_1920: WHAT WAS MOST MEMORABLE
FROM YESTERDAY?

583
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,587
RIDING THE FERRIS WHEEL

584
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,548
I asked him about our field trip
because I wanted him

585
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,137
to mention the Ferris wheel,
and he actually did.

586
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,555
So I was happy.

587
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,559
I was asked what made me like
the person I'm interested in,

588
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,437
so I said I liked her
as soon as I saw her.

589
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,233
That girl was Ji-woo.

590
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,699
Why is he so embarrassed?

591
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,326
-Come on.
-He's cute.

592
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,174
RACCOON_1920: HOW'S YOUR SEATMATE?

593
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,302
SHE'S A GOOD FRIEND WHO'S NICE TO ME

594
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,347
RACCOON_1920: DO YOU LIKE SUSHI?

595
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,475
I LOVE SUSHI

596
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,436
BEAR_1920: WHAT WAS THE MOST FUN SO FAR?

597
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,525
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE OCEAN
WE SAW AT WOLMIDO

598
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,613
MONKEY_1920: INTERESTED IN ANYONE YET?

599
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,291
MAYBE? BUT I'M JUST
GETTING TO KNOW EVERYONE!

600
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,793
-That's vague…
-That's a vague answer.

601
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,296
-Right.
-It's not a straight answer.

602
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:44,193
RACCOON_1920:
MAYBE? I DON'T LIKE VAGUE ANSWERS

603
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,988
When Se-yeon answered, "maybe,"

604
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,115
I was disappointed.

605
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,493
So I wrote back, "Maybe?"

606
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,581
"I don't like vague answers."

607
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:00,043
I think Se-yeon might guess
that it was me.

608
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,212
I thought it was Ye-rin.

609
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:16,392
WE'RE STILL GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
BUT I AM INTERESTED IN SOMEONE

610
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:21,522
THERE IS SOMEONE BUT I JUST DON'T SHOW IT

611
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,950
PENGUIN_1920:
WHO GAVE YOU THE BEST FIRST IMPRESSION?

612
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:42,919
I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH DAY IT WAS,
BUT THE LAST PERSON TO COME IN

613
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,051
Did he just include
Ye-rin and Ji-woo in his answer?

614
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,345
-Is he a genius?
-You're right.

615
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,222
He gave a really vague answer.

616
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,283
The last one was a bit vague.

617
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,078
He was asked who gave him
the best first impression,

618
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,707
but he said it was
the last person to come in.

619
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,167
That means it's Ye-rin or Ji-woo.

620
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,003
-Yes, right.
-Isn't that right?

621
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,506
It seems like Se-yeon is
still unsure about them.

622
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,300
-It seems he's still confused.
-Right.

623
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,555
But Ji-woo asked Jung-yun
the most questions.

624
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:41,769
It might be because there seems to be
something going on right now

625
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,438
between Se-yeon and Ye-rin.

626
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,981
And Seo-hyeon…

627
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,902
Seo-hyeon has shown
some interest in Pyeong-seok.

628
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:56,159
But Pyeong-seok
obviously described Hee-ji as his type.

629
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,535
But Sang-won said

630
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,829
-he doesn't want to be confused.
-Right.

631
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,915
Seo-hyeon still wants to be open

632
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,001
-and get to know everyone.
-Right.

633
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,295
But with Sang-won's answer…

634
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,923
-Right.
-But it's not like they're really dating.

635
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,803
Of course, you shouldn't confuse
your partner when you're dating.

636
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,347
-But they're not dating yet.
-That's right.

637
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,935
I think it's all right
to be open to other guys right now.

638
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,566
UNTIL 20
D-2

639
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,574
SCHOOL 19 END OF TERM CEREMONY

640
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,035
Wow, a varsity jacket.

641
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,453
CLOSING CEREMONY

642
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,289
Great. All right.

643
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,848
To me, School 19 is very special.

644
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,227
I was able to make such nice, fun friends.

645
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,064
I'll have great memories of it.

646
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,148
OUR CHRISTMAS AT 19

647
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,946
I was so happy to be able to end
my year being 19 years old at School 19.

648
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,364
It was fun.

649
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,034
I made a lot of good friends
and had good teachers.

650
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,327
I loved it.

651
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
TRAVEL
INSTRUCTORS KIM AWESOME AND WEE SENIOR

652
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,331
Traveling tips that will help you…

653
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,208
SEX & CULTURE
INSTRUCTOR BAE JEONG-WEON

654
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,211
You might wonder why
I'm talking about relationships when…

655
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,923
I think I followed the rule
about not dating.

656
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,677
Why are you laughing?

657
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:44,100
School 19 was like a shooting star.

658
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,107
I got my wish of making good memories.

659
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,901
And that shooting star
will always shine in my heart.

660
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,530
When I turn 20,

661
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,408
I want to do a New Year countdown.

662
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,451
After the countdown,

663
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,954
I want to have drinks, and…

664
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:10,835
Go to internet cafés and karaoke
and go on trips with my friends.

665
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,295
When I turn 20,

666
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,131
I want to get closer to Ji-woo.

667
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,883
Q. HOW WILL YOU DO THAT?

668
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
I'm not sure yet.

669
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,511
I haven't done this before.

670
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:27,143
I'm excited about the rest
of my time here.

671
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,063
Since I came in the middle,

672
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,192
I had two days less than the others
to get used to it.

673
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:39,113
And I heard that everyone
did a lot together during those two days.

674
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,533
So I'll stay open to things

675
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,119
and if anyone says
they're interested in me,

676
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,457
I'll be grateful
and be more interested in that friend

677
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,376
and try to talk to them more.

678
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,757
My life won't change just from turning 20,

679
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,384
but when we go to House 20,

680
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,803
I'll try to express myself more

681
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,516
and approach anyone I'm interested in.

682
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:13,439
I want to talk more
with my friends and with Pyeong-seok.

683
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,402
I want to get closer to people
I haven't talked to much.

684
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,698
I want to throw a party
with all my friends.

685
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,620
Even the little things we do
will mean a lot to me.

686
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:34,502
It'll be really exciting
to be together when we all turn 20.

687
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,965
-It must be over.
-It's over?

688
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,425
-School's finished?
-They're graduating?

689
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,677
I'm not sad.

690
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,264
I'm so excited about what's to come.

691
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,600
The rules they had at School 19
will be gone in House 20.

692
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,560
Right, the restrictions are gone.

693
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,562
-Right.
-"Restrictions"?

694
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,856
I'm curious about how House 20 looks.

695
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,984
I want to see how they'll dress too.

696
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,527
They'll look so pretty.

697
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,721
-This neighborhood is so pretty.
-Right?

698
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,431
It's so pretty.

699
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,769
This place is nice.

700
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,354
What do I do?

701
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm so nervous.

702
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,608
-Really?
-Yes.

703
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,485
-Aren't you nervous?
-Me?

704
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:46,324
-I'm a bit excited.
-Right.

705
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,868
-It's our last day.
-Our last day.

706
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,413
The house…

707
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,790
It's really pretty.

708
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,460
Is that the door?

709
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,212
HOUSE 20

710
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,590
-"House 20"?
-As in our age?

711
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,884
"House 20."

712
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,563
-It's amazing.
-This place…

713
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,363
It's so pretty. And huge.

714
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,119
Where do we go in?

715
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,247
-Here?
-There are slippers there.

716
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,008
There's stairs going down.

717
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,055
1F DINING ROOM

718
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,015
-Are we…
-A TV!

719
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,141
Soccer! Yes!

720
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,355
-This is awesome.
-This is nice.

721
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,818
This looks like our house.

722
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,529
-What is this?
-A bedroom.

723
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,571
1F GIRLS' ROOM

724
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,698
This seems like the girls' room, right?

725
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,743
-Yes, a bit.
-I don't think it's our room.

726
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,746
Do we have to go up or down?

727
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,915
-Let's go upstairs.
-Okay.

728
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,295
Playing hide and seek here
would take forever.

729
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,924
-Is it here?
-This is amazing.

730
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,801
-This is obviously…
-This is it.

731
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,718
It's clearly ours.

732
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,719
2F BOYS' ROOM 1

733
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,012
But there are three beds.

734
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,389
Are there two here?

735
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,390
2F BOYS' ROOM 2

736
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,975
Yeah, two.

737
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,477
-The view…
-If I wake up in the morning…

738
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,105
The sun will wake me up.

739
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,276
I wonder what's downstairs. I'm excited.

740
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,485
Let's go.

741
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,866
Wow, there are so many rooms.

742
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,950
B1 LIVING ROOM

743
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,288
It'll be so fun with everyone here.

744
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,206
This is so exciting.

745
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,042
-Should we look outside?
-Sure.

746
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,796
-Here.
-The night view will be amazing here.

747
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,512
-This is awesome.
-Right?

748
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,431
I'm so excited.

749
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,352
This is such a nice place.

750
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,773
It'll be amazing when it's sunny.

751
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,402
Or if it snows a lot.

752
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,446
-Right.
-It'll be so pretty.

753
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,031
I'm excited.

754
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,827
Yeah…

755
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,747
This week's going to be so fun.

756
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,543
One day, a couple will go there
to have a serious talk.

757
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,253
-"Why did you do that?"
-Right. Soon.

758
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,505
-Soon.
-Yes.

759
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,524
Where should we sit?

760
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,359
What?

761
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,071
-I'm hungry.
-Look.

762
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,950
-Look.
-I want to eat this right now.

763
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,992
Lobster…

764
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,994
And spaghetti.

765
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,206
What's this? Champagne?

766
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,292
Isn't it time the others arrived?

767
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,086
Yes, they'll be arriving soon.

768
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,589
"House 20."

769
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,007
This looks nice.

770
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,684
This is amazing.

771
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,479
-I wonder who'll be first.
-Hey.

772
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,022
-They're here.
-Let's go.

773
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,566
Clap.

774
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,449
Welcome, guys.

775
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,826
Hey.

776
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,458
What's all this?

777
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,168
Sit anywhere you want.

778
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,465
-This is awesome.
-Nice.

779
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,968
-This is amazing.
-There's more.

780
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,679
-Really? I'm shocked already.
-It's not over.

781
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,807
You all got more handsome.

782
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,393
You all seem a bit different.

783
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,479
I wonder how different the girls look now.

784
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,814
I'm so curious.

785
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,026
Don't girls look more different
when they wear personal clothes?

786
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,152
Yeah.

787
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,738
What's happening?

788
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,181
-It's Ye-rin.
-Who? Is it Ye-rin?

789
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,223
Who is it?

790
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,601
-It's Ye-rin.
-Her height…

791
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,443
-Oh, my!
-Ji-woo!

792
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,612
-What? Ji-woo?
-It's Ji-woo.

793
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,572
-She looks so different.
-Ji-woo!

794
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,325
Who is it?

795
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,917
-Who's here?
-Who is it?

796
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,216
We were wrong.

797
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,592
-Hi.
-Hi!

798
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:39,927
Hello.

799
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,012
We were wrong.

800
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,889
-Hi.
-Hi!

801
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,265
We were wrong.

802
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,142
-Hi.
-Hi!

803
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,102
Hello.

804
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,603
-Hi.
-You're the first one.

805
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,191
-Hello.
-Hello.

806
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,068
Where do I sit?

807
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,195
-Anywhere you want.
-Anywhere.

808
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,571
Sit anywhere you want.

809
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,948
So awkward.

810
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,991
Hey!

811
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,787
-It must be awkward.
-They look awkward.

812
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,331
It's their first time in normal clothes.

813
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,501
-They must be anxious.
-Where will she sit?

814
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,213
-Just sit anywhere.
-Choose any seat.

815
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,516
-Just sit anywhere.
-Choose any seat.

816
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
Okay.

817
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,646
-She sat across from Jung-yun.
-Yeah.

818
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,357
We do look different
when we're not in our uniforms.

819
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,452
We look like we're at
an end-of-the-year party.

820
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,369
Right?

821
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,707
When Ji-woo first arrived,

822
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,628
she didn't look that different from when
she was wearing a school uniform.

823
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,339
She was still pretty.

824
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,969
Jung-yun!

825
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,013
He's adorable.

826
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,896
When I saw Ji-woo,

827
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:20,027
she seemed more mature
than when we were at school.

828
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:25,407
I was surprised how mature she looked.

829
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,744
-I want to show people around.
-You just wore that?

830
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,537
-Aren't you cold?
-I am.

831
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,920
I never thought it would be Ji-woo.

832
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,172
-We didn't think it was you.
-You looked tall.

833
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,757
-You seemed tall.
-I am tall!

834
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,259
Wait. Pardon me asking,
but how tall are you?

835
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,802
I'm 160 centimeters tall.

836
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,095
-Wait, 158?
-Maybe 157.

837
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,305
You said 161 centimeters.

838
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,098
No, I said 160.

839
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,850
I rounded up.

840
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:01,193
Se-yeon looked so different
without his uniform.

841
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,736
He looked really cool.

842
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,907
And Jung-yun looked
completely different too.

843
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,202
He wore a really cool shearling jacket.

844
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,329
So I noticed those two the most.

845
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,872
-Cool.
-Right.

846
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,759
Someone else is here.

847
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,933
-Get up.
-Let's welcome her.

848
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,729
-Welcome.
-Hello.

849
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,899
-Wow, Seo-yeong.
-Seo-yeong's so pretty.

850
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,319
-Hello.
-Sit anywhere you want.

851
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,320
Anywhere you want.

852
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,661
There were a lot of chairs,

853
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:57,583
but I wanted to sit
in front of Ji-min, so that's where I sat.

854
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,378
-I want to look around.
-Me too. I'm so curious.

855
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,674
Someone's coming.

856
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,182
-There's someone coming.
-Who?

857
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,434
-Seo-hyeon.
-Seo-hyeon?

858
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,560
It's Seo-hyeon.

859
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,029
-Seo-hyeon!
-Welcome.

860
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,740
-Hello. Sit anywhere you want.
-Hello.

861
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,373
You just saw that?

862
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,416
Looks delicious.

863
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,544
-You look happy.
-It looks so nice.

864
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,341
Seo-hyeon caught my eye the most.

865
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,885
I could just be drawn to her, though.

866
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:53,889
I always thought she was pretty,

867
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,516
but she looked even prettier
in casual clothes.

868
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,352
She's holding back.

869
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:03,398
Everyone seemed different
when we entered House 20.

870
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,194
Sang-won looks better in casual clothes.

871
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,115
And as soon as I saw Jung-yun,

872
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:19,247
I thought he was really handsome.
He really looked like an actor.

873
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,555
-Who is it?
-Hee-ji.

874
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,266
She walks so confidently.

875
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,518
I can't tell who it is.

876
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,395
It's like when we first met.

877
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,730
-We all stood up and said hi.
-Right.

878
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,277
It's Hee-ji.

879
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,697
-Hello.
-Hello.

880
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,448
Hi, guys.

881
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,788
Where should I sit?

882
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,581
-Anywhere.
-Okay.

883
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,042
-Welcome.
-The head of the table.

884
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,129
Isn't this awesome?

885
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,214
We still have class prez and vice prez?

886
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,466
Of course.

887
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:16,138
I hoped Hee-ji would sit next to me,
and she did. So I was really happy.

888
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,806
PYEONG-SEOK

889
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,057
"That's my seatmate."

890
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,686
He's so cute!

891
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,731
"My seatmate's here!"

892
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:31,403
When Hee-ji wore her school uniform,
she looked like a student.

893
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,613
But seeing her in normal clothes,

894
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,615
she looked kind of mature.

895
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,451
I was a bit attracted by that.

896
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:43,957
Pyeong-seok also looked really different
with this hairstyle and his clothes.

897
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,041
I thought…

898
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,001
HEE-JI

899
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,294
"Is it really him?"

900
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,755
There's one person left.

901
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,006
Is she the star?

902
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,382
Is she the party's host?

903
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,717
She's the host.

904
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,942
-Ye-rin looks so cool.
-Wow, she's so pretty.

905
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,403
She doesn't just look cute anymore.

906
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,488
She seems mature.

907
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,822
Right. She's so pretty.

908
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,948
Her style's so cool.

909
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,118
She's here. Is she a model?

910
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,913
-Let's all stand up.
-She's our host.

911
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,916
She's the star of the show.

912
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,460
Make a cool entrance.

913
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,713
What?

914
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,757
What?

915
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,427
What?

916
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,853
Ye-rin, you look so pretty.

917
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,149
It looked like she'd dyed her hair.

918
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,901
Obviously, she was pretty.

919
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:58,824
But she looked much more mature
than before. She looked really different.

920
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,867
Right.

921
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,787
You all look so good.

922
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,664
Really.

923
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,374
We were always wearing uniforms.

924
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,458
-Right.
-Right.

925
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,674
But you girls look so much different.

926
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,092
Right. Much more than us.

927
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,386
Yes, the girls look much more different.

928
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,264
We all do.

929
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,934
As soon as we've turned 20…

930
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,311
We're lucky to be here when we turn 20.

931
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,398
I agree.

932
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,694
Everyone seemed to glow,
and the food looked great.

933
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,653
YE-RIN

934
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,864
So I felt like I was glowing too.

935
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,616
I felt like the happiest person
in the world.

936
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,410
And there was amazing food there.

937
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,829
I felt so happy.

938
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,747
Thank you for the meal!

939
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,749
-I want the salmon.
-Me too.

940
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,545
Everything here might be gone by midnight.

941
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,256
Thank you for the food.

942
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,594
This is good!

943
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,973
Good, right?

944
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,058
This is good.

945
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,190
Try this sauce.

946
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,775
Chili sauce.

947
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,320
I'll put it here.

948
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,030
Try it first.

949
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,044
You look good.

950
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,382
-Do we eat it with melon?
-What?

951
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,388
What's that?

952
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,141
-Try it with the melon.
-Do we eat it with melon?

953
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,184
What?

954
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,645
FROM MIDNIGHT ONWARDS
DATING BAN IS LIFTED

955
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,896
What's that?

956
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,608
-"From midnight onwards
-"From midnight onwards

957
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,319
-dating ban is lifted."
-dating ban is lifted."

958
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,864
-The dating ban is gone!
-Finally!

959
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,285
On New Year's Day,
when they all become adults,

960
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,871
they'll finally be allowed to date.

961
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:14,626
From now on, they can go on dates
and ask each other out.

962
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,128
-They can start dating.
-Yes.

963
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,964
What will happen from now on?

964
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,882
Things will get crazy now.

965
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,385
Some will confess their love at midnight.

966
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,761
-At midnight!
-Right away.

967
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,429
The house is so big.

968
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,224
There are lots of places to hang out.

969
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,684
Lots of places to hide.

970
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,643
Right.

971
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,769
Oh, my gosh.

972
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,730
-"From midnight onwards
-"From midnight onwards

973
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,692
-you'll be allowed to date."
-you'll be allowed to date."

974
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,194
Finally!

975
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,532
This is exciting.

976
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,574
It's so exciting.

977
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,576
As soon as I saw the screen,

978
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,372
I thought of Ji-woo.

979
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,291
When I read those words, I thought,

980
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,710
"It's starting."

981
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,425
I wondered, "Would I get to date?"

982
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,971
I first thought of Seo-hyeon.

983
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:13,309
I want to get to know everyone better,

984
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,021
but I am a bit more interested
in Sang-won.

985
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,776
I think it'll be like a competition.

986
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,158
All the girls have high standards. So they
will all know who's a decent guy.

987
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,244
There might be
a bit of a friendly competition.

988
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,456
Like this…

989
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,501
We have to shower quickly.

990
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,627
Hey!

991
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,671
One hour left.

992
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,882
We'll be adults in just one hour?

993
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,718
-We'll really be adults.
-Just one hour.

994
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,803
I think I'm going to cry.

995
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,722
I'm going to cry.

996
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,098
This feels so new to me.

997
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,308
-What?
-This is so new.

998
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,519
We all became close friends
in such a short time.

999
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,229
I love everyone so much.

1000
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,483
-This is going to feel weird.
-Even more after today.

1001
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,943
This is our last day being 19.

1002
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,822
I'm nervous now.

1003
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,033
Why am I so nervous?

1004
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,117
Me too.

1005
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,079
I'm so nervous.

1006
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,751
About 30 minutes before midnight,
I started getting really nervous.

1007
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,963
I felt so happy at that moment.

1008
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:30,595
I was glad to be able to spend
my last moments being 19 with them

1009
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,597
and turn 20 together.

1010
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,185
Everyone can tell we're just turning 20.

1011
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:42,148
It was so exciting to have a party
with all my friends.

1012
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,317
Let's open this.

1013
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,783
-Get the glasses.
-It was exciting.

1014
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,620
We were all together,
wondering what to do.

1015
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,248
It wasn't just another year passing.

1016
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,668
It was the year we were becoming adults.

1017
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,672
I'm a bit scared, but there are
lots of things we can do now.

1018
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,216
So I'm excited for that.

1019
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,261
Doesn't this remind you of that meme?

1020
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,013
This is scary!

1021
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,518
I've never felt this way before.

1022
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,647
I was really excited and it was nice

1023
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,443
having drinks in this huge house.

1024
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:31,197
Seeing everyone look so excited,
I felt really happy.

1025
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,574
Let's stand close together.

1026
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,620
Just one minute and a half left!

1027
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,872
Oh, my gosh!

1028
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,915
They're all waiting together.

1029
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,084
This is exciting.

1030
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,588
They'll never forget this day.

1031
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,799
-It must be so exciting!
-Right.

1032
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,844
Just one minute and a half left!

1033
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,557
I was really excited,

1034
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,727
and I couldn't believe
I was actually becoming an adult.

1035
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,937
I kept checking the time.

1036
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,564
We're really 20 now.

1037
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,399
I'm becoming a grown-up.

1038
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,026
We're going to be adults.

1039
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:11,279
I thought, "Am I really turning 20 now?"

1040
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,533
It wasn't hitting me yet,
but I was really excited.

1041
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,829
It's not just us.

1042
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,123
Everyone's doing a countdown right now.

1043
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,249
It'll be wild outside.

1044
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,667
Yes. Doing the countdown.

1045
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,044
-We…
-Just 30 seconds!

1046
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,713
-But just the ten of us…
-I'm so excited!

1047
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:32,050
I felt really weird doing the countdown.

1048
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,886
"I'm really turning 20 now."

1049
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,139
All right. Start with Sang-won.

1050
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,559
-Start with me.
-Ready, go.

1051
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,519
