NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,432
Ready, go.

13
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,392
-Ten!
-Nine!

14
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,227
-Eight!
-Seven!

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,188

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,359
Happy New Year!

19
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,072
Happy New Year!

20
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,752
What? Did you actually finish it?

21
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,045
Nice.

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,506
We had champagne…

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,800
It looks pretty and elegant.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,594
But it tasted awful.

25
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,263
I couldn't enjoy the moment
because it tasted so bad.

26
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
I can only enjoy it if it tastes good.

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,059
As I drank it, I went,
"What's wrong with it?"

28
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,816
I need juice!

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,860
It tasted awful.

30
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,447
It tasted so bad that I couldn't drink it.

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,242
It tasted like poison.

32
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,079
The color looked nice.
I expected it to be tasty.

33
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,413
But it was awful.

34
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,584
-It's their first time trying alcohol.
-Yes.

35
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,962
Right. It tastes awful
when you first try it.

36
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,256
I still can't believe it.

37
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,382
-What?
-We're 20?

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,800
We're 20?

39
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,802
Twenty? No more no-dating rule?

40
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,638
No no-dating rule?
Does it change anything?

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,474
Of course.

42
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,145
Things could change. Anything can change.

43
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,105
We can be fond of someone
with no barriers.

44
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,941
That sounds sophisticated.

45
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,317
Look at your eyebrows.

46
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,654
When the no-dating rule
was finally lifted,

47
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,991
I thought of Sang-won and Seo-hyeon.

48
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,160
I knew they liked each other.

49
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,579
I knew they'd be happy about it.

50
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,708
Seo-hyeon, what about your ears?
Are you okay?

51
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,710
-Your infection--
-Are they still red?

52
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,421
I mean, you shouldn't drink
when you have an infection.

53
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,841
You shouldn't drink too much.

54
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,599
-He only takes care of Seo-hyeon.
-It's clear.

55
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,310
You can't help but overhear
those kinds of conversations.

56
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,769
Right.

57
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,605
-He's making it official.
-He was smooth.

58
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,814
Pyeong-seok.

59
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,899
What?

60
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,610
-Do you have any female friends?
-No.

61
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,990
-You're like me.
-You're amazing.

62
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,825
You've never talked to a girl before?

63
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,784
No.

64
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,536
I'm not good at talking to girls.

65
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,871
Same here.

66
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,834
-I should've practiced.
-I know.

67
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,590
-How many girls have you dated?
-What?

68
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,134
My last relationship was in 8th grade.

69
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,095
-Same for you?
-Ninth grade for me.

70
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,097
Me too.

71
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,934
Sounds like we had similar lives.

72
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,061
-What about you?
-Me?

73
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,103
Ninth grade for me.

74
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,106
My senior year of high school.

75
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,067
That was your first and last relationship?

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,276
Second.

77
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,778
You're an expert.

78
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,446
-Was that your first relationship?
-Yes.

79
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,865
-Really?
-That was my first and last.

80
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,159
He never dated anyone before.

81
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,996
I couldn't date anyone
because I was an athlete.

82
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,505
My throat is burning.

83
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,590
-We all feel like that.
-Isn't it warm?

84
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,550
I feel like I'm getting drunk.

85
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,427
What does it feel like to be drunk?

86
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,845
You feel dizzy, don't you?

87
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,515
We have to drink today to find out.

88
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,432
I'll get drunk.

89
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,268
-Jung-yun.
-Show us.

90
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,103
If you're happy, it means you're tipsy.

91
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,439
I'll show you guys today.

92
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,874
It wasn't easy to drink.

93
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,712
I wasn't sure how much I had to drink
to get drunk.

94
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,755
Ji-min looked pretty drunk.

95
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,590
They are acting weird.

96
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,925
Thank you for your hard work.

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,763
-Drink this and keep it up.
-Is he a boss or what?

98
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,309
That sounded like
a manager's new year speech.

99
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,269
Ji-woo looked dazed

100
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,022
after two glasses of champagne.

101
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,732
-Why is it so hot?
-Give me more.

102
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,235
You drank it all, ma'am. There's no more.

103
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,529
Ji-min…

104
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,823
Hey!

105
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
Don't try to be funny.

106
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,076
You just dropped…

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,077
It's all gone.

108
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,205
-Open a new one.
-Here's one.

109
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,960
I got drunk. I barely remember anything.

110
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,213
JI-MIN

111
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,465
I only remember fragments.

112
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,093
-After that?
-My goodness.

113
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,845
He looks hungover.

114
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,306
-He should have some ramyeon.
-He's still drunk.

115
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,808
I want to try soju.

116
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,187
Raise your hand
if you want to go to the store.

117
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,274
-God!
-If we're going today, then I want to go.

118
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,735
-Let's send four people.
-I'll go too.

119
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,445
-We have four--
-One last person.

120
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,696
No, you can't go.

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,281
No, you need to rest.

122
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,116
No. Ji-min, you shouldn't go.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,993
Se-yeon and I can go.

124
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,162
Why? I'm not drunk.

125
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,997
That's not the point. You're too excited.

126
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,709
We were deciding
who should go to the convenience store.

127
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,587
We only drank a little,
but everyone got drunk.

128
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,172
They couldn't control themselves.

129
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,468
So we decided to take a mix of four people

130
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,722
from those who looked a little drunk
and those who looked okay.

131
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,057
Shall we?

132
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,850
Let's go.

133
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,103
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

134
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,270
Thanks.

135
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,522
Hello.

136
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,148
Hello.

137
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,652
-We can buy drinks now.
-Yes, we can!

138
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,195
We can all show our IDs.

139
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,197
Stick it on your foreheads.

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,824
We've got to do it.

141
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,243
We need to get some gummies!

142
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,828
Gummies!

143
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,123
-This?
-Sure. Get it.

144
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,417
-Ice cream.
-Ice cream.

145
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,588
I've never carried
something this heavy before.

146
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,720
We bought so much.
I think this will be around 200,000 won.

147
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,888
No.

148
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,850
-It'll really reach 200,000 won.
-No.

149
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,144
ID please.

150
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,479
Hey, take your IDs out.

151
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,106
Take it out.

152
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,441
Here you go.

153
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,400
Our IDs.

154
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,943
Can you check mine too?

155
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,027
Mine too.

156
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,906
It was thrilling to take my ID out.

157
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,285
"Finally." I was so happy.

158
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,537
I can now buy alcohol.

159
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,455
SEO-HYEON

160
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,124
-Did you get changed?
-Let's meet after we change.

161
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,792
HOUSE 20

162
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,171
There are so many stairs. Watch out.

163
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,756
It's dangerous here.

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,008
This is…

165
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,721
-Are you drunk already?
-My hair…

166
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,014
-What?
-She's drunk.

167
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,099
-She is.
-I'm not.

168
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,184
You are drunk.

169
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,270
-If she says no, she's drunk.
-She's drunk.

170
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,396
She's definitely drunk.

171
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,565
-Do you want to play Jenga for fun?
-Okay.

172
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,776
Pyeong-seok, it's your turn.

173
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,574
I'm nice, so I'll…

174
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,041
"What was my first impression like?"

175
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,626
My first impression.

176
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,420
I can tell you straight up.

177
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,215
An innocent country boy.

178
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,383
-I was going to say that too.
-Really?

179
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,386
-That's exactly what I was going to say.
-See? It's true.

180
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,014
An innocent country boy. What about you?

181
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,474
My first impression of him?

182
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,770
A shy boy.

183
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,104
That's what I thought.

184
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,272
-Shy?
-Shy.

185
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
I see.

186
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,986
Let's copy him.

187
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,656
Shy guy.

188
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,951
I mean, I found it cute.

189
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,375
What will it be?

190
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,336
"Date someone with no experience
or someone who's been in 20."

191
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,798
-Isn't 20 too many?
-I'd date someone with no experience.

192
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,508
That's a Casanova.

193
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,177
Why? Why no experience?
You probably have a reason.

194
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,595
Then tell us your reason.

195
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,933
Because I'm also inexperienced.

196
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,271
It'd work if you have no experience.

197
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,232
We can work things out together.

198
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,405
Gosh.

199
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,158
"Call each other 20 times a day
versus call once a day."

200
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,495
If you think about it,
20 times isn't that much.

201
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,126
I'm not sure because
I don't have any dating experience.

202
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,218
Why does Pyeong-seok
keep checking his phone?

203
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,553
Is he waiting for Hee-ji?

204
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,388
-Is he?
-She's still not back yet.

205
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,646
Hee-ji was taking too long.

206
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,566
I was worried why she was taking so long.

207
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,819
I kept checking the time on my phone.

208
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,657
I wanted to go with her,
but I had to take care of other people.

209
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,743
Things just didn't work out.

210
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,705
"A person who I like more,
or a person who likes me more."

211
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,373
What's your answer?

212
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,667
I think…

213
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,048
It's the person I like. What about you?

214
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,174
I…

215
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,094
-Pyeong-seok.
-One, two, three.

216
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,679
-Pyeong-seok.
-Pyeong-seok.

217
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,641
I'd say the person I like.

218
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,310
Me too.

219
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,861
I felt like Pyeong-seok and I
make eye contact often.

220
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:58,115
Pyeong-seok has a smile
that melts everyone.

221
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,661
My ideal type is a guy with a sweet smile.

222
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,414
I feel attracted to him.
I can't stop looking at him.

223
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,499
Oh, my goodness.

224
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,835
Now that they're out of school,
they have all changed.

225
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,048
No one makes
my heart flutter like Se-yeon.

226
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,927
But I don't know what's going to happen
between Pyeong-seok and me.

227
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,139
Ye-rin said her heart fluttered
only once before.

228
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,140
That's right.

229
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,726
I think her heart will flutter
a few more times.

230
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,645
Even for Pyeong-seok too.

231
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,814
Ye-rin is a hopeless romantic.

232
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,566
-Is she?
-She is.

233
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,152
But Pyeong-seok only likes Hee-ji.

234
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,696
-He only likes Hee-ji.
-He's always thinking about her.

235
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,204
Did you work out?
Men who work out have calluses here.

236
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,247
Right.

237
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,957
Since they work out daily.

238
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,588
Wait. That's…

239
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,799
I bet Jung-yun is already…

240
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,052
I heard you get it easily,
but it disappears soon.

241
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,637
But I still have it.

242
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,889
Because you work out regularly.

243
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,478
They go away when you stop.

244
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,397
-Yeah, it went away before.
-Let me see.

245
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,774
-But I can't stop.
-Why not?

246
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,026
Are you saying I should?

247
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,620
Look at Ji-min.

248
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,457
-This is interesting.
-Oh, my.

249
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,960
-Can someone be so interested in a callus?
-Why is she scratching it?

250
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,170
I've never done that.

251
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,130
Have you ever studied calluses like that?

252
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,174
Not even your boyfriend's, right?

253
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,969
A callus can't be that serious of a topic.

254
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,556
But then, Ji-woo picked Jung-yun

255
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,683
as the person
with the best first impression.

256
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,894
-She's interested in him.
-She is.

257
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,522
Perhaps it's because she's drunk.

258
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,526
-Drinking is the best and the worst.
-Right. If you drink too much.

259
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,944
It's bad for you.

260
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,198
I'd never forget their conversation
about a callus.

261
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,365
It's shocking.

262
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,160
We're 20 now.

263
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,996
We started with champagne.

264
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,789
Right. It was fancy.

265
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,042
It's funny.

266
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,127
What did you think of school?

267
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,754
School?

268
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,381
It was fun.

269
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,717
Everyone was kind.

270
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,552
Right. They're all very nice.

271
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,388
I just chilled and had fun.

272
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,559
Were you attracted to anyone in school?

273
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,311
I'm curious.

274
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,438
-Attracted?
-I want to ask everyone.

275
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,610
At first, the word "attracted"
was too strong.

276
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,195
I see.

277
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,489
It wasn't that
I had a crush on that person,

278
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,574
but I just wanted to talk to him more.

279
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,035
At first it was you.

280
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,205
-We were sitting next to each other.
-Right.

281
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,541
And our conversations flowed.

282
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,459
-It was fun.
-Right.

283
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,338
So, at first, it was you.

284
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,883
Don't stop there. Me at first, and then?

285
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,801
Right.

286
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,220
I wanted to get to know everyone,

287
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:11,308
but among them,
I was curious about Pyeong-seok the most.

288
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,394
-That's your situation now?
-Yes.

289
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,688
Nothing more than that?

290
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,939
-No.
-Or nothing less?

291
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,858
So, it's too much to say I like him.

292
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,361
-Not yet.
-It's only been a few days.

293
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,530
Right. That's true.

294
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,993
I don't know if this will last.

295
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,328
Right. You never know
once we start living together.

296
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,123
But things changed so much
from our school days.

297
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,291
-It feels different?
-Yes.

298
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,458
-Really?
-It is different.

299
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,795
Do the girls think the boys
have changed a lot too?

300
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,839
Not dramatically.

301
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,341
You think the girls changed a lot?

302
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,095
Yeah, we thought the change
was pretty dramatic.

303
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,722
-Really? You think so?
-Yes.

304
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,225
Are you going to ask
anybody out on a date tomorrow?

305
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,603
I don't know.

306
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,025
The fact that I have to
do everything on my own from now on…

307
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,570
Right. I always struggled
to start something.

308
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,114
Right. The first time is never easy.

309
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,992
We're adults.

310
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,119
We are. Bam!

311
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,955
-Bam!
-Cross.

312
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,916
Cross. Yeah!

313
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,462
We get along well.

314
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,005
-Our humor?
-Yes.

315
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,007
-I agree.
-I agree.

316
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,759
I feel sleepy.

317
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,677
-No, not yet.
-Right.

318
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,433
I can't stop.

319
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,810
I noticed that you like humming.

320
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,188
Yeah, I always sing when I'm home alone.

321
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,649
I shower with music on.

322
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,609
-We're the same.
-Yes.

323
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,989
-Mommy's home.
-Help us with the bags.

324
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,328
Hey, I saw what the others
were doing downstairs.

325
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,663
Did something happen?

326
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
Jung-yun is so easy to read.

327
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,584
-Ji-woo?
-He likes Ji-woo.

328
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,796
-That's cute.
-It was cute.

329
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,346
Do you want mango or pear and apple?

330
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,806
Me? Mango.

331
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,850
-Have it now.
-Hangover cure?

332
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,019
It's for your stomach.

333
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
Have it now.

334
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,654
Hee-ji is very cheerful.

335
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
She's nice to everyone.

336
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,869
I'm not sure whether she likes me
or that's just who she is.

337
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,955
It's confusing.

338
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,165
Raise your glasses.

339
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,377
-Jung-yun has something to say.
-Is he giving a speech?

340
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,631
My arm's hurting.

341
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,633
I can't keep my arm up.

342
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,760
It's dropping.

343
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,221
You all had a great year.

344
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,892
Manager Lim!

345
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,520
To our twenties!

346
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,188
-To our twenties!
-To our twenties!

347
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,362
It's bitter.

348
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,466
What's wrong with this?

349
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,600
I love you.

350
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,435
Thank you.

351
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,150
-What happened?
-He was like, "I love you."

352
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,950
I wanted to sit next to
Se-yeon or Pyeong-seok.

353
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,662
I wanted to sit next to them
and pique their curiosity

354
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,581
since they couldn't see me directly.

355
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:07,169
While sitting next to them,
I just touched this and that…

356
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,879
I had a good time.

357
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,932
-Why are you here?
-Are you getting something?

358
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,433
Yes, a Somersby.

359
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,853
Do your joints hurt?

360
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,563
See you later.

361
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,232
Where did it go?

362
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,736
The Somersby?

363
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,156
Why isn't it here?

364
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,076
It's okay. I don't drink that much anyway.

365
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,495
Should I have the Pororo drink?

366
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,663
Okay.

367
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,833
Why isn't it here? I'm sure I bought it.

368
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,713
-That's cute. She's following him.
-Look at her following him around.

369
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,631
My goodness.

370
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,135
Are we going downstairs?

371
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,970
Yes.

372
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,972
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

373
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,850
I felt tipsy after a small sip.

374
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,522
-I want that.
-Me too. That's expensive.

375
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,899
I want it too.

376
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,739
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

377
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,872
You're drinking so much.

378
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,796
I want to see how much I can drink.
I've had three shots.

379
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,755
Already?

380
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,632
-Cheers.
-Wow.

381
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,614
-You'll end up… Don't stop him.
-Slow down.

382
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,991
What's wrong with him?

383
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,701
Give me soju.

384
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,121
Not that. Give me real soju. Come on.

385
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,623
What's wrong with you?

386
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,790
Manager Lim…

387
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,000
He's drunk.

388
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,835
He's drunk for sure.

389
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,172
I'll surpass my limits today.

390
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,840
I've had seven shots so far.

391
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,133
Don't give him anymore.

392
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm off to take a shower.

393
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,228
Do you want to go upstairs?
You should go upstairs.

394
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,689
You're drunk. Go upstairs.

395
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,775
I want to watch you guys hanging out.

396
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,449
Do you want ice cream?

397
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,619
-I want ice cream.
-Me too.

398
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,205
Do you want ice cream?

399
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,748
-A little.
-Jaws Bar?

400
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,292
-We have Candy and Jaws, no Watermelon.
-Okay.

401
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,128
I'll go with you to get ice cream.

402
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,590
-I want Jaws.
-Okay.

403
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
I kind of get what it feels
to be drunk now.

404
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,932
-You too?
-You didn't know?

405
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,517
I had no clue.

406
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,811
I knew it all along.

407
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,146
You were like that since we had champagne.

408
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,439
-Who?
-You.

409
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,692
Three Candy, two Jaws.

410
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,610
Three Candy, two Jaws.

411
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,738
-Be careful.
-Yes.

412
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,741
-Watch your step.
-You should be careful.

413
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,620
Why are you drinking so fast?

414
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,873
I should know how much I can drink
now that I've turned 20.

415
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,505
Candy Bar.

416
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,468
What?

417
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,513
-I'm okay now.
-I don't think so.

418
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,727
I think I understand why people
get ice cream when they're drunk.

419
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,272
Cheers.

420
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,773
After drinking…

421
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,027
I can't stop smiling.

422
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,154
He kept drinking without a break.

423
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,406
Right. He drank it like it was soda.

424
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,869
-How do you do that?
-I don't know.

425
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,372
I was a bit scared earlier.
I felt like my head was spinning.

426
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,124
Tipsy but feeling good?

427
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,418
I feel tipsy now.

428
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,297
When I turn my head, things move slowly.
You know what I mean?

429
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,601
Things are going in the wrong direction.

430
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,521
When I see Jung-yun and Ji-woo together,
I get jealous.

431
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,649
I'm afraid Ji-woo likes Jung-yun.

432
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
JI-MIN

433
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:54,247
I was sitting on the other side,
and I saw Jung-yun and Ji-woo flirting.

434
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,166
Watching them from a distance,

435
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,252
honestly, it didn't feel great.

436
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,756
-They are all gone.
-What?

437
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,925
Yeah, they're all gone.

438
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,431
Is it sweet?

439
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,850
Is it?

440
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,937
They're in their own world.
They tuned out the others.

441
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,147
If he gave her a chocolate drink,
it's over.

442
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,190
Yes, that's right.

443
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,193
-Right. When you're drinking…
-When you're drinking,

444
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,196
he quietly approaches you and say,
"Drink this."

445
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,198
Anyone would fall for it.

446
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,033
It makes you anticipate something.

447
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,576
Really?

448
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,956
Alcohol gave me confidence.

449
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,168
I felt like I could talk to her.
That's what I felt.

450
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,920
So I gave her a drink.

451
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,382
Last night, after drinking,

452
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,217
I acted like a fool.

453
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,095
Jung-yun was drunk,

454
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,099
but he got ahold of himself
and took care of me.

455
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,268
I want to get to know him more now.

456
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,437
Seo-hyeon.

457
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,107
-Do you want to go out tomorrow?
-Go where?

458
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,901
-Anywhere.
-Sure. I've never been to Naksan Park.

459
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,488
-At 5 p.m. tomorrow?
-At 5 p.m.?

460
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,157
I don't know when I'll wake up.

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,409
Just get up at any time tomorrow.

462
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,539
What are you doing?

463
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,041
I mean,
I'm sure we'll wake up before 4 p.m.

464
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,960
Hey, I'll be up before noon.

465
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,213
Then I'll trust you
and I won't set the alarm.

466
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:35,056
I was happy but worried at the same time.

467
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,811
I want to talk to everyone
and get to know them,

468
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,356
but I've only talked to Sang-won

469
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,192
and spent time with him.

470
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:51,281
I was worried whether it's okay
to go on a date with just him.

471
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,368
Who's getting groceries tomorrow?
Except those who went today.

472
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,329
We're going, right?

473
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,830
-We're going tomorrow.
-Ji-woo?

474
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,379
Hey, you should go. You haven't gone yet.

475
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,882
-The four of us can go.
-What time are we going?

476
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,931
-I'll wait for you.
-What time?

477
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,901
That's crazy.

478
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,738
-They are acting weird after drinking.
-It's crazy.

479
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:36,534
Jung-yun and Ji-woo spent some
time together for the past few days,

480
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,621
but they got so much closer

481
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,915
-in the past few hours.
-Yes, it meant more.

482
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,832
Yes.

483
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,503
But it seems Ye-rin isn't the only one
in Se-yeon's heart.

484
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,213
He seems changed.

485
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,174
He's getting jealous.

486
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,218
I know. He kept looking at them.

487
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,472
At first, he only cared about Ye-rin,
but that's not the case anymore.

488
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,195
Goodnight. I'll wake you up tomorrow.

489
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,572
I set the alarm at 9:30 a.m.

490
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,533
At 9:30 a.m.? Okay.

491
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,829
Let's wrap up and go to sleep.

492
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,001
-Goodnight.
-You have to take care of your skin.

493
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,043
Night.

494
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,379
Are you just going
to the grocery store tomorrow?

495
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,590
-Are you going on a date with Ji-woo?
-I don't feel confident.

496
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,259
I asked her straight up.

497
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,761
-Did you ask anyone?
-No.

498
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,180
I wanted to take things faster.

499
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,808
I asked Seo-hyeon to go on a date
with me tomorrow.

500
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,351
At 5 p.m.

501
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,771
You'll wake up easily with that.

502
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,982
-That alarm upsets me.
-I know.

503
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,942
How are you going to ask for a date?

504
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,069
-What should I do?
-Just say, "Want to go?"

505
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,280
Is that what you said to Sang-won?

506
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,615
No, he asked me first.

507
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,909
He asked you?

508
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,121
Yes, he asked me if I want to go tomorrow.

509
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,504
Seo-hyeon, what are you guys going to do?
I'm curious.

510
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,547
I don't know.

511
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,924
I'm jealous. No one asked me out yet.

512
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,551
-Me too.
-Same here.

513
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,096
It felt awkward to ask someone now.

514
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,098
It's so awkward.

515
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,144
Sang-won…

516
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:30,648
approached me first.

517
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,068
-Are you thankful?
-Yes. It was nice of him.

518
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,903
But I think…

519
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,615
the actual date is what's important.

520
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,495
When the alarm goes off,
let's all wake up.

521
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,539
Goodnight.

522
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,375
Goodnight.

523
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,337
It's hard.

524
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,797
This is hard.

525
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,051
I think they're afraid
of jumping to any conclusions.

526
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,887
It might put pressure on them.

527
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,264
And other people may not approach them.

528
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,392
It's blocking off the possibility.

529
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,103
Perhaps that's what they're worried about.

530
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,941
Right. Regardless of the gender,
you can still be friends.

531
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,652
But it puts a wall between them.

532
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,654
I want them to have more experiences.

533
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,656
And they also don't have much time.

534
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,158
They're not spending
a few months together.

535
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,743
-They only have a week.
-Right.

536
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,585
DAY ONE AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

537
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,843
-Did you get a good night's sleep?
-Yes.

538
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,270
She's fast asleep.

539
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,856
-I want to take a shower.
-Oh, my goodness.

540
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,941
What? Are you up?

541
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,944
-Ji-woo, are you okay?
-Yes.

542
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,239
I'll wake you up later.
You can go back to sleep.

543
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,491
We have to see the sunrise.

544
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,786
-It's too late.
-No. Not yet.

545
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,080
-The sun's not up yet.
-Not yet?

546
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,000
No, it rises from that side.

547
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,002
Look.

548
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,129
There it is.

549
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,132
There it is.

550
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,093
It's 2023.

551
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,347
I feel like I'm still 19.
I feel like I'm still in high school.

552
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,892
I feel like I have to go to school.

553
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,271
I feel like I have to go to school.

554
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,734
When I got up in the morning,
I had a hangover.

555
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:43,573
I was like, this is something
only adults can experience. It felt nice.

556
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,756
Good morning.

557
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,953
We need to clean up.

558
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,885
-There's always someone like him.
-Pyeong-seok is the best.

559
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,221
He should be awarded
a date for doing that.

560
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,558
-Come on.
-Goodness.

561
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,601
Oh, my.

562
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,062
I wondered what that sound was.

563
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,234
How should we clean this up?

564
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,073
I don't know where to begin.

565
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,993
I'll just eat a chip.

566
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,915
This goes in the fridge.

567
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,712
We're 20 now. We were 19 until yesterday.

568
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,676
This is the life of grown-ups.

569
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,639
Look at all these soju bottles.

570
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,850
Pyeong-seok is really quiet.

571
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,810
They could at least say hi.

572
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,354
-They don't even say hi.
-Did they have a fight?

573
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,981
He's really quiet.

574
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,692
Toast? Do you need help?

575
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,822
-No, I don't need any help for ramyeon.
-Let me know if you need help.

576
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,449
Gosh, I want ramyeon.

577
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,535
I should have the eggs ready.

578
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,997
-Shouldn't you add it to the ramyeon?
-I'm making egg toast.

579
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,499
Good morning.

580
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,962
Good.

581
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,592
Everyone will be touched
to see ramyeon and toast.

582
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,219
We'll eat up all the ramyeon in no time.

583
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,806
Ye-rin's cooking class begins.

584
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,153
Hello.

585
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,321
What's that?

586
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,323
-I'm a good cook, right?
-Looks good.

587
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,992
You made it very tasty.

588
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,911
Are you going to flip it?

589
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,996
How did you do that?

590
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,541
-Be careful.
-Yes.

591
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,338
-It's boiling.
-It smells good.

592
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,840
Come out if you want ramyeon and toast.

593
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,721
-What's all this?
-Hello.

594
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,640
-That looks good.
-This is extra.

595
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,685
What?

596
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,478
Ji-min's sitting next to Ji-woo.

597
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,648
Who wants ramyeon?

598
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,400
Me. I'll just gain weight.

599
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,484
It looks perfect.

600
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,862
It's a mix of spicy and mild flavors.

601
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,241
You know how to eat.

602
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,160
I could smell it from the room.

603
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,914
-This is crazy.
-Do you know who cooked?

604
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,873
Sang-won.

605
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:25,294
No, it was all Ye-rin.
But you were a good assistant.

606
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,921
I was her assistant.

607
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,339
It's a cute bowl.

608
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,674
-I know.
-What's this?

609
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,551
Why is mine so small?

610
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,846
-I didn't notice it.
-Is that for soup and this is for rice?

611
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,974
Look at the size difference.
I can't believe it.

612
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,934
Can I eat now?

613
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,687
-Yes.
-Thank you.

614
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,700
Did you have a shot last night?

615
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,118
-What?
-Just one shot yesterday?

616
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,162
A shot? I had more than that.

617
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,455
More than one?

618
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,041
-I had about four shots.
-Four? You drank a lot.

619
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,042
Yes.

620
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,461
It tasted awful.

621
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,795
I almost puked.

622
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:17,096
I was happy that Ji-woo had breakfast
next to me this morning.

623
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,724
I think this is part of getting close.

624
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,225
I was happy.

625
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,062
He's cute.

626
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,022
He's happy just to talk about her.

627
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,441
Even with bowls, they're like,
"Look at them."

628
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,693
He's different from yesterday.

629
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,695
He's happy.

630
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,114
Cheers.

631
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,420
-How's the French toast?
-I liked it.

632
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,006
-I finished everything.
-It was so good.

633
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,966
-It's so good.
-I like the toast.

634
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,555
I wonder if Se-yeon
and Jung-yun are hungry.

635
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,269
"Every midnight,
dream dates will be revealed."

636
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,646
What's that?

637
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,443
It says, "Every midnight,
dream dates will be revealed."

638
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,029
-Dream dates.
-It's giving me the chills.

639
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,781
This is getting fun.

640
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,701
Starting tonight at midnight,
the dream dates will be revealed.

641
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,286
As you can guess from the name,
the dream date

642
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,375
is a very special date to make
the new adults' dreams come true.

643
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,418
During their stay in House 20,

644
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,256
they can only use it once
with the other person's consent.

645
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,926
The most important part is,
once you use it,

646
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,387
you can't use it again
with the same person.

647
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,350
They must choose who their dream date
will be very carefully.

648
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,268
That's right.

649
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:50,731
Aside from the dream date,
they can go on regular dates at any time.

650
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,943
Now that the no-dating rule is gone,
it's a given.

651
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,778
They're free now.

652
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,238
Dates will be fun.

653
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,073
That's such a fun rule.

654
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,534
-What? You can't do it again.
-My goodness.

655
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,120
-Every midnight?
-Only one couple.

656
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,373
-Starting tonight?
-Yes, it is.

657
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,587
I can't wait to see
what the dream date will be like.

658
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,548
The dates can't overlap each other.

659
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,593
I'm sure all of us will get to go on dates
with different partners.

660
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,887
This is exciting.
I'm looking forward to it.

661
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,515
Once I ask someone out,

662
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,810
I can't go on a date with her again.

663
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,396
That's what I was worried about.

664
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,316
I like that rule.

665
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,526
Only one date with the same person.

666
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,320
I like that so much.

667
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,865
Because if you can go on a date
with the same person again,

668
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,492
it'll be boring.

669
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,162
I want to go on a date
with Se-yeon and Pyeong-seok.

670
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,873
Well, Jung-yun, Ji-min and Sang-won too.

671
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,833
I want to go on a date with everyone.

672
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,919
I wasn't exactly happy about it.

673
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,422
Because Ji-woo is the only one
I'm interested in,

674
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,008
and it's not like I have a good chance.

675
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:03,137
I wondered if I could go on a date
with her. I felt bitter.

676
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,433
If I get rejected, do I lose my chance?

677
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,148
I should clean up and put some makeup on.

678
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,107
Okay.

679
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,818
What if you can't recognize me
because I look pretty?

680
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,280
I'll do my best to recognize you.

681
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,531
Okay.

682
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,160
Shall we start cleaning up?

683
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,578
-Sure.
-Sure.

684
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,537
Sure.

685
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,249
I'm so full.

686
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,834
Where are the gloves?

687
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,340
Pyeong-seok, we're dishwashing buddies.

688
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,599
-Pyeong-seok never answers.
-He's so consistent.

689
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,102
He doesn't even need a mic.

690
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,897
The audio director will be like,
"Is his mic working?"

691
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,775
-I think he'll be worried.
-"Is it not on?"

692
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,860
Seo-hyeon has feelings for Pyeong-seok.

693
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,570
Right…

694
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,120
Oh, no.

695
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,080
Hey, you.

696
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,082
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

697
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,961
I don't like how they feel.

698
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,923
Do people usually just say
"hey, you" in Daegu?

699
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,216
Yes, we don't call by names.

700
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,176
That sounds a bit…

701
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,096
-Right. After I came to Seoul,
-It can be hurtful.

702
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,723
people calling me by my name
felt a bit weird.

703
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,765
Really?

704
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,810
In Daegu, we're like, "Hey, you."

705
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,854
"Hey, you"?

706
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,524
When we were washing the dishes,
Pyeong-seok said to me, "Hey, you."

707
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,862
That doesn't sound friendly.
I want him to call me by my name.

708
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,614
Q. DOES HE CALL HEE-JI LIKE THAT?

709
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,742
I've never paid attention to that.

710
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,162
I should pay attention to that
from now on.

711
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,043
Pyeong-seok, do you see this?

712
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,839
We're done.

713
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,175
-Done?
-Yes, that was nice.

714
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,719
Well done.

715
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,722
Well done.

716
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,988
Jung-yun.

717
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,575
Can you get up?

718
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,037
Everyone else is up.

719
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,290
-Thanks.
-Get ready and come out.

720
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,959
No need to rush.

721
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,394
-I'm bored.
-Me too. Let's sit here.

722
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,145
We have enough chairs.

723
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,563
-There are four.
-Yeah.

724
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,815
I can't count.

725
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,526
-What's going on?
-Hurry up and get ready.

726
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,403
-Did you take a shower?
-He's dying.

727
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,487
The great actor.

728
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,781
Look at him.

729
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,324
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

730
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,577
-You don't look fine.
-You woke up surprised.

731
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,247
Get a chair.

732
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,624
You drank too much.

733
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,128
Ji-min is still next to her.

734
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,005
Ji-min's glad Jung-yun woke up late.

735
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,299
But Seo-yeong is staying
next to Ji-min too.

736
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,301
-Exactly.
-Oh, no.

737
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,346
-I'm never drinking again.
-Why?

738
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,016
-You'll drink again tonight.
-Yeah. We need to drink again today.

739
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,233
"Every midnight,
dream dates will be revealed."

740
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,610
What's a dream date?

741
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,863
It's kind of a special date.

742
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,364
A special date?

743
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,074
I wonder what the dates are.

744
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,826
EACH DATE IS FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED

745
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,454
-Then I should--
-I should save it for later.

746
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,080
Why?

747
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,708
It's first come first serve
and you only get one.

748
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,501
-It's first come first serve?
-Yes.

749
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,505
I'm not sure about what to do.
I'm still thinking.

750
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,383
I think I'll watch what others do first

751
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,552
and then make a decision.

752
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,723
They might feel like they have to rush
because it's first come first serve.

753
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,143
It could also be like,
"The next date could be even better."

754
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,269
Exactly.

755
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,813
-They might wait because of that.
-They may wait.

756
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,816
Or Jung-yun might ask Ji-woo now--

757
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,109
No, that'd never happen.

758
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,819
Jung-yun's cautious.

759
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,323
He's careful, and last night,
he was drunk.

760
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,241
Right. It was the alcohol talking.

761
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,703
-They can ask each other out at midnight.
-Right, they may be drunk.

762
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:41,207
-They might do it while drinking.
-There's a possibility.

763
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,751
I can't wait to find out
who will use it first.

764
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,338
What do we need to get?

765
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,089
I got it. Let's go.

766
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,387
Hello.

767
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,681
Hello.

768
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,267
Hello.

769
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,227
-Oh, no.
-Welcome.

770
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,896
Put your seatbelt on.

771
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,064
Put your seatbelt on.

772
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,275
-The supermarket.
-Let's go.

773
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,698
Hey.

774
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,284
-Never mind.
-Okay.

775
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,827
Hey.

776
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,704
Never mind.

777
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,584
-What?
-Never mind.

778
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,545
I just wanted to gasp.

779
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,341
-Ji-woo is playful.
-Yes.

780
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,468
-Jung-yun likes her for that.
-He likes her.

781
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,011
He finds her so cute.

782
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,806
But he can't tell her that
without alcohol.

783
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,935
I like his awkward smile.

784
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,941
They're behind us.

785
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,986
Yes.

786
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,783
I'm going to take a nap.

787
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,994
Sure. I'll wake you up.

788
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,498
What should we do when we turn 20?

789
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,126
Wait, we are 20 now.

790
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,628
What? We're 20?

791
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,256
I can't believe it.

792
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,134
Did it feel real yesterday?

793
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,553
No, I just drank and passed out.

794
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,723
Before feeling it…

795
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,767
I was trying to keep myself sober.

796
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,563
I'm not going to drink anymore.

797
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,522
Why not?

798
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,815
-It's tough.
-Why?

799
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,234
I really need to stay alert mentally.

800
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,652
-Was it mentally tough?
-Yes.

801
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,154
It was okay for me.

802
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,241
You're okay because you let go,
but I was trying so hard to stay alert.

803
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,367
You should let go too.

804
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,410
-No.
-Why not?

805
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,703
Then I won't be myself.

806
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,704
-No?
-No.

807
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,956
-Then who is it?
-I don't know.

808
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,875
A side of me that I don't even know

809
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,877
-might come out.
-I'm curious now.

810
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,211
Can you let go just once?

811
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,797
I let myself go in the room last night.

812
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,426
We should get a drink together later.

813
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,636
-Sure.
-You can show me then.

814
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,553
Okay.

815
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,139
"Together later"?

816
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,516
Ji-woo's more proactive than I expected.

817
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,811
Great.

818
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,022
I'm taking care of you
like a baby already.

819
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,733
You? I drank more than you.

820
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,651
It's okay.

821
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:22,159
Hee-ji, it's time for "Let's play."

822
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,161
Where do we start?

823
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,163
Left.

824
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,498
Here?

825
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,957
Now they can't see us.

826
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,834
One, two, three.

827
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,546
-Let's play.
-Let's play.

828
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,050
Wake up, we're bored!

829
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,178
Can we come in?

830
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,263
I don't mind. What about Pyeong-seok?

831
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,808
Pyeong-seok.

832
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,728
-Look at him.
-You sleepyhead.

833
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:50,979
What time is it?

834
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,898
It's 3 p.m.

835
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,109
Don't lie. I set the alarm for 12:30 p.m.

836
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,736
You didn't fall for it.

837
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,446
I'm bored.

838
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,740
You want to hang out here?

839
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,283
Let's hang here.

840
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,077
Let's hang out here. I don't mind.

841
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,495
Pyeong-seok, do you?

842
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,123
Pyeong-seok's not awake yet.

843
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,338
Se-yeon, are you sleeping?

844
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,634
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

845
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,679
Can I? If you don't answer, I'm coming in.

846
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,013
Come in.

847
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,351
Wake up. Let's hang out.

848
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,103
Wake up!

849
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,521
-What time is it?
-Wake up.

850
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,022
-It's 3 p.m.
-What?

851
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,441
-It's 3 p.m.
-It's 3 p.m.?

852
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,733
Did you have lunch?

853
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,236
It's actually noon.
We haven't had lunch yet.

854
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,113
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

855
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,322
I made breakfast.

856
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,076
I heard. I wanted it. What a shame.

857
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,245
The others said it was really good.

858
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,747
It was really good.

859
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,167
I'm hungry.

860
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,378
Are you? Do you want something?
How about French toast?

861
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,047
-No, maybe later.
-Okay.

862
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,054
I feel pretty well-rested, though.

863
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,975
You can sleep if you want,
but I want you to wake up.

864
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,020
No. I should wake up now.

865
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,647
I'm bored.

866
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,194
Se-yeon's feeling comfortable
around her already.

867
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,779
I don't know what he's thinking.

868
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,615
I wish he could tell us.

869
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,117
-To us?
-Yes.

870
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,369
-"This is how I feel."
-Is it Ye-rin or Ji-woo?

871
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,455
I think he likes Ji-woo more than…

872
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,624
Right? But he keeps saying it's Ye-rin.

873
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,085
It's been a while since
his last interview.

874
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,837
-Right.
-Is that so?

875
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,465
-That's all the info we have right now.
-Right.

876
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,010
It's so warm.

877
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,095
-It's sunny.
-Yes.

878
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,555
I can't keep my eyes open.

879
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,559
Gosh. This is nice.

880
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,687
It's so nice.

881
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,817
-I'm going over there.
-Where?

882
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,362
What's there?

883
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,076
-If you're leaving, I'll take your seat.
-Okay.

884
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,037
-It's a swing.
-The porch swing.

885
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,331
Cool.

886
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,459
Wait, it's the guys' room.

887
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,298
Hold onto the cushion.

888
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,801
Gosh.

889
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,388
-Gosh.
-I like the sun.

890
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,556
It's really nice.

891
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,933
It's so peaceful.

892
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,102
I love it.

893
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,908
-I wish they'd talk.
-Yes.

894
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,201
Please, Pyeong-seok.

895
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,078
He talks even less when he's shy.

896
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,840
The others went grocery shopping… No.

897
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,634
-When did they leave? Around noon?
-Yes.

898
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,595
Will they bring anything good?

899
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,100
You didn't go to the grocery store
or the convenience store?

900
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,728
I should go on a date.

901
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,855
Yeah, you should go on a date.

902
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,358
-Are you going on a date?
-What?

903
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,985
-Do you have a date?
-No.

904
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,570
-No?
-No.

905
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,530
You should go on a date with me.

906
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,539
-Pyeong-seok.
-Pyeong-seok. Finally.

907
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,167
I knew you'd do it.

908
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,045
I'm shocked.
I never expected him to say that.

909
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,631
-Do you have a date?
-No.

910
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,299
-No?
-No.

911
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,134
You should go on a date with me.

912
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,513
I'd like that.

913
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,851
-Where--
-Do you want to go tonight?

914
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,102
-Tonight?
-Yes.

915
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,813
Where do you want to go?

916
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,316
Anywhere.

917
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,738
I have to say I was surprised.

918
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,656
HEE-JI

919
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,451
He's so shy.
I never expected him to ask me out.

920
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,995
It was exciting.

921
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,331
I kept thinking about it.

922
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,917
I was very nervous,
but I gathered the courage

923
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,920
to ask her out with confidence.

924
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,339
It feels like I've completed a mission.

925
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,803
I don't know what to do or what to eat.

926
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,097
But I'm happy to think about it.

927
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,226
Pyeong-seok.

928
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,687
-He asked her out.
-That was cool of him.

929
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,272
-Great job.
-Oh, Pyeong-seok.

930
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,984
He was very quiet in school.
He barely talked to anyone.

931
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,569
That's why it means a lot.

932
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,572
I wondered if he was going to ask her,
but I never thought

933
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,408
-he'd do it in such a cool way.
-Right.

934
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,535
-It was so cool.
-It was wonderful.

935
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,330
What are they doing over there?
Are they on the swing?

936
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,082
Pyeong-seok looks happy.

937
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,500
I can't see that far.

938
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,254
I can see Hee-ji and Pyeong-seok's face.
He's listening to her with a smile.

939
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,923
-That's so like him.
-What?

940
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,968
No wonder Hee-ji fell for him.

941
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,470
No wonder.

942
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,807
-What?
-Nothing. It's just so funny.

943
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:20,976
It's funny.

944
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,229
Right. Do you know who gave you the book?

945
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,064
-The book?
-Yes.

946
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,649
I got two books.

947
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,359
-Two? Bam.
-What?

948
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,153
-Bam.
-Hey.

949
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,988
From whom? Tell me.

950
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,031
I know one's from Seo-hyeon.

951
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,993
I thought the other one was from you.
Am I right?

952
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,453
-Yes.
-Really?

953
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,956
Your life graph was really memorable.

954
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,250
It was a straight line.

955
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,335
I was pretty lucky.

956
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:54,426
I just wanted to tell you
about the phrases I wrote down.

957
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,553
That life is a marathon,

958
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,598
-or that I should rely on others?
-That it's okay to do that.

959
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,725
-That's what you wanted to tell me?
-Yes.

960
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,186
I was grateful.

961
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,397
It's not easy to rely on someone.

962
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,733
-That's not easy for me.
-I see.

963
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,153
Are you going out tonight?

964
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,238
Tonight? No.

965
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,073
-I have no plans yet.
-Okay.

966
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,533
You should ask someone out.

967
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,038
I can't make up my mind.

968
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,124
I don't hesitate to approach someone
as a friend,

969
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,836
but when it comes to dating,
I'm afraid it'd put pressure on him.

970
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,006
That's true. Maintaining that boundary

971
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,259
and not coming on too strong is hard.

972
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:41,181
I should take this chance
to be honest with my feelings.

973
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,519
I don't know what I want.

974
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,020
A week is not a long time.

975
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,397
It's very short, Ms. Choi.

976
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,941
Why can't it be a year?

977
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:58,156
Since we don't have much time,
I believe our emotions change fast.

978
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,700
If I like someone,
I'll fall for them fast.

979
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,496
If someone else sparks my interest,
my feelings would change fast.

980
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,206
I think I should

981
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,003
ask myself how I feel
and try to find an answer.

982
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,924
I want to be honest with myself
in terms of love.

983
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,845
-How was grocery shopping?
-The supermarket? It was really far.

984
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,265
What?

985
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,601
Why the long face?

986
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,731
I think I'll grab a beer later.

987
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,652
-I can't hold it back.
-Is there anyone you like?

988
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,530
-It's Ji-woo.
-Ji-woo?

989
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,576
-Are you going to ask her out on a date?
-Ask her?

990
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,536
You should ask her first.

991
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,164
You think she'd say yes?

992
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,500
Why not?

993
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,965
I'm not good at mustering up courage.

994
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,550
But I need to give it a shot.

995
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,721
-Are you going on a date today?
-What?

996
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,556
Are you?

997
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,310
I'm going to turn Sang-won down.

998
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,436
Really?

999
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,104
What?

1000
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,692
-The casual date?
-She's going to say no.

1001
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,612
Because…

1002
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,907
Right now, I want to get to know others.

1003
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:28,997
But if I go on a date with him
on the first day,

1004
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,791
-then it's set in stone.
-No.

1005
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,253
However you feel about it,
you can just go for it.

1006
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,339
It's a casual date.
Just have a quick meal.

1007
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:42,677
You think so?
I was going to reject him and…

1008
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,095
Come closer.

1009
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,890
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1010
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,516
Bring the chair over.

1011
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:55,440
Just go for a meal.
Go to a nice restaurant.

1012
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,485
I shouldn't just turn him down, right?

1013
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,362
-No.
-You should go.

1014
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,404
Right?

1015
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,781
I…

1016
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,242
Are you going today? Tonight?

1017
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,244
Maybe.

1018
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,789
-Are you going to ask?
-No.

1019
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,540
-Are you going to wait?
-Seok.

1020
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,250
Did he ask you?

1021
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,627
Really?

1022
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,544
Yeah.

1023
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,800
Hey, I think I'm going to
give up on Ji-min.

1024
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,051
Why?

1025
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,886
-Don't take it that far.
-Why?

1026
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,389
He's not interested in me at all.

1027
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,307
I don't know what he wants.

1028
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,642
He's just…

1029
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:35,480
He kept saying he was tired,
and he just wanted to go home and sleep.

1030
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,526
She can feel it too.

1031
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,279
I have to say I was surprised.

1032
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,616
We were all hanging out on the terrace.

1033
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,119
-When?
-When you went grocery shopping.

1034
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,120
Right.

1035
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,790
Then Pyeong-seok suddenly asked me
if anyone asked me out yet.

1036
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,418
-I said no.
-That's cute.

1037
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,295
He was like, "You should go with me."

1038
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,840
What? He said, "You should go with me"?

1039
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,093
I was like, "Should I ask him out first?"

1040
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,470
That's what I was thinking.

1041
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,098
I'm going to ask him out first.
If he doesn't ask me.

1042
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,767
-For tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

1043
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,981
What should I do? Any ideas?

1044
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,150
-You going to ask him out?
-Ask Ji-min out.

1045
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,194
Hang out with him before you decide.

1046
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:33,788
Seo-yeong knows
Ji-min isn't interested in her.

1047
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,708
What then?

1048
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,334
Should she approach him?

1049
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,504
-Personally, I think she shouldn't.
-I agree with you.

1050
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,132
I think she should take a step back.

1051
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,385
-Right.
-See what happens.

1052
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,679
She should talk to other guys too.

1053
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,598
When Ji-min sees that,

1054
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,767
he might be like,
"I thought she was into me."

1055
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,934
Maybe.

1056
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,520
Who's down for some ramyeon?

1057
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,855
I'm hungry.

1058
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,233
-Give me some cup noodles. I'm hungry.
-Are you?

1059
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,860
Who wants this?

1060
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,075
Pyeong-seok, catch.

1061
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,125
Should I ask him now?

1062
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,753
Do it now. Or later.

1063
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,589
-Maybe later.
-Ask him if he wants to get dinner.

1064
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,342
I'm going upstairs.

1065
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,677
-I want to look around.
-Let's go upstairs.

1066
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,995
It's so scary up here.

1067
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,456
You're dead if you fall from here.

1068
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,333
What are you doing in there?

1069
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,001
What are you doing up there?

1070
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,295
They're asking what we're doing here.

1071
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,177
Ji-min.

1072
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,638
She's going for it.

1073
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
I can't watch this.

1074
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,392
No.

1075
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,311
Ji-min.

1076
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,897
-Yeah?
-Come on.

1077
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,526
-Let's talk.
-Talk here.

1078
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,194
-Here?
-Yes.

1079
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,655
Do you want to go on a date with me?

1080
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,990
Sure.

1081
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,366
Do you want to?

1082
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,410
-There's this place I found.
-Where?

1083
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:37,871
Now…

1084
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,206
Look at this.

1085
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,543
I see.

1086
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,838
-Let's talk about it again later.
-Later?

1087
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,006
-Yes.
-Okay.

1088
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,138
I was going to ask Ji-woo.

1089
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:59,142
I had planned to make a move.

1090
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,311
Then Seo-yeong asked me out on a date.

1091
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,896
Things didn't go as I planned.

1092
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,692
I said yes
because I didn't see that coming.

1093
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,111
I didn't know what to say.

1094
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,071
I'm not good at saying no.

1095
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,866
And if I say no, it'd break her heart.

1096
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,368
I shouldn't have,

1097
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,704
but I ended up saying yes.

1098
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,920
What's everyone doing here?

1099
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,552
Se-yeon looks good in navy,
don't you think?

1100
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,512
-Yes.
-Right.

1101
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,514
Didn't mean to put you on the spot.

1102
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,475
Thanks.

1103
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,311
Where should I go?

1104
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,688
You haven't decided yet? Come sit here.

1105
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,358
We should pick a place together.

1106
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,361
We haven't decided yet.

1107
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,992
Just a moment.

1108
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:02,372
Here's what we're going to do.
Let's have dinner first then go to a cafe.

1109
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,582
Sound good?

1110
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,334
Pasta sounds good.

1111
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,585
-Pasta?
-Yes.

1112
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,550
Why are you smiling?

1113
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,307
Who's staying back?

1114
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,310
Me, Se-yeon, Jung-yun, Ji-woo and…

1115
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,603
-And…
-That's it.

1116
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,938
-Just us?
-Yes.

1117
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:32,235
-You can hang out together.
-Let's have an earnest conversation.

1118
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,112
-Let's do that.
-A serious conversation.

1119
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,115
We can hang out in front of the fireplace.

1120
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:47,125
-This is complicated.
-Ji-min is only thinking about Ji-woo.

1121
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:51,462
I know this isn't right but in a way
I hope Ji-min asks Ji-woo out first.

1122
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,882
If this don't work out, Seo-yeong can then
swoop in and comfort him.

1123
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,092
That's a good idea.

1124
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,929
I know from experience,
love is all about timing.

1125
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,389
It's all about timing.

1126
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,354
-Hey, where do you want to go today?
-Today?

1127
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,106
Today,

1128
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,567
-I'm craving bossam.
-Okay.

1129
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,694
What was it again?

1130
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,404
Are we ordering it now?

1131
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,655
No.

1132
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,367
If you want to go out, we can go out
or we can order in.

1133
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:25,580
-Do you want to go out?
-Yes.

1134
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,875
Do you want pasta and wine?

1135
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,754
-Or we could go for yukhoe.
-Wine?

1136
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,215
-We can have a drink with yukhoe.
-Yukhoe?

1137
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,843
I love yukhoe so much.

1138
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,220
Really? Do you want to get yukhoe then?

1139
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,224
-The yukhoe has to be seasoned well.
-Okay.

1140
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,728
And yukhoe bibimbap is tasty too!

1141
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,689
-You said you like yukhoe.
-Yes, how did you know?

1142
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,399
-We did the AMA.
-Oh, right.

1143
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,990
All right. So, Ji-min was going to ask
Ji-woo to go on a date with him at first.

1144
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:05,203
And Seo-hyeon
was going to reject Sang-won.

1145
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:10,333
But in the end, they both
changed their original decisions.

1146
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,417
Right.

1147
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,671
It's not easy to turn someone down.

1148
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,713
-No.
-Right.

1149
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,841
It's hard to turn somebody down
in a situation like this.

1150
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,427
They don't have much experience.

1151
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,180
How would you have
rejected someone in this situation?

1152
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:30,353
I'd say, "Sorry, there's someone else
I want to go on a date with."

1153
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,314
-You'd be honest?
-If I didn't like Seo-yeong.

1154
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,565
That's the right thing to do.

1155
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:40,863
I would've said I won't be able to go
because I have other plans.

1156
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,282
At that age, we wouldn't have been able
to turn someone down.

1157
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,535
Right. Not easy to say no.

1158
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,538
They're all friends. They all just met.

1159
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,581
They'll be like, "Well… Okay."

1160
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:55,044
Anyway, they're going on a date.
Now this is the important part.

1161
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,588
Now is the important part.

1162
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,511
Let's go.

1163
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,763
Let's go.

1164
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,975
PYEONG-SEOK & HEE-JI'S DATE

1165
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,268
I'll get in on that side.

1166
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,646
Let's go.

1167
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,398
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1168
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,358
-Hello.
-Hello.

1169
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,068
-Hello.
-Hello.

1170
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,863
Put your seatbelt on.

1171
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,824
-Okay.
-Okay.

1172
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,203
Anything would taste good now.

1173
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,216
-Look at them.
-So sweet!

1174
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,635
-So exciting.
-They're happy just to see each other.

1175
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,929
I love their smiles.

1176
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,434
I didn't know I was so shy.

1177
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,563
Gosh. If you…

1178
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:01,235
had turned me down today,
I wouldn't have been able to sleep.

1179
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,614
Come on.

1180
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,451
I was thinking about asking you first.

1181
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,994
-Really?
-You suddenly said,

1182
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,704
"We should go on a date."

1183
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,998
I was really surprised.

1184
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,209
I couldn't be happier.

1185
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,801
Your eyes are twinkling.

1186
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,844
I feel like I can dive into them.

1187
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,642
-This feels strange.
-Yes.

1188
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,731
Do you want to play this?
This is Jenga with questions.

1189
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,067
No.

1190
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,653
-Don't be so reckless.
-I'll hold it.

1191
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,406
We were smashing the blocks
when we were drunk yesterday.

1192
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,828
"Your special move
on the person you like."

1193
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,788
I want to hear this.

1194
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:55,373
-Any tips?
-Tips?

1195
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,042
I keep staring at him.

1196
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,336
-I just keep staring at him.
-How?

1197
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:04,340
If I like someone,
I keep staring until we make eye contact.

1198
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:07,009
When our eyes finally meet, I look away.

1199
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,804
So you make eye contact

1200
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,556
to show that you like him.

1201
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,685
Yes. I'm sending a message with my eyes.

1202
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,314
-What's your special move?
-My special move?

1203
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,777
If there isn't one, something you do
around the person you like.

1204
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,321
Like, when you had a crush
in elementary school.

1205
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,907
-Maybe how you felt.
-Back in elementary school?

1206
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,451
I was in the fifth grade
and I'd just had lunch,

1207
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,121
-I was heading back.
-In fifth grade.

1208
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,374
I was walking up the stairs,
and someone was walking up.

1209
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,587
She was so pretty. She was so cute.

1210
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,671
That was me.

1211
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,424
She was my first love.

1212
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,511
So I gathered up my courage
and poked her on Facebook.

1213
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,512
Really?

1214
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,222
Poked?

1215
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,850
-Poked her? Crazy.
-Poked? No way.

1216
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,226
Poking.

1217
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,519
That's it?

1218
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,063
-So poking is your move?
-Your special move.

1219
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,150
Poking is a special move.

1220
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,861
-What about you?
-What's your special move?

1221
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,571
My move?

1222
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,781
My special move? I don't know.

1223
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,576
Or something you do when you like someone.

1224
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,585
I think I try to make
a lot of eye contact.

1225
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,588
You can't help it.
You want to look at them.

1226
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,756
Right.

1227
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,549
Even if we don't make eye contact.

1228
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,927
Even if she doesn't look at me,

1229
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,638
I keep looking at her.

1230
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,681
-You're constantly checking.
-Right.

1231
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,224
Because you want to see her.

1232
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,148
-This is interesting.
-Oh, my.

1233
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:49,195
If you think about it,
House 20 became very interesting.

1234
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,113
It's an interesting group of people.

1235
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,491
In a way, it's a love square.

1236
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,202
We thought these two pairs
would definitely date.

1237
01:05:56,285 --> 01:06:00,289
But it's confusing now. With Se-yeon too.

1238
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,418
Is our hoe coming?
Shall we get some booze?

1239
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,711
Should I get them?

1240
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,046
Let's put it down.

1241
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,047
Put them in here.

1242
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,674
Let's not take too much.

1243
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,884
-Do we need other drinks?
-Yes.

1244
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,637
What do you want to take? Powerade?

1245
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,639
No, the aloe drink? Aloe it is.

1246
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,810
-Let's go.
-Come on.

1247
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,319
What do you think of Jung-yun?

1248
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,739
-Do you like Jung-yun?
-Why do you ask?

1249
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,743
I'm just asking.

1250
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,871
-What?
-What?

1251
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,915
I'm just asking how you feel about him.

1252
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,459
I don't know. He's a nice guy.

1253
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,462
-That's not what I meant.
-What do you mean?

1254
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,841
What do you think of Ye-rin?

1255
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,051
Me?

1256
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,428
What do you think?

1257
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,309
We should talk about it later.

1258
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,021
-What's up?
-What?

1259
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,161
ONE HOUR LATER

1260
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,871
Will it be awkward in here?

1261
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,330
It's not awkward at all.

1262
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,875
-This is my first time in here!
-Let's talk here.

1263
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,543
-Are we the first ones here?
-Yes.

1264
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,214
Something big is going to happen.

1265
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,593
-I can't wait.
-Right.

1266
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,513
-What did you guys talk about?
-Well…

1267
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,599
We talked about a lot of stuff.

1268
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,560
We had a long conversation because…

1269
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,774
This might take a while. Do you have time?

1270
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,067
Yes. Don't worry.

1271
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,443
-I…
-Yes.

1272
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,988
What do you think?

1273
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,616
Who do you think I'm into?

1274
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,576
-Ye-rin.
-What do you think?

1275
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,120
I thought you and Ye-rin both
had feelings for each other.

1276
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,873
-I know how Ye-rin feels.
-Right.

1277
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:12,088
So I thought
you two were on the same page.

1278
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:20,930
Before you got here,
Ye-rin and I did a lot of things together.

1279
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,266
We spent a lot of time together.

1280
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:30,397
I realized Ye-rin is a nice person. But…

1281
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,945
-I don't know what I want.
-You don't?

1282
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:39,740
But there must be something
your heart wants.

1283
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,330
You.

1284
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,360
