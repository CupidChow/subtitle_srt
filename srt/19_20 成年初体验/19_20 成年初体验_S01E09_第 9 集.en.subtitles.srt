00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
SE-YEON

00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,022
JUNG-YUN

00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359

HEE-JI

00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
JI-MIN

00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,118
YE-RIN

00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,287
JI-WOO

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,456
PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,638
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,933
I heard what Jung-yun said about you.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,060
What? When?

14
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,064
Jung-yun said, "For me, it's Ji-woo."

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,195
The others were saying,
"You were only looking at Ji-woo."

16
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,031
-And he said, "I couldn't help it."
-No way!

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,327
Why can't he say that to me?

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,080
That's what I want to hear,
but when I ask him,

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,291
he won't say it. So I'm confused again.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,461
He's making my heart flutter.

21
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,298
Jung-yun's so funny.

22
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,010
-He's so funny.
-Doesn't he have a cute smile?

23
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,345
-No.
-Well…

24
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,722
He's so handsome and he smiles differently

25
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,892
when he's fooling around
and when he can't help it.

26
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,936
The corners of his lips…

27
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,815
-Right.
-You can see that he's trying to hide it.

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,067
It's driving me nuts.
Why is he so handsome?

29
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,030
Ji-woo's expressing her feelings.

30
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,324
-She's so into him.
-I didn't know it was this much.

31
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,119
Ji-woo was really serious about him.

32
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,705
-He's weird. Why can't he just…
-She's blushing.

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,958
Why can't he tell me how he feels?

34
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,379
I do know how he feels,
but I wish he would express himself more.

35
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,633
You guys are so cute.

36
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,137
What about you, Ji-min?

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,722
Yeah, I want to know how he feels.

38
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,849
-Who is it?
-I…

39
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,308
Be honest.

40
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,768
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,232
-Who are you torn between?
-You must be interested in someone.

42
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,900
Between Ye-rin and Ji-woo.

43
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,320
-Ye-rin and Ji-woo?
-My feelings for them keep changing.

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,907
He feels the same way as Se-yeon then.

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,243
Right. They're interested
in the same girls.

46
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,161
Yes.

47
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,663
-Jung-yun only likes Ji-woo. These three…
-Right.

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,206
It's complicated.

49
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,293
I like Ji-woo,
but I'm starting to like Ye-rin

50
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,753
after going on a date with her today.

51
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,756
I keep going back and forth between them.

52
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,967
-How was it?
-It was really fun.

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,885
Really?

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,762
Did she feel more like a friend? Or…

55
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,556
-Was it romantic?
-Were there sparks?

56
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,478
It felt like we were starting to like each
other romantically, not as friends.

57
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,816
I told her that I'm interested
in her and Ji-woo.

58
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
Don't you have something to share?

59
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
Me? Well…

60
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,744
Nothing like that?

61
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,537
-Oh, to Hee-ji?
-Yes.

62
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,206
-Yes, we talked.
-About what?

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,125
I asked her if she likes anyone.

64
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,085
Did she say it was you?

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,546
-Did she?
-Yes.

66
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,423
She was like, "No one else but you."

67
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,885
So everyone's saying that kind of stuff.

68
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,387
Everyone is…

69
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,849
You're the only one
who hasn't said anything!

70
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,100
You should say something.

71
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,020
-Jung-yun.
-It was basically spoon-fed to him.

72
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,898
But I bet he realized
while listening to them.

73
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,484
-He'll know he should say something.
-Please!

74
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,610
I think he will now.

75
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,863
-She was so honest.
-I'm not sure about how Ye-rin feels.

76
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,116
-I opened up about everything.
-I don't know where to start.

77
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,495
You want to do something
with Pyeong-seok, right?

78
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,829
-You're curious about him?
-Yes.

79
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,872
I can tell.

80
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,834
I'd like to get to know him more.

81
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,835
-And he's a friend.
-Yeah.

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,255
How did it go with Ji-min?

83
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,008
We hung out as friends, but in the end…

84
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,182
Ji-min said that he doesn't think of me
as just a friend anymore.

85
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,018
That's crazy.

86
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,104
He's good at saying stuff like that.

87
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,606
-He's good at expressing himself.
-He is.

88
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,111
He says it feels completely different
when he's alone with me.

89
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,072
He said he never thought
he'd feel this way.

90
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,241
-But…
-This is interesting.

91
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,202
I also just thought of him as a friend,

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,621
-Was it different?
-but it feels a bit more romantic now.

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,584
He started being so sweet after he started
to see me as a love interest.

94
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,421
But I don't know
what will happen with Ji-min.

95
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,172
Right. No one knows.

96
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,133
Let's go.

97
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,302
LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE

98
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,309
-You said you wanted
-Let's go.

99
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,727
-a picture of the castle.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,034
-This is crazy.
-Tell me about it.

101
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,579
I just got goose bumps.

102
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,665
-Not everyone gets to experience that.
-Seriously.

103
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,001
Except for the Chairman of Lotte, maybe.

104
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,918
Right.

105
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,299
I can't believe this.

106
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,216
Hey.

107
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,179
This is so awesome.

108
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,346
Hey.

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,265
-The constellations…
-Yeah.

110
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,769
-This is so cool.
-Seriously.

111
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,729
I can't believe it.

112
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,731
This is crazy.

113
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,399
-Hey…
-Holy…

114
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,234
-It's so pretty.
-Yeah.

115
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,236
Seriously.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,322
And we're the only ones here.

117
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,157
Yeah. This is so…

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm so happy right now.

119
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,828
This is amazing.

120
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,581
-This is a dream date.
-Yes, for real.

121
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,335
-Look!
-My gosh.

122
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,089
-Should we take a photo at the castle?
-Yes. I've never taken one there before.

123
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,175
-At the castle?
-Yes, there was always a long line.

124
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,011
-It was impossible.
-I always took photos there by myself.

125
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,306
That's lit up just for the two of us.

126
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,435
I can't believe it. I love it.

127
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,771
The castle's beautiful.

128
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,819
I feel dizzy.

129
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
-From happiness?
-I'm really dizzy.

130
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,657
I'm dizzy with excitement.

131
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,451
-Should we take a photo?
-Yes.

132
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,204
Are you good at taking photos?

133
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,248
Of course. I'm a good at posing too.

134
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,583
-I'm not that good.
-Really?

135
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,586
-I'm not good at taking photos.
-I'll help you.

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,171
-Yes, help me out.
-Okay.

137
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,048
Ten seconds? Three?

138
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,716
-Three is too short.
-Right.

139
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,638
-Nine seconds. What should I do?
-Do a cool pose.

140
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,889
-Here?
-What do I do?

141
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,727
-It took so many.
-Next.

142
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,981
Next, stand right here.

143
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,858
-Okay.
-Stand closer.

144
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,484
Eye contact? Can you?

145
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,697
You can't keep eye contact.
How can we do that pose?

146
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,449
-This is hard.
-There.

147
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:30,992
All right.

148
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,412
Hey, this looks really good.

149
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,913
It's great.

150
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,082
It's awesome.

151
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,253
-This one's good.
-Nice.

152
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,881
It's been a long time since I got
on a carousel.

153
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,798
Same here.

154
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,801
-Five years? Ten?
-Ten years?

155
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,512
-I was 10 years old 10 years ago.
-We're 20 now.

156
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,638
We're 20.

157
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,065
Surprise!

158
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,775
It's so pretty!

159
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,944
That's awesome.

160
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
I got goose bumps.

161
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,615
This reminds me of Shin Hyun-joon.

162
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,033
-Stairway to Heaven?
-Yes.

163
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,535
Do I look like Prince Charming?

164
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,207
-Come on.
-I can ride without holding onto this.

165
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,083
I only rode this when I was little.

166
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,085
It goes up and down quite a lot.

167
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,003
Right?

168
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,798
-Okay.
-Well, I…

169
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,762
Should we take a photo?

170
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,804
-Shall we?
-Yes.

171
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,725
-You look great.
-Make me look pretty.

172
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,603
-Should I get your feet in the picture?
-Yes.

173
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,147
You look good.

174
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,732
I can't wink.

175
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,948
-Hey, why are you…
-Hey.

176
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,993
-This one looks good.
-Are you sure?

177
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,788
-Pick the one you look good in.
-What about this one?

178
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,873
-Okay, this one looks good.
-Okay.

179
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,876
Safety check complete.
Let's set sail. Ready, go!

180
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,169
THE SPANISH PIRATE SHIP
THE CONQUISTADOR

181
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,130
-There's no one here.
-This is crazy.

182
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,259
Calm down.

183
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,178
-Relax.
-Raise your arms.

184
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,014
Raise your hands!

185
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,475
What do I do? Let's calm down.

186
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,812
-Come on, just once more!
-Relax.

187
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,193
I think I lowered my arms first.

188
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,113
They're the first ones to hold hands
in this show.

189
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,949
They're practically dating right now.

190
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,992
But…

191
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,368
They're dating for sure.

192
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,370
What?

193
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,833
He crossed his arms.

194
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,960
He crossed his arms.

195
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,172
-You want me to cover your bangs?
-Wait.

196
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,466
-Should I cover it?
-Yeah.

197
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,093
-Hey!
-Watch out.

198
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,928
-Please!
-Here we go.

199
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,439
Compared to the last time I…

200
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,149
Why is this so scary?

201
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,775
Are you scared?

202
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,987
Please.

203
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,989
-I love this.
-Oh, please.

204
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,787
-What's happening?
-Here we go!

205
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,623
No!

206
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,167
Yes!

207
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
-Here we go.
-Wait.

208
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,555
Here we go. Watch out.

209
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,182
This is it.

210
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,743
That was so much fun.

211
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,829
Thank you for riding.

212
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,872
That was…

213
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,540
Seriously…

214
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,376
-You all right?
-Please.

215
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,169
-My legs are shaking.
-Let's go.

216
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,254
Be careful.

217
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,632
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

218
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,509
Are you okay?

219
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,178
Should we rest here?

220
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,847
Where should we sit?

221
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,475
-I'm hungry.
-It looks great. I'm so happy.

222
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,895
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

223
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,447
Do you like it?

224
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,409
It's really delicious.

225
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,536
It's really good.

226
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,248
-How was today?
-I had so much fun.

227
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,749
-Was it fun?
-Yes.

228
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,128
I think I'm going to dream
about this tonight.

229
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,131
This? Same here.

230
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,384
It was amazing
when the lights of the castle lit up.

231
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,386
It was so pretty.

232
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
What?

233
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,644
I can't believe it.

234
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,981
We can hear the echo of our voices
in Lotte World Adventure.

235
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,318
-It's nice to have it all to ourselves.
-Yes.

236
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,156
-I'm happy I'm here with you.
-Right.

237
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,993
What?

238
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,620
Why do you keep reacting like that?

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,788
-What?
-You keep doing…

240
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,999
No, I…

241
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,585
There was something on my face.

242
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,173
That kind of reaction is funny, though.

243
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,634
Everything was prepared
just for the two of us,

244
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,721
and I was with someone
I got along with and liked.

245
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,474
It's hard to describe,

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,852
but it was literally a dream date.

247
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,188
You always have to wait more than
two and a half hours

248
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,858
to ride the roller coaster.

249
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,237
But it was so nice to just go up there
and ride it right away.

250
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,530
It was like a dream.

251
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:08,245
Having this whole place to ourselves
is what I would call a dream date.

252
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,039
It was so much fun.

253
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,209
So who will you take on your date?

254
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,087
Come on.

255
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,840
-I'm just teasing you.
-My dream date…

256
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,718
-You can go out on a date.
-Yes.

257
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,138
-This is amazing.
-Yeah.

258
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
I wonder what the other dates will be.

259
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,978
They must have their names
up there already.

260
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,814
-But I bet this one was the best.
-Yeah.

261
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,983
-It was awesome.
-I agree.

262
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,277
It was amazing.

263
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,533
Why doesn't it feel romantic anymore?

264
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,536
I have a lot to say.
I've been watching them carefully.

265
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,540
We talked about how they were
the first ones to hold hands.

266
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,875
They did hold hands,

267
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,796
but Seo-hyeon simply raised her hand
and Sang-won grabbed it.

268
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,298
-You're right.
-He grabbed her hand.

269
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,636
And Sang-won kept saying he was happy

270
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,638
and that he loved their date.

271
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,556
But Seo-hyeon

272
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,310
just seemed happy
about having the park to themselves.

273
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,228
Right.

274
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,563
-I think so too.
-Right?

275
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,772
-It seemed that way.
-Yeah.

276
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,941
She might actually feel uncomfortable now.

277
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,821
Sang-won keeps asking how their date was
and who she will go with on her date.

278
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,322
She may be uncomfortable.

279
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,907
This is really difficult.

280
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,744
Some girls want the guys
to express their feelings,

281
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,788
-but others feel uncomfortable if they do.
-Yeah.

282
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,541
-Right.
-You have to balance it well.

283
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,918
That's what they'll learn over time.

284
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,587
-Right.
-They're new to this.

285
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,838
It comes with experience.

286
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,089
Guys!

287
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,093
-It's 11:59 p.m. Come on.
-It's 11:59 p.m.

288
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,221
Does the other person
have to agree with it?

289
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,139
-Yes.
-Yes.

290
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,350
You have to ask.

291
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,277
-What?
-It's nothing.

292
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,739
Hey!

293
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,782
-It's out.
-Hey!

294
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,870
No way!

295
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,706
DREAM DATES: FULL RENTAL OF A MOVIE
THEATER, HANWOO OMAKASE

296
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:21,420
FULL RENTAL OF A MOVIE THEATER

297
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:26,884
HANWOO OMAKASE

298
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,346
HANWOO OMAKASE

299
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,307
-Omakase? They should pick that!
-Yes!

300
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,767
-Hang on.
-No way.

301
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,560
-Choose that.
-Choose hanwoo omakase.

302
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,729
-But the movie theater…
-What?

303
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,774
-If you go at right time…
-It's like a full rental.

304
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,942
If you go at dawn.

305
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,736
-It has to be the right time.
-Either very early or late.

306
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,030
-The hanwoo looks better.
-You should try it.

307
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,698
That looks delicious!

308
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,659
Ye-rin will probably go for it.

309
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,244
Wait!

310
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,747
Wait!

311
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,804
No, this isn't it.

312
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,808
Omakase?

313
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,604
FULL RENTAL OF A MOVIE THEATER
JEONG SEO-YEONG

314
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
-Who is Seo-yeong going with?
-Right.

315
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,858
Sang-won.

316
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,613
I wanted to get to know Sang-won better.

317
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,200
So I told him I wanted to hang out
with him.

318
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,411
EARLIER TODAY

319
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,037
-So actually…
-Yes?

320
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,582
-I want to go on my next date with you.
-Okay.

321
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,210
-Sure, I'd like that. But…
-Really?

322
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,171
As long as it's not eating hoe, it's fine.

323
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,007
-Really?
-I don't like hoe.

324
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
Anything else is fine.

325
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,177
-Sang-won's busy.
-That's right.

326
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,721
He's running all over the place.

327
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,683
-Today and tomorrow.
-Lotte World Adventure, the movie theater…

328
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,976
He's having so much fun.

329
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,815
I'm so full right now that
I don't feel like eating hanwoo.

330
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,775
No, Jung-yun.

331
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,110
Hanwoo isn't the problem.

332
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,531
-Hanwoo omakase.
-It'll be delicious.

333
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,408
I know, but I'm not hungry.

334
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,828
They'll serve yukhoe and beef sashimi.

335
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,458
-It's kind of disappointing, isn't it?
-Yes.

336
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,294
It's not that great.

337
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,465
Then that's gone for nothing.

338
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,766
I seriously considered
hanwoo omakase date,

339
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,604
but Hee-ji didn't seem
to like it that much.

340
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,023
So I didn't write my name.

341
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,567
If Hee-ji had liked it,

342
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,403
I would have written my name up there.

343
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,074
I wanted to go on a better type of date.

344
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,119
Those were not the kind of dream dates
that I had in mind.

345
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,997
So I wasn't that sad about it.

346
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,209
-It's because they've never tried it.
-They've never tried it.

347
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,502
You'll regret it later.

348
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,629
I guess a meal
isn't a dream date for them.

349
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,381
We all thought the hanwoo omakase
was the best option.

350
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,926
It's because it came
after the theme park date.

351
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,180
Why do you all look tired?

352
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,391
-It's hard to adjust.
-You're crying, you know that?

353
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,977
A tear just fell from your eye.

354
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,733
Ji-min's crying on the outside.
I'm crying on the inside.

355
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,903
-Hey, that's mine. No, you can drink it.
-Here.

356
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,826
-I want some coffee too.
-Copy?

357
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,202
I also heard "copy."

358
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,620
Just drink it.

359
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,747
Just open that one and drink it.

360
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,501
-Should I make you one?
-No, I'm done.

361
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,461
-You can drink it.
-It's fine.

362
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,339
-Where did he go?
-Drink it.

363
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,924
-No, it's…
-We can both drink it.

364
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,384
-Let's talk.
-Okay.

365
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,849
Let's just talk over here.

366
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,021
-Maybe somewhere else?
-That was refreshing.

367
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,023
Want to go to the Room of Truth?

368
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,733
Where's the Room of Truth?

369
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,485
-In the basement.
-Should we go?

370
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,611
-Really?
-I don't mind.

371
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,948
-I'm so tired.
-You should get some sleep.

372
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,284
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.

373
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,828
Careful, you might spill it.

374
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,045
I was trying not to think about it,
but I couldn't help it.

375
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,133
I thought, "If I don't say anything,

376
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,096
she might start liking someone else."

377
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,809
Do you know where you want to go?

378
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,729
-What about you?
-I want nice food.

379
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,691
Let's do some research.
We can go have something nice.

380
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,359
Okay.

381
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,445
Great.

382
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,655
How was your date today?

383
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,993
The sushi was really good,
and to be honest,

384
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:07,748
I wanted to know how Jung-yun felt.
He knows about us. You told him too.

385
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,460
He also saw me and Ji-min
talking a while ago.

386
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
So, I actually

387
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,465
wanted him to feel a bit jealous.

388
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,970
But he didn't really give me
the answer that I wanted.

389
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,808
If somebody likes me,
I'd like them to be more expressive.

390
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,478
But nobody's doing that right now.

391
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,980
You guys say you're interested in me,

392
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,151
but I'm having a hard time believing that.

393
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,070
So I feel confused.

394
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,993
Then who's the one
you like the most right now?

395
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,371
It's Jung-yun, of course.

396
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,708
I also want to get to know
you and Ji-min better,

397
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,419
but I only had romantic feelings
for Jung-yun.

398
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,924
I still feel the same way right now.
I haven't done much with you.

399
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,011
But… Can I be honest?

400
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,848
Frankly, you said
that you're interested in me,

401
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,768
but I can't really tell if that's true.

402
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,521
I was wondering if you said that
because you were drunk.

403
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,023
That's what I was thinking today.

404
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,821
Do you really like me?

405
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,240
Are you actually interested in me?

406
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:31,206
I didn't say that to you
just because I was drunk.

407
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,337
I mustered up the courage
and honestly told you how I feel.

408
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,550
I said this yesterday too,
but I really thought that was admirable.

409
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,054
If I were you,
I wouldn't have said anything,

410
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,348
so I did feel attracted to you
because of that.

411
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,852
Right. But…

412
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,108
I didn't know I'd feel
emotionally exhausted.

413
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,072
Don't be like that.

414
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,326
You should go out on dates
with other girls.

415
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,996
And have fun.

416
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,499
You're telling me to do
what I want to do, right?

417
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,542
Yes.

418
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
That's what I was planning to do.

419
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,589
Then why are you feeling so exhausted?

420
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,090
No, I'm not!

421
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,675
You looked awful.

422
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,930
You were always with Pyeong-seok
on the terrace talking and drinking beer.

423
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,058
You were always talking so seriously.

424
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,478
Then you'd keep quiet
and just go about your day,

425
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,771
then talk to him again.

426
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,023
-Why did you come here then?
-That stings!

427
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,650
Why did you even come here?

428
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,238
If you're having a hard time,
you should do something about it.

429
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,158
If not, just try to have fun.

430
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,911
At this rate, you'll just keep…

431
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,623
I haven't even seen you smile
except when we held hands yesterday.

432
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,792
Just kidding.

433
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,049
-Ji-woo's so cool.
-Wow, Ji-woo.

434
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,259
Just kidding.

435
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,012
Let's just talk like this.

436
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,931
Oh, come on.

437
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,599
Don't be like that.

438
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,730
Then let me ask, how did you feel
when we held hands yesterday?

439
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,691
It made my heart flutter.

440
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,196
And during our dancing class,

441
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,491
we were holding hands the whole time.

442
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,245
It felt really romantic to me.

443
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:39,835
But I ignored that feeling
and tried to forget about it

444
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,796
because I thought
there was no connection between us,

445
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,300
and you didn't seem interested in me.
So I just…

446
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,015
I tried to forget about it
and told myself it didn't mean anything.

447
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,859
Well, if I'm being honest,

448
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,697
when I saw the other girls
on my first day here,

449
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,575
none of them were really my type.

450
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,909
But then…

451
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,788
A few days later,
they said a transfer student is coming.

452
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:21,960
And this tiny girl comes in
with a huge backpack as big as her.

453
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,132
I took one look at you,

454
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,011
and I thought,

455
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,638
-"She's the one."
-Really?

456
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,519
You were staring at me
the whole time, weren't you?

457
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,147
-Yes.
-I kept meeting your eyes.

458
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,481
DURING THE BEAUTY CLASS

459
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,025
Just write down what you see.

460
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,402
If there's only one, just write one.

461
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,614
MIRROR

462
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,964
He winked through the mirror.

463
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,467
I felt it through the mirror.

464
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,638
You looked really pretty in the mirror.

465
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,097
-Really?
-Yes.

466
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,936
-It's kind of…
-Wait.

467
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,521
-This is nice.
-It's hot. Should I open the door?

468
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,565
-No, it's perfect.
-Really?

469
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,150
-The fire's too strong.
-Right?

470
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,611
-Let's remove some logs.
-Good idea.

471
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,196
We should remove some.

472
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,784
I thought you'd wink back at me though.

473
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,327
I'm actually good at winking.

474
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,080
Aren't I?

475
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,831
What?

476
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,210
-Did she just wink at him?
-She did!

477
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm actually good at winking.

478
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,257
Aren't I?

479
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,593
Aren't I good?

480
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,220
Way better than me.

481
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,848
Right? Some people scrunch up
their faces when they try to wink.

482
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:03,728
But I can do it much more naturally.

483
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,484
Why is it so hot?

484
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,777
It's cold!

485
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
-You're cold?
-Go outside.

486
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,281
-My gosh.
-Go get some fresh air.

487
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,913
I can't think straight.

488
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,707
You seem kind of drunk.

489
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,916
-What?
-You seem drunk.

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,001
It's because of you.

491
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:39,014
I wanted Jung-yun to express
his feelings for me.

492
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,515
But he didn't say anything,

493
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,977
even when I gave him the chance to do so.

494
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,232
But Se-yeon asked me
if we could talk privately

495
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,235
and said things
that made my heart flutter.

496
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,905
So I felt really attracted to him.

497
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,659
And for the first time, I talked with him
without thinking about Jung-yun.

498
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,664
After our second serious conversation,

499
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:10,378
I feel that we confirmed
that we had feelings for each other.

500
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,173
You're sleepy, aren't you?

501
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,050
It feels like it's 8 a.m.

502
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,426
-Really?
-Yes.

503
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,763
Then we can talk for 12 more hours.

504
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,473
-No, maybe 16 hours.
-Yes.

505
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,099
I can talk for 24 hours.

506
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,356
Ms. Ji-woo is really honest.

507
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,441
-"Ms. Ji-woo"?
-Oh, right.

508
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,736
-She seems more mature than me.
-You can't think straight right now.

509
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,863
You're right.

510
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,907
Ji-woo is being so honest.

511
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:43,453
It seems like she literally has her
hand in his heart and is controlling it.

512
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,956
-He can't think straight.
-That's accurate.

513
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:54,130
Anyway, Se-yeon's talking with Ji-woo more
and expressing his feelings for her.

514
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,674
I think Jung-yun should watch out.

515
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,759
-Right.
-Yeah.

516
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,638
She wants Jung-yun to express how he
feels, but others keep doing it instead.

517
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,100
I think she might be attracted to him,

518
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,394
but she still seems to like Jung-yun more.

519
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,981
-I won't work out tomorrow.
-Sit.

520
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,608
I'm exhausted.

521
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,069
The hills around here are steep.

522
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,238
What is it?

523
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,155
How do you feel?

524
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,448
-How do I feel?
-Yes.

525
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,616
I like Ji-woo.

526
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,701
-I like Ji-woo.
-Okay.

527
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:29,874
But recently, I am a bit confused.

528
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,627
Why are you confused?
There must be a reason.

529
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,339
I don't know what to do. You know?

530
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,051
Well, I think you should
express yourself more.

531
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,177
Be bolder too.

532
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,805
I just can't do it.

533
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,432
-You have to.
-I have to?

534
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,975
-You should.
-Really?

535
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,101
Right.

536
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,895
From my conversations with Ji-woo so far,

537
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,442
she's still interested in you the most.

538
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,027
-We just talked about that.
-Yeah.

539
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,447
If you don't want her
to fall for someone else,

540
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,532
then you should do something about it.

541
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,118
If you keep this up,

542
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,996
who knows what'll happen?

543
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,542
If there's something you want to say,
just say it.

544
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,212
If you want to tell her something,
then tell her. Please!

545
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,800
I feel frustrated seeing you.

546
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,219
I'm frustrated with myself.

547
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,554
Then do something about it.

548
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,597
Please.

549
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,223
-Yes.
-Please.

550
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,183
I'm frustrated, too.

551
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,100
Please.

552
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,019
Hee-ji…

553
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,315
-Thank you.
-Jung-yun is so hard to figure out.

554
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,609
-Some just can't do it.
-He's never done this before.

555
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,277
-I understand.
-He has to try.

556
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,320
He should try.

557
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,530
I want to go there.

558
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,990
-Where the lights are?
-Yes.

559
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,659
I was talking with the others.

560
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:52,707
They said that whenever we talk about you,
I'm always smiling.

561
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,586
I guess I can't hide my feelings.

562
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,172
It's because of this.

563
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,593
-They're so cute!
-So cute!

564
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,638
They're so romantic.

565
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,139
I love watching them.

566
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,893
It's because of this.

567
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,522
-You can't hide it.
-It's my dimples.

568
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,608
They can't lie.

569
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,949
-What are you thinking about?
-What?

570
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,576
Well, Ye-rin…

571
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,621
asked me out on a date.

572
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,872
-A date?
-Yes.

573
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,791
She said…

574
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,628
that she's suddenly…

575
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,924
interested in me,
but I didn't do anything.

576
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,260
I don't get why she's doing this.

577
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,805
Oh, no. I can't let her find out
how cute you are.

578
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,059
-Well, I can go on a date with her.
-Okay.

579
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,354
But she asked me out on a dream date.

580
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,440
A dream date?

581
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,485
-She asked you out on a dream date?
-Yes.

582
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,654
You guys didn't talk?

583
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,156
We just did.

584
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,703
-But she wants a dream date with you.
-Right.

585
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,454
That sounds…

586
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,540
It's a bit, just…

587
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,459
Yeah…

588
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,301
I didn't see that coming.

589
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,886
Me neither.

590
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,104
Well, have fun tomorrow.

591
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,612
So Pyeong-seok will go on a date
with Ye-rin tomorrow.

592
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,031
I'm not worried
about Pyeong-seok and Hee-ji.

593
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,159
-Right. They seem…
-I'm not worried,

594
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,494
-but you never know.
-Ye-rin is…

595
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,122
-Like Ye-rin and Ji-min. You never know.
-You never know.

596
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,958
What if Ye-rin ties her hair up again?

597
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,046
What if she ties her hair up?

598
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,839
But Ye-rin liked Ji-min…

599
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,217
-But I don't know.
-No one knows.

600
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,303
-I'm not sure.
-Who knows what'll happen?

601
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,471
No one knows.

602
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,475
DAY THREE AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

603
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,324
Seo-yeong, what happened yesterday?

604
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,202
Did you run up to the board
and write your name?

605
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,412
The movie theater date?

606
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,541
Did you run up there immediately?
Or did everyone seem to hesitate?

607
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,919
I was right in front of it
when it appeared.

608
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,213
Amazing.

609
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,803
I want my orange and mango juice.

610
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,638
It's probably gone.

611
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,016
-My orange and mango juice.
-What's that?

612
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,934
You have to be kidding me.

613
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,811
-The Capri Sun?
-Yes.

614
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,271
-Someone drank it.
-Who?

615
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,939
-It wasn't me.
-Who was it?

616
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,066
Probably Jung-yun.

617
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,401
-Who?
-Jung-yun.

618
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,988
Jung-yun? Darn it.
I'm not letting this slide.

619
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,742
I'll show him who's the boss.

620
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,204
Lim Jung-yun!

621
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,956
Lim Jung-yun, what's that?

622
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,541
-Come here.
-A Capri Sun.

623
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,252
-Is it yours?
-She wanted to drink it.

624
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,421
-Oh, it's yours?
-Have you lost your mind?

625
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,380
It was yours?

626
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,174
Have you lost it?

627
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,510
Oh, it was yours.

628
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,224
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes, it was good.

629
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,270
All right then, as long as you enjoyed it.

630
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,356
Seo-hyeon is so cute.

631
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,150
Those two are just friends.

632
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,943
Yeah, close friends.

633
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,407
Mild flavor? Mozzarella cheese?

634
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,663
Seo-yeong!

635
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,794
No way. You can't go out like that.

636
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,880
-Should I stay with you?
-Who told you to dress like that?

637
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,634
I'm going to fall for you.
I've already fallen for you.

638
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,135
Why aren't you wearing blue?

639
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,845
This is my outfit.

640
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,930
-For today?
-Yes.

641
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,393
You all dress up so nicely.
Look at you, Seo-yeong.

642
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,437
You look so pretty.

643
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:12,026
I don't know if Seo-hyeon
was joking or not,

644
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,197
but she kept saying I dressed up nicely.

645
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,951
I kept thinking about that.

646
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,372
I was worried that our relationship
would get affected by that.

647
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,458
So I felt a bit conflicted.

648
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,169
Seo-hyeon, hold on.

649
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,213
-The Room of Truth.
-Why?

650
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,506
Am I getting scolded?

651
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,300
It's my first time in this room.

652
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,468
-Really?
-Yes.

653
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,096
-What?
-It's just funny.

654
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,683
How do you feel about my date today?

655
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,600
A bit…

656
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:45,935
Are you okay?

657
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,396
-Just a bit…
-Yes?

658
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,275
It's the first time I'm feeling this way.

659
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,068
Kind of uneasy.

660
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,028
-Uneasy?
-But you can go.

661
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,073
Have fun today.

662
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,451
I intentionally didn't match with her.

663
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,121
Is that what you were talking about?

664
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,291
I have a sweater in the same blue,
but I didn't wear it.

665
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,168
Is that so?

666
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,797
But Seo-yeong is so pretty.

667
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,301
You look prettier to me.

668
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,723
I… What?

669
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,519
I think I need to train my mind
or something.

670
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,022
Is it weird hearing me
say stuff like that?

671
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,981
Totally!

672
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,232
-Why?
-I'm not used to it.

673
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,860
Even after all the things
I've said to you?

674
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,947
I mean, I've never met a guy like you.

675
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,949
Am I too straightforward?

676
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,744
-Very.
-Is it too much?

677
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,287
No, it's not like that.

678
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,289
It's…

679
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,166
something new to me.

680
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,001
I'll keep it up if you don't mind it.

681
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,465
How about giving me
a break every now and then?

682
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,802
-A break?
-Give me time to take in what you say.

683
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,095
Will it take you long?

684
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,472
-Yes, of course.
-Really?

685
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,266
I'll probably never get used to it.

686
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:15,399
Compared to when we were at school, he's
been expressing his feelings more here.

687
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:20,613
I'm really grateful that he's being honest
about his feelings,

688
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:25,368
but it makes me worry
about how I should react

689
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,536
to his behavior.

690
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,376
I don't know how to react to his words.

691
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,172
She doesn't know how to react.

692
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,298
-Right.
-I get it.

693
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,549
She feels uncomfortable.

694
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,301
Sang-won's going too fast.

695
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,347
He's already fully focused on her,
but Seo-hyeon…

696
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,933
-Right.
-She's not sure yet.

697
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,270
He's going way too fast,
so even if she tries to keep up,

698
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,729
-she's backing out a little.
-Right.

699
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,733
And Seo-hyeon has been wanting
to get to know other guys, too.

700
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,152
-That's right.
-But whatever the case may be,

701
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,904
the other guys may think

702
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,448
that Sang-won and Seo-hyeon
are already a couple

703
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,785
and no one else would try
to approach her now.

704
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:13,040
Seo-hyeon may feel uncomfortable
about others seeing her like that.

705
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,168
-I agree.
-Then she could just tell him

706
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,296
-to slow down or stop.
-Right.

707
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,425
She could ask other guys out on a date,
but she's not doing that.

708
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,844
It seems like
she's not the type to do that.

709
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,845
Maybe.

710
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,430
-It'll be difficult.
-Right.

711
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,974
The others think
they're practically dating,

712
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,727
so she can't really
ask someone else out on a date.

713
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,186
I understand.

714
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,313
This is complicated.

715
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,444
I'll do the dishes.

716
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,242
Eat up.

717
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,719
-I'll rinse them.
-No, it's fine.

718
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,930
-All right.
-Okay.

719
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,984
Come back soon.

720
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,363
I might die of boredom.

721
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,074
Okay.

722
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,206
Okay.

723
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,629
So, I'm going to do my lips now.

724
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,631
Let me do my lips.

725
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,240
-Hey, Pyeong-seok.
-Yes?

726
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,741
How do I look?

727
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,576
Nice.

728
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,412
-Should I wear this?
-Yes.

729
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,039
-Should I wear it or not?
-Go for it.

730
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,250
-The headband. Should I wear it?
-It's pretty.

731
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,543
-Is it?
-Yes, totally.

732
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,086
-Totally?
-Yes, it's perfect.

733
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:23,963
Let's go.

734
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:24,922
Okay.

735
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,049
See you later.

736
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,844
-Have fun.
-Okay.

737
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,346
This headband's so pretty.
Bye guysquirrel.

738
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,432
Won't you be cold?

739
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,685
I don't want to bring a jacket.

740
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,604
-He's jealous.
-Right?

741
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,481
-Totally.
-He's so cute.

742
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,649
He's the jealous type.

743
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,403
It seems like Ji-min's feelings for Ye-rin
have grown a lot.

744
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,320
Right.

745
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:49,947
YE-RIN & PYEONG-SEOK'S DATE

746
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,116
-Is it far?
-The comic book cafe?

747
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,786
When's the last time you've been to one?

748
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,539
Me? Ninth grade.

749
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,458
-Me, too.
-Really?

750
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,710
-My last time was in ninth grade.
-With who?

751
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,044
My friend.

752
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,171
What about you?

753
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,007
-I went with my friend, too.
-Girlfriend?

754
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,550
Just a friend.

755
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,759
-Really?
-Yes.

756
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,389
I wonder what Se-yeon's doing.

757
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,100
-He went to work out.
-He's going on a date today.

758
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,143
Oh, right.

759
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,770
-With Ji-woo.
-Right.

760
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,482
-But I'm here with you.
-I wonder what they'll do.

761
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,365
Those two have been talking a lot lately.

762
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,492
Who?

763
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,452
-Se-yeon and Ji-woo.
-Right.

764
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,539
They were talking a lot yesterday, too.

765
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,252
I wonder what they're up to.

766
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,634
They were being so obvious.
It makes me curious.

767
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,096
But I'm also curious
when you're talking to Hee-ji.

768
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,098
Why am I so curious about everything?

769
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,934
-I'm not usually like this.
-Really?

770
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,362
My accent is pretty strong
because of my dialect, isn't it?

771
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,613
-You?
-Yes.

772
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,990
-I like it though.
-Really?

773
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,784
Yes. Try speaking standard Korean.

774
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,494
-Standard Korean?
-Yes.

775
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,039
-I'm not good at it.
-I'll give you a sentence.

776
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,250
"Where are we going?"

777
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,544
Standard Korean really does sound softer.

778
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,003
Yes, a bit.

779
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,713
"Where are we going?"

780
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,839
Oh, no.

781
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,676
"We're going to a comic book cafe."

782
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,261
-"A comic book cafe."
-Right.

783
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,347
"We're going to a comic book cafe."
I can't do it.

784
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,933
Like this, "We're going
to a comic book cafe."

785
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,688
"We're going to a comic book cafe."

786
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,565
"A comic book cafe."

787
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,945
-This is hard.
-It's hard.

788
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,327
COMIC BOOK CAFE

789
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,667
Look, there's a cat up there.

790
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:13,048
This cat is huge.

791
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,594
-Stop staring at me.
-Why?

792
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,390
I'm scared.

793
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,813
He's so cute!

794
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,649
-I get why Hee-ji thinks he's cute.
-She should see this.

795
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,650
-Right?
-He's cute.

796
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,611
Let's pick a book for each other.

797
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,653
Yeah.

798
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:39,950
I heard that the others
exchanged books before I transferred.

799
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,077
I suddenly remembered that,

800
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,789
so I suggested picking out books
for each other.

801
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,333
I fell asleep during the movie.

802
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,712
-Isn't this a romance comic book?
-Romance is good.

803
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,923
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

804
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,801
Let's exchange. One, two, three.

805
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,054
Here you go.

806
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,181
-Your Name.
-Yes.

807
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,350
YOUR NAME.

808
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,768
Your Name.

809
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,520
Maybe she likes my name?

810
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,194
Q. WHAT BOOK DID YOU PICK FOR YE-RIN?

811
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:20,157
I chose one that had
a similar vibe as Ye-rin.

812
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,495
I think I gave it to her because the girl
on the cover looked like her.

813
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,209
HIRING A FIANCÉ

814
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,126
"Fiancé"?

815
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,003
Let's read it.

816
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,517
-I'm hungry.
-Should we order something?

817
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,896
It looks delicious.

818
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,147
The smell's awesome.

819
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,732
It smells so nice!

820
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,243
Try it.

821
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,787
-Let's eat.
-Yes, let's eat.

822
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,510
-Is it good?
-Yes.

823
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,594
You seem to like it.

824
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,098
What do you talk about with Hee-ji?

825
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,435
First impressions, current impression,
and things like that?

826
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,563
Yeah, we talked about that.

827
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,357
What did you think about me?

828
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,693
Didn't you want to get to know me better?

829
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,320
You looked like a celebrity.

830
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,156
-Really?
-Yeah.

831
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,241
You are tall.

832
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,618
And you looked cool.

833
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,372
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

834
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,962
Which guy did you want to
get close to the most?

835
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,922
Se-yeon.

836
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,760
-When I first saw Se-yeon, I was shocked.
-He's like a doll, right?

837
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,222
Would you date him if you were a girl?

838
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,643
If I were a girl,

839
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,438
I'd date me.

840
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,024
For real.

841
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,861
Who do you like now?

842
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,905
-Me?
-Yes.

843
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,156
Be honest.

844
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,284
I like

845
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,786
-Hee-ji the most.
-Right.

846
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,247
Anyone else?

847
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,416
No one else.

848
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,584
-No one?
-No one.

849
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,714
This is what I'm talking about.

850
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,426
He has his guard up.

851
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,220
-He's so cool.
-Right?

852
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,180
No one else.

853
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,306
-No one?
-No one.

854
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,519
Is this alcohol?

855
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,772
-But…
-Yes?

856
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,276
The girls talk about the guys too, right?

857
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,445
We do.

858
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,533
We always talk about you girls.

859
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,493
Really? You must talk about Hee-ji.

860
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:11,912
Right.

861
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,290
And no one else?

862
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,545
I've talked about you too.

863
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,381
In a good or a bad way?

864
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,133
Just the facts.

865
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,010
-That you asked me out on a date.
-Yeah.

866
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,681
-That I was surprised.
-Right.

867
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,307
Then the guys said,

868
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,059
-"Have fun."
-I see.

869
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,227
What did Se-yeon say?

870
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,186
Se-yeon?

871
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,523
I told Se-yeon…

872
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,236
-about the dream date.
-Why did you do that?

873
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:50,450
But still, things can change.

874
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,664
-So?
-So?

875
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,667
So who is he going to ask?

876
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,752
He's still not sure.

877
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,673
About asking me or Ji-woo or…

878
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,716
I don't know.

879
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,310
What?

880
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,270
You seem pretty concerned.

881
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:24,610
But if Se-yeon uses his dream date
to go out with Ji-woo, then I think…

882
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,072
I'd feel heartbroken.

883
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,491
I mean…

884
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,749
During my date with Ye-rin,

885
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:45,005
whenever I looked at her face,
she seemed so serious and troubled.

886
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:49,343
I thought, "She must be thinking a lot
about Se-yeon."

887
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,972
Who are you going out
on your dream date with? Hee-ji?

888
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,432
Yes, I think so.

889
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,398
We were always together in school too.

890
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,233
-Right.
-We were seatmates.

891
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,029
We never changed seats.
I was always with Jung-yun.

892
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,823
-The entire time.
-That's too bad.

893
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,576
There won't be a next time for that.

894
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,203
-Right.
-That's sad.

895
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,296
-Where is everyone?
-Maybe downstairs?

896
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,258
-It's cold.
-It's so cold.

897
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,468
So cold.

898
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,680
-How was the workout?
-Great. I feel good.

899
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,517
You're eating already?

900
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,604
-Boneless chicken.
-Should we eat some? But…

901
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,692
-Just have some.
-No, I have to eat in an hour and a half.

902
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,403
-Why? Oh, right.
-For dinner.

903
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,449
I need to take a shower.

904
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,119
-You can shower first. You have to go.
-Right.

905
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,756
Here.

906
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,676
-I found another one.
-Okay.

907
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,053
He'll want to talk to her before she goes.

908
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,097
-Right. I wish he does.
-Yeah.

909
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,070
I'm leaving.

910
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,740
-Just talk to her.
-Do it now.

911
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,991
-Do it.
-Talk to her.

912
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,410
I'm leaving.

913
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,204
Bye.

914
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,959
-You're going?
-Bye.

915
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,755
I'll take this upstairs.

916
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,102
Come on!

917
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,606
Just talk for five minutes.

918
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,901
But you can tell from his face
how he feels.

919
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,738
-He has to talk to her.
-He needs to. She wants to hear it.

920
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,752
I had a few opportunities to talk
to Ji-woo before she left for her date,

921
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,546
but I didn't do it on purpose.

922
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,800
I just thought it would…

923
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,220
seem too obvious

924
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:43,266
that I was jealous,
so I tried not to show it.

925
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,521
-You should!
-You have to show it, Jung-yun.

926
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,855
-You should!
-You should.

927
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,901
He's still clueless about this.

928
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,404
You're supposed to show her how you feel.

929
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,366
The timing is important too.
That was the right moment.

930
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,298
He's wearing perfume.

931
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,552
I feel like today's date
is really important.

932
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,803
It is.

933
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:23,807
Se-yeon always keeps his bed
neat and tidy.

934
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,809
-But it's messy today.
-It is.

935
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,396
That says how anxious
he is about his date.

936
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,981
-I think so.
-I'm excited for this.

937
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,110
-Hello.
-Welcome.

938
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,320
JI-WOO & SE-YEON'S DATE

939
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:38,864
Are you hungry?

940
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,409
-Yes, I think I'll really enjoy the food.
-Right?

941
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,704
What kind of workout did you do?

942
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:50,250
Me? I ran a bit…

943
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,878
-Is there a gym nearby?
-Yes.

944
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,214
There are these bands.
You know what they are?

945
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,425
What is that?

946
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,386
Resistance bands for exercising.

947
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,556
Oh, right. You use it like this.

948
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,183
-Right? And what else?
-Well…

949
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,644
-I did many things.
-Sounds like you did.

950
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,313
You were out a long time.

951
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,692
-Didn't I come back quickly?
-No. The food…

952
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,818
-You waited for me?
-Yes.

953
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,278
Oh, really?

954
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,363
Of course I waited to eat together.

955
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,660
What did you eat with Jung-yun yesterday?

956
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,079
Yesterday? We had Japanese food.

957
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,832
-Like an izakaya?
-Yes.

958
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,459
-I see.
-We had Nagasaki champon,

959
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,085
sushi,

960
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,757
and stir-fried beef with bean sprouts.

961
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,344
-Are we here?
-This must be it.

962
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,512
It's really close by.

963
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,520
-This is it, right?
-Let's go.

964
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,981
Thank you.

965
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,490
What else did you do today?

966
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,285
I really didn't do much, but time flew by.

967
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,203
Right?

968
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:12,499
But it seems like everything happens
in the evening at House 20.

969
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,709
-Right, that's when everyone goes out.
-Yes.

970
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,670
That's why we're here.

971
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,297
It's when things happen.

972
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,386
Why do you keep smiling?

973
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,679
What? It's nothing.

974
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,640
It's just funny when you think about it.

975
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,644
-Why are you smiling?
-What?

976
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,728
Why are you smiling?

977
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,855
Same reason as you.

978
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,441
I see.

979
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,452
Where would you like the pasta?

980
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,830
-In the middle.
-Can you just put it here?

981
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,290
It looks delicious. Eat up.

982
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,750
-You too.
-This looks good.

983
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,920
-Here, let me.
-It's okay.

984
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,090
It has scallops too.

985
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,135
-It was shrimp, scallop something.
-Let's eat.

986
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,012
-Thank you.
-Let's just…

987
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,222
-Take it from the dish?
-Yes.

988
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,940
-Isn't it good?
-The scallops are really good.

989
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,693
-This is great.
-This is really delicious.

990
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,821
Is this too big? Should I slice it?

991
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,699
Here, open up.

992
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,038
I like this better too.

993
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,247
Right?

994
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,291
Se-yeon is really bold.

995
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,752
He's bold once he makes up his mind.

996
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,669
Right.

997
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,514
-What are you doing?
-I can see you through the glass.

998
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,558
You're inside my glass.

999
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,192
-You see me?
-Yes.

1000
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,697
This is so good.

1001
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,991
This tastes good. Peppermint tea.

1002
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,786
It smells nice.

1003
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,708
It feels different
being outside like this.

1004
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,626
Right.

1005
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:24,964
Everyone's been asking me what we were
talking about for so long yesterday.

1006
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,132
-The girls?
-Yes.

1007
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,052
They said we talked for two hours.

1008
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,804
What did you say?

1009
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,307
That we were just talking
about meaningless stuff.

1010
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,684
It'd be weird to tell them
all the details.

1011
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,811
"Meaningless stuff"?

1012
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,105
-I mean, I didn't say…
-Meaningless?

1013
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,607
I couldn't tell them
we were winking at each other.

1014
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,150
Why not? You could.

1015
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,155
-All right. I'll tell them next time.
-No.

1016
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,325
-Let's be secretive.
-Okay. Sure.

1017
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,037
-It'll be our secret.
-Yes, our secret.

1018
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,959
What kind of person are you
when you're in a relationship?

1019
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:08,550
When I'm getting to know someone,
I'm pretty cautious and careful.

1020
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,803
I usually don't make it that obvious.

1021
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,558
It's actually pretty hard for me
to show my feelings.

1022
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,519
But I did it with you.

1023
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,896
-You should know.
-I know.

1024
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,148
But back then,

1025
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,026
I had no idea.

1026
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,992
I also talk to guys for a long time
before I start dating them.

1027
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,995
The longest time was more than six months.

1028
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:42,542
It takes me months to open up to someone.

1029
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,129
What are you like when you date someone?

1030
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,046
Me?

1031
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,758
I am a bit cute.

1032
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,096
-You act cute?
-Yes, but not intentionally.

1033
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,850
I just start acting like that
without realizing it.

1034
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,268
So you act cute.

1035
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,729
-Doesn't it seem like I would?
-Not at all…

1036
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,398
-Do you think I'll be mean?
-I'm not sure.

1037
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,109
How cute do you get?

1038
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,403
It drives the guys crazy.

1039
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,155
-Really?
-Yes.

1040
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,033
All right. I'm not sure.

1041
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,369
I'm curious, what's your ideal type?

1042
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,623
Well, I like bright people.

1043
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,461
And someone I can talk to easily
and who shares my sense of humor.

1044
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,382
During my date with Ji-woo,

1045
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,135
it seemed like

1046
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,516
the more I got to know her,
the more I felt she was my ideal type.

1047
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,309
I was really happy.

1048
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,329
-I almost winked at you.
-Me too.

1049
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:05,250
I almost did it without thinking.

1050
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,548
I had fun spending time with Jung-yun,

1051
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,884
but I felt pretty disappointed.

1052
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,470
My date with Se-yeon
made me feel much happier,

1053
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,266
and it felt like a real date.

1054
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,521
Se-yeon seems to like Ji-woo a lot.

1055
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:30,441
He was acting a bit shy in front of her.

1056
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,737
I can see that he likes her a lot,
but I can't tell how Ji-woo feels.

1057
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,449
To me, this is going to be a decision

1058
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,286
between a relationship
where she feels loved

1059
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,746
and a relationship with someone
she likes more.

1060
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,664
You're right.

1061
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,126
I think Ji-woo would prefer to date
a guy she likes more.

1062
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,837
I'm not sure about that.

1063
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,429
You're cute.

1064
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,763
-Me?
-What?

1065
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,432
-Am I cute?
-Yes.

1066
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,893
It's cool how your nostrils flare.

1067
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,687
-It…
-My nostrils?

1068
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,574
My nostrils…

1069
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,951
Did I just flare my nostrils?

1070
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,668
We talked so much today, didn't we?

1071
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,046
-Wasn't it fun?
-Yes.

1072
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,547
-Wasn't it nice?
-It was.

1073
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,967
-Yes, it was so nice.
-It was really nice.

1074
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,013
-It's easy to talk to you.
-You too.

1075
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,059
-Then I'm kind of your ideal type, right?
-What?

1076
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,227
-Someone you can talk to easily.
-Right.

1077
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,896
You're right.

1078
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,024
You are my ideal type.

1079
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,360
-You totally are.
-Really?

1080
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,153
Yes, your looks too.

1081
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,572
Seriously…

1082
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,623
I wonder what the others are doing?

1083
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,097
ONE HOUR LATER

1084
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,181
Are you done?

1085
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,479
Take me home.

1086
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,189
-Why?
-Take me home.

1087
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,694
-You know what's funny though?
-What?

1088
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,240
I feel like they're playing with me.

1089
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,324
Why?

1090
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,790
I mean, then he shouldn't have
made it sound like he liked me.

1091
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,459
It's so mean.

1092
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,630
I just wanted to enjoy my time here.

1093
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,134
-I know.
-But they messed with my feelings and…

1094
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,292
