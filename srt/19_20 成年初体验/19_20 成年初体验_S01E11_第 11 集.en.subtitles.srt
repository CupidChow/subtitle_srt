00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
SE-YEON

2
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,022
JUNG-YUN

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,190
SEO-YEONG

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
SEO-HYEON

00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,528
SANG-WON

00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
HEE-JI

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
JI-MIN

00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,118
YE-RIN

00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,287
JI-WOO

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,456
PYEONG-SEOK

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,638
NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,155
-Ji-min.
-Yes?

13
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,867
Do you think you'll be able to have fun
in Busan with me?

14
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,329
Are you sure?

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,499
Really?

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
If you'll have fun with me in Busan…

17
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,715
Let's go.

18
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,427
Let's go to Busan.

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,224
What's wrong?

20
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,976
-It was so tough.
-What?

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,769
-It was so tough.
-Really?

22
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,523
You sure that we should go to Busan?

23
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,526
I've already decided that I'm going
to go with you.

24
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,236
But I think it'll be tiring.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,738
If you think so,
we can go on another dream date.

26
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,656
Okay.

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,992
How about a casual date
after my graduation?

28
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,285
Should we do that?

29
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,204
We're the Choi and Lee duo, remember?

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,289
-Choi.
-What?

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
-It's lame.
-Choi.

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,833
-Lee, cross.
-Cross.

33
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,503
-It's lame?
-Yes.

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,172
Should we go on the next dream date?

35
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,716
Should we?

36
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,805
-Good job, Ye-rin. Good job.
-Isn't Ji-min cute?

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,181
-He's so cute.
-Yes.

38
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,934
Ji-min is so cute in this episode.

39
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,728
-He's cute.
-Ji-min's so cute.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,105
He gets mad and disappointed easily,

41
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,107
-but he gets over it quickly.
-He does.

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,609
When she comforted him,

43
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,569
-he got over it instantly.
-Instantly.

44
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,196
She asked, "Will you have fun?"
And he just nodded.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,032
-He put his head on her hand.
-Yes.

46
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,116
He wasn't prideful.

47
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,744
-That was so cute.
-Gosh.

48
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,996
Seriously.

49
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,290
This is difficult.

50
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,792
I feel embarrassed about crying.

51
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,837
-It was cute. You looked cute.
-Honestly.

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,881
-She's so cute.
-Yes.

53
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,508
-What about me? Aren't I cute?
-Why did you…

54
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,177
-Why'd you cry? I didn't know.
-I didn't.

55
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,263
Come on. You did. I didn't know you cried.

56
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,556
It was heartbreaking.

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,810
What we're doing here was kind of funny.

58
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,145
This whole situation.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,813
Is that why you cried?

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,899
-I don't know. I felt confused.
-I see.

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,151
Right. All of us…

62
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,988
It's stressful. This is really hard.

63
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,074
I miss my mom,

64
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,284
and my grandma.

65
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,747
I think a real grown-up is someone

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,377
who doesn't get swayed by their emotions
and knows how to hide them.

67
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,297
We're technically 20 years old,

68
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,549
but I think we're still kids.

69
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:27,308
DAY FOUR AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

70
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,969
A lot of things happened that night

71
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,055
that made me more certain
about my feelings.

72
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,683
I got the impression

73
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:13,980
that Ji-woo is more interested
in Jung-yun than me.

74
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,862
Even if Ji-woo doesn't choose me,
I don't want to have any regrets.

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,450
I know it's not easy,
but I'm still going to do my best.

76
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,250
Man…

77
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
Ask her out on a date.

78
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,588
No questions asked. Hurry.

79
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,506
Do it now.

80
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,344
Are you going out?

81
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,721
-What?
-Are you going out?

82
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,264
-Where would I go?
-No, right?

83
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,435
-I think I need to talk to him first.
-To Jung-yun?

84
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,482
I don't know what's on his mind.

85
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,028
-Where is he?
-Jung-yun?

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,280
I should talk to him.

87
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,407
Can we talk?

88
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,325
What?

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,328
-Talk about what?
-I need to ask you something.

90
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,043
What is it?

91
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,046
What is it?

92
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,672
-What is it?
-So…

93
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,925
-What's it about?
-Did you guys talk it out?

94
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:24,842
Yeah.

95
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,096
-What?
-You're going out…

96
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,556
with Ji-woo today, right?

97
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,350
Probably?

98
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,393
Why?

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,865
-Okay.
-What are you going to do?

100
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,784
-I'm going to have yukhoe.
-Here?

101
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,287
I'm going to stay with Seo-yeong.

102
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,790
I'm getting a headache.

103
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,917
-What?
-I mean…

104
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,710
What?

105
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,255
-Come out for a second.
-Okay.

106
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,173
-The weather is nice.
-Okay.

107
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,888
Seriously.
We should just go out together later.

108
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,225
-He doesn't want to go?
-What?

109
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,562
I think he's going out with Ji-woo.

110
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,079
-I need to charge my phone.
-Are you going out today?

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,122
I don't know.

112
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,003
Jung-yun, did you ask her?

113
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,129
No, I couldn't.

114
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,840
-I went down. She's now outside.
-Are you joking me?

115
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,426
I was downstairs. She's already outside.

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
Whatever. I'm rooting for both of you.

117
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,018
I'm on no one's side. I just…

118
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,146
The braver person will…

119
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
We're both wearing cool colors today.

120
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,114
-Is this a cool color?
-Yes.

121
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,365
-I didn't know.
-Really?

122
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
-So?
-So…

123
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,663
What are you doing today?

124
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,665
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

125
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,375
-Are you just staying home?
-Yes.

126
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,046
Why stay home? Let's go out.

127
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,672
-Where?
-What?

128
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,342
-Let's go out.
-To where?

129
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,471
Do you want to go and make perfumes?
How about that?

130
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,388
Why not?

131
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,728
I like Jung-yun and Se-yeon equally.

132
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,773
But if Se-yeon continues to be
more proactive,

133
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,818
I think I'll keep liking him
and feel attracted to him.

134
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,863
Are you going out today?

135
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,657
-Too late.
-What?

136
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,866
You're too late.

137
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,243
-Are you going out?
-Yes.

138
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,329
Well, I'm going to use my dream date
tomorrow anyway.

139
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,122
Come with me.

140
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,959
Okay.

141
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,919
Got it.

142
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,380
Whatever comes up, I'll write my name.

143
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,131
Okay.

144
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,889
It takes me some time

145
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,058
to ask someone out on a date.

146
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,605
But Se-yeon is the type of person
who takes action and asks right away

147
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
whenever he has the chance.

148
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,571
I think that might change Ji-woo's mind.

149
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,991
I'm hungry.

150
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,201
Did you eat anything?

151
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,163
I had ice cream, snacks, and cereal.

152
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,165
I'm not going out today.

153
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,667
-You're not jealous?
-Why not?

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,918
-What?
-Are you not jealous?

155
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,295
-Me?
-Yes.

156
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,797
Well…

157
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,465
Why aren't you going on a date?

158
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,717
Se-yeon and Ji-woo are.

159
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,927
They talked outside while we were talking.

160
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,557
-He beat you to it.
-Wait. You said you were going out.

161
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,603
I said probably. I hadn't asked her yet.

162
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,688
I was going to if she didn't have plans.

163
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,192
But she said she does, so I'm staying.

164
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,988
What?

165
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,783
So Ji-woo and Se-yeon are going on a date?

166
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,701
Yes.

167
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,910
Oh, you?

168
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm fine.

169
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,793
It's okay to be fine. I mean, you can't
stop her from changing her mind.

170
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,545
-It'll change if it was meant to.
-Yeah.

171
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,841
I don't want to try to change anything.

172
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,427
-Even if she changes her mind?
-Even so,

173
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,555
I wouldn't try to change her mind again.

174
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,099
-Really?
-That's what I'd do, no matter who it is.

175
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,393
-Really?
-Once they change their mind…

176
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,311
"Sure. Okay."

177
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,563
-"Sure. Suit yourself."
-Right.

178
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,815
-That's what I'd do.
-I see.

179
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,733
Really?

180
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,153
-I wouldn't do anything after that.
-I get it.

181
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,947
You don't want to get
to know someone else?

182
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,157
I'm not sure.

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,533
He wouldn't know now.

184
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,077
We don't have much time left.

185
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,998
He sounds very certain.

186
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,210
That's why he's very careful
about giving his heart to someone.

187
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,169
He's cautious.

188
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,172
I think he might turn very cold
if he stops liking someone.

189
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,299
That's why this is an important time.

190
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,052
Ji-woo shouldn't be getting
too comfortable.

191
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,012
She shouldn't just say, "You're late."

192
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,014
-It might be Ji-woo who's late.
-Right.

193
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,686
Are you going for a drive?

194
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,231
Pyeong-seok's the only one who can drive.

195
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,984
I should've got my driver's license.
I was planning to before coming here.

196
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,112
Gosh.

197
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,489
-Hey, Pyeong-seok!
-Kim Pyeong-seok.

198
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey, it's all good,
just don't come back injured.

199
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,536
Don't come back with an injury.

200
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,247
-I'll be careful.
-Have you driven before?

201
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,665
How often do you drive?

202
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,834
-Been driving for six months.
-Six months?

203
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,168
I drive for my work.

204
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,129
You do? Really?

205
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,676
I bet Hee-ji will fall for Pyeong-seok
big time today.

206
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,346
-Oh, my goodness.
-Are you going to do this?

207
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,267
He's already prepared.

208
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,271
I should've got mine too.

209
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,314
You have a Class 1 license, right?

210
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,649
Yes.

211
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,320
Going on a drive
in the evening is the best, though.

212
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,573
-When's your birthday?
-In May.

213
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,200
-May 7th.
-Yes.

214
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:30,541
Pyeong-seok is the only person
who can drive among us.

215
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,670
I was excited to go for a drive,
just the two of us.

216
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,047
PYEONG-SEOK & HEE-JI'S DATE

217
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:37,965
Let's go.

218
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,634
The weather's nice.

219
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,267
Let's go.

220
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,936
Let's go.

221
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,023
-Cute.
-It's cute.

222
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,988
Let me put on my glasses.

223
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,283
Sunglasses would have been better.

224
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,576
Oh, right, sunglasses.

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,537
-Done. Are you ready?
-Yes.

226
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,249
Let's go.

227
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,423
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

228
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,842
Speed bump ahead.

229
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,261
Why is it so cheerful?

230
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,347
I chose a cute voice on purpose.

231
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,934
Turn right toward Pyeongchang Naru.

232
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,938
How's my car? Isn't it cute?

233
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,022
It's adorable.

234
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,651
This is cool.

235
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,236
What is?

236
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,530
Going on a date like this.

237
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,949
I think so too.

238
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,410
When else would I have a girl in my car?

239
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,623
-The weather is so nice.
-Yeah.

240
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,166
It's so clear.

241
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,254
Enter the city expressway 17 meters ahead.

242
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,255
Okay.

243
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,807
Pyeong-seok is driving.

244
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm going to brag about this.

245
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,277
I never thought that I would be here
riding your car like this.

246
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,194
Same.

247
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,491
I watched Pyeong-seok
while he was driving.

248
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,953
He was so good at driving,
not awkward at all.

249
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,747
I saw him in a different light.

250
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,669
Guri Service Area
roughly 500 meters ahead.

251
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,963
I want manju.

252
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,007
-Yangju?
-Manju.

253
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,593
-"Manjoo"?
-Manju.

254
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,844
-"Manju"?
-Yes.

255
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,555
-You don't know manju?
-I only know mandu.

256
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,058
Manju?

257
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,686
-Manju.
-Tell me what that is, would you?

258
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,731
-What is that?
-"Would you?"

259
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,235
Want to stop on the way back?

260
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,448
Okay.

261
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,284
Relax.

262
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,787
-You can sleep if you want.
-I'm not sleepy.

263
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,749
-Go ahead, sleep.
-I'm not tired.

264
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,709
Then don't sleep.

265
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm not going to.

266
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,341
Tunnel ahead.

267
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,770
You should get some sleep
on the way back, okay?

268
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,271
Being in a car is just…

269
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:45,235
A lot happened yesterday.

270
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,280
I was too tired to keep my eyes open.

271
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,990
Hee-ji was busy.

272
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,951
-The peacemaker.
-She was busy.

273
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,494
Busy keeping the peace.

274
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,040
We're here.

275
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,209
We've arrived.

276
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,336
Stop.

277
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,881
We're here.

278
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,549
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

279
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,678
Let's go.

280
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,850
It's so pretty.

281
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,855
It's so pretty.

282
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,066
This view is crazy.

283
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,736
It's really pretty.

284
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,864
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

285
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,661
Nice.

286
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,247
It's slippery.

287
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,085
Hey, you almost fell.

288
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,504
They're linking arms.

289
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,839
They look great together.

290
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,924
-That was so smooth.
-So romantic.

291
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,551
-That's crazy.
-Oh, my.

292
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:51,969
It's slippery.

293
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,473
Hey, you almost fell.

294
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,143
That was so close.

295
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,312
I thought I was going to slip.

296
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,648
Crazy.

297
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,733
-Awesome.
-So nice.

298
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,693
This is awesome.

299
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,197
I mean, the only thing I can say is "Wow."

300
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,826
-I'll take a picture of you.
-Okay.

301
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,286
Stand there.

302
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,374
This is awesome.

303
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,343
I'll rotate around you.

304
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,554
-It's so pretty.
-Isn't it?

305
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,725
-No Easy.
-No Easy.

306
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,686
No Easy.

307
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,202
I feel so awkward.

308
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,204
You look pretty.

309
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,666
It's so pretty here.

310
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,211
They're basically…

311
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,128
What was that?

312
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,464
What's going on?

313
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,757
That was so smooth.

314
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,008
-What was that?
-Good job.

315
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
That was so smooth, right?

316
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,429
It's so pretty here.

317
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,390
-That looks pink.
-Yes.

318
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,105
It's really pretty.

319
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,023
I've got to take one more.

320
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,068
It's so pretty.

321
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,625
Do you want to make a heart?

322
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,793
A heart? Which one?

323
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,135
Is that right?

324
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,095
You're twisting your arm.

325
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,012
Here we go.

326
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,688
-It's nice.
-Perfect.

327
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,106
Yeah.

328
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,067
This is as good as the amusement park.

329
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,944
I couldn't be happier.

330
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,990
It's so nice here.

331
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,201
I'll miss this.

332
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,373
It makes me happy.
Why does it make me happy?

333
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,292
I want a compilation of those two.

334
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,128
Every gesture and every move they make
is so romantic.

335
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,673
I think they're already in a relationship.

336
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,550
They kept it a secret.

337
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,011
You guys are watching this
and laughing, aren't you?

338
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
-They're like, "Those idiots."
-Guys.

339
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,765
-They kept it a secret.
-Where are you watching this?

340
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,768
-They're watching together.
-Yes. They kept it a secret.

341
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,605
Wait, you have a dressing room, right?

342
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,522
Yes.

343
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,650
Come on. Let's wear matching clothes.

344
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,195
Let's take a look.

345
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,365
-I'll pick some outfits and try them on.
-Picture how I'm dressed.

346
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,742
-I'm wearing this.
-Okay.

347
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,286
You look nice.

348
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,082
-What?
-Wait here.

349
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,002
These and…

350
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,130
What should I wear?

351
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,176
Let me check. It's okay.

352
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,345
-These pants.
-Do you like this color?

353
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,971
Does it look good?

354
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,474
-It's the same color.
-Nice, right? This and…

355
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,892
What should I wear on top?

356
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,810
Not that.

357
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,563
This would look good on me.

358
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,898
How's this? These two.

359
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,525
-I like that too.
-So, these two?

360
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,611
-Sure, why not?
-Let's go with them.

361
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,156
Get out.

362
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,076
-What are you doing?
-Okay. I'll stay here.

363
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,744
-Get out.
-Okay.

364
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,207
Hey. Don't.

365
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,918
-Don't do it.
-Okay.

366
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,921
Come take a look.

367
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,841
-So? Do you like it?
-Yes.

368
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,219
-Isn't it nice?
-I'm not sure if they match.

369
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,303
Me neither.

370
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,639
-Honestly, I'm not sure if they match.
-Right.

371
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,433
-Not bad,
-Yeah, not bad.

372
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,143
Let's go.

373
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,355
Let's go.

374
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,943
JI-MIN & YE-RIN'S DATE

375
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,486
Let's go.

376
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,906
This is our second date, right?

377
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,824
Yes.

378
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,327
-This is going to be fun.
-So much fun.

379
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,499
Get in.

380
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,584
-Hello.
-Hello.

381
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,713
-We're leaving now.
-Okay.

382
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,630
Okay.

383
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,009
Bam! Give me a mint.

384
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,262
-Give me a mint.
-Finally, it's useful.

385
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,847
JI-MIN & YE-RIN'S FIRST DATE

386
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,181
You said you like mints?

387
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,350
What's your favorite flavor?

388
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,476
I like peach.

389
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
-Me too.
-I never tried this flavor before.

390
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,106
Here.

391
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,650
-I think you like these mints.
-Yes.

392
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,194
Peach and mint.

393
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,612
-Peach is the best.
-Yes.

394
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,406
It's the best.

395
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,744
We have three days left.

396
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,246
I know. We don't have a lot of time left.

397
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,043
I think it's all settled now
after last night's drama. Right?

398
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,087
It was a disaster yesterday.

399
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,550
Seriously, I really wanted to leave.

400
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,927
I wanted to leave too.

401
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,095
-Really.
-Right?

402
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,266
I just wanted to say,
"Let's never meet again. Bye"

403
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,522
You're getting emotional thinking
about it. Let's sleep.

404
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,025
We should get some sleep.

405
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,818
Let's sleep.

406
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,239
Oh, right, Ji-min.

407
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,992
What did you and Seo-yeong talk about?

408
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,910
With Seo-yeong?

409
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,790
-I said I was sorry.
-That's all?

410
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,209
-Yes.
-To be honest,

411
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,879
I've been a bit aloof to you lately.

412
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,465
I thought it'd be better
to set the boundary

413
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,676
rather than being uncertain.

414
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,805
So I just want to say that I'm sorry.

415
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,269
I don't regret having feelings for you.

416
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,938
-Really?
-Yes.

417
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,983
Just know that I don't regret anything.

418
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,737
-Thank you for saying that.
-Sure.

419
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,407
Things are so messy right now.

420
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,410
I thought it's best to sort it out
with everyone, one by one.

421
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,789
That way, I'll have no regrets.

422
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,625
Do you like it when people do this?

423
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,669
I'll do it.

424
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,964
Do you want a mint?

425
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,091
You have one in your mouth.

426
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,221
POOL CLUB

427
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,264
Are you good at pool?

428
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,558
-Similar to bowling.
-Bowling?

429
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,060
How do you do this?

430
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,895
This one.

431
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,313
First, chalk the cue.

432
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,940
I played it only once before.

433
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,484
-You have to break from here, right?
-Yeah.

434
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,155
I don't know how to play pool.
How do you play?

435
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,072
Let me try this.

436
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,368
I only played once.
I played billiards twice before.

437
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,956
Whichever goes in is mine, right?
If nothing goes in…

438
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,958
What do I do? This one.

439
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,835
Come on. Hit it.

440
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,006
If you pocket the black one, you lose.

441
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,967
-That was close.
-I'll take it.

442
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,725
Thank you very much.

443
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,187
-Is this how you play?
-I'm afraid we won't pocket any balls.

444
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,980
I'm afraid we won't.

445
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,902
It seems Ji-min doesn't have
any experience playing pool.

446
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,112
But what matters
is spending time together.

447
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,657
Being good at something isn't the point.

448
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,536
So Ji-min and I had a lot of fun playing.

449
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,414
-Yes.
-Then let's grant

450
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,541
the winner a wish.

451
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,169
Grant the winner a wish?
That's intense. Sure.

452
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,843
That went straight in.

453
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,696
I guess you had it all planned out.

454
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,492
I think I got it now.

455
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,745
You can do it.

456
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,792
It's cool to see it from here.

457
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,878
-What should my wish be?
-Show me what you've got.

458
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,506
Let's go.

459
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,932
BLACK BALL

460
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,529
That's a cool defeat.

461
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,905
-He lost.
-He learned a skill.

462
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,073
He lost but did well.

463
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,908
That was amazing.

464
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,994
You can't do it even if you want to.

465
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,082
Wait. I need a minute to think.

466
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,378
-Ji-min.
-How did I lose like that? Seriously.

467
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,338
Why did you…

468
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,298
Darn it.

469
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,174
Why won't that go in?

470
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,969
Come on. What?

471
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,014
Go in!

472
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,933
This is so annoying.

473
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,519
Why can't I get it?

474
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,525
Stop. You need to stop, please.

475
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,861
Oh, my gosh. My face hurts.

476
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,323
-I admit my defeat.
-Okay, I won.

477
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,283
I'll keep the wish for later. Okay?

478
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,410
Okay. Think about it during the meal.

479
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,078
Let's go eat.

480
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,914
It's a typical date.

481
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,167
-I can finally breathe.
-I feel at ease now.

482
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,087
-Although they had some issues yesterday,
-Right.

483
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,548
they got over it and went on a date.

484
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,549
They're laughing.

485
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,217
They've become even closer now.

486
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,552
-They look so happy.
-Yes.

487
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:23,350
Compared to the first date, they're now
laughing and enjoying like a real couple.

488
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,768
I keep getting this feeling…

489
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,771
Ye-rin can make a wish, right?

490
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,688
Yes.

491
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,150
-So?
-What if she makes him use his dream date?

492
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,778
-She wouldn't.
-Come on.

493
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,821
-"Let's use yours."
-"Use yours."

494
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,365
Guys, that doesn't matter.

495
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,366
Right.

496
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,870
SE-YEON & JI-WOO'S DATE

497
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,790
PERFUME STUDIO

498
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,960
Are you making your own perfume
or one for each other?

499
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,253
Have you thought about it?

500
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,547
-What do you think?
-For each other.

501
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,132
-One for each other.
-Okay then.

502
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,928
Pick your favorite and let me know.

503
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,846
-Then we'll go from there.
-Okay.

504
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,482
It smells like flowers.

505
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,860
-Yes.
-Right? It smells like roses.

506
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,030
Gentle?

507
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,534
-It smells masculine.
-Yes.

508
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,296
-This smells nice.
-I'm so curious.

509
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,427
Why don't you spray it on each other now?

510
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,553
Sounds good.

511
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,305
Spray it here. A bit more.

512
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,443
The sillage will smell better.

513
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,070
-After two weeks, it'll smell even better.
-Right.

514
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,242
-The more I smell it, the more I like it.
-That's what I was thinking.

515
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,494
-This was a good idea.
-I like it.

516
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,706
I'll use this every day except
when I have practice.

517
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,790
Really?

518
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,085
You should smell it a lot here.
That's how scents work.

519
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,045
-When you smell something,
-Yes.

520
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,425
it reminds you of what you did,
where you did it,

521
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,843
-and with whom.
-Right.

522
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,847
-I'll remember every time I use it.
-It should remind you every time.

523
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,643
Okay. Got it. I'll remember.

524
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,482
The more time we spend together,

525
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,527
the more my feelings for Ji-woo grow.

526
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,948
When we reached the perfume studio
and got off the taxi,

527
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,367
Ji-woo's shoelace was untied.

528
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,914
Thank you.

529
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,375
-If the other one gets undone, I'll do it.
-Okay.

530
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,546
-You're good at it.
-That will never get undone.

531
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,924
In that short moment, my heart fluttered.

532
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,635
It was fun. I enjoyed it.

533
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,097
I can still smell it.

534
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,934
If you spray it here,
the smell comes around.

535
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,356
That was fun.

536
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,442
-More than I expected.
-Right.

537
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,197
It feels like the end is nearing.

538
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,281
-Right now?
-Yes.

539
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,869
After today, we only have two days left
to go on dates and live at the house.

540
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,329
Really?

541
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,546
Do you think anybody
has made up their mind?

542
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,297
Ji-min.

543
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,882
Me.

544
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,554
Really?

545
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,101
I realized how much Se-yeon is into me,

546
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,104
but I still have feelings for Jung-yun.

547
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,606
Every time Se-yeon
expresses his feelings for me,

548
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,608
I feel conflicted.

549
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,743
CLIMBING GYM

550
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,328
That's it.

551
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,497
What do I step on?

552
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,457
-Bring your foot up.
-The white one.

553
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,709
Carefully.

554
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,751
You can do it.

555
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,169
-That's it.
-You can do it.

556
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,796
-Good job.
-Oh, gosh.

557
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,882
-Good job.
-That looks so hard.

558
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,925
You did it.

559
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,595
Good. Good job. You want to try?

560
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,638
Should I try blue?

561
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,558
-Why don't you try yellow first?
-Should I?

562
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,559
Yellow it is.

563
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,394
-I'll show you.
-Let's see.

564
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,437
I'll show you.

565
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,063
Be careful.

566
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,649
-The yellow one.
-Is this yellow?

567
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,825
-What's she doing?
-She's hanging from it.

568
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,161
-What do I do?
-That one.

569
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,370
I can't do it!

570
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,581
Try moving your left foot up.

571
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,832
Move your left foot up.

572
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,042
-Where?
-Here.

573
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,836
Under the gray one. Isn't that orange?

574
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,504
What is she going to do?

575
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,256
You can come down.

576
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,759
-Hey, come down.
-Get down.

577
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,969
-Get her down.
-Just jump.

578
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,596
Find your footing and come down.

579
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,932
Be careful.

580
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,100
-Do you want to try again?
-No.

581
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,020
-Come here.
-No?

582
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,980
Are you joking me?

583
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,150
-If only I had longer arms.
-Are you okay?

584
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,693
If only I had longer arms.

585
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,990
Why are my forearm muscles shaking?

586
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,618
You got a muscle pump.

587
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,204
What the heck?

588
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
-He got a muscle pump.
-Yeah.

589
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,085
-My forearm muscles are going to burst.
-My palms are going to burst.

590
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,212
Climb the wall.

591
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,631
That's a tough spot.

592
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,511
-Gosh.
-Let me try.

593
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,929
I feel like I could do it.

594
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,639
I just need a couple more tries.

595
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,516
Come on, muscle boy.

596
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,479
No.

597
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,190
Jung-yun, change your feet there.
Keep going.

598
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,072
Jung-yun is pretty good.

599
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,494
How does he hold on?

600
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,621
-Good.
-Oh, right.

601
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,539
Good.

602
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,166
Oh, that's a first.

603
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,003
You got it. Put your right foot there.

604
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,046
Move your right foot. Right foot first.

605
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,467
-I don't know what to do now.
-Put your right foot there.

606
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,263
My legs are shaking.

607
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,141
-That looks so hard.
-Oh, my gosh.

608
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,894
-You got it!
-You did it!

609
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,855
You did it.

610
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,357
He's pretty good.

611
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,361
-Gosh, I'm tired.
-That was awesome.

612
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,405
-My legs are shaking so bad.
-That was so cool.

613
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,451
Sang-won did his best.

614
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,122
But for some reason,
I couldn't take my eyes off Jung-yun.

615
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:07,795
After climbing, his arms were crazy.
It was amazing.

616
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,594
So, Seo-yeong has her eye on Sang-won,
Sang-won on Seo-hyeon,

617
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,012
and Seo-hyeon on Jung-yun.

618
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,139
And Jung-yun has his eye on Ji-woo.

619
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,101
-What would you call this?
-It's complicated. Many people involved.

620
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,229
Anyway, Seo-hyeon knows
how Jung-yun feels.

621
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,399
-Right.
-She knows what's going on.

622
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,069
Would she still approach him
despite all the pressure?

623
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,904
-She wouldn't.
-No.

624
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,782
Considering what she's like,
she won't approach him.

625
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,408
Let's eat.

626
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,785
Let's eat.

627
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,411
STEAMED DISH & SHABU-SHABU RESTAURANT

628
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,663
What would you like?

629
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,252
Two servings
of the Iberico pork shabu-shabu.

630
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,463
We're ready to order.

631
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,634
Already?

632
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,011
Excuse me.

633
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,263
These are the vegetables
for the shabu-shabu.

634
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,181
Thank you.

635
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,725
What?

636
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,186
-She's tying up her hair.
-She is.

637
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,270
Ye-rin.

638
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,065
These are the vegetables
for the shabu-shabu.

639
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:09,982
Thank you.

640
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,571
He saw her.

641
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,949
-There he goes.
-He's sneaking a peek.

642
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,243
-He saw her.
-Why is he closing his eyes?

643
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,495
That's so cute.

644
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,091
This is my first time eating shabu-shabu.

645
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,553
-What?
-This is my first shabu-shabu.

646
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,971
-Me too.
-You too?

647
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,224
It looks deliciousquirrel.

648
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,853
You love saying that.

649
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,231
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

650
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,650
-Thank you.
-When the vegetables start to boil,

651
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,236
you can cut the meat and add it.

652
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,362
-Okay.
-Okay.

653
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,323
-Choi.
-Lee.

654
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,283
-Cross.
-Cross.

655
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,327
-Good teamwork.
-We got it right.

656
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,872
I like it.

657
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,457
When I say Choi,
you have to say Lee right away.

658
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,917
-Lee.
-Choi.

659
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,043
-Cross.
-Cross.

660
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,632
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

661
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,892
Let's eat.

662
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,353
Shabu-shabu is a perfect food for a diet.

663
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,105
-Really?
-Yes.

664
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,775
When my cheeks look fat,
I stop eating immediately.

665
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,614
-I go on a diet right away.
-Fat cheeks? How can you tell?

666
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,284
I can tell when I struggle to smile.

667
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,454
What?

668
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,540
My cheeks prevent me from smiling.

669
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,626
They stop my lips from moving up.

670
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,881
That's so cute.

671
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,259
You shouldn't go on a diet.

672
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,220
-Do I look good right now?
-Yes.

673
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,306
-I'll keep them like that.
-They look squishy.

674
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,228
-Shall we add the meat?
-It's boiling. You can add it.

675
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,146
I was told to do it like this.

676
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,607
No, look.

677
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,276
-I saw someone doing this with chopsticks.
-Like so.

678
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,070
-I saw someone doing this with chopsticks.
-Like so.

679
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,030
-Yeah, exactly.
-And then you add it.

680
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,740
How did you do it?

681
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,825
Grab it by the end.

682
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,577
-By the end and spin it?
-Spin it.

683
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,997
Yes, you got it.

684
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,209
-I think I'm good at it.
-Maybe.

685
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,504
I think it's ready.

686
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,632
My first shabu-shabu experience.

687
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,680
Enjoy.

688
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,725
This is really good.

689
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,185
-Is it good?
-Yes.

690
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,402
I just want to play with it.

691
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,706
It's nice to be out.

692
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,748
Right?

693
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,585
-I feel relaxed when I'm with you.
-Same.

694
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,755
It feels comfortable.

695
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,718
I'm excited about living in the house now.

696
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,053
-I don't want it to end.
-It'll be fun, right?

697
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,179
I think it'll be fun.

698
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,098
-Yeah.
-I can just hang out with you.

699
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,523
You make my time at House 20
more enjoyable.

700
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,358
Let's just live there.

701
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,112
-Sure.
-Let's hide when everyone leaves.

702
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,155
Okay.

703
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,537
What?

704
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,414
Eat.

705
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,502
That reminds me.
What do you want for your wish?

706
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,420
What?

707
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,798
We said the winner at pool
would be granted one wish.

708
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,924
Oh, my wish?

709
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,927
Right. You lost.

710
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,095
I'll grant your wish.

711
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,558
-I hope I was wrong.
-No way.

712
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,895
-I…
-Yes?

713
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,317
I'm not asking for much.

714
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,904
The dream date.

715
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,615
Let me use mine.

716
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,748
-She's really cool!
-Yes. That's so cool.

717
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,292
I was wrong to think that.

718
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,877
Right.

719
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,504
Don't be like that, Kyuhyun.

720
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,005
-I thought the same.
-Really?

721
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,840
It's understandable from what we saw.

722
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,092
-Is it?
-So far.

723
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,136
-That's true.
-We witnessed a lot of emotions.

724
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,472
-We were confused too.
-That was so cool.

725
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,474
The dream date.

726
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,893
Let me use mine.

727
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,313
-Is that your wish?
-Yes.

728
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,315
Really?

729
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,945
But it will be what I want.
What do you say?

730
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,072
Sure.

731
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,243
What do you think? Am I cool?

732
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,160
Yes.

733
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,621
We should really go.

734
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,915
We should.

735
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,376
-I can't wait.
-It's a bummer.

736
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,293
What is?

737
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,254
I wish I could go again with
the same person.

738
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,213
Right.

739
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,509
-We can both use our dates.
-But you can't use it on anyone else now.

740
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,219
-Okay?
-I won't.

741
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,849
I'm getting so excited.

742
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,643
-Because you have a date now.
-Yes.

743
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,521
No regrets?

744
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,482
Never. I don't do anything
I'll regret later.

745
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,863
Ji-min made me feel secure
and gave me trust.

746
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,533
So I wanted to give him my heart.

747
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:58,706
I think Ji-min changed me,
and I see Ji-min changing because of me.

748
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,004
We were able to confirm that we like
each other. And we built up trust.

749
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,422
For both of us…

750
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,218
This date made us want
to be in a relationship.

751
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,432
-It smells good.
-It smells so good.

752
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,976
I AM THE PORK BELLY OF JOSEON

753
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,313
I wonder what everyone else is eating.

754
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,733
-There's nothing like pork belly.
-Nothing can beat pork belly.

755
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,779
What would they eat?
I wonder how the climbing went.

756
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,452
The boys probably took it too seriously.

757
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,497
I'm sure they did.
Who went climbing? Sang-won and Jung-yun?

758
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,081
Jung-yun. Sang-won and Jung-yun.

759
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,794
-Seo-hyeon said she's good at it.
-Seo-hyeon will like it.

760
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,716
Do you like wraps?

761
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,052
No, I'm too lazy.

762
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,929
-Me too. Too lazy to make it.
-Yes.

763
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,138
My hands get messy.

764
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,640
-Right, from the water.
-Yes.

765
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,644
-No way.
-Oh, my gosh.

766
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,103
Awesome.

767
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,441
-Soybean paste stew. Smells good.
-I'll put it here.

768
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,110
-Oh, you put it here.
-Kimchi.

769
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,154
It's so…

770
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,490
-Seriously.
-Enjoy.

771
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,616
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

772
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,245
-Now, kimchi.
-That looks so good.

773
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,333
-I wish we could hear more sizzling.
-We need more oil.

774
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,673
You should eat three pieces at a time.

775
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,217
Try it.

776
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,386
Oh, my.

777
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,471
-You're so sweet.
-Eat.

778
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,390
Wait.

779
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,727
Hang on. Try it with this.

780
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,645
No way.

781
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,819
-Good, right?
-Yes.

782
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,534
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

783
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,828
The best I've had since I got here.

784
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,745
-Really?
-Yes.

785
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,582
I can tell from the look on your face.

786
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,792
-Have one more.
-Eat. I'll give you one.

787
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,210
What?

788
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,638
You're going to cry because it's so good.

789
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
Isn't it amazing?

790
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,400
I'll cook it faster.

791
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,985
-It's so good.
-You should eat.

792
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,403
-Eat.
-Don't just serve me.

793
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,696
You should eat too.

794
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,574
-It's so good.
-Right?

795
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,455
-Should I take over?
-No, it's fine.

796
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,290
Just enjoy it.

797
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,167
Okay.

798
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,133
-That looks good.
-Look at this.

799
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,761
-Ready?
-Yes.

800
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,015
This is only a mouthful.
I made it small. Open your mouth.

801
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,526
You're eating so well.

802
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:23,702
We said we were too lazy to make wraps,
but he kept making wraps for me.

803
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,580
I thought that was so caring.

804
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,083
I became more fond of Se-yeon.

805
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,669
Yet I couldn't stop thinking
about Jung-yun.

806
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:38,133
I really like Se-yeon,
but I miss Jung-yun.

807
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,805
I wish I had more time to see
Jung-yun's new attitude,

808
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,725
but if my feelings for Se-yeon
keep growing, that might not happen.

809
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,645
I had a lot on my mind
compared to the first date.

810
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,732
-She has mixed feelings.
-She cares about Jung-yun.

811
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,276
The fact that she's conflicted

812
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,362
-means she likes Jung-yun more.
-Exactly.

813
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,072
She can't stop thinking about Jung-yun.

814
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,448
She's not aware of it.

815
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,535
Let's come back for some pork jowl.

816
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,537
Sure.

817
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,206
I'll tell everyone about it.

818
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,834
-That you had pork belly?
-Yes.

819
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,130
-I wonder what they had.
-I'm really curious as well.

820
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,590
Climbing?

821
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,433
I'm good at reading the room.

822
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,312
When we were on our date,
from the beginning until the end,

823
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:38,610
I could tell that Ji-woo
was still thinking about Jung-yun.

824
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,821
When I talked to her,

825
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,408
I could feel it.

826
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,336
We only have two more days left
to go on a date.

827
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,048
I think I'll go…

828
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,594
on a date with Jung-yun tomorrow.

829
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,849
He said he'll write his name
for the dream date, whatever it is.

830
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,142
For you?

831
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,061
You should go with him.

832
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:18,192
You should go on a date
with him tomorrow. And on the last day,

833
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,776
you should go on a date with me.

834
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,404
What? I haven't used my dream date yet.

835
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,614
Oh, you're right.

836
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,575
What do you think?

837
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,785
-Isn't it perfect?
-Kind of.

838
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,830
-Kind of?
-Kind of.

839
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,790
Kind of.

840
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,336
It looks good.

841
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,255
-Hello.
-Hello.

842
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,466
Hello.

843
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:46,845
Thank you.

844
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,765
My hands hurt. Do yours?

845
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,351
-I think I'll get blisters.
-I got a callus.

846
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,812
-Been a while since I got one.
-My hands are red.

847
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,439
My hands were shaking like this.

848
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,859
-Your legs too.
-It was funny to see your legs shaking.

849
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,947
-Do you boys talk about that stuff too?
-Of course.

850
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,573
In depth?

851
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,659
-Yeah.
-We have so much to talk about.

852
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,327
-We never stop talking.
-Really?

853
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,662
We get so emotional.

854
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,792
-Do you take turns to talk?
-That's what we did at school.

855
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,086
-We took turns.
-Like a presentation.

856
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,130
It's like a presentation,
"I like this girl."

857
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,219
-Really?
-But you see, it's very important

858
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,054
to talk to others.

859
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:29,972
Right.

860
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,890
-We need that.
-We really do.

861
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:36,728
After Seo-hyeon talked to me,
she said she knew what she wanted.

862
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,438
-You did?
-Yes.

863
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,525
That's what's nice about it.

864
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,611
Thanks to that, somebody was able
make up their mind.

865
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,615
But there was somebody who became
more conflicted after talking.

866
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,287
I think you might be the one
who was able to make up their mind.

867
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,872
What?

868
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,544
That's not what I meant.
I mean like, "Now I know this was this."

869
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,296
-Right.
-That's what I meant.

870
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,799
"This is how I felt at the time."
You're the only one who settled that.

871
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,802
-That makes sense.
-Yes.

872
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,847
"That makes sense"?
You're talking about yourself.

873
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,808
-I know.
-I'm saying it makes sense.

874
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,939
Something felt off with Seo-hyeon
during the date.

875
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,399
She was acting…

876
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,402
somewhat cold.

877
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,780
She was treating me
in a different way compared to before.

878
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,327
It got me thinking,
"What's gotten into her?"

879
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,039
When did the moon get so high?

880
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,248
I'm hungry.

881
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,462
-It's warm.
-Yes.

882
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,761
We grabbed each other's drinks.

883
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,473
It looks good.

884
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,891
I'll cut it.

885
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,685
Have the strawberry.

886
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,566
-Is it good?
-Yes.

887
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,736
It's really good.

888
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,322
I like it.

889
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,159
I feel so much better.

890
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,130
-I used up all my energy eating.
-Yes.

891
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,175
It was good though.

892
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,886
-Hee-ji looks tired.
-Yes.

893
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,845
She should sleep.

894
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,847
-She had a long day yesterday.
-Yes.

895
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,120
You've only been going on dates with me.

896
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,288
-What?
-You've only been on dates with me.

897
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,206
-Right?
-Yes.

898
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,717
Did I get any on my face?

899
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,974
When we were on a date,

900
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,145
Hee-ji looked tired.

901
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:29,234
It got me thinking if it was too much
for her to spend time with me.

902
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,405
It was rather discouraging.

903
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,368
-Do you want to go for dinner?
-Yes.

904
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,828
-I'd love to.
-Let's go.

905
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,246
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

906
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,500
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

907
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,502
That was really good.

908
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:48,879
Let's go.

909
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,965
You want your shoes here?

910
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,842
-Yes.
-Okay.

911
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,927
You can just come down now.

912
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,308
Okay. Oh, watch out.

913
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,352
This is bad.

914
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,730
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

915
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,025
My eye hurts. What do I do?

916
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,943
This is bad.

917
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,240
-Are you okay? Let me see.
-My eye hurts. Wait.

918
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,743
I can't open my eye.

919
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,040
THEY ENDED THEIR DATE
AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL

920
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,333
This isn't good.

921
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,003
Pyeong-seok.

922
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,630
I bet he was surprised, too.

923
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,214
I was worried it could be serious.

924
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:19,135
If I'd been more careful,
that wouldn't have happened.

925
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,265
I kind of blamed myself for it.

926
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,891
My goodness.

927
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,062
He must be thinking
he hurt the girl he likes.

928
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,107
I know. I would feel so bad.

929
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,236
After she got hurt,

930
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,240
I had all kinds of thoughts.

931
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,829
And if I sat there doing nothing,
I thought it'd make things harder for me.

932
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,501
So I started cleaning.

933
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,188
It's so cold!

934
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,150
-Are we the first ones to be back?
-No.

935
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,027
Those who went for a drive are back.

936
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:17,986
-Drive.
-Jung-yun.

937
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,530
-Pyeong-seok's here.
-They're back from their drive.

938
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,241
-He cooks with his glasses on.
-Trying to be a sexy chef?

939
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,869
-He always does that.
-Hi, Hee-ji.

940
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,412
Pyeong-seok, how was the drive?

941
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,705
What's with the glasses?

942
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,582
Why are you wearing those glasses?

943
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,417
What's with the glasses?

944
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,543
What?

945
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,461
Pork belly?

946
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,962
-Did you have dinner?
-Yeah.

947
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:36,922
You guys didn't?

948
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,549
-We didn't.
-You didn't?

949
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,885
-No.
-You didn't?

950
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,261
You came home right away?

951
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,512
-Yes.
-After the drive?

952
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,015
Why did you skip dinner?

953
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,935
Something happened.
Hee-ji went to hospital.

954
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:50,977
-Really?
-Is she sick?

955
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,438
-A little.
-Okay.

956
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,652
Let's take our jackets off.
Want to go downstairs?

957
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,736
Let's go.

958
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,369
When will she be back?

959
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,002
What time did you guys leave?

960
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,462
-Around 4:00 p.m.
-Around when we left?

961
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,964
-Around 4:00 p.m.
-I see.

962
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,257
I mean, we went to the café.

963
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,509
-Café?
-Yes.

964
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,427
It was about an hour away.

965
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,804
-You drove there?
-Yes.

966
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,015
After we finished eating,

967
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,560
-we were cleaning up.
-Yes.

968
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,689
I was going to put my shoes on,

969
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,482
-and Hee-ji had her head down.
-Yes.

970
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,903
As I was holding the tray,
Hee-ji got up and hit it with her head.

971
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,154
Did the glass break?

972
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,825
It went like this
and everything fell on the floor.

973
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,785
The shards flew everywhere.

974
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,539
-I think one got in her eye. I'm not sure.
-Okay.

975
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,753
When did she go to the hospital?

976
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,754
Right away?

977
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,090
About an hour ago.

978
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,259
I hope she's okay.

979
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,095
I hope it's not serious.

980
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,973
I'm not sure if she's okay.

981
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,267
I'm sure she is.
It's probably not serious.

982
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,645
Is she in the hospital? She's not here?

983
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,232
-You went to a café in Namyangju…
-It took about one hour.

984
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,900
-I see.
-It took exactly one hour.

985
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,697
Eat first.

986
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,032
-I'm sure she's okay.
-Okay.

987
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,701
She'll be here soon enough.

988
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,077
I'm sure it's no big deal.

989
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:31,995
Eat.

990
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,167
Too bad that it happened.

991
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,214
What?

992
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,052
-Are you worried?
-I should've been careful.

993
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,095
It was an accident. It wasn't your fault.

994
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,139
Don't blame yourself.

995
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,811
Who's back?

996
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,646
-Seo-yeong and Seo-hyeon.
-Just us.

997
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,564
Just us.

998
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,692
-Where did Se-yeon go?
-To the perfume studio.

999
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,904
-The perfume studio.
-Ji-woo… She gets to do everything.

1000
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,489
The perfume studio.

1001
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,866
-Right.
-First, the candle, and now the perfume.

1002
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,122
-You should ask Ji-woo today.
-The dream date.

1003
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,916
-Yeah…
-Let me ask her first.

1004
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,959
Did you talk it out with her yesterday?

1005
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,044
-Yes.
-It went well.

1006
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,093
Is Hee-ji okay?

1007
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,805
-Are you okay?
-Oh, my.

1008
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,848
Let me see.

1009
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,809
Are you okay?

1010
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,478
-Does it still hurt?
-It's a little itchy.

1011
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,562
Can you see?

1012
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,523
Yes? That's good.

1013
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,286
Hee-ji's in there.

1014
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,955
-Where?
-In the changing room.

1015
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,084
Ask her if she wants dinner.

1016
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,882
-Hee-ji.
-Yes?

1017
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,717
Pyeong-seok asked if you want dinner.

1018
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,144
-She said no.
-Okay.

1019
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,789
-This is hard.
-Tell me about it.

1020
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,043
Nothing's going the way we want.

1021
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:45,962
That's true.

1022
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,968
I can't stop sighing.

1023
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,889
I was worried.

1024
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,517
She said she was okay.

1025
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,228
But she didn't look okay.

1026
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,316
So, I didn't feel relieved.

1027
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,902
But it wasn't his fault.

1028
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,570
-Right.
-It's no one's fault.

1029
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,613
It's upsetting.

1030
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,615
-It's upsetting.
-I'm upset.

1031
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,871
-He should've had a good time with her.
-Hee-ji was busy comforting people

1032
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,664
-the day before.
-Right.

1033
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,542
-She must feel emotionally exhausted.
-She seemed tired.

1034
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,878
She didn't look after herself.

1035
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,005
It has nothing to do with Pyeong-seok.

1036
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,089
-Right.
-Yes.

1037
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,053
He must be worried.

1038
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,305
-What about you?
-What?

1039
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,057
-Are you not worried?
-Not at all.

1040
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,977
-I can tell.
-I'm happy.

1041
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,562
-You look happy.
-Thanks.

1042
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,855
Are you worried?

1043
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,024
-Me?
-Yes.

1044
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:49,901
A little.

1045
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,819
-A little? Why?
-A little.

1046
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,946
-Why?
-Yes.

1047
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,573
-Because I am.
-You can tell me about it.

1048
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,866
That's how I feel.

1049
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,284
-That's how you feel?
-Yes.

1050
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,702
-That's how you feel?
-Yes.

1051
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,836
Seo-hyeon, can we talk
before the food arrives?

1052
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,171
-Sure.
-Let's talk.

1053
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,756
Bye, guys.

1054
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,301
Upstairs or downstairs? You choose.

1055
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,387
-Where do you want to go?
-Anywhere warm.

1056
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,099
Let's talk here. It's cold.

1057
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,184
-Is it okay for me to come in here?
-Yes.

1058
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,143
Okay.

1059
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,480
So, tell me. What's up?

1060
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,608
-What's the matter?
-What?

1061
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,193
-Well…
-Yes.

1062
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,071
I wasn't sure whether to tell you or not.

1063
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,407
But I thought I should.

1064
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,535
Remember how I said I hope you choose
me in the end?

1065
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,619
-Yes.
-About that…

1066
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:46,416
I think it didn't come out as I intended.

1067
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,128
I didn't mean you should choose me
when I said that.

1068
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,131
I just meant that I won't change my mind.
To be honest,

1069
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,591
I don't know if I should tell you this.

1070
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,260
And I have nothing to say
if you get upset.

1071
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,389
I hope you don't pay too much attention
to what others say.

1072
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,434
You said you talk to Seo-yeong a lot.

1073
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,645
And Seo-yeong told me

1074
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,939
that she likes me the most right now.

1075
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,649
-Seo-yeong…
-During the dream date…

1076
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,900
Seo-yeong told me--

1077
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:13,985
That she likes you?

1078
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,070
She said she likes me the most.

1079
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,450
To be completely honest,

1080
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:25,038
nobody's going to be happy if their
crush is doing well with someone else.

1081
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,582
I'm not trying to badmouth Seo-yeong.

1082
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:31,586
I'm just saying this because you two share
a lot of things with each other.

1083
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,382
From her perspective, the fact that
I'm pursuing someone else…

1084
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,719
She might be rooting for us.
But she might not.

1085
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,555
When you're thinking about all this,

1086
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,392
I hope that you'll consider the time we've
spent together and what we talked about.

1087
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,396
So here's what I talked about
with Seo-yeong.

1088
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:56,694
Honestly, she just told me

1089
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,947
things that I was unable to see about us.

1090
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,160
She shared what she observed
from an objective point of view.

1091
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,078
LAST NIGHT

1092
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,079
From what I've seen…

1093
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:10,124
I can see the look on your face.

1094
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,587
When you're with Sang-won,

1095
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,508
you look comfortable,
but also uncomfortable sometimes.

1096
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,635
-That's what I think.
-Right.

1097
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,595
When we were over there…

1098
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,722
What?

1099
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,768
He said that even if I go on dates,
he wants me to choose him.

1100
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,356
-When I hear that,
-Yes.

1101
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:37,860
I feel guilty. I feel bad.

1102
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,154
The thing is, I…

1103
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,535
I've been thinking a lot about this.

1104
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:52,542
So when Seo-yeong shared the things
that she observed objectively,

1105
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:57,630
I was able to understand
what was on my mind better.

1106
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,551
Because if I hadn't been thinking
about those things already,

1107
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,887
I would've been like, "What do you mean?"

1108
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,349
Honestly, I felt that she cares about me.

1109
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,934
-You felt it?
-Yeah.

1110
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,856
I'm grateful that she told me that.

1111
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,692
About that…

1112
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,071
One second. Actually, never mind.

1113
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,781
I'll come back later. Bye.

1114
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,744
Oh, my.

1115
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,983
