1
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
This punch is to pay you back.

2
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Suiqing.

3
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,240
Stop listening to his nonsense.

4
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
He's clearly playing the victim here

5
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,720
to win your forgiveness

6
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,979
and then crawl back to He Zhen for scraps.

7
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,280
Mr. Ruan.

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,210
I didn't think that far.

9
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
I was only thinking about protecting my sister's safety.

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Believe me.

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,450
I really couldn't resist He Zhen's pressure.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
If I didn't get 'Old Dreams',

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,120
he would beat me to death.

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Sister.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
I truly know I was wrong.

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Your slap woke me up.

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Since childhood,

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,930
he would beat me whenever he was upset.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,890
I'm really happy to have found you.

20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
I want to escape that prison immediately.

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Now,

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I understand.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,280
You have someone who can protect you.

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,040
I have no reason to stay with the He family anymore.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
He Zhen and I have fallen out.

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,720
Sister.

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,579
Please forgive me this time, Sister.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Besides you,

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,880
I don't know who else I can rely on.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,780
Why are you so foolish?

31
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,250
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,260
It's all right now.

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
What's in the past

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
let it stay in the past.

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,079
From now on,

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
this is your home.

37
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Mr. Ruan.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,540
I didn't think things through this time,

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,800
but I did it all for my sister.

40
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,079
When I was with the He family,

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,640
you had some

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,340
misunderstandings about me.

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,960
I've completely left the He family now.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,560
Trust me,

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,450
I'll definitely find a way to make it up to you.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,730
Don't be afraid.

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,079
From now on,

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,960
no one will hurt you again.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,120
Suiqing.

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
Come with me for a moment.

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Go ahead.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
What exactly are you up to?

53
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,800
What does Young Master Ruan want to ask?

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,440
I've already said everything I should.

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Cut the nonsense.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,580
Chen Zhiyi isn't here.

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,580
You don't need to pretend with me.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,240
I truly don't understand what Young Master Ruan means.

59
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Let's go back.

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,770
My sister is still waiting.

61
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,480
You clearly denied it before

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,080
that you burned the costume.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,840
Now you come here admitting your mistake

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,300
putting on this sob story.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,760
Chen Zhiyi treats you like a brother.

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,680
She can't see through you,

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,880
but do you think everyone else is a fool?

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I told you,

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
He Zhen did all this.

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,850
It has nothing to do with me.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,810
If you don't believe me,

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,620
Young Master Ruan,

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
at least give me a proper reason.

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm actually curious

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
why Young Master Ruan is so agitated.

76
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
Is it just because I burned the costume

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,130
preventing your father from being saved?

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,210
Why do you care so much about my sister?

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
Because I like her.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,530
Did you hear me clearly?

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,640
I like her.

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
If that's the case,

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,690
you shouldn't doubt me.

84
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,690
Because we're the same.

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,490
We both want the best for my sister.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
Do you truly want what's best for your sister?

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
I don't care.

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,440
But do you know how much Chen Zhiyi cares about you?

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,620
Those things the He family did

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,410
better have nothing to do with you.

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Of course.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,720
Doesn't my sister always say

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
the He family is the He family,

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
and I am me?

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,620
We're not the same.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,840
You'd better be.

97
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm warning you.

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,020
If you dare hurt Chen Zhiyi again,

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,720
I won't let you off.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
I've already told you

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,360
I've cut ties with the He family.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
All I want now

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,920
is to stay by my sister's side peacefully.

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I almost forgot.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,159
That day

106
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
the day of the competition,

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
at Suiyin Pavilion,

108
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
I ran into Officer Lin.

109
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
He seemed to have something urgent to tell you.

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
All right.

111
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's go back.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,770
My sister will be worried soon.

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,090
The door isn't even locked.

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,100
Seems like no one's been here for a while.

115
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Officer Lin asked me to tell you

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
he had to leave early.

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,159
He won't be watching the match

118
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,560
but will make it up later.

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,159
Did he say where he was going?

120
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,960
No.

121
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,880
Hurry up.

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Be careful.

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
Watch out.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,920
Got it.

125
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,040
Quick!

126
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
This is unusual.

127
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,039
When we investigate cases,

128
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,080
we always pay attention to

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,840
abnormal phenomena in daily life.

130
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,120
If this dilapidated temple is related to the case,

131
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,040
there must be clues left behind.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,280
So according to what you're saying,

133
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,810
this stone is also unusual.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
I didn't notice it last time.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,480
Often we can't see anything on the surface,

136
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,180
but it might be hidden inside.

137
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,680
When my parents were still alive, I knew about this flower.

138
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,720
I loved it so much.

139
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Later we became homeless,

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
couldn't even afford a decent meal.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,760
So

142
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,200
back then I always dreamed

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,320
that one day,

144
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,840
I could grow a large patch of daffodils at home

145
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,460
and fall asleep to their scent in winter.

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,280
I can't believe you still remember, sister.

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
How could I forget?

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
This was our promise.

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
I still remember

150
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,410
how little you were then, looking up at me saying,

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Sister,

152
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
when I grow up,

153
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll give you a whole field of daffodils.

154
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Perhaps

155
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,920
by some fate,

156
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,120
it was the spirit of these daffodils

157
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,450
that helped me find you.

158
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,520
So

159
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,850
as long as it's from you,

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
even if it's just one pot,

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm already content.

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Wish fulfilled.

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,120
I'll put it by my bedside tonight.

164
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,690
What I promised you,

165
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,370
I will definitely fulfill.

166
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,080
These daffodils represent longing.

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,320
So our reunion

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,730
was also meant to be.

169
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,800
The fairy's delicate steps leave traces on her stockings,

170
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,000
as she gracefully walks on water under the crescent moon.

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Suiqing.

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
Where have you been all morning?

173
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,100
I haven't seen Dalin for days.

174
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
I went to get something from him.

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
What's this?

176
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
It's a gift from Mingxu.

177
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,560
Well,

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,960
does Young Master Ruan have such refined tastes too?

179
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,400
I don't have such sophisticated interests.

180
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,040
However,

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
I do have a few questions I'd like to ask.

182
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
These narcissus flowers

183
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
bloom when they meet water

184
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,400
and love warmth.

185
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
Even in our cold and dry north

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,850
they can still grow.

187
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,840
Narcissus does bloom in winter.

188
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,260
They're more common in the south,

189
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
but with proper care

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,060
they can survive in the north too.

191
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
You know quite a lot.

192
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,890
Since you like them,

193
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,020
I naturally wanted to learn more.

194
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,600
When I was at the He family home,

195
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
I heard that

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,240
dried narcissus can be used as tea leaves.

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Master Ruan,

198
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
I advise you

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,690
not to touch it with your hands.

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
The fragrance of narcissus is harmless,

201
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,450
but its bulbs and stems are poisonous.

202
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
Accidental ingestion would cause you great discomfort.

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Go wash your hands quickly.

204
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
In case you get poisoned.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Don't blame it on my flowers.

206
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,140
I'll stir-fry it for you tonight.

207
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,980
It's not like we don't have any clues.

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,800
Look.

209
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
What's this?

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Moss.

211
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
This isn't common in the north.

212
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,280
So?

213
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
This is unusual.

214
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,800
When we investigate cases,

215
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,760
we always pay attention to

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,890
abnormal phenomena in everyday life.

217
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,160
If this old temple is related to the case,

218
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,120
there must be clues left behind.

219
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,120
Narcissus flowers do bloom in winter.

220
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,540
They're more common in the south.

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
But with proper care,

222
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,660
they can survive in the north as well.

223
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,410
You know quite a lot, don't you?

224
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,660
When I was at the He family,

225
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
I heard that

226
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
dried narcissus can be used as tea leaves.

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,410
If the truth is related to narcissus flowers,

228
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,160
and the clues I've found

229
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,200
all correspond to something in that abandoned temple,

230
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
then the key to this mystery

231
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,720
must still be in that temple.

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
And that kid Dalin,

233
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,140
who knows where he's gone.

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,730
I need to go check it out.

235
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,840
It's not cold.

236
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,100
You're sitting out here alone

237
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,450
without even a blanket.

238
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,460
Waiting for me?

239
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,040
How dare you say that.

240
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,560
I haven't even settled scores with you yet.

241
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,620
You really are something.

242
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Anyway.

243
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,880
I do owe you.

244
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,120
I'll just

245
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,810
pay you back gradually.

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
It's a deal.

247
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,720
Whoever backs out is a puppy.

248
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,720
Suiqing.

249
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,080
I asked Mingxu to stay.

250
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,240
You won't mind, will you?

251
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,200
You know.

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,200
Because I

253
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,880
once left him homeless.

254
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,880
I've finally found him now.

255
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,640
I have a stable life again.

256
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I don't want him to be alone anymore.

257
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,920
No matter what,

258
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,890
I've always felt guilty

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,920
toward Huaiqing.

260
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,600
I understand.

261
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,280
He's the brother you've been desperately searching for.

262
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,800
He should stay here.

263
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,180
I just feel that...

264
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,250
He's from the He family.

265
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,970
I know the He family better than you do.

266
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,050
I'm afraid that someday

267
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,410
he might do something against you.

268
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,520
I was

269
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,400
also concerned about that.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,120
But today,

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,960
when I saw him coming back with narcissus flowers,

272
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,610
I suddenly realized...

273
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
He's my brother.

274
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,450
Even if it's because of He Zhen,

275
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,650
he's done many inappropriate things,

276
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,440
but that surely wasn't what he wanted to do.

277
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,280
I still want to believe

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,760
that if he lives with us,

279
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
he'll still be that

280
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
pure-hearted child.

281
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Why are you smiling?

282
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm being serious.

283
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,240
Nothing.

284
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,360
All right.

285
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,800
Since Boss Chen has spoken,

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,780
I have no choice but to comply.

287
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
You've really figured me out,

288
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
knowing I'll always take your side.

289
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,560
But I have to say,

290
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,320
if there ever comes a day

291
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
when he does something to wrong you,

292
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,610
I'll personally help you clean house.

293
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,490
Why are you smiling?

294
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm serious too.

295
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,040
Nothing.

296
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,480
It's just been a while since I heard Young Master Ruan

297
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
bantering with me.

298
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Suiqing.

299
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,119
Thank you.

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,079
Thank you for always

301
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,920
standing by my side,

302
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
thinking from my perspective.

303
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
What can I do?

304
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,560
You're always getting into trouble,

305
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,000
so I naturally have to look out for you.

306
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,319
And also,

307
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,530
stop saying thank you all the time.

308
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,740
If you really want to thank me,

309
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,840
when I write plays in the future,

310
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,760
make them famous with your singing.

311
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay.

312
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
It's a deal.

313
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,920
By the way,

314
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,380
what were you writing earlier

315
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,880
under the tree?

316
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
It's only been a few days,

317
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
and you're already curious?

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
My true feelings.

319
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,500
Things I've wanted to say for a long time.

320
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,100
It's getting late.

321
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,180
I should go now.

322
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,500
I'll be away for a few days.

323
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
During this time,

324
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,610
take good care of yourself.

325
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
Where are you going?
