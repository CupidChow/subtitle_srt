1
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
The contestants this time

2
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,890
are all well-known opera troupes.

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,320
The most notable among them are

4
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,920
Ye Xiaoqiu from Fuchun Hall,

5
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,800
Leng Yulou from Yunqi Society,

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,759
and Chen Zhiyi from Mule Society.

7
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,560
It's worth mentioning that

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Chen Zhiyi from Mule Society

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
is a female Peking Opera performer.

10
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,600
This is also the first time in Haicheng

11
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,920
that a woman has performed in Peking Opera publicly.

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,479
How will she perform?

13
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,810
Will she win the audience's approval?

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,160
Zhiyi.

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Don't worry.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,600
You'll be fine.

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,160
Yes, Zhiyi.

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,460
You'll be fine.

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,240
Senior,

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,170
I believe in you.

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,800
Sister.

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,440
Mingxu.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
Why are you here?

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,160
Nothing.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,440
I just came to see you.

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Thanks to Young Master He

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,040
for setting up this device.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,970
Now we can follow the competition.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,800
You're too kind, Young Master Ruan.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,960
It's all thanks to the Young Commander's approval.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Without his permission,

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
no one would dare do this.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
However,

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
I truly hoped

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,040
that everyone in Haicheng could hear my sister's performance.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,560
That's why I recommended it to the Young Commander.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
I believe

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
it's a blessing for the people of Haicheng.

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,490
Please come in, Young Marshal.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Please step inside, sir.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,700
Young Marshal,

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,040
this is our best seat in the house.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
Watching a performance from here,

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
the feeling,

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,920
the experience.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,460
Young Marshal,

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,040
if you like this seat,

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
we can sit down.

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
This competition

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
is very important.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,890
Mr. Jin must have many things to attend to.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,220
Let's not take up any more of his time.

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,840
You two enjoy the show.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,100
I'll take my leave now.

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,160
Young Marshal,

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,760
please.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,780
Young Marshal,

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,090
we're truly indebted to you this time.

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,040
Our Haicheng has never had

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,680
such a grand Peking Opera event before.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,160
Not at all.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,860
I've heard that

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,780
Mr. He's opera guild is doing quite well.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
I believe even without my presence,

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,120
the Peking Opera industry in Haicheng

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
would certainly reach new heights.

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,300
Young Marshal,

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,480
you flatter me.

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,120
Without your support,

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,840
I couldn't make any significant impact.

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,600
So Mr. He means

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,860
he wants to stir up some waves?

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,960
No, no.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,880
What I mean is

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,280
calm waters are best.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Indeed.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,399
Yes.

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
Calm waters are best.

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,980
Young Marshal,

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,680
which theater owner do you favor today?

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Actually, it's quite strange today.

82
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,400
I've heard about

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,770
all the opera troupes in Haicheng.

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
Especially Fuchun Hall,

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,420
Yunqi Society,

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Mule Society -

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,940
they all have quite a reputation.

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
However,

89
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,970
I haven't seen any of their performances.

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
How can I choose?

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,880
That's true.

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Then I'll

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,700
cast my vote for Ms. Chen of Mule Society.

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,140
Young Marshal,

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,090
what makes you say that?

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,920
Well,

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
this Mule Society...

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
Ms. Chen

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,320
is a woman.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,040
If I remember correctly,

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
this Mule Society

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
is the only one in Haicheng

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,930
that hasn't joined your guild, right?

104
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,560
You see?

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
What did I tell you?

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,880
In Haicheng,

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
anyone who doesn't rely on Mr. He

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,280
must have some real talent.

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,480
Mr. He,

110
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,600
how does that saying go?

111
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
Fortune

112
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
comes in cycles.

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,180
Don't you think I'm right?

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
Mr. He,

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
I'm just joking.

116
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't take it seriously.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,940
Young Marshal,

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,480
you truly have unique insights.

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,960
Unique insights.

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,260
Young Marshal,

121
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
the show is about to begin.

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Let's see.

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Stop right there!

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,740
Third Brother.

125
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,890
Where are you two

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,400
going?

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
To the warehouse, Third Brother.

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
Suiyin Chamber has new regulations

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,120
saying all items must be stored together.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
What's wrong, Third Brother?

131
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
What's wrong,

132
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,960
you little brats?

133
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,159
There's moss growing on this box.

134
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,480
Are you blind?

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
No, Third Brother.

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
You know Second Brother's warehouse.

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,800
The roof leaks.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,010
It just rained these past few days.

139
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,240
So you see,

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,540
the moss just grew.

141
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,340
Still making excuses?

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,520
This couldn't have happened overnight.

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
You guys

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
just don't care.

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,840
When flowers and grass grow on this box

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
and ruin the costumes inside,

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,060
can you take responsibility?

148
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,760
I've checked everything.

149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,280
It's fine.

150
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,940
What's the matter, young man?

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Sir.

152
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,320
You're involved in this too?

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,610
You're from Mule Theater Company, right?

154
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,400
Yes.

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,050
When you see Ruan Suiqing, tell him

156
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,340
I had to leave for business at the bureau.

157
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,400
All right then.

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
What are you staring at?

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,010
Hurry up and deliver it.

160
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,000
It only rained for one day.

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,240
Could it really be that damp?

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Officer Lin,

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,400
what brings you here?

164
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
Young Master He.

165
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,720
I should be asking you that.

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
Shouldn't you be at Suiyin Chamber now?

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
I thought

168
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,980
this temple had been abandoned for years

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,539
and no one would come here.

170
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,419
I didn't expect

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
Officer Lin would also frequent this place.

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
He Mingxu,

173
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
what's that in your hand?

174
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Let me give you some advice.

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,450
Don't do anything foolish.

176
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,640
Foolish?

177
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,320
What?

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Officer Lin,

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
is it against the law

180
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,920
to pray for my sister before her competition?

181
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,720
I know you don't like me.

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
I also know

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,000
how others see me.

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
But I can assure you.

185
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
In the past,

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,540
I might have been involved in He Zhen's activities.

187
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,540
But now with Chen Zhiyi in my life,

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
everything I do

189
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
is to protect her.

190
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
He Mingxu,

191
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
I don't care about you praying

192
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,800
for your sister.

193
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,050
But let me tell you this.

194
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,120
The things your He family has done

195
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,720
can't possibly be airtight.

196
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,040
So

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,180
praying to Buddha is useless.

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,730
Alright.

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,680
Officer Lin.

200
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,050
You chose

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
this path yourself.

202
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,880
Good.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,560
Good.

204
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,700
Nice performance.

205
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
Really good indeed.

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,840
Excellent.

207
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Good.

208
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,960
Good.

209
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Here it comes.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,860
- Amazing skill.
- Amazing skill.

211
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,560
Next up.

212
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,020
Mr. Leng is about to show his special talent.

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,600
All court officials, listen carefully.

214
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,600
Everyone at court, pay attention.

215
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,730
I told you he couldn't do it.

216
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,240
This...

217
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,120
What a shame.

218
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
We just checked everything and it was fine.

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
If we don't find out who moved this table today,

220
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,660
I want that person caught,

221
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,180
none of you are going home.

222
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,720
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,520
Young Master.

224
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,120
Boss Ye Xiaoqiu will be here soon.

225
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
We need to look sharp.

226
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
Tell him to be careful.

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Don't try things he can't handle.

228
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
No way.

229
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,970
Nowadays, when we watch opera,

230
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,800
we listen to the voice

231
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,440
and appreciate the movements.

232
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,900
Those martial performers

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
can't be relied upon.

234
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,760
The second performer is

235
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,640
Ye Xiaoqiu from Fuchun Hall,

236
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,920
performing a scene from 'The Peony Pavilion'.

237
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,560
Please wait patiently.

238
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,680
Zhiyi.

239
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
Yunqi Society has very little chance of winning now.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You need to focus

241
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,760
and don't let this matter distract you.

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,280
Don't worry, Second Brother.

243
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,760
He Zhen requires all costumes to be kept in the warehouse.

244
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
I've already sent Hetao to get them.

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
You should get dressed quickly too.

246
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,880
It's alright, Zhiyi.

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,240
Don't worry.

248
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,210
Nobody wants to see this kind of thing happen.

249
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
But please be very careful when you go on stage.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Although we don't have a chair,

251
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
a drunk Imperial Concubine

252
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
would take quite a fall

253
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,480
if she were to stumble, wouldn't she?

254
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,160
Ruan Suiqing, you really are...

255
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,760
You're still joking at a time like this, let me tell you.

256
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Something terrible has happened!

257
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,560
The warehouse

258
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,920
is on fire!

259
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,040
What?

260
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Hurry up!

261
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,000
We need two more people over here!

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,360
Move faster!

263
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,480
Keep up!

264
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,980
Water buckets!

265
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Coming!

266
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,560
What's happening over there?

267
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,620
The storehouse over there is on fire!

268
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,040
Sister.

269
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,010
What's going on?

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,800
Yes.

271
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,040
What happened?

272
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,960
How did the perfectly fine warehouse suddenly catch fire?

273
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
And coincidentally right before

274
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,060
Mule Theater's performance.

275
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,480
Mr. He,

276
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,120
aren't you upset

277
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,520
that the costumes you gave were burned?

278
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,420
Ruan Suiqing, what are you implying?

279
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
The costumes I gave to my sister,

280
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
I had someone burn them?

281
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,960
Then tell me,

282
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,290
where were you just now?

283
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,610
Can't answer that, can you?

284
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,480
I've been suspicious

285
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,400
about how you knew

286
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Zhiyi would perform 'The Drunken Beauty'.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,160
So you've been plotting this all along.

288
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,960
Ruan Suiqing.

289
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,640
What gives you the right to suspect me?

290
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
Are you a police officer?

291
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,440
Do you have any evidence?

292
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,920
Something like this happens

293
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
and you immediately frame me.

294
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
What are your intentions?

295
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,040
Fine.

296
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,160
I don't have evidence.

297
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
But when the warehouse caught fire, everyone was helping.

298
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,080
The clothes you delivered...

299
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,320
Where were you?

300
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,280
Ruan Suiqing.

301
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
If you keep making false accusations

302
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,770
I'll tear your mouth apart.

303
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,490
You think I'm afraid of you?

304
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,400
Gentlemen,

305
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,720
please calm down.

306
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,760
Don't get upset.

307
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,680
Answer him.

308
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Sister.

309
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
He Mingxu.

310
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
Where did you just go?

311
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,080
Do you know how important

312
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,840
this competition is to me?

313
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm such a fool.

314
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
If I had known this would happen,

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,460
I wouldn't have bothered in the first place.

316
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
What a mess.

317
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,960
Sir.

318
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,400
It's been taken care of.

319
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,960
Good.

320
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,480
Zhiyi.

321
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,520
There are still several theater troupes before our turn anyway.

322
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,760
Why don't we just cancel our performance?

323
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,920
We can't just

324
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,600
give away 'Old Dreams' for nothing.

325
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,320
Nanwei.

326
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,020
Young Master Ruan's father is still in their hands.

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,960
If we leave,

328
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
I'm afraid...

329
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Right.

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
I was just too upset.

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,520
I completely forgot about that.

332
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,250
I have another idea.

333
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,480
But I'll need everyone's cooperation.
