1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Your mentor's father

2
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,039
knows very well.

3
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
He Zhen

4
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,410
has good singing skills

5
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,800
and a quick mind.

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,600
He frequently socialized

7
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,970
with the elites in Haicheng back then.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,680
So many of Mule Opera Troupe's private performances

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
were arranged by him.

10
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,960
So how did my master become

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,620
the head of Mule Opera Troupe?

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,759
It was He Zhen.

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,400
He insisted

14
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,320
that your master won by cheating.

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Then he suspected your mentor's father

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,720
of showing favoritism to your master.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
He believed 'Old Dreams' should have been his.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
And so

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,199
he caused a huge scene in the troupe.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,440
Shortly after,

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,440
he left Mule Opera Troupe.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
He established Fuchun Hall,

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,160
which is what you see now.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
So

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
my master

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
had no choice but to take over as the troupe leader,

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
while He Zhen always believed 'Old Dreams' should be his.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,040
Miss,

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,180
when it comes to opera,

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,120
your master was truly a master.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,060
But regarding management...

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Fate is cruel.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
I've told you everything I know.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,880
I'll be going now.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,079
Mr. Feng,

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,980
thank you for your help this time.

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Young lady,

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,760
isn't it time you addressed me differently?

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Uncle Master.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,340
Uncle Master Feng.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,240
Since you've called me Uncle Master,

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,970
I can't let that be for nothing.

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Before I leave, I have a gift for you.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
I've purchased

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Mule Society's original property.

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
Uncle Master, this is...

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
It allows this old man

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
to do something for Mule Society again.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,880
The rest of it

50
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,280
will be up to you young people to manage.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560
Remember this.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,600
When you become the troupe leader,

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,800
you won't be performing alone anymore.

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
What needs to be let go

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
must be let go.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Uncle Master,

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,420
please don't give me more challenges before you leave.

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,640
Miss

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
that little mouth of yours

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
has never spared anyone.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Suiqing.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,080
Jiu'er,

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
what brings you here so late?

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,280
Zhiyi,

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,100
Jiu'er has something to tell you.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,250
Don't be afraid.

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
We'll all protect you.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
Tell me

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
what you know.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Sister Zhiyi.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,840
Brother Suiqing.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,720
I told the He family

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,850
which opera you were going to perform.

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,159
They said they could save my father.

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,180
Was it He Zhen who asked you to do this?

76
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm sorry, Sister Zhiyi.

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,320
It's my fault.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,680
I know I was wrong.

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
I understand.

80
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,720
You wanted to save your father

81
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
through your own efforts,

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,320
right?

83
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
Then don't give up.

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,080
Sister Zhiyi,

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,840
I may never be able to save my father now.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,560
Jiu'er,

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
let me ask you something.

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
Do you think

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
I perform well?

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,600
Do you like opera, Jiu'er?

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Yes,

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,720
but

93
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I don't know how.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Jiu'er,

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
I'll teach you,

96
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
be your master.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,370
Would you like that?

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Sister Zhiyi.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Good girl.

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,090
Though I can't think of a way

101
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
to save your father right now,

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
but

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
once you learn to perform,

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
once you become a capable performer,

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
by then,

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,360
you'll have the power to do what you want.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
Loser.

108
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Let me tell you.

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,020
Even if you help Chen Zhiyi win the competition,

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,340
she still won't look twice at you.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,760
You know very well

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,880
what kind of person you are.

113
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,159
But I didn't know

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,860
about your plan to burn the costumes.

115
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,960
Do I need to

116
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,580
report everything I do to you?

117
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
Do you know

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,100
how important this competition is to me?

119
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm so stupid.

120
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,360
If I had known then

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
what I know now.

122
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
Sister, what is this?

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
This flower is called narcissus.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
It represents pure longing.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,840
If we ever get separated,

126
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
make a wish to it.

127
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
The flower fairy will hear you.

128
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
No matter where you are,

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,120
it will lead you back to me.

130
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
I understand, sister.

131
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
I hope

132
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,080
to use our future time

133
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
to make it up to you.

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
You don't need to make anything up to me.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,799
I just want

136
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
you

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
to stay together forever, okay?

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
I'll make you happy.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
This feels so nice.

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,800
Sometimes I really don't understand you.

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
You say you care about Mule Society,

142
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,680
working yourself to death when busy.

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
Now that Mule Society has its building back,

144
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,800
you're suddenly not in a hurry anymore.

145
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,520
It's not as bad as you make it sound.

146
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,800
Didn't Second Brother and the others already go?

147
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,240
I just want to slack off a bit now

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
and have a good relaxation.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,460
What's wrong with you now?

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Nothing.

151
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
I was just thinking

152
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
that it seems now

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,450
those terrible things were indeed done by the He family.

154
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,440
It's fine.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
Everything has been resolved anyway.

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
Zhiyi.

157
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,480
It's wonderful to see you

158
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,120
back on stage performing again.

159
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
But all those promises I made to you before,

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,170
I couldn't keep any of them.

161
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,400
I said I would build you a stage

162
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,240
and a theater.

163
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,900
All these empty words,

164
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
I failed to accomplish any of it.

165
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Now I don't even have a home

166
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,840
and have to rely on Mule Society's support.

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,130
It's truly ridiculous.

168
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Zhiyi.

169
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
If...

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,450
without you, Ruan Suiqing,

171
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,000
I, Chen Zhiyi, would never have been able to perform on stage.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
If not for you, Ruan Suiqing,

173
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,250
Mule Society would never have restored its reputation.

174
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,820
But there aren't so many 'ifs' in this world.

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Suiqing.

176
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,400
Thank you for always

177
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,460
staying by my side unconditionally.

178
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Even if

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,160
these words I'm saying now

180
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,800
aren't important to you,

181
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,760
or you don't care about them,

182
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,600
but

183
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,920
you have truly accomplished

184
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,600
what no one else could do.

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,800
Thank you.

186
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Zhiyi.

187
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,280
Let's write down what we most want to say to each other

188
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,640
and to ourselves

189
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
on this piece of paper.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Trees connect heaven and earth.

191
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
We'll bury this note

192
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,720
beside the tree.

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,640
Let heaven and earth know our thoughts.

194
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,810
Maybe they'll help make our wishes come true.

195
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
After many years,

196
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,280
we'll come back

197
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,520
and dig it up.

198
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,720
We'll see if what we wrote

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
has come true or not.

200
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,240
I never thought you'd pray to heaven and earth too.

201
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Of course.

202
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,050
If in the future,

203
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,540
when we face confusion again,

204
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
doubt,

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,560
or forget who we are,

206
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,930
just by looking at this,

207
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
you'll be able to see

208
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,650
the person you most want to become.

209
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,760
Senior.

210
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,720
Why are you all here?

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Zhiyi is back.

212
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,920
Is something wrong?

213
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,280
Junior.

214
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,730
It's about Senior Brother.

215
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,020
News just arrived.

216
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,960
It's nothing.

217
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Don't stand around watching.

218
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,740
Everyone come with me to work.

219
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Zhiyi and brothers of Mule Society,

220
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
by the time you read this letter,

221
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,560
I may have already left you all.

222
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm sorry for not saying a proper goodbye.

223
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,760
I will bless you from heaven.

224
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,640
And about my departure,

225
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,320
please don't tell Muyan.

226
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,120
Let her live well

227
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,320
and stop waiting for my return.

228
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,680
I have failed her

229
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,040
and caused her suffering.

230
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,120
Don't be sad because of my departure.

231
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,080
Lu Nanfeng's final words.

232
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,500
Zhiyi, Second Senior.

233
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,160
Let her go.

234
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
She knows what to do.
