1
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
We're getting married in a few days.

2
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Every time I think about it,

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,560
I can't help feeling happy inside.

4
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,560
Don't wander around these days.

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,880
If you need anything,

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,759
just tell the He family steward.

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
I'll do as you say.

8
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,650
But tomorrow I need to go back to Mule Society.

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,280
I need to get some things,

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,160
and then I can peacefully wait to be married.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,479
Why not just send a servant to get them?

12
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
Why go yourself?

13
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,820
I don't want our relationship to be so tense.

14
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
After all,

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,480
Second Senior Brother and the others have been good to me.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
I still hope that at our wedding,

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,360
they can come as my family

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,720
to see me off.

19
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,400
Then I'll go with you.

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
The one who tied the knot must untie it.

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,450
I'm the one insisting on marrying into the He family.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,240
I want to try one last time.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,840
If they still won't forgive me,

24
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,000
then it means

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,810
our relationship has reached its end.

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,180
It's getting cold.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Let's go back.

28
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,010
Second Brother.

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
I know this decision

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,840
is hard for you to accept.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,930
Second Brother,

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,400
you've always been the best to me since childhood.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
I hope on such an important day,

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,130
you can all be there.

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
Zhiyi,

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
I watched you grow up.

37
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
All these years,

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
no matter what decisions you made,

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
we never questioned you.

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
But this time I really can't understand

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,240
why you're doing this.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
What kind of family is the He family?

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,980
What kind of person is He Zhen?

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
You know better than any of us.

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,920
Even if you're angry at Young Master Ruan,

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,380
you shouldn't throw yourself into the fire.

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Could it be

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,520
you actually believe that confession letter

49
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
and think Young Master Ruan is guilty?

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
Zhiyi,

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
do you need money to bribe officials

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,840
or want the He family to help find a solution?

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
Whatever it is,

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
you need to tell us.

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,760
If you need money,

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
we'll sell everything we have, even our house,

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,960
to help you.

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,160
If that's not enough,

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
we'll go back to Xiaodong Theater to perform.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll sing opera to support you for life.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
But this...

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,320
suddenly deciding to marry into the He family.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
How can we help you with that?

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
Stop eating.

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,620
Say something.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
Let me speak.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
What's there to say

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
to a traitor?

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
I forgot.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
So I was also a traitor in your eyes.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,480
When I left back then,

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,810
you held onto the door and wouldn't let go.

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
I felt so guilty.

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
But why did I come back later?

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Wasn't it for you, Chen Zhiyi?

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,440
Believing you could bring everyone

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,240
and Mule Society back together?

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
So...

79
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,440
You've been putting on an act with me.

80
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,330
If I had known Mule Society meant so little to you,

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,330
I might as well have waited for you at Fuchun Hall.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me tell you,

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,440
traitor to traitor,

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
there's nothing to discuss.

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,680
I have nothing to say.

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,040
What if I'm really performing in a play?

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
This play

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
cannot be performed

89
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
without my brothers.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Mr. Ruan.

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,660
It seems your integrity isn't as rigid as I thought.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
I've read your confession.

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,060
Your attitude is good.

94
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Very sincere.

95
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,050
That's more like it.

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,380
Are you satisfied now?

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,010
Then why are you still here?

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
To mock me?

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,210
Seems you don't have much dignity either.

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
Don't worry.

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm not interested in you.

102
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,370
Your confession was well written.

103
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,290
She firmly believes

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
that you destroyed her family.

105
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
And I

106
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
am the only person she can rely on in this world.

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,480
I came here to tell you

108
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,120
that Chen Zhiyi and I

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
are getting married.

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,680
This was your plan all along, wasn't it?

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,420
What competition?

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
'Old Dreams'.

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,180
You don't care about any of it.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
Be it Mule Society

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,480
or Lu Nanfeng.

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,080
Including me.

117
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,160
Anyone who stands between you and Chen Zhiyi

118
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
will be eliminated by you.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
What good does it do you

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,040
to know all this now?

121
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,760
By the way,

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,640
Chen Zhiyi

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
wants you to witness our wedding in person.

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
As revenge against you.

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
She will perform

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,140
that 'Golden Chamber' opera at our wedding.

127
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,760
He Mingxu,

128
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
you bastard,

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,280
I'll haunt you even after death.

130
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Sooner

131
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
or later,

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,280
Chen Zhiyi will know the truth.

133
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
All your dirty deeds

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,640
will be exposed.

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Just wait and see.

136
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,560
You'll see.

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,930
I'll make sure you attend the wedding.

138
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,720
Consider it

139
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,520
my thank-you gift to you.

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
He Mingxu.

141
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
What's going on?

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Why did you bring me here?

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,520
Come.

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Didn't you say

145
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,570
outsiders weren't allowed in?

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,290
You're not an outsider.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
You're my wife.

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,500
This home has no secrets from you.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Open it.

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Sister, what is this?

151
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,480
This flower is called narcissus.

152
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,520
It represents pure longing.

153
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
If one day we get separated,

154
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,040
make a wish to it,

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
and the flower fairy will hear you.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,920
No matter where you are,

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,800
it will lead you back to me.

158
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,080
I understand, Sister.

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
I told you

160
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,560
I would make you happy.

161
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,320
And only I can make you happy.

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,580
After all we've been through,

163
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
now

164
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,560
I can finally hold your hand

165
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
and tell you.

166
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Chen Zhiyi,

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,240
let's never be apart again.

168
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,360
What's wrong?

169
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,420
The young master isn't used to commoners' food.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Go ahead.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,880
Using Mr. Chen's name

172
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,920
to invite me here so formally.

173
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,460
What's this about?

174
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920
Wait outside.

175
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Speak.

176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,000
No rush.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,160
One needs a full stomach to have the energy to talk.

178
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,540
Since the Young Marshal doesn't want to eat,

179
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I'll help myself.

180
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,140
Congratulations! Thank you!

181
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,060
Please come in.

182
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
Thank you. Please come in.

183
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,080
Quite lively here today.

184
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
Colonel Zhang.

185
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,360
Thank you.

186
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,020
Your presence honors my humble establishment.

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,400
I've arranged a special performance today.

188
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Just waiting for you and the Young Marshal to be seated.

189
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
The Young Marshal has been feeling unwell these past few days.

190
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
So he won't be joining the celebration.

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,040
He asked me

192
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
to deliver his gift

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
to express his best wishes.

194
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,480
I hope Mr. He won't take offense.

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Not at all.

196
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,760
Just having you here

197
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
is the greatest honor for me.

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
Another day,

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,720
I'll bring Mingxu

200
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,360
to the Marshal's residence to thank him in person.

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,000
Good.

202
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,280
That young man has been sending people to investigate the military funds.

203
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
I think

204
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
it's just a formality.

205
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,600
As long as they don't trace anything to you,

206
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,370
the matter will be dropped.

207
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm just running an opera troupe.

208
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,610
What could that have to do with your military?

209
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,640
Good.

210
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
Congratulations, Young Master He.

211
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Once the wedding ceremony is complete,

212
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,720
you'll finally get what you've been wishing for.

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,160
Thanks to Colonel Zhang for his help.

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I, Mingxu, am truly grateful.

215
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't mention it.

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,520
In the future,

217
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,240
we need to maintain this long-term relationship.

218
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,120
Yes, indeed.

219
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,100
Colonel Zhang,

220
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
let's talk more inside.

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Mingxu,

222
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,800
please attend to the guests here.

223
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Colonel Zhang, please. Good.

224
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,040
Please.

225
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
Have you made up your mind?

226
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,930
Once you take this step,

227
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,680
there's no turning back.

228
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,690
The curtain has already risen.

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,400
The audience is waiting.

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
How can you not go on stage?

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Well then,

232
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,560
let's put on a good show.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Everyone,

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,280
let me say a few words.

235
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,520
I've arranged for all outside guests to stay in the front courtyard.

236
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,840
All of you present here

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,160
are my esteemed guests.

238
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,480
My son Mingxu is getting married today.

239
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Thank you all again for gracing us with your presence.

240
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,880
No need for formalities, Mr. He.

241
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Congratulations!

242
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,440
Mr. He,

243
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,460
you've gained quite a wonderful daughter-in-law.

244
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,400
As you all know,

245
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
my daughter-in-law

246
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,240
is the troupe leader of Mule Opera Company.

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Now that she's joining Fuchun Hall,

248
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,920
it fulfills

249
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,880
my wish as the chairman of the Opera Association.

250
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,330
With Troupe Leader Chen joining Fuchun Hall,

251
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,730
I hope you all will continue to support us.

252
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
Good! We certainly will. Today,

253
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,160
Mule Opera Company and Fuchun Hall will perform together for you all,

254
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,140
presenting 'Golden House Hiding a Beauty.'

255
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,320
It's a new play based on their own story.

256
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,400
Everyone, please wait for the performance to begin.

257
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
Good.

258
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
Everyone,

259
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,560
an honored guest has arrived.

260
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,520
I'll go welcome them.

261
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Please wait a moment.

262
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,100
The Young Commander has arrived.

263
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,140
I thought you weren't coming.

264
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Had I known you were coming,

265
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
I would have waited at the entrance for you.

266
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,080
We're all family here,

267
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,880
no need for such courtesy, Mr. He.

268
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
I wasn't feeling well these past few days.

269
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,040
I was planning to ask Colonel Zhang

270
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
to bring my gift for me.

271
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
But then I thought

272
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
I should come in person to congratulate you,

273
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,720
so here I am.

274
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
Thank you.

275
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,240
You came without any of your men.

276
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
You should have let me know,

277
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,320
I would have sent someone to escort you.

278
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Thank you for your concern, Uncle Zhang.

279
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm here for a celebration,

280
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,600
bringing too many people wouldn't be convenient.

281
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,520
Mr. He,

282
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
I heard there's a new play tonight.

283
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
That's right.

284
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Let's

285
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,640
begin now.

286
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,520
Okay.

287
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,600
Let's begin.

288
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
the show is about to start.

290
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,320
Alright.

291
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
Huaiqing.

292
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Huaiqing.

293
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,800
Learning opera is hard work.

294
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,840
The opera troupe rules state

295
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,960
that women cannot perform on stage.

296
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,880
If you're willing,

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,359
you can stay by my side from now on.

298
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
After getting separated from my brother,

299
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,920
Master took me in.

300
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,780
Thanks to Master's kindness,

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,320
he taught me to sing opera

302
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
and passed down his skills to me.

303
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,480
From then on,

304
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,180
we became not only master and student

305
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,860
but also father and daughter.

306
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,410
All my fellow students were kind to me.

307
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,740
Especially my senior brother

308
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,760
who doted on me like a real sister.

309
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,560
They allowed a homeless girl like me

310
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,900
to experience the warmth of being in a noble family.

311
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,770
My days at the Mule Opera Troupe

312
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,200
were the happiest times of my life.

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
My family is there.

314
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,880
That is my home.

315
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,900
I thought I could live happily like this for the rest of my life.

316
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
Until that person

317
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
entered my life.

318
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,600
Who says women are inferior to men?

319
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,880
I, Ruan Suiqing, promise to make you succeed.
