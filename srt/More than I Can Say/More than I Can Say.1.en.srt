1
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
During the late Qing and early Republic era, in times of turmoil

2
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,320
the opera world of Haicheng thrived in its own realm.

3
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,039
Haicheng was home to numerous opera troupes,

4
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:33,240
with Mule Society and Fuchun Hall being the most popular.

5
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,500
Rumors circulated

6
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,880
that whoever obtained 'Old Dreams'

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,880
would become the leader of the opera world.

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,600
The most promising heir to it now

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,560
is the senior disciple of Master Lu from Mule Society,

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,000
the unrivaled star of Haicheng,

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,280
Lu Nanfeng.

12
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,680
But Mule Society also has an orphan girl,

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
named Chen Zhiyi.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,520
She was exceptionally adopted by Master Lu who personally taught her the craft,

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
but in these times when women were forbidden to perform on stage,

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,240
she became leverage for Fuchun Hall to suppress Mule Society.

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Yet Chen Zhiyi paid no heed to this,

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
hoping only for her senior to inherit 'Old Dreams'

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,440
and to perform alongside him on stage.

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
At this moment,

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,560
a variable unexpectedly entered the scene -

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
the young master of Haicheng Daily,

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Ruan Suiqing.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,480
This young master Ruan lavished money on opera stars,

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,840
appearing frivolous

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,960
yet was the only one willing to protect her

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,560
and help her perform secretly with her senior.

28
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,800
However,

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
a piece of red cloth

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,410
had already woven the fate of everyone involved.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,460
When Chen Zhiyi

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,600
covered her head with it in that moment,

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,120
a magnificent tale of destiny

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,680
had already begun with a bang.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
Hey, Zhiyi!

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
You're a young lady.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Why are you covering your head with red cloth?

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,290
Take it off quickly.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,760
Second Brother,

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,280
look.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,010
This red cloth is so exquisite.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
According to tradition,

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
once the red cloth is lifted,

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,360
the marriage bond is formed.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Besides,

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
you're not even married yet.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
If someone lifts it,

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,050
it would be disastrous.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm just pretending,

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
it's not real.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
Young Master Ruan,

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,480
good morning.

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,520
The latest one.

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
Look at you.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Young Master Ruan.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,079
So early today?

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
Are you here to see Boss Lu?

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Or to deliver books?

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,480
No books. Not this time.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm looking for Nanfeng to help revise my script.

61
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
Third Senior, you all keep practicing.

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
I'll go check.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
Practice well.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
My goodness.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,480
Look at this young master,

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,160
not a single serious thing to do all day.

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
Stop watching.

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Be careful or Master will come out and scold you again.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,640
By the way,

70
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,920
hide your book properly,

71
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,680
don't let it show or you'll be in trouble again.

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
Senior, breakfast is ready.

73
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,960
What are you doing?

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Come out quickly.

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
I made you snow pear and white fungus soup.

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,760
Senior.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Senior, come out for breakfast.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,760
Senior, hurry up or the soup will get cold.

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,200
Coming.

80
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
Ruan Suiqing.

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you doing?

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,980
What are you doing?

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,640
Suiqing,

84
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
you're here.

85
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,320
Give it to me.

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
How is it?

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,400
Well? Say something.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
You?

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,120
You think you can compare to Mr. Xishan?

90
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Instead of always bringing these messy writings

91
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,159
for your senior to correct,

92
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,200
you might as well go back and work with your father

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,120
to properly manage the Haicheng Daily.

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,180
That might be more promising for you.

95
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,840
It's so delicious.

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,900
Senior, have some.

97
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,120
All you know is eating.

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
You don't understand anything.

99
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,120
Nanfeng,

100
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
tell me.

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,880
The one who understands me

102
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,760
is Nanfeng.

103
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,370
Listen, Young Master Ruan,

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
I knew it.

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,400
You never bring anything good when you visit my senior.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,680
My senior is somebody important now.

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,120
Stop asking him to do these things for you.

108
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,970
You think I came here

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
to listen to your senior

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
say some pretty words?

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
Your senior

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,580
has been desperately waiting for me to come.

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,760
Whose letter is this?

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,120
Give it to me.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,420
What are you doing?

116
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
Children shouldn't meddle in adult business.

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,920
Ruan Suiqing, give it to me.

118
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,360
Give it to me.

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Give it to me.

120
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,120
You,

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
give it to me.

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,159
I won't.

123
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,760
Zhiyi.

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,120
Where's the stuff?

125
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Here.

126
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,480
Wait a second.

127
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll help you get on stage.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,039
You owe me one.

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,860
Quickly think of a way to buy me some time.

130
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Don't worry.

131
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,980
I have a trick up my sleeve.

132
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,200
Come quick! Young Master Ruan is going to write calligraphy!

133
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Hurry, go take a look!

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,570
Come quickly! Young Master Ruan is about to write calligraphy!

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Master Ruan orders Biluochun tea.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Today is Mr. Lu's debut performance at Suiyin Pavilion. Indeed.

137
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
Master Ruan will surely write some fine calligraphy for the occasion.

138
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
I wonder who will receive his calligraphy?

139
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
Not just anyone can get Master Ruan's calligraphy.

140
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
Master Ruan.

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Please be kind and help me.

142
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,680
Gift me a piece of your calligraphy,

143
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,480
so I can buy back my freedom.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,040
Get lost!

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Let me tell you something.

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
You're just a singing girl.

147
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,200
You dare ask for Master Ruan's calligraphy?

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,130
Bring me a brush.

149
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,560
Master Ruan's inscription: 'Beautiful Landscape.'

150
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Excellent!

151
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,640
Our Master Ruan loves to write calligraphy after watching opera.

152
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
Whoever gets this piece today

153
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,600
will surely sell it for a good price.

154
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,330
Isn't that right, Master Ruan?

155
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
Others may laugh that

156
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,720
the Qingyin troupe doesn't understand calligraphy.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,640
But I say

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,040
my casual writing

159
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,250
is not for petty men.

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,440
It's yours.

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,980
Thank you, Young Master Ruan.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
Let me see it. Let me see it.

163
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,360
What a beautiful landscape! Show it to everyone.

164
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,170
Why are you grabbing it? Young Master Ruan already gave it to me.

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
How could I have given it to her?

166
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,250
Get away from me.

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Young Master Ruan, help me!

168
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,440
Stop fighting over it.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,680
Then why don't you show it to everyone?

170
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
We haven't seen it clearly yet.

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,000
All right.

172
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
I'll show it to you all.

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,920
Just look at it.

174
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,650
Don't damage the calligraphy.

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,880
I've been wanting to see this for a long time.

176
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,680
Senior,

177
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,280
the show is about to start

178
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
and you haven't put on your makeup yet.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,380
It's too late, Senior.

180
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,840
Ruan Suiqing is stalling for time out there.

181
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
Quickly find a place to hide.

182
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,250
Don't let Supervisor Feng see you.

183
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,010
Little Gabadou,

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,960
listen to me.

185
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,690
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

186
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,160
Okay.

187
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,400
Father, about joining the opera guild...

188
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,280
Has the Mule Society responded yet?

189
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,960
Didn't you already send them an invitation?

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
How ungrateful!

191
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,040
A theater troupe that employs women

192
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
dares to stand against the He family,

193
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,200
putting on airs

194
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,900
and obstructing my plans.

195
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me go instead.

196
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,330
It's not time for you to step in yet.

197
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,160
After all, I haven't obtained 'Old Dreams' yet.

198
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,480
Since we were once from the same school,

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,320
I'll give them one last chance.

200
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,720
What do you plan to do?

201
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,560
Jin Shiquan from Suiyin Pavilion will send them another invitation.

202
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,440
Manager Lu.

203
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
This Suiyin Pavilion is my establishment,

204
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,960
the sixth venue I've opened,

205
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
and my favorite one too.

206
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
Although your Mule Theater is well-known

207
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,400
throughout Haicheng,

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
in our business,

209
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,740
going it alone is the worst mistake you can make.

210
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,720
This

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,880
is the invitation I'm delivering on behalf of Mr. He.

212
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,960
About joining the guild,

213
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,820
please give it some more thought.

214
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Take it.

215
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
We should

216
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,280
keep in touch from now on.

217
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,040
Hey,

218
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,000
the young lady has been on stage for ages.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,680
Where's the actress playing the maid?

220
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,920
That's right.

221
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
I've never seen 'The Peony Pavilion' with only the young lady performing.

222
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
Why not?

223
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,140
Maybe Young Master Ruan helped revise the play.

224
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,200
Mr. Feng

225
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
You're back.

226
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,970
Get out of my way.

227
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,280
What's wrong?

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,520
Something happened.

229
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,450
Where's Xiaowu?

230
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,640
Not on stage.

231
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
Of course not.

232
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,170
Would I be rushing here if he were on stage?

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,400
That's impossible.

234
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
I saw him change his clothes.

235
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,240
In 'The Peony Pavilion',

236
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
the lady has gone on stage,

237
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,280
but Chunxiang is missing.

238
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Where is Chen Zhiyi?

239
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
Where are you looking?

240
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,690
She can't possibly be on stage.

241
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Let me tell you.

242
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
Quickly find Xiaowu.

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,080
If the later scenes fall apart,

244
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
we're all doomed.

245
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,200
Hurry up! Go!

246
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Why are you in such a hurry?

247
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,960
Sir.

248
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,600
Hurry up!

249
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Why hasn't the lead performer come out yet?

250
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,920
Yeah.

251
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,010
What's going on?

252
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
It's been so long.

253
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,640
We've been waiting for ages.
