1
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,730
If we also take a stance of opposition,

2
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,770
how many intellectuals in Haicheng will suffer?

3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
How many newspapers

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
will fall into the hands of those villains?

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,220
Do you understand any of this?

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,800
Villains.

7
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,120
Scoundrels.

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Accept your fate.

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,400
Now is not the time to stick your neck out.

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,039
Suiqing.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,759
All this time,

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
you've misjudged me.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,060
This is my destiny.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,530
I must accept it.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Commander Zhang,

16
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
it's my honor that you've graced us with your presence.

17
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,720
I've prepared some fine wine.

18
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,650
Please, come in.

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,970
You must have a few extra drinks today.

20
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,740
Please.

21
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Boss,

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,960
bring me some wine.

23
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
Coming, coming.

24
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Miss Chen.

25
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,240
She's had enough to drink.

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,440
But the wine has been opened.

27
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,920
This...

28
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,640
Just leave it here.

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll pay for it.

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
If she orders more wine later,

31
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,800
don't serve her anymore.

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,560
Alright.

33
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Enjoy your drink.

34
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Let me know if you need anything.

35
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,200
Boss!

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,960
Boss, where's my wine?

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
Why haven't you brought it after all this time?

38
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,040
Life is but a spring dream.

39
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,240
Let me enjoy a few drinks.

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
How much have you had?

41
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,040
One jar.

42
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,340
One jar of sorghum liquor?

43
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,080
Rice wine.

44
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
My lady,

45
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,220
this isn't meant for drinking all night.

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
You shouldn't drink it carelessly.

47
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
You know your opera well.

48
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,000
You won't let me drink,

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,200
you're no good.

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
None of you are any good.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,080
You all...

52
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,920
who else?

53
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
Who?

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Who is it?

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
Ruan Suiqing,

56
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,640
you bastard.

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,560
I thought you'd be on my side.

58
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
I thought you'd help me.

59
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,920
But you joined them in bullying me.

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,240
You'll regret this.

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
Pour me some.

62
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,520
Fill it up.

63
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,720
How have I wronged you?

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
You...

66
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,400
it's you.

67
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,640
You and the senior brothers

68
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
forced me on stage.

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
None of you are any good.

70
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,280
Good wine.

71
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,640
What's wrong with you?

72
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
I know.

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
What do you know?

75
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,680
I know.

76
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,010
What's really going on?

77
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
I know.

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,800
I know you mean well.

80
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,520
But...

81
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,320
but I'm afraid.

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm afraid.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,380
You know I'm doing this for your own good.

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,159
Then why are you crying?

85
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,560
I...

86
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
I don't know.

87
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,280
Why does this wine taste so awful?

88
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Commander Zhang,

89
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,530
about Officer Lin's matter...

90
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Go back and tell your father

91
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,880
to take good care of my business.

92
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,620
I've got connections at the police station.

93
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
What are you afraid of?

94
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,300
You're absolutely right.

95
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,620
Let me toast to you.

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Pour it.

97
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
No matter how bad it sounds,

98
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:56,280
the crystal clear spring water flows.

99
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:09,920
I can only wave my sleeves and dance in solitude.

100
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,880
I can only raise...

101
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
You're awake.

102
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,720
I...

103
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,600
Where am I?

104
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
At my place.

105
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Do you remember who I am?

106
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,680
You're...

107
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,800
Yushuang.

108
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
Not bad.

109
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Last night I asked where you live,

110
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,720
but you wouldn't tell me.

111
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
I had no choice,

112
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,220
so I had to bring you back here.

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
I drank too much yesterday.

115
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,380
If I say you were drunk,

116
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,140
you still remembered my name.

117
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,820
But if I say you weren't drunk,

118
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
seeing your behavior yesterday,

119
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,680
it really looked a bit like

120
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
'The Drunken Beauty.'

121
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
I've troubled you.

123
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,240
I...

124
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,680
You

125
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,380
can perform opera.

126
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,400
I'm just average at it,

127
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,440
but I enjoy it.

128
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
Judging by your look,

129
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,490
you're quite an expert too.

130
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
What do you think?

131
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,250
When you hear opera,

132
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,400
your eyes light up.

133
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
Hearing you sing just now

134
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,730
reminded me of someone.

135
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
A lover, perhaps?

136
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Everything in these operas

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,680
comes from real life.

138
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
Anyone who can see

139
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,880
or feel something in opera

140
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
is no ordinary person.

141
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
You

142
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
must have quite a story.

143
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,440
Come,

144
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,480
get ready.

145
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
I'll take you to see an opera.

146
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,600
We.

147
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,200
What's with this 'you' and 'we' stuff?

148
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,120
We have a connection.

149
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,680
Today,

150
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
you must come support me.

151
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,120
You're performing?

152
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,400
Don't dawdle.

153
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,660
Go freshen up quickly.

154
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,920
You can't go out

155
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,580
reeking of alcohol like this.

156
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,800
Come on,

157
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,330
I'll get some water for you.

158
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,080
Oh no!

159
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,520
I see it's your first time here.

160
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Don't be nervous.

161
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,740
We don't have many rules around here.

162
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,160
But can girls

163
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,120
perform on stage too?

164
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Of course.

165
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,600
The quality of the performance is what matters most.

166
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,360
Yushuang is our lead performer here.

167
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Her performances

168
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,720
are beloved by all of us.

169
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Look!

170
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,940
The show is about to start.

171
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,920
Okay.

172
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
I know you have talent.

173
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,540
You're born to perform opera.

174
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,280
But being a girl has always been an obstacle.

175
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,680
You couldn't go on stage.

176
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,410
What's wrong with being a girl?

177
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Just sing.

178
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,840
The audience isn't stupid.

179
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,970
They can tell whether it's good or not.

180
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm waiting.

181
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,080
One day,

182
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
I'll see you perform on stage.

183
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Mule Opera Troupe

184
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,440
has never had women performers before.

185
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,520
Remember this forever.

186
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,420
Mule Opera Troupe collapsed because of you.

187
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,760
They just want to find someone

188
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
who would sacrifice everything

189
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,450
for the troupe and for opera as its leader.

190
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,820
Only then can Mule Opera Troupe survive.

191
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,100
What are you afraid of?

192
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Where's the Zhiyi I used to know?

193
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,560
Hurry up!

194
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,480
Officials are coming to inspect.

195
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
Such busybodies.

196
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,280
Let's go quickly.

197
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,720
After all, this small theater is privately run

198
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
and illegal.

199
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Come with me.

200
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,280
This place is illegal.

201
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,400
Everyone gathers here because they enjoy the opera.

202
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,280
It's alright.

203
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
The police are just doing their job.

204
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,040
There will be other opportunities.

205
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,080
Whenever there's a chance,

206
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,810
I will get on stage and perform.

207
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
Father,

208
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,560
I've found out everything.

209
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
That Officer Lin

210
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,330
is just a minor cop from another province.

211
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,480
He had conflicts with his superior

212
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
so he was sent here.

213
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Why would he target the He family for no reason?

214
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,040
I heard

215
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,500
he had just been transferred here

216
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,260
when he encountered the Xie family maid's case.

217
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
He volunteered to investigate it.

218
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,800
What did Colonel Zhang say?

219
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,160
Don't worry,

220
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
the Colonel has already made his position clear.

221
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,000
He said

222
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,140
he'll have someone deal with him.

223
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,000
That's good.

224
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,040
As long as we have Colonel Zhang's backing,

225
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,119
those small fry

226
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,380
will be taken care of sooner or later.

227
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,599
I know

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,280
you've always been cautious.

229
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,440
But

230
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
there's no need to risk your life

231
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
for a woman.

232
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
I don't want you

233
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,290
to make the same mistake again.

234
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,780
I understand, Father.

235
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,970
You need to remember

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
who took you in.

237
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,640
And who abandoned you when you were desperate.

238
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Having you reconnect with that girl from Mule Society

239
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,280
was to find out where 'Old Dreams' is.

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,850
Don't lose sight of what's important.

241
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,200
Yes.

242
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,880
Alright.

243
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
The Young Marshal is coming to town.

244
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,440
We need to prepare ourselves.

245
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,800
Fengsun is already dead.

246
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,800
You need to be more attentive.

247
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,360
Find where 'Old Dreams' is as soon as possible.

248
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Perhaps

249
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,040
the Young Marshal's arrival

250
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
could be a good opportunity.
