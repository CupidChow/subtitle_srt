1
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,680
Miss.

2
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,570
I'm terribly sorry.

3
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,720
There were too many people at the curtain call,

4
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
keeping you waiting.

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,090
It's quite alright.

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,650
I arrived a bit late myself.

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,039
Mr. Lu, your reputation is unmatched in the city.

8
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,240
You have many admirers of your performances.

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
You can't keep your audience waiting.

10
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,759
The opera script you mentioned in your last letter,

11
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,600
I've found it.

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,080
It's just a bit old.

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,820
But I've added some notes.

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you for your trouble, Mr. Lu.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,660
With your handwritten notes,

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,810
it will be easier for me to understand.

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
This part is quite interesting.

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,650
I wonder if I could discuss it with you.

19
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
If you're interested, miss.

20
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,930
Why are you running so fast?

21
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,410
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
It's so cold today.

23
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
What if you catch a chill?

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,320
I was eager to see you.

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
I started running without even realizing it.

26
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,040
But,

27
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,920
thinking that in a couple of days,

28
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll be able to hear you perform,

29
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
makes me even happier.

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Do you know?

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
In the program sent to Mule Society,

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,080
the two plays you'll perform later

33
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,000
were added at my request to my father.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
I want to hear you sing them for me.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Nanfeng.

36
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,640
What's wrong?

37
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,780
This is the handkerchief you gave me.

38
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,460
Why are there mandarin ducks embroidered on it?

39
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,460
Mandarin ducks come in pairs.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,360
They naturally represent you and me.

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
But the duck beside you

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,800
isn't me.

43
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,650
The little fish swimming next to the ducks

44
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
is.

45
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,490
What exactly are you trying to tell me?

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,420
You are the mandarin duck.

47
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
I am the fish.

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,700
Though we live in the same waters,

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
one stays on the surface

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
and one beneath the lake.

51
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,300
How could we ever be together?

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
So?

53
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,360
Therefore,

54
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Miss Xie who lives on the surface

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,800
will someday

56
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,080
meet

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,780
the mandarin duck who truly belongs by her side.

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,680
And I

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,960
will find the fish meant for me.

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
What exactly happened

61
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,600
to make you say such things?

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Nothing.

63
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,250
And precisely because nothing happened,

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,060
we should understand that

65
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,300
mandarin ducks and fish are inherently different.

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,640
They can never be together.

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,970
I should have realized sooner that

68
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,580
no matter how famous I become,

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm still just an opera performer.

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,160
And you

71
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,770
are the daughter of the Xie family.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
You are someone

73
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,640
I could never dare to pursue.

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,800
As they say, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water,

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,930
fish and birds must forget each other.

76
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,960
Let our feelings

77
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,159
end where they began.

78
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,500
Let's forget everything that happened before.

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,770
It was something that should never have existed between us.

80
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,940
I was bewitched and have wronged you.

81
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,280
From now on...

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,170
No more entanglements.

83
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,240
I just have one question for you.

84
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,080
Did you ever truly care for me?

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
Were the words in your letter

86
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,240
truly from your heart?

87
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,570
I do have something to tell you.

88
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,600
We met through opera.

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,170
Tomorrow at the gathering,

90
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,610
I'll sing it for you.

91
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,860
In a couple of days,

92
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,840
the Xie family's birthday banquet

93
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,400
has booked our Mule Society to perform.

94
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,560
That's great!

95
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,500
The program list has been drafted and sent over.

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,040
You all need to practice well these two days.

97
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,920
Okay.

98
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,620
Where is your senior brother?

99
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
Listen to me, all of you.

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,440
Even if

101
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,720
you become famous

102
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,330
and turn into stars,

103
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,090
you still need to practice diligently every day.

104
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,919
Remember,

105
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
in our opera circle,

106
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,169
there has never been a performer who only knows one play.

107
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Master is right.

108
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,450
I'll remember, Master.

109
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,300
You're the head disciple,

110
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,980
why aren't you watching your juniors practice?

111
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,210
Where have you been?

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
This show,

113
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,640
are you still performing it or not?

114
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
Every one of you

115
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
keeping your thoughts

116
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,800
hidden deep inside.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
The Emperor may be gone,

118
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,940
but the sky hasn't fallen.

119
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,540
Senior Sister.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
You startled me.

121
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,840
Why is Master angry?

122
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
Because this morning,

123
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,760
the Xie family sent an invitation for a gathering.

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,200
But the head disciple has been missing all morning.

125
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
The Xie family gathering.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,410
Alright, I understand.

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,580
Senior Sister.

128
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
Master has been looking for you all morning.

129
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
Be careful not to get scolded.

130
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Don't worry.

131
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
When the day comes

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,440
that people can sincerely

133
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
call you Boss Lu,

134
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
when you no longer have to bow and scrape

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,840
and beg for food while watching others' moods,

136
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,080
that will be your time to truly rise up.

137
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Boss Lu,

138
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
calm down.

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Have some tea before scolding them.

140
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
All of you,

141
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,840
listen carefully.

142
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,280
If you make Boss Lu angry again,

143
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,400
I'll throw you all out,

144
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,680
every single one of you.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,740
Do you understand?

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Boss Lu,

147
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
is that acceptable?

148
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,250
You're the only one giving me trouble.

149
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,920
I can't see you around all day long.

150
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,570
Stop causing me trouble

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,480
so I can live a few more years.

152
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,000
Who knows?

153
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,160
I

154
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,260
might still see the day you perform on stage.

155
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,940
You really want me to perform?

156
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
If she performs on stage,

157
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,100
we'll all be left with nothing to eat.

158
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
I've said it before,

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,690
women shouldn't be backstage.

160
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,530
You're all just indulging her.

161
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
If this continues,

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Mule Society might as well change its name to Chen.

163
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
Uncle Feng,

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
there must be some misunderstanding.

165
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,440
Zhiyi has been following the rules lately.

166
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
When she tried to go on stage before,

167
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,400
you stopped her.

168
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,200
How could this happen?

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,280
If you want to keep something secret,

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,640
then don't do it in the first place.

171
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
She doesn't do anything immoral herself.

172
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,960
How can others taint her?

173
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,360
And now look what's happened.

174
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,020
News from Suiyin Chamber says

175
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,280
every theater is spreading rumors

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,680
that Mule Society training women to perform

177
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,720
is indecent

178
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,920
and breaks the rules.

179
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
I've said all the nice words I could

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,120
and they finally agreed

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,520
to let us back in the theater

182
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,880
once this blows over.

183
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
Isn't it obvious?

184
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
Someone's just jealous of Mule Society's success.

185
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,520
Why blame it all on me?

186
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,840
Using my performance as an excuse again.

187
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
Don't say I haven't performed.

188
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Even if I did,

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
what's wrong with that?

190
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,800
You know,

191
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,040
they haven't even heard me sing.

192
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,240
How can they say it's not allowed?

193
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,640
You...

194
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,250
Are you still going to protect her?

195
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Let me tell you,

196
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,440
today I must discipline her properly.

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
She must be confined.

198
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
I refuse to believe

199
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
that today

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
I can't put an end to this improper behavior.

201
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Why should I be grounded?

202
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
I've already said I didn't do it.

203
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,280
Why do you believe them instead of me?

204
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,640
You...

205
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,180
You're really out of line.

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
What do our ancestors' rules mean to you?

207
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
Do you even care about this opera troupe anymore?

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,180
Don't pressure me with rules and etiquette.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Ancestors are to be respected in our hearts,

210
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,130
not just mentioned in empty words.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,000
Mule Society is my home.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Of course I care about it.

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,040
But

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,280
you can't use this to wrongfully accuse me.

215
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,760
You...

216
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Enough!

217
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
When you're determined to condemn someone,

218
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,820
you'll always find an excuse.

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,810
Anyone with eyes can see the truth.

220
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
Why are you still arguing?

221
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
And you,

222
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,480
you're becoming more and more disrespectful.

223
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,260
We'll do as Fengshen said.

224
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,440
You're grounded for three days.

225
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,740
The Xie family gathering,

226
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,090
you won't be attending.

227
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,040
Xiao Hetao.

228
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,240
Master.

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,100
Go help Senior Brother with his luggage.

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,010
Alright.

231
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,740
You're all dismissed.

232
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,280
Master,

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,800
I...

234
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
Confine her to quarters.

235
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,420
Even if you press all those peanuts into oil,

236
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,800
you still won't be able to enter the Xie family gathering.

237
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I asked you here to help me find a solution,

238
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,570
not to kick me when I'm down.

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
Besides,

240
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
I haven't settled the score with you for lifting my bridal veil yet.

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
Come on now,

242
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
I'll go and

243
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
arrest that old man Fengsun,

244
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440
give him a good beating,

245
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,370
and hang him on the city wall for public humiliation.

246
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Enough.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just hurry up and help me think of a solution.

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,760
If Senior Brother is performing at the Xie family, I definitely need to go.

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,560
And

250
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,080
if I find out who

251
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
has been spreading rumors about me,

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
I swear,

253
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,080
I'll smash their head with a cup.

254
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,200
But anyway,

255
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,240
could you please keep a low profile these days?

256
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,200
I think

257
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,600
this must have something to do with the Fuchun Theater.

258
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,460
Think about it.

259
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,680
They've never gotten along with the old troupe master,

260
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,610
and they've failed to win him over.

261
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,980
If you go to the Xie family now,

262
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,540
won't they just find something else to use against you?

263
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
If you back down now,

264
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,360
that wouldn't be like you at all, my junior.
