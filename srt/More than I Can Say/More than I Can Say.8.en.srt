1
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,759
Listen up, all of you!

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,160
About recent events,

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,020
I'm sure everyone already knows.

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,080
I don't want to say more about it.

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,560
Mule Society

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
has reached such a desperate state

7
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
it's like a dying wild horse.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,560
Nanfeng is probably beyond saving.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Even if he recovers,

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
with his current reputation,

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
he can't sustain this theater troupe anymore.

12
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,320
Today,

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,610
on behalf of the old master,

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,240
I officially announce to you all:

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,200
Mule Society

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,440
is disbanded.

17
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Impossible!

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,039
Master would never say that.

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,720
This is exactly what the master meant.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,480
Don't tell me

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,010
you think I stole these indenture contracts?

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
Everything I'm doing today

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
is for Mule Society

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
and for you ungrateful bastards too.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you all want to starve to death?

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,840
Those who want to starve,

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
those who want to perform on the streets,

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
I won't stop you.

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
Those who want food to eat,

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,420
those who want a place to perform,

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,520
come with me.

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Fine!

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,840
So you're all loyal to the bone, huh?

34
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,880
It seems

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,280
today

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
someone needs to set an example for you all.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,480
This villain

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
will be me.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,970
Flowers bloom and wither, as is the way of all things.

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,170
Gatherings and partings all have their time.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
Go and find your own way.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,840
Disperse.

43
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,680
Leave now.

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,170
Senior Brother.

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,220
Junior Sister.

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,410
Get out of my way.

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
I was wrong, Senior Brother.

48
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,160
I was wrong.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
I am a harbinger of death.

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
I bring nothing but misfortune.

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,140
Junior sister,

52
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,880
don't be like this.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,160
Get out of my way.

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
At a time like this,

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,900
why are you still playing the victim?

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Uncle Feng,

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
I was wrong.

58
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,680
You can hit me or scold me, I'll accept it all.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll never sneak onto the stage again.

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
I'll listen to you from now on.

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll listen to Master.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
As long as you don't leave,

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
I'll do whatever you ask.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm begging you all.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
Please don't leave.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
The Mule Club cannot disband.

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,650
It can't disband. Get out of my way!

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Nobody is allowed to leave.

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,659
Junior sister.

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,900
Junior sister.

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,820
Junior sister, please get up.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,980
Don't be like this.

73
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,409
You heard it.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,540
Junior sister.

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
Master said

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Mule Society

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,640
is disbanded.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,320
Brother.

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
Everyone just wants to make a living.

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
Please clear

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
the path for your brothers.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Take care, little sister.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,560
Brother.

84
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,040
Chen Zhiyi.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
I want you to remember

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,480
how Mule Society ended up like this.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,810
It's all because of you.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Get up.

89
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
The floor is cold.

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,800
I still remember

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,050
the day you first came here.

92
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
Mr. Wan

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,659
brought you to Mule Opera Troupe.

94
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
Snow was falling heavily.

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
You were like a little bird

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,890
standing in the courtyard.

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,480
Mr. Wan asked me

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
if I wanted to take you in.

99
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
At that time,

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,680
Your little face was red from the cold.

101
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,800
Your big watery eyes

102
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,440
were staring at me.

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
Do you remember

104
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,680
what I said to you then?

105
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,620
You said opera is exhausting,

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,410
and if I couldn't perform on stage,

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
would I still want to stay.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
Perhaps this

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,800
is the fate between us.

110
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,120
Father,

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,640
I was wrong.

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,360
I won't perform on stage anymore.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,920
I won't sing opera either.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,159
Can you forgive me?

115
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
It's them

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
who stick to the rules

117
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,890
and don't allow women on stage.

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,080
Clinging to so-called equal social status.

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
Separating lovers.

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,640
It's not your fault.

121
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,520
They are the ones to blame.

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,330
About your senior apprentice,

123
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
That was his own choice.

124
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,480
He and Miss Xie

125
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
are in love.

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
I know.

127
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
It's my fault

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
for not going earlier

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
to propose marriage,

130
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,360
which led to today's outcome.

131
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Your performance

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,520
was also to

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,050
save the reputation of Mule Opera Troupe.

134
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,880
None of this is your fault.

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,240
Now,

136
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,680
whether he lives or dies,

137
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,200
it's his fate.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
Then why are you disbanding the troupe?

139
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,620
Why are you sending my senior brothers away?

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
I'll listen to you carefully from now on.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll stay properly by your side.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,760
Please don't send me away,

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,920
will you?

144
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
You're my precious daughter.

145
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,240
Father.

146
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,000
How could I bear to send you away?

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
Really?

148
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
I want to see you

149
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,840
get married,

150
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,840
have children,

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
and live peacefully.

152
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
I won't get married.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I want to stay by your side,

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
for my whole life.

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,690
That's fine too.

156
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,120
As long as you live

157
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
happily

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
and healthily.

159
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Then we'll keep singing together.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,680
I'll take care of you.

161
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Alright,

162
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,240
stop crying.

163
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
These days,

164
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,160
you've been running around

165
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
and lost weight.

166
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,860
Father, it's been so long.

167
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
No more opera for you.

168
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,280
Go make me a cup of tea.

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
I haven't had your tea for days.

170
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Go ahead.

171
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Mr. He.

172
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Theater manager,

173
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,840
I'm here about Mr. Lu's matter.

174
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,240
I've been negotiating with the police and the Xie family for a long time.

175
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,160
His case

176
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,490
has been mitigated.

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,060
Mr. Xie has agreed not to press charges further.

178
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Although he's escaped the death penalty,

179
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,170
he still faces exile and forced labor as punishment.

180
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,050
Don't overthink it.

181
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,900
There's hope as long as he's alive, isn't there?

182
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,610
He'll be leaving tomorrow.

183
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,680
I've made all the arrangements.

184
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
You can go see him off.

185
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Go quickly and pack

186
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
some of his everyday clothes.

187
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,930
Come with me.

188
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Go on.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,520
What a disgrace.

190
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,520
You've completely humiliated the Xie family.

191
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Look at yourself.

192
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Look at what you've written.

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Having an affair with an actor.

194
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
What are you doing?

195
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,360
Nanfeng and I are in love.

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,960
It's not as filthy as Father describes.

197
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Shameless!

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,420
You are a lady from a respectable family.

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,290
How could you

200
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,280
get involved with an actor?

201
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
I feel

202
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
embarrassed just hearing about it.

203
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,720
In love, you say?

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,080
I'll beat that love out of you!

205
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
Do you understand your mistake?

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,200
Being with someone I love -

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
I don't see what's wrong with that.

208
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,360
You

209
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,760
dare to talk back?

210
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,480
Still claiming you're in love?

211
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,540
Still saying you're a perfect match?

212
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll show you what love is!

213
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,890
I'll teach you about perfect matches!

214
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,010
Your affair with that actor

215
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,530
is already spreading around town.

216
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
If I hadn't found a way

217
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,980
to suppress this scandal,

218
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,280
who knows what people would be saying about our Xie family.

219
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,210
Your mother and I

220
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,610
have no face to show in public anymore.

221
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
Since the rumors are already spreading,

222
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
why don't you grant my wish, Father,

223
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
and just let me be with him?

224
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,120
Fulfill my heart's desire.

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,680
You!

226
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,720
You

227
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,080
are absolutely hopeless!

228
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
Fine.

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
Fine.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,600
Guards!

231
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,960
Bring the family rod.

232
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
Master!

233
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,200
No!

234
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't use the rod!

235
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
I know I was wrong.

236
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Yan'er,

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,960
just look at her attitude!

238
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,020
She doesn't regret anything!

239
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,520
If she doesn't wake up today,

240
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
I might as well beat her to death.

241
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,660
Let's just pretend

242
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,120
the Xie family never had this daughter.

243
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
No!

244
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,440
Do you truly understand your daughter?

245
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Since childhood,

246
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
You taught me to be well-educated

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,120
and literate.

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,330
You kept me confined in this vast Xie mansion.

249
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,840
I only learned rules

250
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,780
and etiquette,

251
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,050
but never understood the human heart.

252
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,200
Until I met Nanfeng,

253
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,970
he showed me the world beyond these walls.

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,300
Listening to him perform,

255
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,200
I finally saw the world

256
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,420
and understood the heart.

257
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,320
If you truly care for your daughter,

258
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
withdraw the charges

259
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,840
and release Nanfeng.

260
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
You gave me life,

261
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I dare not throw it away carelessly.

262
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,520
But if you insist on executing Nanfeng,

263
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,160
then execute me as well.

264
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
Since I know he's been wrongly accused,

265
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,600
I cannot let him die for me

266
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
and for my reputation.

267
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Yan'er.

268
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Go.

269
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,140
You're letting her go?

270
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,840
To find her lover?

271
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,440
And then allow

272
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,080
everyone to gossip about the Xie family

273
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,440
and criticize your parents?

274
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,940
You see this place as a prison,

275
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
but isn't this your home?

276
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,120
You were born here,

277
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
you are a Xie.

278
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,610
Whether you acknowledge it or not,

279
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,400
you cannot sever these ties

280
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,839
with just a few words.

281
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,220
I have done so much as your father,

282
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,599
was it all just for myself?

283
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,480
When you were involved with Lu Nanfeng,

284
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,240
did you think about your parents

285
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,380
and the reputation of the Xie family?

286
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,480
If you truly care about Lu Nanfeng,

287
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Fine.

288
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,000
I will no longer seek his life.

289
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,450
But you must promise me.

290
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,020
To settle things with him.

291
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,890
Make him sign this confession letter.

292
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,240
I'll arrange for someone

293
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,920
to exile him to the south.

294
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,440
Yan'er.

295
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,920
You both have your own responsibilities

296
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,250
and things to protect besides each other.

297
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
I'm sparing his life.

298
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,320
And that's the biggest concession I can make.
