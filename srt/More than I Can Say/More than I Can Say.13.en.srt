1
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,980
Killing a maid and still leaving traces.

2
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
What a waste.

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
As for that cop,

4
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,520
I'll arrange a meeting between you two.

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,500
Deal with him as soon as possible.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,479
Sir.

7
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,479
You called for me?

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,800
Nothing ever goes smoothly.

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,759
How are things going?

10
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,400
Fairly well.

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,479
Where's the item?

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,039
I haven't got it yet,

13
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,080
but don't worry, sir.

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,840
Leave it to me.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,170
I'm keeping an eye on it.

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,010
Just give me a little more time.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
I don't have that much patience.

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,240
Take care, sir.

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,960
Chen Zhiyi?

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
Second Brother?

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
Is this the place?

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
Chen Zhiyi?

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Stop calling.

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,060
Nobody's here.

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,450
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Do you know

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,850
how to get to Xiaodong Tian?

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,440
Walking so fast, do you even know where it is?

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,170
I don't know,

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
but isn't Second Brother with us?

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,050
Let's clean up quickly when we arrive.

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,880
Hurry up.

33
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Suiqing,

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Mingxu,

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,130
what are you doing here?

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Sis.

37
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,680
This place is really...

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,840
Although I hate to agree,

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,000
but Zhiyi,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,329
this place is indeed...

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,200
It's just a little hardship.

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
Besides,

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,000
this place hasn't been cleaned up yet,

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
so it looks a bit messy.

45
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,040
Okay,

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,660
I'll help you clean up.

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,540
Let's not clean up now.

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,720
I'll buy some things tomorrow.

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,650
I'll go with you.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,400
I said it first.

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Young Master Ruan, are your writing hands

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,690
capable of doing other things?

53
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,850
What did you say?

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,720
Young masters,

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,480
how about this:

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,280
tomorrow

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,800
Young Master Ruan will accompany junior sister to the market.

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
Why?

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
From Young Master He's tone,

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
he seems to have some muscle power.

61
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,760
Tomorrow,

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,080
you'll accompany me to Xiaodong Temple to do some manual labor.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Second senior brother is right.

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,840
These hands that hold writing brushes

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,700
can't handle heavy lifting work.

66
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
It seems

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,130
that won't work either.

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Are you really okay?

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,180
Let me help you carry some.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
It's just a few things.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
No big deal.

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,540
What happened to your arm?

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
It's nothing.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,800
The other day,

75
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,280
I ran into some thugs while delivering newspapers.

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,200
It took some time to deal with them.

77
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Otherwise I would've...

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,760
I've been feeling resentful

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
about this whole thing.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
If I had known...

82
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,720
It's okay.

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,820
You did nothing wrong.

84
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,880
It was my fault.

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Chen Zhiyi.

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,690
Can I ask you something?

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Tell me,

88
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,080
now that Xiaodong Tian is completed

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,240
and your brother has been found,

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,580
have you thought about

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
getting back on stage to perform again?

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
Fine, I won't go.

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
I was just asking.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,170
Why are you looking at me like that?

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Now,

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
I'm just happy that I can help Second Brother.

97
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,320
That's enough for me.

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,850
I don't want to hurt them again.

99
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Everyone has chosen to start over now.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,060
Don't say that.

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Hang in there.

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,170
Wait for me a moment.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Why aren't they here yet?

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,960
Mr. He!

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Here I am.

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,420
Been looking all over for you.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,080
Second Brother has something to do.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,320
There's still a lot of work to do.

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,440
We need to hurry and set up the stage.

110
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,480
No, no.

111
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,700
I saw you all were quite busy just now.

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
And tired too.

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,720
Why don't you take a break first?

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,440
We've barely started.

115
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm not tired.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,080
I see you're not bad for a young master.

117
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,640
I wasn't wrong about you.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
Of course.

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,800
Come on.

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
There are more than ten sandbags over there.

121
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,700
Let's move them together.

122
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Second Brother.

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm coming.

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Finally here.

125
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,600
Young Master He, what are you doing?

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,000
Young Master Ruan paid for it,

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,520
so I should certainly do my part.

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
Second Brother, just rest,

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,320
leave the rest to them.

130
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,320
This is too kind, Young Master He.

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,120
It's nothing.

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
Everyone, hurry up.

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,280
After you finish setting up the stage over there,

134
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,720
help Second Brother organize the other things as well.

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,780
Yes, young master.

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,530
And those sandbags over there.

137
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Thank you all for your hard work.

138
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,290
Where have you been?

139
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
I went to see an old friend,

140
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,450
a friend of my father's.

141
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
So you went to...

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,640
A gift.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
I can't show you yet.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
Being all mysterious.

145
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Let's go.

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,570
Second Brother.

147
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
Look at our stage.

148
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
It's great.

149
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's practice.

150
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Alright!

151
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Young Master,

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,280
everything you asked for

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
has been taken care of.

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Good.

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
Well done.

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Young Master,

157
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,520
the Master has requested

158
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,090
that you return home first.

159
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,850
Have someone take good care of this place.

160
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,410
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
I didn't expect that this brother of yours

162
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
would be so proper in handling things.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
I was planning to come back and set up the stage myself.

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,320
But in just one morning

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
he's finished everything.

166
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,640
Indeed.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,720
Young Master He not only set up the stage

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,050
but also found helpers.

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,040
That's great.

170
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,760
Tomorrow

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
we can open for business.

172
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,360
Mule Society has never been about making money on appearances.

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
For those who come to hear the opera,

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,160
if the singing is good,

175
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
even if it's in a cattle shed or stable,

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,890
they'll still enjoy it.

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,010
Yes, little junior sister.

178
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,840
However,

179
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,370
it's still a kind gesture from the two young masters.

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,380
You said you don't want money,

181
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,240
but they sent people to set up the stage,

182
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,370
which is quite reasonable and proper.

183
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Alright then.

184
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Let's consider that you've sponsored Mule Society.

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,040
You'll have a share in Mule Society from now on.

186
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,920
The money that my second senior and I earn

187
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,640
will be shared with you as dividends.

188
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,240
Why are you so stubborn?

189
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
Fine, fine.

190
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
So from now on

191
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm half an owner of Mule Society.

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Not quite half.

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
There's also your brother's share.

194
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
What is all this?

195
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
Such a mess.

196
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,610
And they've even set up a stage.

197
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Who built this stage?

198
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Brother.

199
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,770
He's obviously trying to stay here permanently.

200
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,920
Xiaodong Tian isn't a place where anyone can come

201
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,520
and go as they please.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,140
Let's talk this through reasonably.

204
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,940
Who are you people?

205
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,100
Opera performers.

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,040
Yes.

207
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
Coming here,

208
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,680
are your skills any good?

209
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,280
To be honest with you both,

210
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,810
I trained here for a few years in my early days.

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,960
I was young then,

212
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
always wanting to venture out.

213
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,840
After going around in circles,

214
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,440
well,

215
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
I've come back again.

216
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,640
Now that the New Year has just passed,

217
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
I need to find a way to feed my brothers.

218
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,400
You're right.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,240
Times are turbulent now.

220
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm not

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,240
trying to block your livelihood.

222
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,000
However,

223
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
performing is one thing,

224
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,760
but do you understand the rules?

225
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Rules?

226
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,960
What exactly do you do?

227
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,440
What do we do?

228
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,880
He actually asked what I do.

229
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,240
Art Affairs Supervisor.

230
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,370
Have you heard of it?

231
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,080
To perform at Xiaodong Tian,

232
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,440
all the spots

233
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
must be approved by my brother

234
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
before you can get in.

235
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Approval.

236
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,080
Isn't Xiaodong Tian supposed to be a place

237
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,920
where anyone can perform and compete fairly?

238
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,040
Anyone can.

239
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,840
Without my brother's approval,

240
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,120
if we let everyone in,

241
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,850
wouldn't it be complete chaos?

242
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,000
Let me tell you something.

243
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,040
First,

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
look at the spot you've chosen.

245
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,680
It's so remote.

246
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
To be honest,

247
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,900
we were afraid of this very issue.

248
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,680
So,

249
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,610
we chose a more secluded location.

250
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,520
That's fair.

251
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
But look,

252
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,080
people are still coming this way.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
As performers,

254
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
we need to attract some audience,

255
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,410
after all, we need to make a living.

256
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,240
You're right.

257
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,650
We all earn our living with our skills.

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
Xiaodong Tian

259
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,740
belongs to those with talent.

260
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,120
Here, regardless of how many people there are,

261
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,400
as long as there's a path,

262
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
everyone has a chance.

263
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,320
If you want to come here,

264
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,400
this path

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
is the rule.

266
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,160
This path and rule,

267
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,890
what does that mean?

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,920
You're really stupid, aren't you?

269
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,300
Since I'm new here,

270
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,620
I brought a small gift.

271
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,960
It's nothing special,

272
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
just a token of goodwill.

273
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,360
Buy yourselves some cigarettes,

274
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,080
and maybe you can help me out in the future.

275
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,240
This young man finally shows some sense.

276
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,040
Smart move.

277
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,410
You can come visit our place sometime,

278
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
we might find you a job,

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
better than this one.

280
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,930
Let's go,

281
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
check out some other places.

282
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
Master Ruan,

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,860
you shouldn't have started this.

284
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,040
Started or not, it's done.

285
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Better to avoid trouble when possible.

286
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Small theater dispute resolution:

287
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,080
Management fee payment,

288
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
ten silver dollars.

289
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,960
What?

290
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,720
Ten silver dollars?

291
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,560
Ruan Suiqing,

292
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,680
have you lost your mind?

293
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
What management fee?

294
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,880
This is clearly robbery.

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
It's a facilitation fee.

296
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,860
You don't understand.

297
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,000
Besides, they promised me a job.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What does this mean?

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
Problem solved.

300
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
We might even

301
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,760
get to perform on Main Street.

302
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,400
Facilitation fee?

303
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,400
Do you have any idea

304
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
how many shows we need to perform to earn that back?

305
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,220
It doesn't matter.

306
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,930
It's just small change.

307
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
We haven't even opened yet,

308
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,600
and we're already in debt.

309
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,520
That's not fair, Boss Chen.

310
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,930
How can you call it debt?

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
Think about it.

312
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,920
Since Nanfeng's first performance,

313
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
I've maintained a close

314
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
partnership with Mule Society.

315
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
All the costumes,

316
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,640
props and equipment

317
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,120
have been funded by me

318
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,450
without interruption.

319
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
This small amount

320
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
is nothing.

321
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
Young Master Ruan,

322
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
you can't just say things like that.

323
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
When you were being generous,

324
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,200
you didn't just sponsor my senior brother.

325
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,160
You wanted to sponsor every performer

326
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,480
in Haicheng.

327
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,980
And what was it all for?

328
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,160
Just for your scripts, right?

329
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
And what happened?

330
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,460
Not a single one was produced.

331
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,240
My senior brother was kind enough

332
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,900
to keep revising them for you.

333
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,840
But now...

334
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,100
But now my senior brother is gone.

335
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,360
But he will come back.

336
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,680
Before he returns,

337
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
we all need to do well,

338
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
including Mule Society.

339
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480
We need to rely on ourselves,

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,420
not on sponsorship from a young master like you.

341
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,040
What are you smiling at?

342
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm talking about serious matters.

343
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,760
This is ridiculous.

344
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,480
Zhiyi.

345
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,280
Master Ruan,

346
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,800
Zhiyi didn't mean it that way.

347
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,760
I know.

348
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
But now

349
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,900
she finally shows a glimpse of the old Zhiyi.

350
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,970
Second Brother,

351
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
before the show starts tomorrow,

352
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,770
come with me for a while.

353
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Officer Lin.

354
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,000
There was a small issue at the station.

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
I got delayed.

357
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
It's no problem.

358
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,050
I just didn't expect

359
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,380
Officer Lin to be so busy right after arriving in Haicheng.

360
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,329
What are you looking for, Officer Lin?

361
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
It's nothing.

362
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,600
I thought your father had arranged to meet me,

363
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,960
but now I see

364
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,080
he's not here,

365
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,290
so I think I understand the situation.

366
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,960
Officer Lin,

367
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,820
please don't misunderstand.

368
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
My father is very busy with work,

369
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,080
and the Opera Guild has just been established.

370
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,040
He has many official matters to attend to.

371
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,760
That's why

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,260
he sent me specially to wait for you here.

373
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,520
The Opera Guild,

374
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,480
the one that incorporates all the opera troupes in Haicheng,

375
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,740
that brings them all under one umbrella.

376
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Well,

377
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,020
it has indeed received everyone's support.

378
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,800
Impressive.

379
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,040
Not just the opera troupes,

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,920
I hear you have connections with merchant families like the Xie family

381
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,180
and maintain close relations with them.

382
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,120
When the Xie family had such a major incident,

383
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
your He family handled it with ease.

384
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,840
It shows that Mr. He

385
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,760
is not only influential in the opera circle,

386
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
but throughout all of Haicheng,

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,460
he's truly a figure of great importance.

388
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,160
You flatter us too much, Officer Lin.
