1
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,640
Look at those red gloves.

2
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
So brutal.

3
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,039
What?

4
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,360
Red gloves?

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
That's what I named the killer.

6
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,760
Scary, right?

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
But anyway,

8
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,560
when it comes to showing off,

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,680
you're hardly one to lecture me.

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,160
However,

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,720
I see you're doing

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,600
pretty well.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,320
Not bad.

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,880
What else can I do?

15
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,820
Face whatever comes my way

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,080
and deal with it.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,220
I heard about Mule Society's challenge.

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,120
I see you've

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
already started preparing, right?

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
That's good.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
But

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,040
before the killer is identified,

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,770
you all should be more careful.

24
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,560
Why are you being so fussy today?

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,640
Me?

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,400
Am I?

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,300
Are you hiding something from me?

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,760
Hiding from you?

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,200
I hide plenty of things from you.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,600
Who do you think I am?

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm a police officer.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,640
What are you doing?

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
I knew you were hiding something.

34
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,079
It's serious.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,380
Can Xiaojiu stay with you for a while?

36
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Xiaojiu?

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Why?

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,480
Her father got arrested again.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,940
It's not my case this time.

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,610
When will he get out?

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
No idea.

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Didn't you say she was staying with the neighbors?

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
That works for a short time,

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
but it's inconvenient for longer periods.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,579
Why don't you take care of her?

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
She's just a little girl.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
My place isn't suitable.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,280
Besides,

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
I have my own plans.

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,880
It's not convenient to bring her along.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Look,

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
she likes it here too.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,080
When you're free,

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
your boss Chen could teach her a thing or two.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,540
She might become your successor.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,330
Why don't you ask him yourself?

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,680
You know me.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,700
When it comes to

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,120
asking for favors...

60
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,140
You have to help me.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,480
I've already promised the little girl.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,840
You must agree.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,360
Alright,

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
it's settled then.

65
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,840
I need to go.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
I'll leave first.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,040
Did I agree to that?

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
I really have something to do.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm going now.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Alright.

71
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,640
Miss,

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,840
you're performing 'The Drunken Concubine', aren't you?

73
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Yes.

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
I made some changes to it.

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
But your movements aren't very fluid.

76
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
You're the one from last time.

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Yes.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
I can't go home yet.

79
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,640
Just came out for a stroll.

80
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,000
It really is you.

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
I was just going to say,

82
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
you left a bag behind last time.

83
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,800
I couldn't catch up with you before you left.

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,880
I'll go get it for you right now.

85
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,600
Good.

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,320
Very good.

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Where did I put it?

88
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Sir,

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
your bag.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Yes,

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,160
yes, that's it.

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,680
Please check

93
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,010
if anything is missing.

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,520
No need to check.

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
There's nothing valuable in it.

96
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,640
Don't say that.

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
Young lady,

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,080
I'll be going now.

99
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,770
You can practice here at your own pace.

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Okay.

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Good.

102
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,280
I'm leaving now.

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,240
Take care.

104
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,960
Alright.

105
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
Has your leg healed so quickly?

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Suiqing,

107
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,640
what are you drawing?

108
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,290
I'm drawing a theater costume.

109
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,220
It's for Sister Zhiyi to wear.

110
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,680
It's for Sister Zhiyi to wear on stage.

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
But Jiu'er, you need to keep this a secret for me.

112
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Why?

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
Because it's a surprise.

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
A surprise?

115
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes.

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
If you know about a surprise beforehand, it won't be fun.

117
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,700
Right, Jiu'er?

118
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,200
Suiqing,

119
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,980
what opera will Sister Zhiyi be performing?

120
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,780
Sister Zhiyi will be performing 'The Drunken Concubine'.

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
Suiqing,

122
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
guess who I just ran into?

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
What are you doing?

124
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm

125
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,420
enjoying the flowers.

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,260
Let me tell you,

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,080
I met a master.

128
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
A master?

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,720
He's an old man

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,919
who gave me some pointers on my posture this morning.

131
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,679
An old man

132
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,580
gave you posture tips?

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,280
Yeah,

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,920
the old man I met before.

135
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,480
He left his bag with me.

136
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
Come with me.

137
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,560
Slow down.

138
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,320
He used this old stick

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
to map out those drunken footsteps.

140
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,400
I did follow the footwork pattern.

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
The stones were placed

142
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
according to where the feet should land.

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
It's just that

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,520
the positions he arranged are strange.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,760
You normally can't step on those spots.

146
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,840
If I'm moving my upper body

147
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
or singing,

148
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,380
it would be extremely difficult to step on these spots.

149
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
From what you're saying,

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,530
that old man is incredible.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,600
I watched him walk for a while,

152
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,880
then he said he couldn't go any further

153
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,400
and buried the jar here.

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,920
You just said

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,120
you met him by chance on this road.

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,100
I was coming back from Yushuang's place.

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
I understand.

158
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,330
Let's go.

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,620
Where are we going?

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
You'll find out soon.

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,880
What's wrong?

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,080
Don't want to eat this?

163
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,580
It's fine if you don't.

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,680
Jiu'er,

165
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
grandpa wants to ask you,

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,040
what play is your sister Zhiyi rehearsing now?

167
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,000
Grandpa He,

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,880
if I tell you,

169
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,120
can you save my father?

170
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,080
Grandpa He has a great relationship with the police officers.

171
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
They often visit his home.

172
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
So,

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
about your father's situation,

174
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,090
you don't need to worry.

175
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,210
What play are they rehearsing?

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,340
'The Drunken Concubine.'

177
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,140
'The Drunken Concubine.'

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,170
Children shouldn't tell lies.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,330
Do you think I don't know what play that is?

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Come on,

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,880
tell me again.

182
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,640
I'm not lying.

183
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,000
Grandpa will give you one last chance.

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Think carefully.

185
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,920
Don't get it wrong.

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
Think about your father.

187
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,360
Think about what I can do to help you.

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,840
Grandpa He,

189
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,800
please believe me.

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
It really is 'The Drunken Concubine.'

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm not lying.

192
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,480
Suiqing told me himself.

193
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,960
Grandpa He, let's go.

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Please believe me.

195
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
It really is 'The Drunken Concubine.' Let's go.

196
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Please save my father. Hurry!

197
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Please save my father.

198
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
'The Drunken Concubine.'

199
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,300
'The Drunken Concubine.'

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,840
Right here.

201
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,460
Are you sure this is the place?

202
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,640
Within 10 miles around here,

203
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
this is the only place with corn stalks.

204
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,300
Where else could it be?

205
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,100
Maybe he just picked it randomly somewhere.

206
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,730
Where are you going?

207
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm not going.

208
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Let's go back.

209
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,400
Let's go in and take a look.

210
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Wait a second.

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
If you just barge in there without clarity,

212
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
what if you've got the wrong person?

213
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,250
You won't be able to explain yourself.

214
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,360
What are you doing?

215
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
No response.

216
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,200
There's probably nobody home.

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Let's go.

218
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
To have these original opera scripts

219
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,280
must mean this person is quite extraordinary.

220
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,880
He might not just be a simple old man with a limp.

221
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,560
For the destined person to open.

222
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Being able to see it means you're the destined one.

223
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
Qionglin Banquet.

224
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
What are you doing?

225
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,960
You can't just wander backstage.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,560
Let's go take a look.

227
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,120
It might help you.

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,160
They gave us tickets

229
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,720
so we could watch the show,

230
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
not for you to sneak backstage.

231
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,000
There's an old saying,

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
know yourself and your enemy,

233
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,980
and you'll never be defeated.

234
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
That's not okay either.

235
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,330
Senior Brother.

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Let's go.

237
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,530
Senior Brother.

238
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,800
Why are you here?

239
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,760
Just arrived?

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,960
The things you asked for.

241
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,360
Just need your approval.

242
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,520
Pay attention and learn.

243
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,560
Well.

244
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,320
This Yunqi Society.

245
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
It's not as scary as I imagined.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
Drinking before going on stage.

247
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
It's almost time.

248
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's hurry.

249
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
Let's go.

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,930
Have some water.

251
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,720
I noticed you were watching the show intently.

252
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,250
You barely drank anything.

253
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,120
Don't worry.

254
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,280
Although Yunqi Society performed well,

255
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
isn't it all within our expectations?

256
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,780
They're just showing off.

257
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,560
We still have a chance.

258
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,400
After all,

259
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
we still have time, don't we?

260
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
That senior student from Yunqi Society

261
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360
isn't that impressive after all.

262
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
He even drank before going on stage.

263
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,900
But his singing was quite steady.

264
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
What did you just say?

265
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,280
I said that senior student

266
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,520
has quite a good alcohol tolerance.

267
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,360
No, no.

268
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,770
The last thing you said.

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,760
He could still perform steadily after drinking.

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,240
Yes,

271
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
that's it.

272
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
I understand now.

273
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,369
What do you understand?

274
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,300
What's the name of the opera they performed?

275
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
'Qionglin Banquet.'

276
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,319
In 'Qionglin Banquet,' Fan Zhongyu's

277
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,560
most brilliant scene is what?

278
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,170
The drunk scene.

279
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,280
I believe so.

280
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,240
You see?

281
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,240
So that's what you meant.

282
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,800
But you haven't been drinking.

283
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,120
I can act it out.

284
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
It's not like I've never been drunk before.

285
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Sir.
