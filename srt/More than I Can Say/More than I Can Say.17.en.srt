1
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,960
So what did He Zhen give you

2
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
that makes you listen to him so obediently?

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,770
A candied fruit skewer.

4
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,920
Since that day,

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,360
I realized

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
that in this world,

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,860
we can only rely on ourselves.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,880
The things we want

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
can only be earned through our own efforts.

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
Sister,

11
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
if you continue

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
to depend on others,

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
in the end,

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
they will all leave you.

15
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Only you yourself

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
are the key to changing everything.

17
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,840
Mingxu.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
Don't call me that.

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,240
Call me Huaiqing.

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
If that day

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,690
I hadn't gone looking for food,

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,760
you wouldn't have suffered so much afterward.

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,980
Sister, you don't need to apologize.

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,160
If only I had gone back to find you sooner,

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,450
you wouldn't have gone through those things.

27
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,680
Sister,

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
did you go back?

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,720
Actually...

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
I've been waiting for the right moment to tell you.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,020
I went back to look for you many times.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
But I never found you.

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,040
I know

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
telling you this now

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
won't change anything.

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,240
But if possible,

37
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,840
I hope I can

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
make it up to you with our time together from now on.

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
You don't need to make anything up to me.

40
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,880
It's just...

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Sister,

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,579
can we stay together forever?

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
I'll make you happy.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
Come on,

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
let's go, Second Brother.

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Zhiyi.

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Zhiyi.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,580
You're asleep.

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
That's not fair.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,440
I wasn't finished talking

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,570
and you fell asleep.

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
So just listen to me.

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Zhiyi.

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,120
How many years have we known each other?

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,720
55.

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
18,

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
19.

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,560
19.

59
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,010
I can't even count it right.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,100
Anyway, it's been many years.

61
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,220
It doesn't matter.

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,360
What matters is

63
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,159
I did say before

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
that I would unconditionally stand

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,840
on Mule Society's side.

66
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,960
I will still keep my promise.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
But Zhiyi,

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
since Nanfeng left,

69
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,880
I've always seen you as a sister.

70
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
I genuinely want to be good to you.

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,760
Maybe because of Mule Society,

72
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,320
or maybe because of Nanfeng.

73
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,920
And I know

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,060
you have special feelings

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
for Nanfeng.

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
So I've always

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
stayed back.

78
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Stayed back.

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Wanting to be behind you,

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,760
silently protecting you.

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,480
That was enough for me.

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
But Chen Zhiyi,

83
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,880
you can't expect people not to change, right?

84
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
People do change.

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
People do change.

86
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,760
We've been through so much together.

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,160
Today when I saw you standing on that stage,

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,760
just standing there.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm happy inside.

90
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Your dream has come true.

91
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,760
I just hope you can keep singing.

92
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,640
That's who you truly are.

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,159
Confident.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Determined.

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,659
From being everyone's little junior

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
to becoming

97
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,770
the radiant person you are now.

98
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,680
Chen Zhiyi.

99
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
You were born

100
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
to be a performer.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
As for me,

102
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm still

103
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
that idle rich boy

104
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,520
everyone talks about.

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
But I've really changed.

106
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,440
I need you more than ever now.

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,360
Maybe someday,

108
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,320
I mean,

109
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,500
it's possible that

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
we might part ways.

111
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,800
But I hope

112
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,320
in your life's memories,

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,560
you'll always remember someone.

114
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
A man

115
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,400
who stands behind you unconditionally,

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
supports you,

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,400
protects you.

118
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,300
Who thinks what you think.

119
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,090
Who loves what you love.

120
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,850
Who loves what you love.

121
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,320
Good night.

122
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
Good night.

123
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,570
Second Brother,

124
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
you all drank so much yesterday,

125
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
yet you're up so early today.

126
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,200
Leave the clothes there. I'll take care of them.

127
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,660
The troupe leader is here.

128
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,480
Speaking of which,

129
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,920
you shouldn't be handling these costumes anymore.

130
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
How can we let the leader of Mule Troupe

131
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
do such menial tasks?

132
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,090
Second Brother,

133
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll just assume you were all drunk yesterday

134
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,040
and talking nonsense.

135
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,840
From now on,

136
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,960
please don't joke about me like this anymore.

137
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm serious.

138
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,320
How could I joke about you being our troupe leader?

139
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
But...

140
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,560
Quick,

141
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,400
come back with me, you rascal.

142
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't think you can catch me!

143
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
Stop running!

144
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Don't be so smug.

145
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,580
I'm going to catch you!

146
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,280
Big sister, help me!

147
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,610
He's trying to catch me!

148
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,840
Stop!

149
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Sit down.

150
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Behave yourself.

151
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,440
I've already explained to you.

152
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm a police officer.

153
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,160
Why won't you believe me?

154
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
No one would believe that.

155
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,880
You're chasing

156
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,600
a defenseless little girl in broad daylight.

157
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,760
And you don't even have a badge when I ask for it.

158
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,560
No.

159
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,560
I...

160
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,840
I told you I'm not on duty.

161
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,370
If you're not on duty, why are you chasing her?

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,730
I've already explained to you.

163
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,920
That little girl

164
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,480
threw stones

165
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
and broke the police station windows.

166
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
The police station!

167
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,320
Let me be honest with you.

168
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
I was afraid the police would actually arrest her

169
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
and lock her up.

170
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,760
So you were afraid the police

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
would take her in?

172
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,080
Yes, yes.

173
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,960
Second Brother, look.

174
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
He admitted it.

175
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
He's not even a real police officer.

176
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,080
Behave yourself.

177
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,210
Morning, everyone.

178
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Perfect timing, Suiqing.

179
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,840
Hurry up.

180
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Take him to the police station.

181
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Lin Dalin.

182
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
Does Jiu'er know

183
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,180
that her father was arrested for trying to sell her?

184
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,490
Jiu'er is too young.

185
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm afraid to tell her.

186
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,090
Afraid she can't handle it.

187
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
I made up an excuse

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
and left her with my neighbor for now.

189
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
As for the future,

190
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,890
I'll figure something out.

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,720
That kid

192
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
is quite something.

193
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,250
She's got real grit.

194
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
You see,

195
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
to save her father,

196
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,140
she keeps bothering me every day.

197
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,680
Officer Lin.

198
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm really sorry.

199
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Just now,

200
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
you took quite a fall because of us.

201
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,720
I truly apologize.

202
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,720
It's fine.

203
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,040
It was all a misunderstanding.

204
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,640
Everyone was just trying to do the right thing.

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,600
Alright.

206
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,880
Bring her out.

207
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,940
I'll take her home.

208
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,040
That's enough, stop staring.

209
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
I need to tell you something.

210
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,120
What is it?

211
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,930
Keep this quiet for now.

212
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,610
Feng Sen is dead.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,800
The night before last.

214
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,330
It's been ruled a homicide.

215
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,880
I don't know the details.

216
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,480
I'm not in charge of the case.

217
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Homicide?

218
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
Remember what you told me about the narcissus?

219
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,680
Is there?

220
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
That's not right.

221
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,940
But Fengsun is from the He family.

222
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm not sure about that either.

223
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,080
Anyway,

224
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
take care of yourself

225
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,690
and don't tell anyone else yet.

226
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Alright,

227
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,490
no more running off on your own from now on.

228
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Be good, Jiu'er.

229
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,320
If you're ever unhappy about anything,

230
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,200
come to your sister.

231
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Did you hear that?

232
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,280
No matter how upset you get,

233
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,880
stop bullying your brother.

234
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,680
I'm leaving.

235
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,560
See you again.

236
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,640
Suiqing.

237
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,130
Let's get drinks later.

238
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,360
Go.

239
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
That kid Jiu'er.

240
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
I believe

241
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,000
that sooner or later,

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,560
she'll find her own way out.

243
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
How do you know?

244
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
I just know.

245
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,100
Where were you so late?

246
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,500
I almost took a cop to the police station.

247
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
What are you laughing at?

248
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,520
By the way,

249
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,650
I actually have something.

250
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,359
Yunqi Society.

251
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
They're coming to Haicheng.

252
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,400
Where did you get this?

253
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,319
I have my ways.

254
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Just tell me if you're going or not.

255
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,890
Of course I'm going.

256
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,839
Then it's settled.

257
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,700
It's a promise.

258
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,480
See you at Suiyin Pavilion.

259
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,530
Whoever doesn't show up is a puppy.

260
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,620
You've got quite a few tricks up your sleeve now.

261
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,360
Is this really for me?

262
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Of course.

263
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,160
Who would dare mess with you now?

264
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,770
What do you mean?

265
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,880
You even dare to hit cops.

266
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
Yes, I did.

267
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Are you okay?

268
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,880
You dare lie to me?

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
Is it ready? Is it straight?

270
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,360
How is it? Good.

271
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,200
All done!

272
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,120
Good.

273
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,800
That's wonderful!

274
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,900
Thank you, Young Master Ruan.

275
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Finding a calligraphy master

276
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,560
to create new signage for our Mule Society.

277
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
Third Senior, you're too kind.

278
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
As I always say,

279
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,120
the affairs of the Mule Society

280
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,520
are my affairs as well.

281
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,840
Good.

282
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
This is the calligraphy of Master Zhang from Haicheng.

283
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
It's written with such distinction

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,880
and grandeur.

285
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,720
What do you think?

286
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you like it?
