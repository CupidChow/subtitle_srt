1
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,120
Drop the knife.

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,800
I did it.

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
I did it all.

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Lu Nanfeng hurt you.

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
He deserved to die.

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,620
Feng Cun drove you to suicide.

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,840
He deserved it even more.

8
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,600
As for Lin Dalin,

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,400
if he hadn't insisted on investigating me,

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
he brought it all on himself.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
I thought

12
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,320
if I got rid of all those

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
random people around you,

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,340
you would fall in love with me.

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,210
But you fell for Ruan Suiqing instead.

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
You even let him kiss you.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
How dare he.

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,960
What are you doing?

19
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,760
Zhiyi! Zhiyi!

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,660
Put the knife down.

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Do you even realize

22
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,760
what you've done?

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,880
But I did all this for you.

24
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,240
You said you'd never leave me.

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,079
Does that mean nothing now?

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,680
But because of you,

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,920
I've lost almost everything.

28
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,010
Having me should be enough for you.

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,220
Why did you have to fall for someone else?

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
I have always only seen you as a brother.

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,240
What exactly turned you into what you are now?

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
Huaiqing.

33
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,480
Stop this.

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
If you don't put down that knife,

35
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
I will die right in front of you.

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,839
I won't let you succeed.

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,260
I've worked so hard to get to where I am today,

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
just to stand here with you,

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,400
and make you my wife.

40
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
But you betrayed me for them.

41
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Chen Zhiyi,

42
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,680
you truly deserve to die.

43
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Ruan Suiqing,

44
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
you've won.

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,880
She still chose you.

46
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,640
Chen Zhiyi,

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,930
if I had known it would come to this,

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,960
you should never have dug me out

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,420
from that pile of corpses.

50
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,409
If you were going to save me,

51
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,530
why did you abandon me alone in that dilapidated temple?

52
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,159
Zhiyi.

53
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,280
Drop the knife.

54
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Sister,

55
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
don't cry.

56
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,640
Only I can make you happy.

57
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
If even I make you this sad,

58
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,680
then I deserve to die too.

59
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,680
But dying by your hand

60
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,080
isn't so bad.

61
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
Sister.

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,400
The daffodils have bloomed.

63
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,000
They're truly beautiful.

64
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,960
Huaiqing.

65
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
Huaiqing.

66
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Master Ruan.

67
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,920
What's wrong?

68
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Suiqing.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,720
Get help quickly!

70
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Hurry, get someone!

71
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,530
I'll go get help.

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Hurry!

73
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,760
Take my car.

74
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Hurry!

75
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
Suiqing.

76
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,570
Looks like the medicine is taking effect.

77
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,600
Did you truly want to marry me, Sister?

78
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Master Ruan,

79
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
stay with me to see how this ends.

80
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
It's alright.

81
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,120
I've sent Second Brother to get help.

82
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
Zhiyi,

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,960
this play today

84
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,800
was beautifully performed.

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,080
But you must admit

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
I wrote it well.

87
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
If only Nanfeng

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,039
and Dalin

89
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,400
could see it.

90
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,520
I, Master Ruan,

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,890
am truly fortunate.

92
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,600
Suiqing.

93
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Suiqing.

94
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Suiqing.

95
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,240
Zhizhi,

96
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,280
are you listening?

97
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm here.

98
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm here.

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
Don't worry.

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
I won't forget you.

101
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
Whether you're on stage,

102
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,600
dazzling and brilliant,

103
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,920
or in everyday life,

104
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
lively and playful.

105
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
If I ever forgot you,

106
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,970
you'd hit me, wouldn't you?

107
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
It seems today

108
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,640
this play will end in tragedy.

109
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
Zhizhi.

110
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm here.

111
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,610
I want to ask you something.

112
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Can you answer me?

113
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
I often

114
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,560
dream of that

115
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,320
beautiful sunny morning.

116
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,530
With a red veil covering your face,

117
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
sitting at Nanfeng's doorway.

118
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,440
I want to ask you,

119
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
if we could do it all again,

120
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,680
would you still let me lift your veil?

121
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
I would.

122
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,720
I would.

123
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
Zhizhi,

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
if I say I like you,

125
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm willing to do anything for you.

126
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,640
Would you wear your red dress

127
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,610
and spend the rest of your life with me?

128
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Zhizhi.

129
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,760
I

130
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
like

131
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,360
you

132
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,160
too.

133
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,440
Suiqing, don't.

134
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Suiqing.

135
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,640
It's finally over.

136
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,180
What about you?

137
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,730
What will you do now?

138
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
What else can I do?

139
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,020
I don't know anything except performing opera.

140
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,280
However,

141
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
thanks to you,

142
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,200
I can perform opera properly again.

143
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
My master's uncle wrote to me.

144
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
I want to visit Shanghai.

145
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,780
I want to make Mule Society

146
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
a theater company where women can perform.

147
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Shanghai.

148
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,890
Shanghai crabs are delicious.

149
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
Bring a couple back for me to try.

150
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Won't they spoil?

151
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm just kidding.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,800
If it's you,

153
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
you'll definitely succeed.

154
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,660
What about him?

155
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,650
What are you planning to do?

156
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
What else can I do?

157
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
I'll take him with me.

158
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560
I probably

159
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,770
can't leave him for the rest of my life.

160
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,020
What about you?

161
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,720
What are your plans?

162
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,850
I heard there are new developments with the foreigners.

163
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,280
Since I've regained military authority,

164
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,810
I may have to leave Haicheng

165
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,530
to prepare for what's coming next.

166
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,480
When you return,

167
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,240
I'll save the best seat at Mule Society for you.

168
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,800
Good.

169
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
Mr. Chen,

170
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
I look forward to

171
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,420
hearing your 'Old Dreams' again.

172
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm leaving.

173
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,120
See you again.

174
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
See you again.

175
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,000
I shouldn't have bought you white clothes.

176
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They look good,

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,460
but they're hard to clean.

178
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,000
I meant you look good.

179
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,520
The Young Marshal has left.

180
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Let's go too.

181
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,400
Let's go to Suiyin Pavilion.

182
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
I have a gift for you.

183
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
I said,

184
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,520
let's go to Suiyin Pavilion, I...

185
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
Forget it then.

186
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Stop right there!

187
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,000
Ruan Suiqing!

188
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
Stop!

189
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
Don't run!

190
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Zhiyi,

191
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,570
I've written a new play.

192
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,530
Make it a hit with your singing.

193
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,080
It's a deal.
