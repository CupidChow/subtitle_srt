1
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,539
I know this will be hard for you to hear

2
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
but I believe

3
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,800
you have the right to know.

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,620
I kept hoping that someday

5
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,120
he would come back.

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,039
Someday

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,170
I could hear him perform again.

8
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,920
I never thought

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
that day would be our final goodbye.

10
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,720
I once said

11
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,759
Nanfeng was my window

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,720
that showed me the outside world.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,039
But I never imagined

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,860
that world outside

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
would be so cruel.

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
It's all because of my stubbornness.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
If I had known earlier

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,639
about your feelings for each other.

19
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,440
Perhaps...

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Mr. Chen.

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
I'm getting married.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,660
To a merchant from the Northeast.

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
A suitable match.

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
Zhiyi,

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,560
don't blame yourself.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
I've come to understand

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,770
that none of us did anything wrong.

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
If you must blame something,

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
blame

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
the era we were born into.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,320
This is the fan Nanfeng gave me when we first met.

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
Take it back to Mule Society.

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
I won't wait for him anymore.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
I envy you.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,040
You can do what you want.

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
And

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,280
you've kept your promise.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,730
If your senior were still here,

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
he would be very happy.

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
But Miss Xie,

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
about the marriage...

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,440
Zhiyi,

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,640
don't worry about me.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,680
I've married him in my heart.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
Nanfeng is gone.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
Haicheng,

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
I have nothing holding me back anymore.

49
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Suiqing.

50
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,640
This can't just end like this.

51
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,159
Indeed.

52
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,090
We need to do something for Nanfeng

53
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
and Miss Xie.

54
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Suiqing.

55
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,200
Zhiyi.

56
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
I have an idea.

57
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,320
Is this

58
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,490
the script you asked Senior Brother to revise back then?

59
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,520
I wanted to adapt 'Butterfly Lovers'

60
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,440
based on Nanfeng

61
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,400
and Miss Xie's story,

62
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,100
so I brought it to get Nanfeng's opinion.

63
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
Then things went wrong,

64
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
so I buried it.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
This time I want to...

66
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Of course.

67
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
If you...

68
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,120
What are you laughing at?

69
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,159
You had the same idea?

70
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
But let's be clear.

71
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,159
This isn't about wanting or not.

72
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,460
Then what is it?

73
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,880
A touching story

74
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,520
needs a moving ending.

75
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,640
Yes.

76
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
I'll revise it again.

77
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,480
You're still going to revise it?

78
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,340
She's getting married tomorrow.

79
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
It's time to show you

80
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,890
what the real Young Master Ruan is capable of.

81
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,680
Nanfeng once requested

82
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,320
that the man and woman in the play

83
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
couldn't be together

84
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
because of their different social status.

85
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Since then,

86
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,490
they were separated by life and death,

87
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,730
but in their hearts,

88
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,130
they never let go of each other.

89
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
If that's the case,

90
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,360
let's make everyone know

91
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,000
that this play is about

92
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,960
a couple who broke through traditional constraints

93
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,720
and finally ended up together.

94
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
That's right.

95
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,960
We must let everyone know.

96
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,920
You're awake.

97
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,010
I've completed my task.

98
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,320
The rest

99
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
is up to you now.

100
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm Chen Zhiyi from Mule Society.

101
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,620
On behalf of my senior,

102
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
I thank you, Mr. Xishan.

103
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Wait.

104
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
Miss Xie.

105
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
Miss Xie, please wait.

106
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,320
Miss Xie, hold on.

107
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
I have something for you.

108
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,200
Miss Xie, I have something for you.

109
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Miss Xie, I have something for you.

110
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
Miss Xie, where did this child come from?

111
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,440
Let me go! Get out of my way!

112
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
Can you take responsibility if we miss the auspicious time?

113
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,530
Listen to me. Keep walking.

114
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,200
Stop.

115
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,360
Miss Xie.

116
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Miss Xie.

117
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,180
I have something very important for you.

118
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
Let him give it to me.

119
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Here.

120
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,640
Brother Liang.

121
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Alright.

122
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,240
My tears cannot wash away my guilt.

123
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
I face you with shame.

124
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,240
Oh, my dear brother Liang.

125
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
Even if mountains and rivers separate us,

126
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:50,640
I will follow you in life and death.

127
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Thank you,

128
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,820
junior sister.

129
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Nanfeng!

130
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,040
Wait for me!

131
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,320
I saw you on stage.

132
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,320
Now

133
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,450
I should call you Boss Chen.

134
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,890
Senior Brother.

135
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
This is the last thing I can do for you.

136
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,440
I'll take your place

137
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,410
and escort Miss Xie to her wedding.

138
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,480
It's you.

139
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,680
What are you doing?

140
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
I burned the costume.

141
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,660
I'm sorry, sister.

142
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,119
So why did you do it?

143
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,500
You were the one who gave me that costume.

144
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
Why would you burn it?

145
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,839
He Zhen forced me to do it.

146
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,760
You told me yourself

147
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,140
that you checked the costume before giving it to me.

148
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,819
I only accepted it because I trusted you.

149
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,520
Even though I know

150
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,119
He Zhen and Master have never gotten along.

151
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,359
I also know

152
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,760
he's always wanted to get 'Old Dreams'.

153
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
But from the day I recognized you as family,

154
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,280
I believed

155
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
you were different from him.

156
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,280
Sister.

157
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,920
This is all He Zhen's scheme.

158
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,460
He pretended to have me deliver the costume,

159
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,930
knowing you wouldn't be suspicious of me.

160
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
Sister.

161
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,320
I never meant to hurt you.

162
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,760
I just thought

163
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,560
if you lost the competition,

164
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,040
he would get 'Old Dreams'

165
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,840
and then he wouldn't

166
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,970
bother you anymore.

167
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,420
What about Uncle Ruan?

168
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,220
Have you thought about what would happen to him?

169
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,080
You were there when I signed the challenge letter.

170
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,360
If I lose the competition,

171
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,880
Uncle Ruan will remain in prison.

172
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,280
Did you think about that?

173
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,600
This punch is payback.

174
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Suiqing.

175
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,400
Stop listening to his nonsense, will you?

176
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
He's just playing the victim here

177
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,840
to win your forgiveness

178
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
before crawling back to He Zhen for scraps.
