1
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,200
Mr. Lu,

2
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,320
you're right.

3
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Mandarin ducks and fish truly cannot be together.

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,490
Perhaps we were wrong from the beginning.

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,080
I came today to tell you

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,449
thank you for the experiences and memories you've given me.

7
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
I admit

8
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,960
I had feelings for you.

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,240
But it seems

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
this is where it must end.

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,920
I hope when you see old acquaintances again,

12
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,380
you'll have a lovely companion by your side.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Consider this my gift to you.

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,079
Likewise,

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,720
I'd like something from you

16
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
in exchange.

17
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,980
Cherish the spring blossoms,

18
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
don't forget

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,600
the joyful times.

20
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Mr. Lu,

21
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
take care.

22
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
In life,

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,320
I shall return.

24
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,400
In death,

25
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,920
I'll forever yearn.

26
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,040
When did you find out

27
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,500
that Nanfeng was leaving?

28
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,930
I just found out last night.

29
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,480
Master Ruan, you don't need to blame yourself.

30
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
I know

31
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
you tried your best to help.

32
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
It was just an emergency.

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,760
If I hadn't stepped in to mediate,

34
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,960
Mr. Lu's life might have been in danger.

35
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,680
That's why I took matters into my own hands.

36
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
I was only a moment late.

37
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,050
Why couldn't you wait a little longer?

38
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,240
Master Ruan.

39
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,800
What's done is done.

40
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
There's no point in discussing it further.

41
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,060
If I hadn't considered

42
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
your friendship with Mr. Lu,

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,250
I wouldn't have needed to tell you any of this.

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,920
You were the one who made the bet,

45
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,610
and you're the one who broke your promise.

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
The fact that this didn't end in tragedy

47
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,960
is already a blessing.

48
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
I didn't...

49
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,080
I...

50
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Let's allow Miss Chen

51
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,320
to see Mr. Lu off in peace.

52
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,250
At least it will give her some comfort.

53
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
Why did you come here?

54
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,440
It's freezing cold out here,

55
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
and you didn't even bring warm clothes.

56
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
These days,

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,880
you've suffered in there, Senior Brother.

58
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
You must not have eaten well.

59
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
And the prison is so damp.

60
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
It's my fault.

61
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,280
I couldn't save you.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,840
You've already done so much.

63
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm the one who was wrong,

64
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
I've let you and Master down.

65
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,700
How is Mule Society doing?

66
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,640
Everyone is fine.

67
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Master is well too.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
Don't worry,

69
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll take good care of Master.

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
This is from Master.

71
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,840
He wants you to take good care of yourself.

72
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,560
The one I worry about most

73
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
is you, Zhiyi.

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,560
After I'm gone,

75
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
you must behave

76
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,650
and stop being willful.

77
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
From now on,

78
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,890
there won't be anyone to protect you anymore.

79
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
Also,

80
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,480
if you don't understand something,

81
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,880
ask your Second and Third Senior Brothers.

82
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,370
Don't make Uncle Feng angry again.

83
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,640
Master is getting old.

84
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,250
He'll need your care in the future.

85
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,370
It's time for you to grow up.

86
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Alright.

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Remember,

88
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,850
what happened this time

89
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,560
was all my choice.

90
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,400
Ending up here

91
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
is my own doing

92
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,000
and has nothing to do with you.

93
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm grateful you went on stage for me that day

94
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180
and stood up for me.

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,330
From the bottom of my heart,

96
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,490
I've always wanted to see you on stage.

97
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Perhaps someday,

98
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll have to respectfully

99
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,160
call you 'Boss Chen.'

100
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
Senior Brother.

101
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,520
You must come back.

102
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,799
Master and I will wait for you.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There, there.

104
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,039
Don't cry.

105
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
My little junior sister,

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
you've always been so cheerful.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,860
Since you're seeing me off today,

108
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
you should be happy.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
That way, after I'm gone,

110
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
whenever I think of you,

111
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,620
I'll remember your smiling face.

112
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Oh, right.

113
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,130
I prepared a small gift for you,

114
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,000
but didn't have the chance to give it to you.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,730
It's in the small box in my room.

116
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,640
Remember to check it when you go back.

117
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,700
That's enough now.

118
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
We need to get going.

119
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,970
Mr. Lu, don't make it difficult for us.

120
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,250
Brother,

121
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,400
please do us a favor.

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
Give us a little more time.

123
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
What are you doing? Bribing us?

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,460
What do you take us for?

125
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,240
No, no.

126
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,160
Officer.

127
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
Here.

128
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm an acquaintance of your Colonel Zhang.

129
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,480
Why the long face?

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,800
This isn't like you, Young Master Ruan.

131
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
It seems

132
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,360
I won't be able to perform in your play anymore.

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
Don't talk nonsense.

134
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,760
I could have saved you.

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,320
Suiqing.

136
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,220
My junior and the Mule Society

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,920
I leave them in your care.

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,640
Rest assured.

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,810
Where there is righteousness,

140
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
I will defend it with my life.

141
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,480
Let's go.

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Senior Brother.

143
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,080
You must come back.

144
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Likewise.

145
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,920
I also want something from Mr. Lu.

146
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,480
In exchange.

147
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,210
Love the spring blossoms with all your heart.

148
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,320
Don't forget

149
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,400
the joyful times.

150
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
Actually, that day I...

151
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,400
It's okay.

152
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,280
I know.

153
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
Getting all the newspapers in Haicheng to agree

154
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,900
was never going to be easy.

155
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,680
You've seen everything.

156
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,360
When Second Brother showed me the newspaper last night,

157
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,220
I had a feeling this would happen.

158
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,400
If I had arrived in time,

159
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,210
I could have saved Nanfeng.

160
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,520
It's all resolved now.

161
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,570
Thankfully, Young Master He helped save my brother's life.

162
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,050
This is probably

163
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,530
the best outcome we could hope for.

164
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
How is the old troupe master?

165
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Young Master!

166
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,760
Young Master!

167
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,280
Zhiyi.

168
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,480
I need to leave the city for a while.

169
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
It's urgent.

170
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,140
Take care of yourself.

171
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,740
I'll be back tomorrow.

172
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,970
I saw my senior fellow apprentice.

173
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
He's doing well.

174
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,600
The money you gave him,

175
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,360
he accepted it.

176
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
It's getting cold.

177
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
You're still sick.

178
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,010
Let me help you back inside.

179
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
Father.

180
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,080
Father.

181
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
She's dead.

182
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,330
How could she die after being back for just a few days?

183
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,360
This girl,

184
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,560
a few days ago,

185
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,200
came back in a panic,

186
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,960
with all sorts of baggage,

187
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
saying she got in trouble at the Xie household and was kicked out.

188
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,600
That very night she fell ill.

189
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,640
The medicine didn't help.

190
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,880
Last night suddenly,

191
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,180
she just...

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Where's the body?

193
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,839
Already buried.

194
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,440
The villagers said

195
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,680
she brought something unclean back from the city.

196
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,960
I was afraid of gossip,

197
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,480
so I hurriedly buried her.

198
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,240
Did she bring anything back with her before she died?

199
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,040
Yes, yes.

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,040
Tell me the truth.

201
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,000
How did your daughter really die?

202
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,640
Such expensive perfume.

203
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,300
A maid like her couldn't afford this, could she?

204
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,160
How would I know about that?

205
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,800
No.

206
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
What exactly do you want?

207
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,320
If you hadn't just told me

208
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
that you were my daughter's friend,

209
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,080
I wouldn't have told you any of this.

210
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Take this money back.

211
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
Please leave now. Go.

212
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
Did you take hush money from someone

213
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,360
to conceal your daughter's real cause of death?

214
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,020
If you don't tell me the truth,

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,340
I'll take you to the authorities.

216
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,170
Who's there?

217
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,560
The murderers, right?

218
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,640
You're working with them.

219
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,120
Killing to silence witnesses.

220
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Are you also involved in what happened to Lu Nanfeng?
