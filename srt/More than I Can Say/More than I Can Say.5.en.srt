1
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,600
If you back down now,

2
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,280
that's not like my junior sister at all.

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,880
Nanfeng,

4
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
why are you making things worse too?

5
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm not going.

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,080
Who wants to watch you perform for Miss Xie?

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,800
I've told you before,

8
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
I'll handle the matter with Miss Xie properly.

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,120
Mule Society

10
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
will always be my home.

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,320
This gathering

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,060
is also to express my true feelings to her through song,

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,720
and after that, we'll no longer associate.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Alright.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,330
For my performance,

16
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
I trust my junior sister's makeup skills

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,960
the most.

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,560
This time,

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
consider it your senior brother asking for your help.

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,039
Really?

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Of course.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
However,

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
we can't let Uncle Feng know.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,460
We need to ask someone for help first.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
Why are you looking at me?

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,760
You want me to figure it out again?

27
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
I don't care.

28
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,880
You have to take me there.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,640
I just remembered something.

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
That night when we were drinking,

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
didn't you promise me a favor?

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
The honorable Master Ruan,

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,690
you must keep your word.

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,610
I wasn't that drunk.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Fine, fine, fine.

36
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Be careful.

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440
You must be tired.

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,160
It's fine.

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,220
They haven't left yet.

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Stop playing around.

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,640
Let her out quickly.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,700
Or she'll suffocate soon.

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,000
You.

44
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
Performing in front of your beloved,

45
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
how does it feel?

46
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Why don't you two elope today?

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Give that old master Xie a surprise.

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,360
Show him what true devotion looks like,

49
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,420
flying together like a pair of birds.

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
But anyway,

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,640
have you seen my revised version of 'Butterfly Lovers'?

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,500
You two are the real inspiration.

53
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
A pair of lovers

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,840
from different social classes.

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Breaking through the constraints of social class

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
and finally being together.

57
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,960
Just thinking about it makes for a great piece.

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
It's a pity

59
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,040
I haven't finished revising it yet.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Suiqing.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,420
I want to perform your new script.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,880
Although it's not finished,

63
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,159
there are some things

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
I want to sing for her to hear.

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,240
Really?

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
Sure.

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,000
I thought you didn't want to perform that play anymore.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,460
But a script written by me,

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,810
performed by you will definitely be a hit.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,450
I've seen the new script you wrote.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,440
Stop it.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,970
Go get your makeup done now.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Will you let me see it?

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Are you going to show me?

75
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
You wouldn't understand anyway.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,330
Senior Brother.

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
It's time for you to get dressed.

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll help you with your headpiece later.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
All right.

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,450
Wait for my call.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,320
Let me see it.

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,960
Zhiyi.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Fine, I'll look.

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,520
Go put on your makeup.

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll deal with you later.

86
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
You two get your makeup done first.

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,409
I'll go check out front.

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
After all, it's the Xie family patriarch's birthday.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,640
Don't run around.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,600
Go ahead.

91
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
Master Ruan.

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,840
Mr. Lu.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
Excuse me.

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Our lady would like to speak with you.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Please meet her in the backyard.

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
I understand.

97
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
Go ahead, senior.

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,240
I was thinking yesterday.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
You were right.

100
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Since you've explained everything to me,

101
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
I should trust you.

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,970
Otherwise you'll say I'm being difficult again.

103
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,010
I've already explained things with Miss Xie.

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,720
She's coming to see me today.

105
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,480
It must be something important.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,660
I'll be right back.

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,420
Get everything ready.

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,500
We'll apply the makeup when I return.

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
You'd better hurry up.

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,320
If you come back late,

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,760
I might steal your role.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Thank you, Uncle Xie.

113
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,400
My father is feeling unwell today

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
and couldn't come in person.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
He sent me to wish you a happy birthday instead.

116
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,280
I hope you don't mind.

117
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,200
No need to be so formal.

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
You're welcome here.

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,960
Your father and I

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
have always been good friends.

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Please send him my regards.

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I certainly will.

123
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,200
I heard

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,640
that today you've invited

125
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,570
performers from Mule Society for your celebration.

126
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,500
Next time for such occasions,

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
please let me know.

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
I can have people from Fuchun Hall

129
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
make proper arrangements for you.

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,260
My dear nephew,

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,210
are you complaining that I didn't hire your Fuchun Hall?

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,660
I know your father wants to expand into the business world lately.

133
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,240
I've told him many times

134
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
the time isn't right yet.

135
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,820
He should first settle matters with the theater guild.

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,060
Though we make our living among various trades,

137
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,690
there's still a hierarchy to respect.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,600
He needs some reputation and status

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,680
before I can introduce him to those business leaders.

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,680
By the way,

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
I heard that recently

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
he's become quite close with Chief Zhang from the police department.

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
That's quite good, isn't it?

144
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
You're right, Uncle Xie.

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll remember your advice

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,049
and discuss it thoroughly with my father.

147
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,559
Good.

148
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,960
Uncle Xie.

149
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,960
Thanks.

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Uncle Xie,

151
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,260
happy birthday

152
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,410
and long life to you.

153
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,680
Thanks.

154
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Senior,

155
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,420
I'm here to help with your headdress.

156
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,840
Senior?

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Senior?

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,880
Senior?

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
Why does the singing style sound different today?

160
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,320
Senior,

161
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
please rehearse silently first.

162
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,740
I'll be back later.

163
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,080
But we're on after two more acts.

164
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
We need to get ready quickly.

165
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,180
Where is everyone?

166
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,840
You two really are like siblings, aren't you?

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
Is the standard for joining Mule Society

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
being undisciplined?

169
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
You want to go on stage but can't,

170
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,100
and when it's his turn, he's gone.

171
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,000
He couldn't have really eloped, could he?

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Impossible.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Senior

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
promised me.

175
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,960
Besides,

176
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
no matter what,

177
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
he would never leave the audience waiting.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Senior,

179
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,360
it's really time to get dressed.

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,820
We're about to go on stage.

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,980
What are you doing?

182
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
Go find Senior quickly.

183
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,600
I can't go out.

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Chen Zhiyi,

185
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
this isn't a game.

186
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
Your previous performances were minor matters,

187
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,520
but this time is different.

188
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,760
Lu Nanfeng is the lead performer.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
Everyone knows him too well.

190
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,700
If you go up there, you'll easily be discovered.

191
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,880
Chen Zhiyi,

192
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,560
secretly replacing the lead is a small matter,

193
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,840
but if they discover you're a girl,

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,240
it would be a fatal blow to the Mule Society.

195
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,130
Are you listening to me?

196
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,360
Instead of trying to persuade me,

197
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
you should hurry and find Senior.

198
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,840
If you find him now, there might still be time.

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
We can't have no one on stage

200
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
when it's time for the lead to perform.

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
The Mule Society doesn't operate that way.

202
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
Now,

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
go tell Hetao

204
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
and say

205
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
that

206
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,440
Senior's voice isn't well,

207
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,160
and ask Third Senior to fill in first

208
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,420
to push Senior's performance back a bit.

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,800
This way,

210
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,840
when Senior returns,

211
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
even if the audience has to wait a while,

212
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,450
it's better than having no show at all.

213
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,520
Senior,

214
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm coming in.

215
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,920
Are you alright? Wait-

216
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Wait.

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,280
Chen Zhiyi.

218
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,130
I'll go find Lu Nanfeng now.

219
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,160
You must control yourself.

220
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,680
Do you hear me?

221
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't do anything rash.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
If all else fails, we'll just have to disappoint them once.

223
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,160
At worst,

224
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,690
the Mule Society will lose face this one time.

225
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,220
Young Master Ruan.

226
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,340
Senior Sister.

227
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,600
You!

228
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,120
You shameless scoundrel!

229
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,280
Guards!

230
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Guards!

231
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
Seize him!

232
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,900
Where is everyone?

233
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,980
What's wrong with Nanfeng today?

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,400
Xiao Hetao!

235
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
Xiao Hetao!

236
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
Coming!

237
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Where's Nanfeng?

238
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,040
Where did Nanfeng go?

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm talking to you!

240
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Where is Nanfeng?

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,920
Useless!

242
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,120
This...

243
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,480
This clearly isn't Nanfeng!

244
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,200
This...

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,410
Is this that troublesome girl?

246
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Who is this person?

247
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
Why is she so strange?

248
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,020
She doesn't look like Boss Lu.

249
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Speak up!

250
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
I can't find Senior Brother.

251
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,440
When I went in, Senior Sister was already in costume.

252
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
I thought

253
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,160
I could fill in for Senior Brother.

254
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Nonsense!

255
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
Fill in?

256
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
If the audience recognizes you,

257
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,800
don't talk about filling in.

258
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
You'll be paying with your life.

259
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,840
Useless.

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
What's going on here?

261
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,640
Isn't that Mr. Lu?

262
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,880
Then who's on stage?

263
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,840
That's clearly not Lu Nanfeng on stage.

264
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
The height and figure are all wrong.

265
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Looks like a child.

266
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,280
I bet it's a woman.

267
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,920
What's going on?

268
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,080
Mule Theater secretly switched performers.

269
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
They're treating us like fools!

270
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,160
Get off the stage!

271
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
Get off! Get off!

272
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,920
Get down!

273
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,780
Get off! We don't want to hear you.

274
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,770
We came to hear Boss Lu perform!

275
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
Go down.

276
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Ask Mr. Lu to come up.

277
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,960
Go down now.

278
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
Get going.

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
Go down quickly.

280
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,240
Come down right away.

281
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Go.

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,400
Go,

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
and bring your manager here.
