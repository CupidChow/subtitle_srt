1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,130
I have another idea.

2
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
But I need everyone's cooperation.

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,220
Young Marshal,

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,840
what do you think of Ye Xiaoqiu's figure

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,039
and her dancing?

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
Magnificent!

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,759
Good!

8
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,240
Very good!

9
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,420
This Miss Ye is really something.

10
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,840
As long as it pleases you.

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,560
Good!

12
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,520
Very good!

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Have you heard

14
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,720
that Mule Society sent a woman?

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
If the Young Marshal hadn't approved,

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
she would've been arrested.

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Is that so?

18
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,800
I heard about this long ago.

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,720
Zhiyi.

20
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,000
Brothers.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,480
I'll handle

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,660
the costume issue.

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
Fortunately,

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
there's still some time before Zhiyi performs.

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,730
Several other troupes need to perform first.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,420
You need to put on your makeup now.

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,690
To prevent any further incidents,

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
please make sure

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,560
to buy me some time until I return.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Zhiyi.

31
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
Trust me.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
This time,

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
I'll definitely make it.

34
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
Gao Lishi has already gone on stage.

35
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,640
Now we're waiting for the Imperial Concubine.

36
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,970
Why hasn't Manager Chen gone on stage yet?

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,880
Is she getting cold feet?

38
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,560
After all, she's a woman who's never performed before.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,280
That's right.

40
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
Indeed.

41
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,970
As for the Imperial Concubine,

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
being a lady of high status,

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,159
she might be late

44
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,170
to make the audience wait a bit.

45
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
How long have we been waiting?

46
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
What's going on?

47
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,280
If you ask me,

48
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,040
this woman definitely can't perform opera well.

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
Look.

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
The Imperial Concubine is on stage.

51
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
This Mr. Chen is impressive.

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Interesting.

53
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Good.

54
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,280
Good.

55
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Good.

56
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,640
Hello, Mr. Chen.

57
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,280
Hello there, Mr. Chen.

58
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,520
Hello.

59
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Mr. Chen.

60
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
Hello.

61
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
What a wonderful performance. It was brilliant.

62
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,380
Really excellent.

63
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,940
Young Marshal.

64
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,300
These audience members are something else.

65
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,920
Chen Zhiyi's performance of 'The Drunken Beauty'

66
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
is completely different

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
from the older generations.

68
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,440
Just look at everyone's reaction.

69
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,970
The changes are excellent.

70
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,450
Mr. Chen is impressive.

71
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,980
Young Marshal.

72
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,280
So regarding this time's top prize

73
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
and

74
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,500
the ownership of 'Old Dreams'

75
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
what do you think?

76
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
You've been here for so long now.

77
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Our Fuchun Hall also...

78
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
And you call yourself an opera performer.

79
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,720
Can't you see?

80
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,360
It must be the Mule Society.

81
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Given the chance,

82
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,000
I'd really like to meet this Mr. Chen again.

83
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,800
Let's go.

84
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,960
Suiqing.

85
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,080
This is the place.

86
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
It's here.

87
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,500
But where is everyone?

88
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Zhiyi.

89
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,760
Here we come!

90
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,800
Long live Mule Society!

91
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Now,

92
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
let's welcome...

93
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
Manager Chen!

94
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:19,760
Manager Chen!

95
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,320
Manager Chen!

96
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,620
Hello, Uncle Ruan.

97
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Hello, Miss Chen.

98
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Boss,

99
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,440
say a few words this time.

100
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,560
Yes, Zhiyi,

101
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,420
say something.

102
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
This time,

103
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
I won't run away.

104
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
We were afraid you might!

105
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Manager Leng,

106
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
what's the meaning of this?

107
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
The competition just ended,

108
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,160
and you bring people to our humble place.

109
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
What brings you here?

110
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Mule Society is celebrating their victory today.

111
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,040
We from Yunqi Society came to congratulate them.

112
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,280
Isn't that normal?

113
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,520
What's wrong?

114
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,120
Not welcome?

115
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,860
Of course you're welcome.

116
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,080
It's our honor to have Yunqi Society here.

117
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,400
But there's something

118
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I need to clarify with Manager Leng.

119
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,090
The accident that happened on stage today

120
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,720
has nothing to do with Mule Society.

121
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
I give you my word.

122
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,760
Yulou,

123
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,320
is it that wherever this old man goes,

124
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,480
bad things happen?

125
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,200
Master,

126
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,920
it's not always the case.

127
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,920
Old Han,

128
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,400
so you're the director of Yunqi Society.

129
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,810
You can still recognize me even in this disguise.

130
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
I thought after winning the competition,

131
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
you wouldn't recognize this old man anymore.

132
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,160
How could that be?

133
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
If it weren't for you,

134
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,260
I wouldn't have...

135
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,780
If it weren't for me, what?

136
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
If Manager Leng hadn't fallen,

137
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,690
our Zhiyi might not have won the competition.

138
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Zhiyi,

139
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,960
come with me for a moment.

140
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,520
This is Feng Sheng.

141
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,120
So,

142
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,720
my master's master had three disciples.

143
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
Yes,

144
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
your master,

145
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
He Zhen,

146
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
and me.

147
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
But remember,

148
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,080
only your master

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,000
devoted his entire life

150
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,400
to Mule Society.

151
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
If

152
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,320
He Zhen left Mule Society to start his own business,

153
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
then why did you leave?

154
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,320
I...

155
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
That old man, your master,

156
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,940
he never told you about me.

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
Perhaps he was too disappointed in me.

158
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Have you heard about the performance

159
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,360
of Mule Society 30 years ago?

160
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
You mean that sensational event in Haicheng?

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes.

162
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
Of course I've heard about it.

163
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,760
That's when my master made his name.

164
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,880
Indeed.

165
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,520
To the outside world,

166
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,600
it was just a grand performance.

167
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,610
But for Mule Opera Troupe at that time,

168
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,040
it was a competition that determined their fate.

169
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,560
Competition?

170
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,480
Your grand-master at that time

171
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,810
had already made plans.

172
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
He wanted to use this performance

173
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,280
in front of all the opera fans in Haicheng

174
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,640
to announce the new successor of Mule Troupe.

175
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,880
So,

176
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,520
that competition was to

177
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,410
select a new troupe leader.

178
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,690
Did you really think

179
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I asked you to get close to Chen Zhiyi

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,260
just for you to reunite with your family?

181
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,520
What I want is 'Old Dreams.'

182
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Useless fool.

183
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me tell you,

184
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,420
even if you help Chen Zhiyi win the competition,

185
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
she still won't think highly of you.

186
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
You know very well

187
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,000
what kind of person you are.

188
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,200
But I didn't know about your plan

189
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,160
to burn the costumes.

190
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
Do I need to

191
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,500
report everything I do to you?

192
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,640
You're just a dog I raised.

193
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,090
How dare you act on your own.

194
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
You damned thing.

195
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
I'll beat you to death.

196
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
I'll kill you.

197
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,520
Don't you know

198
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
how important 'Old Dreams' is to me?

199
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,360
Just like I don't understand

200
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,820
your relationship with your sister.

201
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,840
From today on,

202
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,760
get out of the He mansion.

203
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,160
Until you realize

204
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,880
who your real master is.

205
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,920
He said my master cheated.

206
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,000
That was just He Zhen's wishful thinking.

207
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,680
He

208
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,020
thought he'd made connections with some social elites

209
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,060
and believed that in such a city-wide performance,

210
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
he would definitely win.

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,730
But who would have thought,

212
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,440
old Lu Shun not only sang well

213
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,920
but was also brilliant at adapting plays.

214
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,200
His performance

215
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,360
captivated all the opera fans in Haicheng.

216
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,210
He Zhen couldn't believe it

217
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,440
and thought your master was just like him,

218
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
pulling strings behind the scenes.

219
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
The most ironic part is

220
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,080
those people who were close to He Zhen

221
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,280
unexpectedly

222
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,930
changed their minds at the last minute

223
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,720
and voted for your master.

224
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,040
Since my master won the competition,

225
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,730
then the ownership of 'Old Dreams' should...

226
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,740
The ownership of 'Old Dreams'

227
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,680
was passed to your master.

228
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,359
But the head of Mule Opera Troupe,

229
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,079
your grand-master, wanted to pass it to He Zhen.

230
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,520
Grand-master...
