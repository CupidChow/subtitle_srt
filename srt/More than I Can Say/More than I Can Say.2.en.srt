1
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
You little brat!

2
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
Want to read books?

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
Go to a private school then.

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,120
Why waste your time in our opera troupe?

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
For some worthless book,

6
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,890
you let your senior go on stage and ruin the Mule Society.

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,240
I'll show you books!

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
I'll teach you to be a deserter!

9
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,759
Master Feng.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,479
I asked Xiaowu to switch clothes with me.

11
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,360
If you want to punish someone,

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
punish me instead.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
The troupe leader spoils you every day.

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,360
You think I don't dare to hit you?

15
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,160
Fine!

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
You want to take the blame for him.

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,020
I sealed it for the Mule Opera Troupe.

18
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,880
I won't indulge you.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,440
Take him away.

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,680
Come on.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Come on!

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,760
Come!

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
Chen Zhiyi.

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Day after day

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
you just want to run on stage.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
If you want to hit me, just do it.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,040
Stop wasting words.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,300
Still being stubborn?

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,579
I'll show you what stubborn gets you.

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Chen Zhiyi!

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
Have you thought about

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,320
if others find out about this,

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,800
how will the Mule Opera Troupe

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
continue to perform?

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,050
Who says women can't perform on stage?

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
You disrespect the law!

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,250
I'll beat you for your disrespect!

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,920
The law!

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,880
Seal it!

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,740
Let me tell you,

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
the Qing Dynasty is gone.

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
Who says women can't perform on stage anymore?

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Only you people still cling to these outdated rules.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,260
Sooner or later

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
you'll regret this one day.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,840
Whether I'll regret it or not, I don't know,

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,960
but today,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I'll make you regret it for sure.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,760
I'll make you pay for wanting to go on stage,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
for being disrespectful,

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,600
for not respecting me.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,160
I...

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,880
Master.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Nanfeng.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
What?

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,420
Are you also pleading for her?

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Master.

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,130
I'm not here to plead for mercy.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,610
I'm here to accept punishment.

60
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,840
Since I achieved some success,

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,050
my junior sister has always taken care of my daily needs.

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,930
She is clever and obedient,

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,170
and has quite an interest in opera.

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
It's all my fault.

65
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Sometimes I

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
disregard the rules.

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,720
I thought perhaps one day

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,920
she might have her own place in this world.

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,160
It is I who

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
failed in my duty as senior brother.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
If she has committed a grave mistake today,

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,540
I am willing to share her punishment.

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,940
I hope Master will grant this.

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Senior Brother.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Uncle Feng.

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Go ahead.

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Master.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
When my junior sister made a mistake,

79
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
we brothers all share the responsibility.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm willing to accept the lead performer's punishment.

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm willing to accept your punishment, Master.

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm willing to accept your punishment, Master.

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm willing to accept your punishment, Master.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,880
That's enough.

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Since

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,420
you've all been punished,

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,500
you should learn your lesson.

88
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,159
Zhiyi.

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
Today,

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,120
your brothers pleaded for you.

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,240
It was more about

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
personal relationships.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,460
This is your good fortune.

94
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm happy for you.

95
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,800
But this opera profession

96
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,680
is far more complex than you imagine.

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Even your senior brother

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
may not fully understand it.

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,700
You still have a long way to go.

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,640
Figure it out gradually.

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Dismissed.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
You

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
little bastards.

104
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,440
Junior.

105
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Senior.

106
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Junior,

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,320
Junior,

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
are you okay?

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,480
What am I going to do with you?

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,720
Why were you hesitating?

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
You were just one step away from getting on stage.

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,210
How could you let yourself get caught?

113
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
I think you might just have bad luck.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
Otherwise, such a good plan...

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,840
How could it just...

116
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,700
It's all because of that Feng Cun.

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
If he hadn't suddenly appeared backstage,

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,840
I would have definitely made it on stage this time.

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,520
Most importantly,

120
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,180
I even caused my senior to kneel down and beg for mercy on my behalf.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,680
He's the lead actor!

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,440
You're still afraid of those rules, aren't you?

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
I think in the future,

124
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
you should just stop thinking about getting on stage.

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
You know,

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
that damn Feng Cun,

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,900
what's he got to be so proud of?

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Can he paint facial patterns?

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Can he carry props?

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,080
Can he even perform opera? He...

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,760
But honestly, your skills still need work.

132
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
You've snuck on stage so many times,

133
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,240
but I've never seen you perform with Nanfeng.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,770
What roles have you played?

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,120
Maids,

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,720
soldiers...

137
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
How dare you look down on me!

138
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You'll regret underestimating me.

139
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
You really can't do anything,

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
and you won't even let people say it.

141
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
Just watch me carefully.

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm waiting.

143
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,720
Well,

144
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,460
that was actually quite good.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,840
See what happens when you underestimate me?

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
Now you know.

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
I'm impressed.

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,010
It seems those people have eyes but can't see talent,

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,500
unlike me, Master Ruan, who has the fortune to hear you.

150
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,890
Stop joking around.

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,760
I know you're just trying to comfort me.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
Tell me,

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,880
when will I be able to perform

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,240
on stage with my senior?

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,000
I have such a small wish,

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,480
why is it so hard to achieve?

157
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,640
Master says I have good aptitude,

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,200
it's just a pity I'm a girl.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,720
What's wrong with being a girl?

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
Are you crazy?

161
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
What I mean is that girls should sing when they deserve to.

162
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,640
The audience isn't deaf.

163
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,360
They can tell for themselves what sounds good.

164
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
If all else fails,

165
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll build an entire theater

166
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,000
just for you.

167
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Promise?

168
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,760
You build the stage,

169
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,240
I'll perform the opera.

170
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It's a deal.

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,720
I hope that day really comes.

172
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,920
If Huaiqing could see it,

173
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,220
that would be even better.

174
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Who's Qing?

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,600
He's my neighbor's younger brother.

176
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,410
Our families have been friends for generations.

177
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,240
We grew up together.

178
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
But then,

179
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,460
foreigners invaded the city,

180
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,400
and our parents were killed.

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,000
We had to make a living together.

182
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
But...

183
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,120
I lost him later.

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,290
If it weren't for my master and senior,

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
I probably

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,440
wouldn't be able

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,320
to sit here drinking with you now.

188
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
So,

189
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,520
I have

190
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
two wishes

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,720
in this lifetime.

192
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
First,

193
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,800
to perform on stage with my senior.

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,000
Second,

195
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,360
to find my brother

196
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,960
and tell him

197
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Don't worry,

199
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,680
I'll help you find him.

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,240
I'm never drinking with you again.

201
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,610
You fall asleep just like that,

202
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,440
like a little pig.

203
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,440
Anyway, what's done is done.

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
About the veil incident,

205
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
don't ever mention it again.

206
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's move on.

207
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Good night.

208
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
No way.

209
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,480
You

210
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
have to agree to one condition.

211
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,640
Will you agree or not?

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,760
Yes, I agree.

213
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,680
It's a deal.

214
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,220
Thank you all for your help today.

215
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
Take care, Manager Feng.

216
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,660
Give my regards to the old master.

217
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
Thank you for your patronage, sir.

218
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,560
Our Mule Society

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,220
still relies on your support.

220
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Please stay.

221
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,040
Please wait.

222
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Where is Nanfeng?

223
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,600
Why isn't he here?

224
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,960
He should come greet you.

225
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,800
It's fine, really.

226
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,640
Mr. Lu probably isn't good at socializing.

227
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
As a performer...

228
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,360
I came only to perform.

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,520
Now that the show is over,

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,010
I don't wish to impose any further.

231
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,540
I hope you understand.

232
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,680
Mr. Lu.

233
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,920
Will you

234
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,680
come back again?

235
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,260
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

236
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,680
If you enjoy opera,

237
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
you can come to Mule Society.

238
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,890
I'll reserve a seat for you.

239
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,300
If you're concerned about coming as a woman,

240
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,720
you can take this.

241
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,800
Someone will escort you to a private box.

242
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,000
Consider it my thanks

243
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,860
for covering for me today.

244
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Miss.

245
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Miss.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Have you seen the young lady?

247
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,680
It is like leaves in late autumn.

248
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
Mountains in the south, waters in the north.

249
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,960
Half a life so lengthy.

250
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Thoughts keep me from sleep.

251
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Thus I write to you.

252
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
Thanks to heaven's blessing,

253
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,140
I have had the fortune to meet you.

254
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,360
I, Nanfeng,

255
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,000
am deeply grateful.

256
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,520
You understand music,

257
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,540
harmonize with my melody,

258
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
recognize my chimes.

259
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,080
You are the only one who does.

260
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,120
Recently, there are many affairs at Mule Society.

261
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,250
I will handle them as soon as possible,

262
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,040
then express my true feelings.

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,840
Miss,

264
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,920
here's freshly made honey pear paste.

265
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
It will warm you up.

266
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,600
In my spare time,

267
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,440
I found the opera you performed on stage.

268
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,980
Your voice and image appeared again.

269
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,760
Your voice

270
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,160
is like jade feathers on southern mountains.

271
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
Hearing it makes me sing.

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,440
The opera says

273
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,240
that longing thoughts

274
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,099
should be kept in moderation.

275
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,920
Yet since first meeting you...

276
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,770
Like an old friend returning home,

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,359
I think of you often,

278
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,480
unable to forget.

279
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,440
May the southern wind know my heart,

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,200
as I long for my beloved's return.

281
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
Thanks to heaven's blessing,

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
I've had the honor of meeting you.

283
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960
Nanfeng is deeply grateful and aware.

284
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,050
I can't listen to this anymore.

285
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,920
What else?

286
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,210
Stop reading it.

287
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,640
Finishing it will affect my digestion.

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
If you ask me,

289
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,050
you should return this letter right away.

290
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
I helped you get on stage

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
because I couldn't stand those stubborn old folks.

292
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,440
But stealing letters is a matter of principle.

293
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,040
If Nanfeng blames someone for this,

294
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,160
I won't speak up for you.

295
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
I don't need you to speak for me.

296
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
I'll take responsibility for my own actions.

297
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,140
For heaven's sake,

298
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,940
can we stop this nonsense?

299
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
A thousand mountains, ten thousand mountains,

300
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,440
no matter how high they stand,

301
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,700
they cannot block the red thread of fate.

302
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
My new suit.

303
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,760
Where did you get it from?

304
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,100
I'm not giving it back.

305
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,960
I'll wait until he gets anxious and comes looking for it.

306
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
I want to see

307
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
who's more important to him -

308
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,040
me or the Xie family's daughter.

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,320
Give it to me.

310
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
Pay the bill.

311
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,690
It's your treat.

312
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
It's completely useless.

313
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
And I wanted to treat you to dinner,

314
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
go whistle for it.

315
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
Watch where you're going!

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,320
You blind little girl!

317
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
Are you being reasonable?

318
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,610
You're the one who suddenly appeared.

319
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,520
What are you doing?
