1
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,840
Alright.

2
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,560
The Young Marshal is about to enter the city.

3
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,400
We need to prepare well.

4
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Fengshen is already dead.

5
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,130
You naturally need to pay more attention.

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,440
Find the whereabouts of 'Old Dreams' as soon as possible.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,240
Perhaps

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,000
the Young Marshal's arrival

9
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
is a good opportunity.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Father,

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
I still don't understand something.

12
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,400
Speak.

13
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,960
Since you've already taken down the Mule Society,

14
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,800
why are you still so obsessed with 'Old Dreams'?

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
Obsessed?

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,360
I just want to take back what rightfully belongs to me.

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,770
Look at this little dog.

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,540
Although it's made of white jade,

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,730
at the end of the day,

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
it's just a plaything.

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,000
Take this.

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
It's for you.

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,010
Just do what you're supposed to do.

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
As for everything else,

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
you don't need to know.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Yes.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
You were watching so intently just now.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,090
Why did you suddenly leave?

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,120
I...

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Tell me.

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
How was my singing?

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Tell me now.

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,079
Don't. I'm ticklish.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
How was my singing?

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Good.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,880
Stop tickling me.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,000
Stop right there.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
If my singing was good, why are you running away?

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Stop right there. I wasn't running.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Stop.

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
Actually,

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
it's not that I didn't want to watch,

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,770
I just couldn't bear to watch anymore.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,850
Couldn't bear to watch?

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Seeing you shining so brilliantly on stage

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,960
reminded me of the past,

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
of how I once destroyed everything.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
I know your talent.

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
Anyone who hears you sing

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
will surely love it.

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,120
Everyone who heard me sing

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,820
ended up suffering because of me.

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
If I hadn't insisted on performing,

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,940
my master wouldn't have died,

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,980
my senior wouldn't have left,

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
and Mule Society

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,980
wouldn't have disbanded.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,050
You were from Mule Society?

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,840
I don't think there was anything wrong with what you did.

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,880
Back then, you

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,720
were just in a desperate situation

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,980
and chose to save the show in your own way.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,519
In my opinion,

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,399
everything that happened afterward

65
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,660
had nothing to do with that performance.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Do you

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
really think so?

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,240
Your friend was right.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
What's wrong with being a girl?

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,100
As long as we sing well,

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
we will someday

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,320
step onto our own stage.

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
Actually,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
I really envy you.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,210
You don't have so many burdens,

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
you're so brave,

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,520
and you can do what you want.

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,159
You're not me.

79
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,159
How do you know I don't have burdens?

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,560
However,

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,800
courage is necessary.

82
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,720
As long as I can perform on stage,

83
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
I'll do anything.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
But girls performing on stage breaks the rules.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,280
Aren't you afraid they'll throw eggs at you

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,440
or cabbages?

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,640
They throw money at me too.

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,080
I lost my mother when I was little.

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,650
My father thought I was useless

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,720
so he sold me to a costume merchant.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Because of that,

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,490
I became connected to theater.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,400
I used the opportunity of delivering clothes

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,800
to sneak into the theater troupe and listen to performances.

95
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,320
Gradually,

96
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,500
I became fascinated by the characters in the plays.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,520
And then?

98
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Then...

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Then I ran away.

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,560
But

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,440
I was tricked by a brothel madam.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
She said

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,720
if I went with her obediently,

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,220
I could perform in operas.

105
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,720
She actually hired

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,320
an old master from a theater troupe to teach us.

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,159
Since then,

108
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,770
I've made my living by performing.

109
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,920
But

110
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
I know

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
what's performed in brothels

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,700
is mostly vulgar entertainment.

113
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
I always think,

114
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,440
Life is already hard enough.

115
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,920
It's even harder for girls.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
If the plays performed

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,560
were about genuine, passionate emotions,

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,160
wouldn't that be wonderful?

119
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,760
The stories I imagine,

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,720
how wonderful if they could happen to me.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
I long

122
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
to become such a person.

123
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
So I think,

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
I must perform,

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,330
perform what I want to perform,

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
become who I want to be.

127
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Only when I'm on stage

128
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,280
am I truly myself.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,680
So,

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
it's not that you don't want to perform,

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,320
you're afraid to perform.

132
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,920
I

133
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
am truly afraid.

134
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Forget it.

135
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,480
Not performing isn't the end of the world.

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,800
We can still survive.

137
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,500
But you need to think clearly.

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,520
Is that really what you want?

139
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
We've been talking for so long,

140
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,920
where is your home?

141
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Why did you run away?

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
I had a fight with my family

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,090
and snuck out after things blew up.

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,680
That's nice.

145
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,010
You still have family and friends.

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
You're my friend too.

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
All right.

148
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
Then listen to your good friend.

149
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Go home.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,960
I know.

151
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,280
Those people

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,159
truly care about you.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,600
And that friend who encouraged you to perform,

154
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,400
he understands you.

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
How do you know?

156
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,159
A young lady had too much to drink,

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
crying her eyes out,

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,080
and mistook me for her sweetheart,

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,760
kept apologizing to me.

160
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
In wine there is truth.

161
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
How could I not know what she's thinking?

162
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Don't talk nonsense.

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,560
All right,

164
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I won't.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,880
Go home now.

166
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
You should cherish those

167
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
who are willing to stay by your side.

168
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,080
Thank you.

169
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
No need to be formal with me.

170
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,020
Remember to treat me to a drink sometime.

171
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh no,

172
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,799
I think I've lost something important.

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,620
From your sweetheart, right?

174
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,720
What should I do?

175
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,980
He went through so much trouble to get it.

176
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,840
A drink won't fix this problem.

177
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
Let me tell you,

178
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
this is Feng's play,

179
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I was planning to keep it for myself.

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
How did it end up with you?

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,760
Who knows?

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
Someone got drunk

183
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,440
and insisted on giving me this ticket,

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,200
saying they never wanted to see that person again.

185
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
What was that person's name?

186
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,400
Something like Ruan...

187
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,180
I'll buy you a drink next time.

188
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
Keep this between us.

189
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
My lips are sealed.

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Yushuang,

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm glad to know you.

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
All right.

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You should go now.

194
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,040
I should go too.

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
I still have things at the small theater.

196
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,300
I need to check on them.

197
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
I won't see you off.

198
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,760
You know where I live.

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,160
You're welcome anytime.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll definitely come to support you next time.

201
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
It's a promise.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm off.

203
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,500
I'm at the Xiaodong Theater in the south of town.

204
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
I hope next time

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,530
you'll come support me too.

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
Elder, what's wrong?

207
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Young lady.

208
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,530
My brother has passed away.

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,840
These are his ashes.

211
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,800
I need to

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,560
take him home for burial within a month.

213
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
But my leg is injured,

214
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
I can't walk,

215
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,330
I'm afraid I won't make it back in time.

216
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
Let me help you up.

217
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,480
No,

218
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,960
I need to rest.

219
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
I can't walk anymore.

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,160
Let's rest a bit.

221
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
How about

222
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,480
I find you some water,

223
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,240
or

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
you come to my home first

225
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,280
and heal your leg before continuing your journey?

226
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
No, I can't go on.

227
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,410
I'm staying right here.

228
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm not leaving again.

229
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
But didn't you say

230
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,620
you would return home within a month?

231
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,280
I did say

232
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
I was going to return.

233
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,920
But he

234
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,960
doesn't need to anymore.

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
But that's still his hometown after all.

236
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Perhaps

237
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,880
this is where he belongs now.

238
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Sir,

239
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
is he your relative?

240
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
Fallen leaves return to their roots.

241
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,580
You can't just bury him in a foreign land.

242
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,000
In the future,

243
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,020
you'll probably feel regretful.

244
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Young lady.

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,490
These fallen leaves

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,040
don't necessarily need to return to their roots.

247
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,160
As long as they're buried in this soil,

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,880
nourishing new life,

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
they will be reborn.

250
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,570
Please reconsider.

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Or perhaps,

252
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,480
or...

253
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,280
If you trust me,

254
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,720
I can find someone to help you take him back.

255
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,200
It seems I've met a kind person today.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Young lady,

257
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,880
I can't, just because my leg is useless,

258
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
trouble others.

259
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,040
After my leg heals,

260
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll come visit him often.

261
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Thank you.

262
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,520
Please go now.

263
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
Old friend,

264
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,020
I can't go any further.

265
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
With you,

266
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,900
neither of us can make it home.

267
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
You should rest here.

268
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,080
Wait for me to visit you again.

269
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,540
Elderly sir, your bag.

270
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
The Young Marshal is coming to town.

271
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
Get yourself ready.

272
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
I'll find a way to introduce you to him.

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,640
I heard the Young Marshal enjoys opera.

274
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,960
This is perfect timing.

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,680
Colonel Zhang.

276
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,480
Have some tea.

277
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,640
Opportunities like this are rare.

278
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
If you seize it,

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,760
the benefits will come naturally.

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Of course.

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,120
Rest assured.

282
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,240
He won't stay long anyway.

283
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,490
Just deal with it temporarily.

284
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,880
The important thing is our business must continue.

285
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,400
However,

286
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,800
we can't let him find out.

287
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
Understood.

288
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,800
I'll handle it carefully.

289
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,480
By the way,

290
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,960
this is what we collected this month.

291
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,890
Please count it.

292
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,840
I always trust

293
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,380
how you handle things.

294
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh right,

295
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,010
there's something I need you to look into.

296
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,360
Recently, someone

297
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,100
has been spreading negative news in the papers,

298
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,680
saying nothing but bad things about the Young Marshal.

299
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,880
This is creating a very bad impression.

300
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,760
You have many connections in town.

301
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Find this person who uses the pen name Xishan.

302
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Locate him before the Young Marshal arrives.

303
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,200
This will benefit you too.

304
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,320
Don't worry.

305
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,760
This matter,

306
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,940
we will definitely handle properly.

307
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,380
Colonel Zhang,

308
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,280
a new batch of male courtesans has just arrived.

309
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,410
They're settled in.

310
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,120
We'll send them to your residence tonight.

311
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,120
Good.

312
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Colonel Zhang,

313
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,560
take care.

314
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:39,920
Lou Zhijun.

315
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,600
Wenju and Zhijun,

316
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,880
use a heavy brush to write sharp articles,

317
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
and a sharp pen to write profound pieces.

318
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Judging by the writing style,

319
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,800
it must be a young person.

320
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,040
He quoted Mr. Chizhang.

321
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,160
This author has some backbone.

322
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,480
Although it wasn't published in our newspaper,

323
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,120
this article

324
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,120
has already caused quite a stir.

325
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,360
We should find this author as soon as possible.

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,760
Perhaps we can protect him.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
I understand.

328
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,460
I'll arrange for someone to look into it.

329
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,600
This article is written with integrity

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
and shows original insight.

331
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,640
It's just that

332
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
publishing it at this time

333
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,540
will cause significant public reaction

334
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,240
and might bring trouble to the author.

335
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
What was his name again?

336
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Mr. Xishan.

337
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
What do you mean?

338
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,120
How is it?

339
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
How is what?

340
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,000
This Mr. Xishan's

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,060
writing, how is it?

342
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
The writing is quite good,

343
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
passionate and inspiring.

344
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,920
I heard among the students,

345
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,760
it has caused quite a stir.

346
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
That's all?

347
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,570
Many common people can recite it by heart.

348
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,119
Really.

349
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,800
Absolutely.

350
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,200
However,

351
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,440
this guy is probably going to be in trouble.

352
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,440
What do you mean?

353
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
This article has been

354
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,800
seen by General Zhang, who works for the Young Marshal.

355
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
This General Zhang has been

356
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,560
managing Haicheng for the Young Marshal for years.

357
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,319
How could he possibly allow

358
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,119
the Young Marshal's reputation to be damaged before his arrival?

359
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,920
I heard

360
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,200
they've already sent many people to investigate

361
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,760
this Mr. Xishan.

362
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
What's wrong?

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
Do you know this Mr. Xishan?

364
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
It couldn't be...

365
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you crazy?

366
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,040
At a time like this!

367
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,370
Stop being so hesitant,

368
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,760
just like my father.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
I'm just sharing some good news with you.

370
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,900
Don't be a killjoy.

371
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,000
From now on,

372
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
who would dare say that I, Ruan Suiqing,

373
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,040
am just an idle rich kid?

374
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
What now?

375
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,800
Planning to take the newspaper

376
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,960
and show off to your little wife?

377
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,480
Stop talking nonsense.

378
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,200
How's your case going?

379
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,880
Don't even ask.

380
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm now a free man with no official duties.

381
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
I've been suspended.
