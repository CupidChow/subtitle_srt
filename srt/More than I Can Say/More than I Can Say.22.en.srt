1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
When my master was alive,

2
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,240
Mule Opera Troupe was one of the

3
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,960
most renowned theater companies.

4
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,760
Please mind your words, sir.

5
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,960
Who are you?

6
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
I am Chen Zhiyi,

7
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,180
the manager of Mule Opera Troupe.

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,320
Interesting.

9
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
A female troupe manager.

10
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,160
From your accent,

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,090
you don't seem to be from the North.

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,120
So,

13
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,479
what brings you here?

14
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,840
What can I do for you?

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,920
If you want to see a performance,

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,039
you can go to Xiaodong Theater.

17
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,039
We'll treat you as an honored guest.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Amusing.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,380
You're quite formidable.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
I am Leng Yulou.

21
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,640
I came here

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,840
because I heard that Mule Opera Troupe

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,500
has a treasured masterpiece,

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
an excellent play

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
called 'Old Dreams.'

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,340
I'm also an opera enthusiast.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,640
Today I came

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
to see for myself

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,440
what kind of performance it is

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,050
that has such a legendary reputation.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,400
I heard the last person who performed this play

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,079
was your old troupe leader Lu.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Young Master Leng, you've come at an unfortunate time.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Indeed, many people over the years

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,680
have wanted to see the true face of 'Old Dreams'.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,940
But when my master passed 'Old Dreams' to me, he instructed

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,280
that I should only open it after five years.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,079
So,

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,180
I'm afraid Young Master Leng will be disappointed.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,120
It seems this Mule Troupe isn't all that special.

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,000
Ever since Lu Nanfeng left,

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,020
there hasn't been anyone who could be the pillar of the troupe.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,560
What exactly do you do? I'd like to know.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
Alright.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,560
Stop passing the buck here.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
Seeing you all making excuses,

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
I suppose this 'Old Dreams'

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,690
isn't really anything worth showing.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Or perhaps,

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
your skills are inadequate

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,730
and you don't have anyone talented enough to perform it.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,040
Forget it.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
You shouldn't be using the Mule Troupe's name

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,290
to deceive people anymore.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,890
You truly don't deserve it.

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
Young Master Leng, there's no need for your sarcastic remarks.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Our Mule Troupe has weathered many storms.

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,960
Theater fans like you who kick us when we're down,

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,690
we've seen plenty of those too.

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
The Mule Troupe

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,760
has always regarded our audience as our benefactors.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,860
But after hearing what Young Master Leng just said,

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,570
it seems you don't truly understand theater.

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,200
Performers know best the warmth and coldness of human nature.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,240
If you don't know the true capability of the Mule Troupe,

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,360
then stop putting on airs here.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Please leave.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,880
What a pretentious act.

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,650
Since Mr. Chen is so confident,

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
why not let me see

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,940
the true abilities of Mule Society on stage?

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
I heard the He family is hosting a competition.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,079
To be honest,

74
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,080
both of us are on the invitation list.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Don't back out when the time comes.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Stop right there.

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,120
Stop playing dumb.

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,200
Who are you people?

79
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,800
Yunqi Society.

80
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,160
Yunqi Society

81
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,210
Isn't that Feng's theater troupe?

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,040
It's really when it rains, it pours.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
Everyone who passes by wants to step on us.

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
If you ask me,

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,600
we might as well accept this situation.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,400
Don't act rashly.

87
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,960
Zhiyi.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,560
They all look like they're up to no good.

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Why don't

90
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
we move out quickly,

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,080
avoid trouble,

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,480
before things get worse?

93
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,780
We don't need to leave.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
But now

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,130
we've been unwillingly dragged into a competition.

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,250
Second Brother,

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,760
let's close Xiaodong Tian for a couple of days

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
while we figure things out.

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
Okay.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,700
Get out of here!

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
You'll let just anyone into your home.

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,120
You think our house is a charity?

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,660
Do you really think you can afford to offend the Young Marshal?

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,180
Young Master Ruan,

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
you should leave now.

106
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,540
I can't help you with that matter.

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,600
Since your father was arrested,

108
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,240
everyone in Haicheng

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,260
is afraid to be associated with the Ruan family.

110
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,820
Here's the calligraphy you wrote for me.

111
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,840
Take it back.

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,560
As for the money I lost,

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,020
I won't ask you to repay it.

114
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Yunqi Society

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,220
They've come to Haicheng.

116
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,680
Where did you get this?

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
I have my ways, of course.

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
Just tell me if you're going or not.

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,730
Of course I'm going.

120
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,920
Then it's settled.

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,840
It's a deal.

122
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,290
When the time comes,

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
meet at Suiyin Pavilion.

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,370
Whoever doesn't show up is a puppy.

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Come on.

126
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,360
What are you thinking about?

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Ruan Suiqing

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,480
hasn't come to Xiaotiantian for several days.

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Yes.

130
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,240
After your argument in the courtyard last time,

131
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,700
he hasn't been back since.

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Look at this.

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,600
These opera performers are so unreliable,

134
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,919
so heartless.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
As soon as the Ruan family has trouble,

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,460
even they want to run away.

137
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Stop talking.

138
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,200
With what happened to the Ruan family,

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,130
anyone would keep their distance.

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,400
Alright, let's go.

141
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Excuse me.

142
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Please wait.

143
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
Don't panic.

144
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,640
Being detained at the police station

145
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,760
is better than being in a military prison.

146
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,960
I've already asked my colleagues

147
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
to check on your uncle's situation.

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,080
In a few days,

149
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
once I've saved enough money,

150
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll beg my superior.

151
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,680
He loves money,

152
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,010
so he'll definitely find a way to help.

153
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,140
Even if you had ten thousand taels of gold right now,

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,930
no one would dare speak up for the Ruan family.

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Don't worry,

156
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,290
your problems are my problems.

157
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Even if I have to get on my knees and beg him.

158
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
If that doesn't work,

159
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,640
I'll use all the dirty things he's done

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,800
to blackmail him.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,660
Even if it costs me my life,

162
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,640
I'll help you rescue your uncle.

163
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,520
Rest assured.

164
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,080
Thank you.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,620
No need to be so formal with me.

166
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
Open up!

167
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,320
Open the door!

168
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,780
I'm here to turn myself in.

169
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,320
I wrote the article defaming the Young Marshal.

170
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,120
It has nothing to do with Ruan Zhongkun.

171
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Release him!

172
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,600
What's all this noise?

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,800
You've got some nerve,

174
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,060
causing trouble here in broad daylight.

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,920
A good beating will teach you a lesson.

176
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,360
Don't make trouble for me,

177
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
you hear me?

178
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I wrote the article.

179
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
It has nothing to do with my father.

180
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,560
He's innocent.

181
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
Release him!

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Beat him!

183
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,600
Dalin,

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
what kind of friend is this?

185
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,130
Coming to make trouble at the police station?

186
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
He's just had some family issues

187
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
and suffered a shock.

188
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,420
He's not mentally stable.

189
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,280
Only because he's your friend.

190
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,000
If it were someone else,

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
we could beat him to death and it wouldn't be illegal.

192
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
That's right.

193
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,080
But if he hadn't caused this scene,

194
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
I wouldn't have remembered.

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,760
Now it seems

196
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,520
that only the police jail

197
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,920
is safe for him.

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,240
It's quite a coincidence.

199
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Today,

200
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
the Young Marshal is coming to town,

201
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,640
so all the important officers are out patrolling.

202
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,520
The chief and others

203
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,320
have gone to the He family to host a welcome banquet for the Young Marshal.

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,440
Luckily, I was left to watch the station.

205
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,320
Otherwise,

206
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
I couldn't guarantee

207
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,420
what would happen to your friend.

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,520
So,

209
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,640
since he's already here,

210
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,080
help me keep an eye on him.

211
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,280
Alright,

212
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
but he can't stay long.

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
Take him away as soon as possible.

214
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,200
Okay,

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,530
thank you for your help.

216
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,880
I told you to calm down, and you pull this stupid stunt.

217
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Alright.

218
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,680
Now you can relax.

219
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
Stop making trouble.

220
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
If you cause another scene like this,

221
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,170
I'll have to bail you out again.

222
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,280
Just stay here quietly for a few days.

223
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll handle your uncle's matter for you.

224
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,520
Don't overthink things.

225
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,720
Where could a grown man

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,920
possibly disappear to?

227
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
I've asked at all the theaters

228
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
he usually frequents.

229
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,960
Well...

230
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,010
They all say they haven't seen him.

231
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,200
I've been asking around about some shop owners

232
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,880
and theater fans who used to curry favor with Young Master Ruan.

233
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
They say they've seen him once.

234
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,520
He looks

235
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,010
completely destitute.

236
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,970
Young Master Ruan went to borrow money from them.

237
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
But now

238
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
they're afraid to be too closely associated with the Ruan family,

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,130
so they all refused.

240
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,040
Indeed,

241
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
time reveals people's true colors.

242
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,000
When Young Master Ruan was at his prime,

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,880
so many people surrounded him begging for his calligraphy.

244
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,960
But now?

245
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,680
They avoid him like the plague.

246
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,320
This...

247
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,360
Stop.

248
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
Don't talk nonsense.

249
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,760
But this Young Master Ruan is something else.

250
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,360
Things have gotten this bad,

251
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
yet he'd rather ask those people for help

252
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,000
than come to us.

253
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Seems our friendship isn't deep enough.

254
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,420
It's because our friendship is too deep,

255
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,570
so he's afraid the Ruan family troubles might affect us.

256
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,600
Right, junior sister.

257
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,930
That's what I meant too.

258
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,600
The key issue is where he is now,

259
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
we have no idea.

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,300
Even if we want to help,

261
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,480
we don't know where to start.

262
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,600
Third senior brother,

263
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
you have many connections in the martial world.

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,060
Ask them to help search tomorrow,

265
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,960
we might have a better chance.

266
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,600
Alright.

267
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,840
Why wait until tomorrow?

268
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,680
I'll go right now.

269
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,400
Hurry.

270
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Officer Lin.

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,760
Who's that?

272
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,690
Coming here in such a rush at night.

273
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,080
Mr. Chen, I'm Officer Lin.

274
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
What brings you here?

275
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,680
I just heard about what happened to the Ruan family.

276
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,840
I've been looking for Ruan Suiqing all day but couldn't find him.

277
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
Do you know where he is?

278
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
That's exactly why I'm here.

279
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,640
Come with me quickly.

280
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Where to?

281
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,320
The He family.

282
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Ruan Suiqing heard from the prison guard

283
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,840
that the Young Marshal went to the He family dinner in town tonight.

284
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
So he knocked out the guard

285
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,410
and ran to the He family.

286
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
He's probably going to turn himself in

287
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,280
and beg the Young Marshal to release his father.

288
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,880
I've been suspended from duty

289
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,280
and can't easily enter the He mansion without credentials.

290
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,410
So I was thinking...

291
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,320
Well...

292
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
Isn't the He family's adopted son your brother?

293
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,680
You might have a better chance of getting in than I do.

294
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,520
Please go quickly

295
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
and see if you can bring him out.

296
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Don't let him make a scene in front of the Young Marshal,

297
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,840
or the situation will become irreparable.

298
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Why

299
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,970
was he taken to the police station?

300
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,920
What

301
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
exactly happened to him?

302
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,680
No,

303
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
they're keeping him there for his own good.

304
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
They're afraid he'll cause more trouble if he gets out.

305
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Come with me first.

306
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
I'll explain everything on the way.

307
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,480
Let's go, hurry.

308
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

309
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,000
Young Master Ruan has a relationship with our Mule Society.

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,720
We can't ignore it if he's in trouble.

311
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,480
Grab your weapons.

312
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Yes, absolutely.

313
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Let's go.

314
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,640
It's an honor that the Young Marshal

315
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,280
has graced my humble home.

316
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,660
I'll drink first as a sign of respect.

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,330
On behalf of Haicheng's opera community,

318
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,780
we welcome the Young Marshal to our city.

319
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
This gentleman here

320
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,200
is the chairman of Haicheng Opera Association.

321
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,840
Yes,

322
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,040
he's also a prominent figure in Haicheng's cultural circle.

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
Recently,

324
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,560
he has ventured into the business world.

325
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,720
From now on, under the Young Marshal's command,

326
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,650
there will be one more capable man.

327
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
Come,

328
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
let me toast you on behalf of the Young Marshal.

329
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,480
Commander Zhang is my father's favorite general.

330
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
You volunteered yourself back then

331
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,160
to lead the vanguard in Haicheng for me.

332
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
You've worked hard all these years.

333
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,320
I heard

334
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
that Mr. He has arranged

335
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
a special opera performance competition to welcome me.

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm told

337
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,680
the stakes are quite extraordinary.

338
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
Yes.

339
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,810
I know the Young Marshal enjoys opera.

340
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,760
That's why

341
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,680
I arranged this event.

342
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
First,

343
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
to let you experience

344
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,849
the cultural atmosphere of Haicheng.

345
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,839
Second,

346
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,210
knowing you care about the people,

347
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,940
we wanted the townspeople

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,680
to join in the festivities.

349
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,300
Most importantly,

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,040
the prize for this competition

351
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,040
is a famous traditional opera of Haicheng.

352
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,380
It hasn't been performed for many years.

353
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
Knowing of your arrival,

354
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
we're using it to welcome you

355
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,720
as a sign of our respect.

356
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,490
You've really gone to a lot of trouble.

357
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,490
I heard that before my arrival,

358
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,780
General Zhang cleaned up Haicheng for me

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
and arrested many students.

360
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,330
You don't know the whole story.

361
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,000
Those who were arrested

362
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
were spreading rumors and malicious slander,

363
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,810
villains who were tarnishing your image.

364
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
I see.

365
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,040
These rumor-mongers are truly despicable.

366
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,640
What I hate most in my life

367
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
are those who stir up trouble.

368
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,560
Uncle Zhang,

369
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,420
it's good to have you here.

370
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,400
Here.

371
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,720
I'll pour this drink for you myself.
