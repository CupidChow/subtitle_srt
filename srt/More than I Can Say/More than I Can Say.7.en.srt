1
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,000
Since

2
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,000
you've come to me for help,

3
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,120
I can't just ignore your request.

4
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,640
Are you really willing to help

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
and speak up for my senior?

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,440
It seems your master never told you.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,120
He and I

8
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,759
are also fellow disciples from the same school.

9
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,840
By seniority,

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
you should call me Uncle Master.

11
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
That's wonderful, Uncle Master.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,759
Rest assured,

13
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,280
I know Ruan Suiqing very well.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,120
If he says he can bring back the newspaper in three days,

15
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
he'll definitely keep his word.

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,570
He won't put you in a difficult position with the police.

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,970
It's just a matter of saying a word.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,960
Nothing difficult about it.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,320
However,

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,880
this will cost me some personal favors.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,440
My dear niece,

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,940
you wouldn't let your Uncle Master do this for nothing, would you?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,320
Do you want money?

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
I'll have my seniors collect some right away.

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,640
Just name your price,

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
and I guarantee I'll bring it to you.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,280
I don't need money.

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,850
There's something else I need.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
'Old Dreams'

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Do you know it?

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
Fool's dream.

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
Master.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,970
Senior Brother,

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,760
how have you been?

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,280
He Zhen.

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,760
As long as I'm alive,

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,840
'Old Dreams'.

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
don't even think about it.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,280
That was mine to begin with.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
You used tricks to take it from me.

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,240
After all these years,

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,960
who's really been playing tricks?

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,680
You know it best.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,160
Back then,

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,640
you gave it up willingly.

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,360
Now you regret it,

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,880
but there's no need to make things difficult for the child.

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Regret?

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,460
I think you're the one who should regret.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Lu Shun.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll give you one more chance.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Apologize to my face.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,380
Bring 'Old Dreams'

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,000
and join my opera guild.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,079
Mule Society,

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
I'll keep it safe for you.

57
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,640
He Zhen,

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
you're still so full of yourself.

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
You think

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
just because you do some business

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
people will respect you?

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,520
Zhiyi,

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
remember this:

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Relying on others

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,380
is not as good as relying on yourself.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,380
If you want others to respect you,

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
you must stand tall.

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,400
A dog depending on its master's power.

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
A dog

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,440
will always remain a dog.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
You!

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Let's go.

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
Come home with me.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,440
You.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For you, the great young master Ruan, to call me father

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,010
must mean something bad is happening.

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
This is a matter of life and death.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,530
How can saving someone's life not be a good thing?

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,320
You've confronted the Xie family?

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,120
No.

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,290
Since you already know,

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,170
I won't hide anything anymore.

83
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,409
I've written an article

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
that can prove Miss Xie

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
and Lu Nanfeng are innocent.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
Please publish it for me.

87
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,800
Nanfeng's life is now in my hands.

88
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,440
You must help me with this.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,440
Father.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
I was wrong, okay?

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,480
As long as you help me publish this,

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll do whatever you say.

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,880
I won't write calligraphy anymore,

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,140
nor will I write plays.

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,440
I'll even come back

96
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,040
and obediently help you manage the newspaper.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm not dead yet.

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,720
The newspaper doesn't need you,

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,050
and without you, I'd have fewer troubles.

100
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
As for that Lu Nanfeng,

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
if he were truly

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
pure and innocent,

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
then he wouldn't have

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,280
been caught red-handed.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,960
Mr. Ruan,

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,440
Nanfeng and I are like brothers.

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,170
I know what kind of person he is.

108
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,400
All of you look down on what I write,

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,840
but only he is willing to open his heart to me,

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,320
to discuss the human emotions in plays with me,

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,720
to explore the diverse aspects of life together.

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
I know in my heart

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
that he's different from those who want to get close to my family

114
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,650
completely different.

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,440
The ways of the world.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,159
You always tell me

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,840
that newspapers must put truth first.

118
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,640
I swear on my late mother's name

119
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
that between the two of them

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,880
there is absolutely nothing improper.

121
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Well,

122
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,440
is everything you've written here true?

123
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Of course.

124
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
They truly love each other,

125
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
but can't be together because of their different social status.

126
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,520
The two of them

127
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,770
are just like 'The Butterfly Lovers'.

128
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,850
So what you've written here is that

129
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
these two people

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
for the love in their hearts

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,970
are determined to break through feudal class barriers.

132
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
It's like saying

133
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,680
'You shall be as solid as rock,

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
and I shall be as pliant as reed.'

135
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,200
If I really publish

136
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
what you've written here,

137
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,770
this friend of yours

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,880
won't live much longer.

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,720
Why?

140
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
You're blinded by a single leaf.

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,520
If we publish this,

142
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,860
where does that leave Mr. Xie?

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Your agreement with the Xie family

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
was to protect Miss Xie's reputation.

145
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,280
That's why they made the bet with you.

146
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Besides,

147
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,560
if you know Lu Nanfeng is innocent,

148
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
why not find evidence

149
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,690
instead of handling it by publishing in newspapers?

150
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,120
What problem will this solve?

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,500
If you portray Mr. Xie as a feudal patriarch,

152
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,659
will he obediently drop the charges?

153
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,280
He'll only kill Lu Nanfeng in anger.

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,360
If it's deliberate framing,

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,360
would they care about evidence?

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Publishing is also

157
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
to safeguard Nanfeng's innocence.

158
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
You know,

159
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,160
everything I've taught you

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,800
you haven't remembered a word of it.

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
You think you're seeking truth?

162
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
You're just being stubborn.

163
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
If you want to protect Lu Nanfeng now,

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
without any evidence,

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
it's going to be very difficult.

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,210
Tomorrow's front page,

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
take it back and revise it,

168
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,700
then ask your Uncle Bai to publish it.

169
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
Not willing?

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,330
Then don't come to me at all.

171
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm willing.

172
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
Could I get your stamp on this?

173
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,980
Listen carefully.

174
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Once I stamp this,

175
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,640
you'll put down your pen for good

176
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,290
and stop writing those trite theatrical novels.

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,360
Wait.

178
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
To save someone,

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
one newspaper isn't enough.

180
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,690
You need to find a way

181
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,160
to get all

182
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
four major newspapers

183
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,300
in Haicheng to publish this article.

184
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Getting past me is easy,

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,920
but whether you can get those three newspapers to sign

186
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,600
depends on your abilities, Young Master Ruan.

187
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
All right, I understand.

188
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,740
What do you want to say?

189
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,210
If you have nothing to say, just leave.

190
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Master,

191
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,880
are we really not going to save Senior Brother?

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,480
With our current situation and abilities,

193
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,620
there's not much we can do for him.

194
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,120
Fortunately,

195
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
Young Master Ruan has proposed

196
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,920
a perfect solution.

197
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,640
Do you trust him?

198
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
Of course I do.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,800
But

200
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,120
your Senior Brother was clearly framed deliberately.

201
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Those who harmed him targeted us because of our humble status,

202
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,800
knowing we lack the power to save him.

203
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,480
So our priority now is to save your Senior Brother's life,

204
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,920
and then his reputation.

205
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,410
For performers like us,

206
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
without patrons,

207
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,160
our art means nothing.

208
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,080
Young Master Ruan is such a patron.

209
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
We must trust him.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,120
I just feel sorry for Senior Brother.

211
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,880
He shouldn't suffer such injustice.

212
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,080
Indeed.

213
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,520
That's why Young Master Ruan's approach

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,880
truly has your Senior Brother's best interests at heart.

215
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,680
He cares about Nanfeng's life,

216
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,180
and more importantly,

217
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,320
he equally cares about

218
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
Nanfeng's reputation.

219
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,760
People already have prejudice against performers like us,

220
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
harboring biases.

221
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
They call us

222
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,330
fickle and untrustworthy.

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
If there comes a day

224
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,940
when Nanfeng's life cannot be saved,

225
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
at least

226
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,360
we must let the world know

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,240
that he is innocent.

228
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,760
Master.

229
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,720
You.

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,360
Yi.

231
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,840
From now on,

232
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,810
no matter what difficulties you face,

233
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,680
remember,

234
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,000
don't let your emotions

235
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,720
control your heart.

236
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
He Zhen is a man

237
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,720
of poor character.

238
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
From what I know of him,

239
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,120
even if you give him 'Old Dreams',

240
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,170
things may not turn out as you wish.

241
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,200
You and Nanfeng

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
are both my children.

243
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,960
Seeing you

244
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,560
unable to eat or drink,

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
I

246
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,920
cannot bear it.

247
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
Very well.

248
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
Everyone has their own fate.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
If you truly want to use 'Old Dreams'

250
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,980
to save your senior fellow disciple,

251
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
then take it.

252
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,420
Let's be clear on this.

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,640
All manuscripts and copyrights of Mr. Xishan

254
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,600
belong to me.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,440
It's a deal.

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,860
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

257
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,450
Uncle Xie, you're here.

258
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,740
Please come in.

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Miss Chen,

260
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,400
I heard that

261
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,300
you came looking for me last time.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
What my master's uncle wants

263
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,340
I cannot give it to him.

264
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
But I know

265
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,800
Young Master He is a good person.

266
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,080
Please, I beg you to help me

267
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,000
protect my senior fellow disciple in front of the bureau chief and Mr. Xie.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ruan Suiqing will definitely come.

269
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,200
Did he get the newspaper?

270
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
The young master stayed at the factory all night.

271
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
He took the first copy of the newspaper.

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
It's rare to see him so invested in something.

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,760
He even managed to handle those old foxes.

274
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,360
The young master does have some skills.

275
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,920
Slow down.

276
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Make way! Make way!

277
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,020
Let me through!

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Well, if it isn't Young Master Ruan.

279
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,640
Where are you rushing off to?

280
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,080
Last time you humiliated me in front of everyone.

281
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Today you'll have to spare me some ink one way or another.

282
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,960
Beat him up!

283
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
Goodbye, Mr. Xie.

284
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,280
Mr. Xie,

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
please wait a little longer.

286
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,079
It's not dark yet.

287
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,280
The newspaper should be out by now.

288
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
It's just that Ruan Suiqing hasn't arrived.

289
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,880
He must have been delayed by something on the way.

290
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Don't say I didn't give him a chance.

291
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,040
He's the one who didn't show up on time.

292
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,200
I've said it before.

293
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
That dissolute young master Ruan

294
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,410
is completely unreliable.

295
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,599
You're all blinded by foolishness

296
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,130
insisting on trusting him.

297
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
Mr. Xie! Mr. Xie!

298
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
Mr. Xie, please wait a little longer.

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,720
He will definitely come, Mr. Xie.

300
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
Mr. Xie.

301
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,320
Mr. Xie! Please wait a bit more.

302
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,160
Mr. Xie.

303
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Mr. Xie.

304
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
Why are you pulling me?

305
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
Mr. Xie has left.

306
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,960
What are you going to do, Senior?

307
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Senior.

308
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,360
Senior.

309
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
Listen up, everyone.

310
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm sure you all know

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,370
about what happened recently.

312
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,560
I won't say much more.

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,040
Mule Society

314
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,400
is disbanded.
