1
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,810
Where are you going?

2
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,370
I'm going to find Dalin.

3
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,039
When Nanfeng got in trouble before,

4
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,570
I asked him to help me investigate the matter.

5
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,330
But when I went to see him today,

6
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,880
he wasn't there.

7
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
I'm a bit worried.

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
There's something else I haven't told you.

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,880
After what happened to Nanfeng,

10
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,610
I went to find the Xie family maid who accused him.

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,860
By the time I got there,

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
she was already dead.

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,440
Dalin and I thought something was suspicious,

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,240
so we've been investigating it.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,210
Later we discovered

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,300
that Fengseng's death

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,940
might also be connected to the He family.

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,570
If your senior were still here,

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,570
he wouldn't want you to get in trouble because of him.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Don't worry.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm just going to visit some friends,

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,760
and I'll be back after gathering information.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
In the bag with the Ruan family seal,

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,540
I've left some things for you.

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
After three days,

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
if I don't return,

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I mean if I can't make it back in time,

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,360
give the family seal to Dalin.

29
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,360
When he sees that bag,

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,730
he'll understand everything.

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm leaving.

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Wait for me.

33
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,490
I'll write a new play for you when I return.

34
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
You're here.

35
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,800
It really is you.

36
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,680
If it weren't for me,

37
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
you probably would never

38
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,300
find this place in your lifetime.

39
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,480
The person you're looking for is also here.

40
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Where is Dalin?

41
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Suiqing.

42
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Don't back down.

43
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Come

44
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
to justice!

45
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,700
As a messenger of justice like me,

46
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,200
I shine wherever I go.

47
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Welcome back.

48
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,320
Suiqing,

49
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
let's have a drink later.

50
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,440
He Mingxu.

51
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,680
You despicable villain.

52
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,810
So you're behind everything, aren't you?

53
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
You killed Fengsun,

54
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
you arranged for Nanfeng's exile,

55
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,370
and you dealt with the owner of the Hongfeng Theater.

56
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Why?

57
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Why?

58
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,960
They had no grudge against you.

59
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
Why?

60
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Why?

61
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,640
Why do you people always ask why?

62
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
Does it matter who I am?

63
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,300
You don't need to ask why anymore.

64
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,120
What matters is

65
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,440
that Ruan Suiqing

66
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,040
will soon disappear from this world.

67
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,040
I'll kill you.

68
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,480
Mr. Ruan.

69
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
We now suspect you

70
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,920
of attempting to take over Mr. Chen's Mule Club

71
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,050
and involvement in multiple murders,

72
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,320
including Officer Lin's death.

73
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,400
Me taking over Chen Zhiyi?

74
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
It's you again.

75
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
No more talk.

76
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,480
Cuff him.

77
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,940
Colonel Zhang,

78
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,370
thank you for your help.

79
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,640
His family has a record.

80
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,080
It won't be difficult to deal with him.

81
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,610
Go back and tell your father

82
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,200
to behave himself lately.

83
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
Don't make any big moves.

84
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,080
Let me get rid of that brat first.

85
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes.

86
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,880
Impossible.

87
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,840
This is absolutely impossible.

88
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,560
I just can't understand

89
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,160
how Young Master Ruan could do such a thing.

90
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,280
The police caught him red-handed.

91
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,220
What's the point of saying

92
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,880
it's impossible?

93
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,720
Don't you know people at the police station?

94
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,520
Can you put in a good word for him?

95
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Sister.

96
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,840
It's not that I don't want to help.

97
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
I did know people at the police station before,

98
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,240
but as you know, that was because of the He family's connections.

99
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,480
Now I've broken ties with the He family.

100
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
Those self-interested people at the police station

101
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,580
naturally won't do me any favors.

102
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
I bet

103
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
He Zhen is behind this again.

104
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,680
Young Master Ruan hasn't offended him,

105
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,520
how could he push someone to this point?

106
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,960
Could it be that

107
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,720
Young Master Ruan really did kill someone?

108
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,580
Third Brother,

109
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,080
don't talk nonsense.

110
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Perhaps it was because of that previous competition.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,200
If Young Master Ruan hadn't stepped in,

112
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,160
He Zhen would have claimed 'Old Dreams' as his own.

113
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,980
The most urgent matter now

114
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
is that we need to quickly

115
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,640
get him out of jail.

116
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,080
Even the best person who enters such a place

117
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
will suffer greatly.

118
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,960
We can't let Young Master Ruan

119
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,760
suffer from false accusations.

120
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Yes.

121
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Young Master Ruan

122
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
has taken such good care

123
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,090
of our Mule Society over the years.

124
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
When our First Brother got into trouble,

125
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080
Young Master Ruan stood by us.

126
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
Now that Young Master Ruan is in trouble,

127
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,320
we at Mule Society cannot stand idly by.

128
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,160
Zhiyi.

129
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,240
Second Brother is right.

130
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
All this talking back and forth

131
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,330
isn't getting us anywhere.

132
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,560
Before Suiqing left,

133
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
he specifically said he was going to find Officer Lin.

134
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,580
Third Brother,

135
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,080
you know many people in the community.

136
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,880
Ask them to help find Officer Lin.

137
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
Perhaps when we find him,

138
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,360
we'll get some clues.

139
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
All right.

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
We'll need money to save him.

141
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,160
Shuang,

142
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
I have some jewelry.

143
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
Take Xiaotao with you

144
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
and pawn them for emergency funds.

145
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay.

146
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,820
The show must go on.

147
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,240
No matter how chaotic things are outside,

148
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
we need to let them know

149
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
that we have a solid foundation.

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
So,

151
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,680
regarding the theater troupe,

152
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Second Brother,

153
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,760
please help take care of things.

154
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,400
Okay.

155
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
I'm a bit tired.

156
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll go think of other solutions.

157
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Everyone, please disperse.

158
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,880
Zhiyi.

159
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,340
Have something to eat.

160
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
You've been hungry all day.

161
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,180
At least have a little something.

162
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,920
Well,

163
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,420
I'll drink something.

164
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,820
What are you really thinking?

165
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
I've been asking you all day

166
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,850
and you won't say anything.

167
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,560
But your face

168
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,880
can't hide anything.

169
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
Everyone can see

170
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
you're just putting on a brave face.

171
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,840
Shuang.

172
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,300
Have you ever experienced

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,600
giving yourself completely to someone

174
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,700
only for something to suddenly go wrong?

175
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,440
It feels like

176
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,640
you've lost something inside.

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Can you understand that?

178
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,800
I just don't understand

179
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,160
how Ruan Suiqing could possibly want to possess you so badly

180
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,090
that he'd kill people close to you.

181
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,410
Not to mention interfering

182
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,610
and deliberately framing Lu Nanfeng.

183
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,360
Wait.

184
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,600
You don't actually believe

185
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,240
all that nonsense in the newspapers, do you?

186
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
Of course I don't believe it.

187
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,200
It's just that all these things

188
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,320
are connected to me in every way.

189
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,160
What's

190
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
important is...

191
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,960
What is it?

192
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,440
What's important is that

193
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,800
since I've known you

194
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
everything Ruan Suiqing has done for you

195
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
has been with your best interests at heart.

196
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
He wants you to perform on stage.

197
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,570
He wants you to be happy.

198
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,880
He wants you to have your own happiness.

199
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,200
With these feelings alone

200
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,180
do you really think he would hurt you?

201
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,500
It's precisely because I understand his love for me

202
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,280
that I worry

203
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,900
he might be used by people with ulterior motives

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,460
and get hurt because of it.

205
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
There are too many paths.

206
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,290
You end up not knowing which one to choose.

207
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,250
Don't overthink it.

208
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
You just need to know in your heart

209
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,800
which path to take.

210
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
Take a sip.

211
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
When you wake up,

212
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,200
you'll know what to do.

213
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,290
Where are you going?

214
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
You're in such a hurry

215
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,400
just for this?

216
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
What is this?

217
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
What's wrong?

218
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
Why are you crying?

219
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,920
I knew it wasn't him.

220
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,720
I knew it definitely wasn't him.

221
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not him.

222
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Alright.

223
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,720
Okay, okay.

224
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,930
It's not him.

225
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,280
It's not him.
