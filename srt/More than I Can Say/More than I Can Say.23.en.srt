1
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Uncle Zhang.

2
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,410
Good thing you're all here.

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,320
Here.

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm pouring this drink for you myself.

5
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,650
You've worked hard.

6
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,690
I'll definitely keep working hard

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
to protect the Young Commander.

8
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:42,960
Here.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,200
This drink is for Boss He.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,120
I can see that

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,479
our officers and soldiers

12
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,039
have been troubling you quite a bit here.

13
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,800
From now on,

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
we'll definitely keep in touch.

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Yes.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,400
Since I've been ordered to take over Haicheng,

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
naturally,

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,760
I want to live in harmony with the local people.

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,560
In the future,

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,600
we'll need your help, Mr. He.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,200
You're too kind, Commander.

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Commander,

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,840
if there's anything I can do,

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,200
just let me know.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
I'll serve you in any way

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
without hesitation.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,660
Whatever it takes.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Let me in!

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
I need to see the Commander and Young Master Ruan.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,050
I've been wronged! You can't go in.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,730
What's going on?

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,240
Damn it!

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
The Commander is here,

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,440
you can speak plainly.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,320
Speak.

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,040
Sir,

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,370
Young Master Ruan insisted on barging in.

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
He says.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,760
Says what?

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
He says he's been wronged

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,480
and he's here to turn himself in.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,120
If you have grievances, go to the police station!

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,880
What kind of place do you think this is,

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
letting him shout and make a scene?

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Go.

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,500
Find some people to get rid of him.

47
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,880
Wait.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,860
I understand your situation.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
You want to clear your father's name.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,640
My father was truly wronged.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,480
He went to prison in my place.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,520
I had no other choice.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,980
I rushed in only because I knew you were here.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,730
You're such a spoiled brat.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
And you're supposed to be educated.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Newspaper young master.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,640
When officials handle cases,

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,960
do you think they wrongfully accuse people?

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,090
They must have caught him red-handed.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
What now?

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Should we just take your word for it?

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,040
Is there no justice anymore?

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,700
My father was truly innocent.

64
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
He copied my article.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,060
Young Marshal.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,240
I also have the Ruan family seal.

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
How can you be so certain

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,880
that my father wrote that article?

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,760
Besides, the writing,

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,420
I remember every single word.

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
That article,

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
what did it say?

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
I heard some rumors

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
and wrote some unfounded words.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,620
Young Marshal, you don't need to read it.

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,850
The writing is good.

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,240
Shows some backbone.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,399
But,

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
just from this article,

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,770
do you really understand what kind of person I am?

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
From this alone,

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
the one being judgmental

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,360
is you.

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,580
Young Marshal.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
He's just a foolish young man.

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Please be magnanimous.

87
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Since his father has already been arrested,

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,120
please don't hold it against him.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
That's not right.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
If we just let him go,

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,760
where does that leave our military's reputation?

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,840
If a mere boy can easily change a verdict,

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
then in Haicheng,

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,650
who's really in charge?

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
So you're suggesting

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
since he insists on confessing,

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
we should arrest him too,

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
investigate thoroughly,

99
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,940
and make an example of him.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Mr. Zhang.

101
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,500
That's not necessary.

102
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,640
You just said

103
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,840
we should live in harmony with the people.

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Now you're starting a literary inquisition.

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,920
That's not right.

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,500
Young Master Ruan,

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
what do you think?

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
I already said.

109
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,480
One must take responsibility for one's actions.

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
I did it.

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as you release my father,

112
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
whatever punishment you choose,

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
I'll accept it.

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,880
Well.

115
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,220
So you'll accept any punishment.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,300
Young Master Ruan,

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,400
I've heard

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
you write plays

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,620
and are a theater enthusiast.

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,940
How about this?

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,700
Perform a piece for me.

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,040
If I enjoy it,

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,640
we'll consider this matter settled,

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,720
and it will count as your admission of guilt

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,650
and punishment.

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,800
As for your father's case,

127
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll look into it later.

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Will you really reconsider my father's case?

129
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,280
After I hear your performance,

130
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
I'll consider it.

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,500
Young Marshal,

132
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,780
which play would you like to hear?

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,060
Whatever you want.

134
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
Since you're a military man,

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll perform

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
The Battle of Changsha.

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Wait.

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
A performance needs proper presentation.

139
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,930
Performing without makeup

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,130
doesn't seem right.

141
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,130
What do you want?

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
The cream on this Western cake has some color.

143
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Put it on.

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Since the Young Marshal said you must be punished,

145
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,610
you should show a proper attitude of acceptance.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,010
Come here on your knees.

147
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,560
Do you really understand

148
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,200
the situation in Haicheng?

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
Do you know who holds power,

150
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,140
who has the upper hand?

151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,400
Do you?

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,400
All you see is

153
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
innocent students being arrested.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,200
But do you know

155
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
who will take the blame if I don't write this article?

156
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
If we also take a stance against it,

157
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,440
how many intellectuals in Haicheng will suffer?

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
How many newspapers

159
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,200
will fall into the hands of those villains?

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Do you know all this?

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,330
I originally wanted

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,940
you to be a person with ideals and ambitions.

163
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,370
But after your mother passed away,

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
I suddenly realized

165
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,810
none of that matters to me anymore.

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,840
In these times,

167
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,920
it's enough if you can just live well.

168
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
That day.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,260
I have an appointment.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
If you want to apologize,

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,929
we'll talk when I get back tonight.

172
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,250
Who told you to stand up?

173
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,160
Kneel back down.

174
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,360
Sing while kneeling.

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,120
Ruan Suiqing, stand up now!

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Get up!

177
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,210
What a lively evening tonight.

178
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Mr. He.

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
This is quite a nice place you have here.

180
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,900
And who is this young lady?

181
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,400
Get up.

182
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Young Commander.

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,530
What a coincidence.

184
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
She's the one from Mule Opera

185
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,650
Troupe, the Young Marshal.

186
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,240
I am the manager of Mule Opera Troupe,

187
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
Chen Zhiyi.

188
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Madam Manager.

189
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080
May I ask

190
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,370
why you've come here, Ms. Chen?

191
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
I heard that

192
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,040
my friend has disturbed your enjoyment.

193
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,370
Unfortunately,

194
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,280
he is an investor in our troupe.

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,080
Ruan Suiqing is a good-for-nothing playboy,

196
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,810
as everyone in Haicheng knows.

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,840
So,

198
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,160
if the Young Marshal wishes to enjoy opera,

199
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,200
I'd be honored to perform for you.

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Good.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
What a fine show of 'Beauty Saves the Hero.'

202
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,600
They say opera performers are the most heartless.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Yet I see in you, Ms. Chen,

204
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
something of

205
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
a heroine.

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,090
You flatter me, Young Marshal.

207
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,920
As the old saying goes, convince with reason.

208
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Though I am just an opera performer,

209
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,120
even for a private performance,

210
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,120
this is not how it should be done.

211
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Interesting.

212
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,800
Then, Ms. Chen,

213
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,060
how would you like to perform?

214
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,940
Young Marshal.

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,360
This Ms. Chen

216
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,420
is like my apprentice-niece.

217
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,820
Her master and I trained under the same teacher.

218
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,500
The 'Old Dreams' I mentioned earlier

219
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
is in Ms. Chen's possession.

220
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,460
For this competition,

221
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,160
Ms. Chen's Mule Troupe was also invited.

222
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
However,

223
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,000
she hasn't accepted the invitation yet.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,400
How about this, Ms. Chen?

225
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,360
Today we sign the invitation,

226
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,690
and in a few days,

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
you can perform for the Young Marshal on stage.

228
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Wouldn't that be better?

229
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, I'm truly looking forward to

230
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
your performance, Ms. Chen.

231
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
Let's do this.

232
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,280
Since you came here for your friend,

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll make my position clear.

234
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,890
If you win the competition,

235
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,000
Master Ruan's father,

236
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,050
I can guarantee his safety.

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Mr. Chen,

238
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
what do you think?

239
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,640
Good.

240
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,800
Agreed.

241
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
You shouldn't have come.

242
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,040
Hurry up.

243
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Second Brother said

244
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
we're having dumplings tonight.

245
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,760
If we don't leave now,

246
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,490
I said you shouldn't have come.

247
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
they'll eat them all.

248
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,690
I said you shouldn't have come.

249
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
My problems have nothing to do with you.

250
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,960
Just focus on managing your Mule Society.

251
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
Isn't being a class teacher enough?

252
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,720
Why must you get involved?

253
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,280
When I was sad, you were by my side.

254
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,680
You helped me sneak onto the stage.

255
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
When Fengshen scolded me,

256
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,360
you stood in front of me.

257
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,120
And also,

258
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
you were the one who lifted my wedding veil.

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
I haven't even settled that score with you yet.

260
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
How can you say it has nothing to do with me?

261
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,260
But I don't want to drag you down. I'm not afraid.

262
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,320
Ruan Suiqing.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
You know,

264
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,280
I was once an orphan.

265
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,560
I finally found a family.

266
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm afraid of losing it.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,560
But the more afraid I am, the more I lose.

268
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,960
I lost my loving master

269
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,220
and my doting senior brother.

270
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,920
I lost the entire Mule Society.

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
So I don't want to be afraid anymore.

272
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Because

273
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm afraid of losing you.

274
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,520
Chen Zhiyi.

275
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Do you even understand what I'm saying?

276
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
Didn't you see it?

277
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Today I was crawling on the ground

278
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
like a dog.

279
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,080
I have no dignity left.

280
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,960
As long as I can save my father,

281
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll do anything.

282
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,300
When my father was around,

283
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,360
I never thought about

284
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
what would happen next.

285
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,540
What could happen?

286
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,920
I always thought

287
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,240
I could live peacefully as a young master.

288
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,680
But when I saw our family's possessions

289
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
being taken away piece by piece,

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
when I watched my father go to prison,

291
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
I couldn't do anything.

292
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm just useless.

293
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm just useless.

294
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,160
Useless.

295
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
Do you remember

296
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,160
what you once told me?

297
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,400
You said,

298
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,680
The past,

299
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,560
right or wrong,

300
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,400
is all behind us.

301
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,720
Courage

302
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,160
means not looking back.

303
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,200
Those words of yours

304
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,600
were like fireflies.

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,760
Although

306
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
the light was faint,

307
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
it was the only light I had

308
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
when I couldn't see the way forward.

309
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,480
Zhizhi.

310
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,440
I have nothing left.

311
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,319
So,

312
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,650
let me be the one to protect you from now on,

313
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
okay?

314
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,880
Get up.

315
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,120
Come home with me.
