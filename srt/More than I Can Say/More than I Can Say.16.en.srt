1
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
I, Lu Nanping,

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,600
am fortunate in this life

3
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
to have received my master's guidance.

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,720
Learning opera

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,050
gave me skills to make a living.

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
I've been at Mule Opera Troupe

7
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,960
for over 20 years now.

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
In the beginning,

9
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,840
there was me,

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,320
Nanwei

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
and Nanfeng.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,759
I'm truly happy from the bottom of my heart.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,009
It was Mule Opera Troupe

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
that gave me a sense of home again.

15
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,900
Later, as everyone knows,

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,760
Mule Opera Troupe had troubles.

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Our senior brother left.

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,039
Our master

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
also departed.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,340
Regardless of whether everyone here

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
respects me or not,

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,000
we were at least brothers from the same school.

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Until now,

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,040
Mule's performances have continued,

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,640
and we've managed to preserve our reputation.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Good.

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,720
I want to

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
take this opportunity today

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,329
to thank two people.

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,680
First,

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,620
Young Master Ruan,

32
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Ruan Suiqing.

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,880
Me?

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,440
Everyone knows.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,120
Since Young Master Ruan

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,380
began supporting our Mule Opera Troupe,

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,400
he has always been

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
there whenever needed

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
without asking for anything in return.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
Now,

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,260
when our troupe is in trouble,

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,120
Young Master Ruan still remains here,

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
never abandoning us,

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,880
doing everything he can.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,120
Including you, junior brother,

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,450
who was also invited by Young Master Ruan.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,780
Young Master Ruan,

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,560
without you,

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,920
we wouldn't have this feast.

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
The first cup

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
I toast to you.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Second Brother.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,000
I toast to you.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,480
You're too kind, Second Brother.

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
As I always say,

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Mule Society's affairs

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,940
are my affairs, Ruan Suiqing's affairs.

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,160
Second Brother is right.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,060
Young Master Ruan.

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,079
You're so magnanimous.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,480
Here,

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,480
I must say

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,329
that Young Master Ruan and I

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,690
had some minor disagreements before.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,080
But now I see

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,680
I was being petty.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
No, no, no.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,920
Young Master Ruan.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,980
You're too generous to hold grudges.

70
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
For the sake of Mule Society,

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,360
you came to find me despite our past conflicts.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,200
I...

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Lu Nanwei

74
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,920
toasts to you.

75
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,360
Third Brother, Third Brother.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
Did you two plan this together?

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Not giving me a break, are you?

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
Come, come.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm a bit drunk.

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
The second person

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
is also

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
someone I've wanted

83
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,570
to thank the most during this time.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,120
Zhiyi,

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,220
our little junior sister,

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,520
Chen Zhiyi.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,260
Since Master passed away,

88
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,490
not just everyone else,

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,370
but I too at one point

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
almost couldn't carry on.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Every day I kept thinking

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
that Mule Society

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
would just fall apart like this,

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,080
and what would happen after.

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Actually,

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,900
when I first said I wanted to perform here again,

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
it was just an excuse to leave Mule Society.

98
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,600
Seeing Mule Society so lifeless every day,

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
I just couldn't bear it anymore.

100
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
When I proposed

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
coming here,

102
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
I never thought

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,100
we could revive Mule Society's reputation.

104
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,280
It was Zhiyi.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
She kept persevering.

106
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,490
If it weren't for Zhiyi,

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,240
Mule Society

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,480
wouldn't have lasted until now.

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,120
Zhiyi,

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,140
this second cup

111
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,330
is from your senior brother to you.

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,250
Young Master He.

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Young Master He.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Young Master He,

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
don't scare me like that.

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,730
Young Master He,

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,730
you nearly frightened me to death.

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,330
Young Master He.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,930
Young Master He.

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,970
Young Master He.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
Young Master He,

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,880
I know why you've come to find me.

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
About Lu Nanwei canceling the performance,

124
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
just leave it to me to handle.

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,650
You don't need to worry.

126
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,200
Manager Feng,

127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
regarding this matter,

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,600
you don't need to concern yourself anymore.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I've already made arrangements

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
for what comes next.

131
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
What about

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
the rest?

133
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,450
What do you mean?

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
Your people lost the match.

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
Not only did they fail to retrieve the item,

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,170
but they also allowed them to gather together again.

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,960
This...

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,170
So you already know about this.

139
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
This...

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,159
It's all because of that wretched girl

141
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,420
showing off in public.

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,000
You mean

143
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,000
Chen Zhiyi?

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
At a place like Xiaodong Tian,

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,440
everyone just wants to see some excitement.

146
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,840
They've never seen a woman on stage before.

147
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,210
That's how she got away with it.

148
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,280
But don't worry.

149
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,240
Leave this to me.

150
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,250
As long as they don't leave Xiaodong Tian,

151
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
none of them can escape.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,760
So what is Manager Feng's plan?

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
I'll go directly to demand 'Old Dreams.'

154
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,840
If she won't give it up, no matter.

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,170
We'll set a trap for her.

156
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Drive her to her death.

157
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,600
'Old Dreams' will find its way to us.

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
Manager Feng,

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,200
you truly are brilliant.

160
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
You flatter me.

161
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
It's just a pity

162
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,000
your talents aren't being used in the right place.

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,080
And so

164
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,440
we decided to come to Xiaodong Tian.

165
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,400
It was also

166
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,620
my first time seeing Zhiyi

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
perform on stage.

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,500
No wonder she was so eager to get on stage before.

169
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,560
So that's why.

170
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,520
She heard us singing poorly

171
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,280
and couldn't stand it anymore.

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Well said.

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,850
To be honest with everyone,

174
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm someone who

175
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,440
doesn't really have grand ambitions.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
I've lived for over 40 years,

177
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
mostly going with the flow.

178
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
When my master taught me opera,

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,520
I learned.

180
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,780
When my master made me the second senior,

181
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,600
I did my best to take care of everyone.

182
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,920
Although

183
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,440
you've all left Mule Society,

184
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,680
in my heart,

185
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,260
you'll always be my brothers.

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
Today,

187
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,320
I want to use my seniority

188
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,580
to make a decision.

189
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,810
Second Brother,

190
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,800
we'll support whatever decision you make.

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,240
Yes, Second Brother,

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
just tell us.

193
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
As long as you don't mind,

194
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,500
we're still part of Mule Society.

195
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,160
You rascal, stealing my lines again.

196
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,890
I should be the one saying that.

197
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
Second Brother,

198
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
please continue.

199
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
I've decided

200
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
to nominate

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Chen Zhiyi

202
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,740
as the troupe leader of our Mule Society.

203
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,720
I agree.

204
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,540
Young Master Ruan,

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
I knew

206
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
you would definitely agree.

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,480
I agree too.

208
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,300
What about you all?

209
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,320
Of course we both agree.

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,380
Definitely agree.

211
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Then what are we waiting for?

212
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,680
Let's all toast to Troupe Leader Chen.

213
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,120
Come on.

214
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,900
To Troupe Leader Chen.

215
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
To our new troupe leader.

216
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,570
Come on, we have a troupe leader again.

217
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
To our leader.

218
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,160
To our leader.

219
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,940
Third Brother,

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
this trip was worth it, right?

221
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
Yes, Third Brother. Of course.

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,040
We were just waiting for you.

223
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,760
How is it?

224
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,560
Mule Society's wine is still the best.

225
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,090
Isn't it?

226
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,760
Yes.

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,820
You all keep drinking.

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Okay.

229
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,140
Here, Second Brother.

230
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
Mr. Chen

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I'd like to toast you.

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
You've had too much to drink.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Why are you joining in with them?

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
With my tolerance,

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,650
this is nothing.

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,690
Second Brother.

237
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,680
I've really missed your cooking.

238
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,960
I think about you and Senior Sister every day.

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Listen,

240
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,520
you're drinking with the troupe leader

241
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
without inviting me?

242
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,760
Third Brother,

243
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,520
stop teasing me.

244
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,800
I can't handle it.

245
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,220
Third Brother,

246
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,760
isn't He Zhen your real troupe leader?

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,240
It's such a good day today.

248
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
Don't stir up trouble.

249
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
This is my junior sister.

250
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,690
My junior sister sings so well.

251
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,160
She deserves to be the troupe leader.

252
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,280
Yes, yes.

253
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,400
Let me tell you.

254
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
In life,

255
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,280
we inevitably make some wrong decisions.

256
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes.

257
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,120
We're now at the He mansion,

258
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,200
occasionally performing for princes

259
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,660
and military officials for entertainment.

260
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
But they

261
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,040
only want to see those romantic plays.

262
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Or they watch us on stage

263
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,160
clowning around

264
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,490
and doing martial arts.

265
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,890
They're happy just watching that.

266
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
Those brutes,

267
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,170
do they understand opera? They don't.

268
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
I was wrong.

269
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Really wrong.

270
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,760
Come.

271
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll drink with you.

272
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,380
Third Brother,

273
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,000
if you believe

274
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,370
Mule Society is a place for real opera,

275
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,840
why did you leave?

276
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
Do you think

277
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,250
you're the only ones who care about Mule Society?

278
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
I know.

279
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
I left before.

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,100
That was wrong.

281
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,440
I truly know I was wrong.

282
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,020
But Junior Sister,

283
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,520
I promise

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
from now on,

285
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,090
whenever Mule Society needs help,

286
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,480
whether you forgive us or not,

287
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
we will definitely

288
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,440
come whenever you call,

289
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
even if it means offending the He family

290
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,640
or Fuchun Hall.

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,330
Don't worry about Fuchun Hall.

292
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,640
Sister.

293
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,960
I heard about what happened here.

294
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,040
So I came to see if I could help.

295
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
But now I see

296
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,530
it's been resolved.

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,760
Mingxu.

298
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
Listen to me.

299
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,250
Young Master He.

300
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,120
Even in your presence,

301
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
I still stand by what I said.

302
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,560
After all, we were trained by Mule Society.

303
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Now that they're in trouble,

304
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,560
we must help them.

305
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,060
If we miss performances because of this,

306
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,780
we'll accept the punishment.

307
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,040
I'll go.

308
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,820
You don't need to say more.

309
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,440
Since you're helping my sister,

310
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,860
why didn't you tell me?

311
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,860
What do you take me for?

312
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Now,

313
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,490
I'm giving you two options.

314
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Either

315
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
you both come back to Fuchun Hall with me

316
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,330
and face punishment together,

317
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
or

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
you toast me with a drink.

319
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,920
You two

320
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
and everyone else from Mule Society

321
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,560
can leave Fuchun Hall now.

322
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,410
I'll handle the indenture contracts.

323
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
But only if my sister

324
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
agrees to it.

325
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,880
What's wrong?

326
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,280
You could hear my sister's wonderful performance,

327
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
but now you've all gone deaf?

328
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,010
Young Master He,

329
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,810
do you mean what you say?

330
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,200
Was I not clear enough?

331
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,880
That's wonderful!

332
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,100
Pour it up! Pour me a drink.

333
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,600
Thank you for your generosity, Young Master He.

334
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,200
Good.

335
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,880
Thank you for your kindness, Young Master He.

336
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
We really owe you one.

337
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,080
Come on.

338
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Master Chen.

339
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,440
I really don't drink.

340
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,040
No, no.

341
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,800
Just one sip.

342
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,360
Don't drink too much.

343
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,890
Good wine, Second Brother.

344
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Let me tell you.

345
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,210
This wine I've been keeping

346
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,280
never had time to drink it before.

347
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,440
Finally brought it out today.

348
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,880
Now I can share it with everyone.

349
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Brother.

350
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,160
This wine is really good.

351
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
You've got good taste, kid.

352
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
I was wrong before.

353
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
For opera performances,

354
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,400
we still need to return to our Mule Society.

355
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,760
Right.

356
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
Come, drink up.

357
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,600
Why don't you go drink with them?

358
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm from the He family.

359
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,690
Even if I do good things,

360
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,940
I still can't fit in with them.

361
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Don't say that.

362
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,000
You are you,

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,400
and the He family is the He family.

364
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,160
Look.

365
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,480
They're so happy now,

366
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
all because of you.

367
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,650
What about you, Sister?

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
Are you happy for me too?

369
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,300
Since I was very young, I've known

370
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
that only by making others happy...

371
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,970
Only then can you get what you want.

372
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,960
Come.

373
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,400
Come here.

374
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,119
Come here.

375
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,240
What's your name?

376
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,880
Huaiqing.

377
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,540
Remember this.

378
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
From now on,

379
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,000
you'll take my surname

380
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,280
and be called

381
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,120
He Mingxu.

382
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,220
How about that?

383
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,460
Would you like some candied haws?

384
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,880
