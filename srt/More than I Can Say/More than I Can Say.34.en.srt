1
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Zhizhi

2
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,289
Before experiencing all of this with you,

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,979
I didn't fully understand

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
what it meant

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,440
to be blessed to meet your beautiful face

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,039
and have my life filled with warmth ever since.

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,960
At first, I wasn't sure

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,720
when I fell for you.

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,720
I thought

10
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,759
our daily teasing and bickering

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,370
was just friendly play.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Until

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,240
I lifted your wedding veil.

14
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,290
From that moment on,

15
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,800
I knew for certain.

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,720
I did love you.

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,160
But I couldn't force my feelings on you.

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
After all, back then,

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,810
the one in your heart

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,360
was Nanfeng.

21
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,280
Later,

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,579
We went through so many hardships together.

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,740
And I became even more certain

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
of my feelings.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,560
I want to tell you

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,440
In this life, only death will part us,

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
nothing else.

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,660
No matter where you are in the future,

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,780
What are you doing?

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,090
I'll always be by your side.

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Right beside you.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,800
Sir.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
Father.

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,840
I need to do something

35
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
very important for the Mule Society.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
You passed the old dream to me,

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
wanting me to pass it on.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,880
But this time,

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,280
I want to take a gamble.

40
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
I couldn't save my senior back then.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
This time,

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
I must save him.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,560
I know

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
you won't blame me.

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,380
[Washing clothes]

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,240
Sister.

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,200
I see the senior brothers are quite busy.

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,840
I don't have much to help with.

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,770
So I'm just washing their clothes.

50
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,090
Do you need something, Sister?

51
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
Give this to He Zhen.

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
Ask him to help us.

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
I want to see Ruan Suiqing.

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Perhaps when I see him,

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,560
I'll understand what

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,840
this is all about.

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I understand what you mean, Sister.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
I know.

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,900
This is very important to you.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,170
Keep it safe for now.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,730
As for the He family,

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,700
I'll speak to them for you.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,800
I'll try to arrange a meeting with Young Master Ruan.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
But without 'Old Dreams',

65
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
why would he help us?

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't worry, Sister.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I have my ways.

68
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,480
I've served He Zhen for so many years.

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,760
Even if I haven't achieved much, I've certainly put in the effort.

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Besides, the reason we fell out this time

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,159
was because I wanted to leave the He family.

72
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,890
He has no one else to rely on now.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
He might actually want to see me.

74
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,780
It's nothing more than

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,680
enduring some hardship

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,300
and taking some scolding.

77
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
No.

78
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
How could I let you go through that again?

79
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,040
Sister.

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,530
I didn't speak up before

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,450
because I didn't know what you were thinking.

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,840
Now that I know,

83
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,850
I will definitely help you.

84
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,640
No.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,120
You should take it with you.

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,800
Sister,

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,160
if you keep treating me like a stranger,

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
I won't help you anymore.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,860
All right then.

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
But please don't push yourself too hard.

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Whatever they ask for,

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
just tell me.

93
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,960
Oh, right.

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
See if you can find someone

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,440
to give this to Ruan Suiqing.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,320
This is...

97
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
When he sees this,

98
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,220
he'll understand my intentions.

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,300
When he sees this bridal veil,

100
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,520
he'll keep going.

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,159
You can only resort to such dirty tricks.

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,740
Trying to force me to confess.

103
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,460
Unless you use my corpse to sign the confession.

104
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
I know you have guts.

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,760
But I just want to see you suffer.

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,000
Seeing you like this

107
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,090
makes me feel so satisfied.

108
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,160
What other tricks do you have?

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
Just bring them on.

110
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
These past few days,

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,960
I've figured you out.

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
You're not that capable after all.

113
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm here

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
to tell you news from outside.

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,900
Right now outside,

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
because of your case,

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
there's a huge commotion.

118
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,280
Those fools from Mule Society

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,080
keep chattering all day long,

120
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,780
talking endlessly

121
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,000
but can't make any sense.

122
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
After all, they're just a bunch of actors,

123
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,460
born to be servants for others' entertainment.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,930
And your father?

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,970
He believes in you completely,

126
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,640
but a powerless old man

127
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,440
can only cough up blood from anxiety

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,080
and can't offer any real help.

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,600
You dog!

130
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
What I understand least of all

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,240
is my sister.

132
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
This morning she came to me

133
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,880
offering to give up 'Old Dreams'

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
to He Zhen

135
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,280
just to see you one more time.

136
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
You filthy thing!

137
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,000
What right do you have to make my sister worry about you every day?

138
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,480
My sister said you lifted her bridal veil.

139
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
Who do you think you are?

140
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
How dare you.

141
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
How does it feel, Young Master Ruan?

142
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Do you still like my methods?

143
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,320
I originally wanted to kill you,

144
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,360
but now I've changed my mind.

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,000
Lu Nanfeng is dead.

146
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,420
You helped preserve his reputation.

147
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Now,

148
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,320
I'll make sure your name is forever disgraced.

149
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Don't you want to know the truth?

150
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,840
Let me tell you.

151
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
I arranged Lu Nanfeng's death.

152
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
I killed the Xie family's maid.

153
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
I killed Feng Cun too.

154
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,560
And that Officer Lin,

155
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,650
and the old man from the Hongfeng Theater Troupe.

156
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
It was me.

157
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,800
All me.

158
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,610
What can you do about it?

159
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,760
You can only lie here,

160
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
becoming the next victim.

161
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
Let me tell you one more time.

162
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Mule Club.

163
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,500
Because you've already quit acting.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,680
Your father is basically half-dead already.

165
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
And your sister,

166
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,780
because of you,

167
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,800
doesn't eat or drink all day.

168
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,760
So,

169
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,970
to avoid affecting more people...

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
You should just admit it.

171
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,540
Trying to fool your grandfather?

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,560
You're still too green.

173
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,600
Believe it or not.

174
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,480
But are you willing to gamble with their lives?

175
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,440
For someone who's about to die.

176
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Keep an eye on him.

177
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,810
He doesn't have many days left.

178
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
Before he confesses,

179
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,440
don't let him die.

180
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
And this.

181
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,860
My sister asked me to give this to you.

182
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
She said

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,640
to hang in there.

184
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,200
I think so too.

185
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,730
At least you need to hang on until you confess.

186
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,880
So Young Master Ruan is really a murderer.

187
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,940
That can't be fake.

188
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,840
He was just taken in a few days ago.

189
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,040
Now his confession is already written.

190
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,960
I always thought he was just a spoiled rich kid.

191
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,690
This time he killed for a woman.

192
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
That's really ruthless.

193
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,640
Isn't that Manager Chen from Mule Club?

194
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,970
Young Master Ruan killed someone for her.

195
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Is that so?

196
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,880
Watch what you say.

197
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,280
Be careful your gossip doesn't hurt yourself.

198
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,720
Young Master He.

199
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,580
Little Walnut.

200
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,850
Have you seen my sister?

201
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,480
Senior Sister has been in Young Master Ruan's room and hasn't come out.

202
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
I didn't dare go in to ask her.

203
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
Why?

204
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
It clearly wasn't you who did it.

205
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
Why are you confessing?

206
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,160
Regarding the recent

207
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
murder cases

208
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,770
including Officer Lin Dalin's death,

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,800
I confess

210
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
that I, Ruan Suiqing, am responsible.

211
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,640
I also confess that my motive for murder

212
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
was because I fell in love with the troupe leader of Mule Society,

213
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,920
Chen Zhiyi.

214
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,440
From the beginning, I wanted her all to myself.

215
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,920
I never wanted her to be a troupe leader.

216
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,200
I only wanted

217
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,460
to keep her as my hidden treasure.

218
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,920
That's why I plotted against

219
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,650
her senior brother Lu Nanfeng.

220
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,140
To silence witnesses,

221
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I also killed the Xie family's maid.

222
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Furious about the supervisor's long-term punishment of Chen Zhiyi,

223
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,260
I simply killed him in the end.

224
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,840
As for Officer Lin,

225
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
it was merely because he was close to me

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,880
and had already found clues leading to me,

227
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
so I silenced him.

228
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,200
Now I've been caught red-handed.

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,800
I have no defense.

230
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,980
This criminal has only one last wish.

231
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,160
If before I die,

232
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
I could write one more play for Mr. Chen,

233
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
and stamp it with my seal myself,

234
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,720
I would have no regrets.

235
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,130
In the pouch containing the Ruan family seal,

236
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
I've left something for you.

237
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,599
After three days,

238
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,240
if I don't return,

239
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,660
I mean, if I can't make it back in time,

240
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,280
give the family seal to Dalin.

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,330
When he sees that pouch,

242
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,690
he'll understand everything.

243
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
Master Ruan,

244
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
I advise you not to touch it with your hands.

245
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,480
The fragrance of narcissus is harmless,

246
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,610
but its stems and roots are poisonous.

247
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,200
Accidentally ingesting it would cause you great suffering.

248
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,200
Finally,

249
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,560
I hope Mr. Chen can find someone who truly loves him,

250
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,640
find his own ethereal fairy.

251
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Remember

252
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
what I said under the tree.

253
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,400
I hope in her life,

254
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,720
she never meets someone like me again.

255
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,880
