1
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Sister,

2
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm sorry,

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,759
I...

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,479
Silly.

5
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,820
What are you apologizing for?

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm the foolish one.

7
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
Even now,

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
I still trust him so much.

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,120
I even wanted

10
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,280
to find out the truth.

11
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Sister.

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,490
What's the point of seeing him anyway?

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Look,

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
he's already confessed.

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
Maybe

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,300
Young Master Ruan was forced to confess.

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,560
Maybe he was tortured.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,960
Give me a few more days,

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll find a way for you to see him.

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
No need.

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,520
I know exactly what kind of person he is.

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
If he didn't do it,

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,800
no matter how much torture,

24
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
he would never give in.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
I never thought

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,360
that I, Chen Zhiyi, had such charm.

27
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,760
Even less did I expect

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
that the confidant who was always by my side

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,720
could be so vicious.

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Young Master Ruan

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
was a bit extreme in his actions.

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,490
But he did help us after all.

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,450
It doesn't matter anymore.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
He harmed my senior brother,

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,720
destroyed Mule Society,

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
and left me homeless.

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
In my lifetime,

38
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,320
I will never forgive him.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Mingxu.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Sister now

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
only has you.

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,120
Sister.

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
I promised

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
I would make you happy.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
And what I say,

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
I will definitely do.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
After going through so much,

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm a bit tired.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,680
The opera troupe,

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,880
the 'Old Dreams,'

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
are just relics of the past.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,200
I've decided,

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,250
we'll take 'Old Dreams'

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,010
and leave Mule Society.

55
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
But if we leave Mule Society,

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
how will we live?

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,380
I understand you want to leave this place

58
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,800
because it makes you sad.

59
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,159
Sister.

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,600
We only have each other now.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,300
If we leave Mule Society, we still need to find a way to live.

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
What I mean is,

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,200
if we could leave here

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,640
and live a steady life together.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Sister,

66
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,360
would you allow me

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,770
to marry you into the He family?

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,360
After all,

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,040
in these chaotic times,

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,120
perhaps only by returning there

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,480
will I have more ability to protect you.

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes.

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
What I promised you a few days ago,

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
I've already accomplished.

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
The person is now waiting outside with the things.

76
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,450
About my matter,

77
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,540
Father, what do you think?

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,880
Did you really think

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,170
I told you to get close to Chen Zhiyi

80
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
just to recognize her as family?

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,400
What I want is 'Old Dreams'.

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,200
All these years, I've done so many things.

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,280
I got close to both legal and criminal worlds.

84
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,010
Laundered money for warlords.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Painstakingly established the Opera Guild.

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
All just to bring down Lu Shun.

87
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,200
To take back what belongs to me.

88
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,100
And the result?

89
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
Lu Shun is dead.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,360
But that little girl

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,000
has the nerve to walk all over me.

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
All of this

93
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,280
is because I raised such a fine son

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,340
who wants to reunite with his sister.

95
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,840
Useless!

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Let me tell you.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,180
Even if you help Chen Zhiyi win the competition,

98
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,400
she'll still look down on you.

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,570
You know perfectly well

100
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,040
what kind of trash you are.

101
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,400
But I didn't know about

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,090
your plan to burn the costumes.

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Do I need to

104
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,980
report everything I do to you?

105
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,880
You're just a dog I've raised.

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
You knew all along

107
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
that Mule Society had a backup plan.

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,810
You were afraid Chen Zhiyi would lose,

109
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,360
so you didn't tell me.

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
Get out!

111
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,159
You worthless dog.

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
From now on,

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,090
you're no longer part of the He family.

114
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Father.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
I know I was wrong.

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
This time,

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
I promise you

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll make Chen Zhiyi

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
bring 'Old Dreams'

120
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,490
and come here in person.

121
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,400
Do you think

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
I can still trust you?

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Father,

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
you know

125
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,320
I only have one desire,

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,360
and that's Chen Zhiyi.

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,920
For her,

128
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,840
I'm willing to do anything.

129
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,040
All I need is

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,900
for you to put in a word with Commander Zhang.

131
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,080
Niece.

132
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Let's be straightforward.

133
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,290
You know very well what's going on between our families.

134
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
Last time,

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
you stood right here

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
and made me a promise.

137
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,760
But you broke your word.

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Then you brought Mule Society

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,160
and openly challenged me face to face.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Today,

141
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
what game are you playing now?

142
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,120
Uncle, you're mistaken.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
You set up the competition.

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,420
The invitation

145
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
was also signed at your insistence.

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,160
I simply followed the rules of the competition.

147
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,840
However,

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
I came here today

149
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
with sincere intentions.

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,640
What happened with Ruan Suiqing

151
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
has greatly affected Mule Society.

152
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,980
I don't want to worry about that anymore.

153
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
As a young woman,

154
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,770
being constantly gossiped about,

155
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,880
I've suffered enough.

156
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,640
I've realized

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,360
only Mingxu truly cares about me.

158
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
For the rest of my life,

159
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I want to live a simple, steady life.

160
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
You sure know how to talk.

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
But you just showed up like this.

162
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,120
It will affect my Fuchun Hall.

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
Besides,

164
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,160
where do you get such confidence

165
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,050
to think I would take you in?

166
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
'Old Dreams'

167
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,160
is no longer important to me.

168
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,160
Since you're so fixated on it,

169
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,400
why not give it to someone more deserving?

170
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,680
Moreover,

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
everyone in Haicheng knows

172
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,420
about your influence.

173
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,680
I came to you

174
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
because I need a patron.

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,520
What about

176
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Mule Society?

177
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,410
They won't understand, of course,

178
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,760
but I don't care.

179
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,520
I've decided to live with my brother

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
from now on,

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
and won't associate with them anymore.

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
It seems

183
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,000
to make you truly believe me,

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
I need to sign a contract in black and white,

185
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,520
a binding agreement.

186
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,440
This way,

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,800
from now on,

188
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,840
I'll perform at Fuchun Hall.

189
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Though unworthy,

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
thanks to your stage,

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,920
I've gained some fans now.

192
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,280
Let's sign this contract today.

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,600
What do you think?

194
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,640
Good.

195
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
Guards!

196
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
Bring paper and ink.

197
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes.

198
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
My niece.

199
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm not being paranoid.

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,320
With this document,

201
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
from now on,

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,040
we're family.

203
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,040
If you need anything,

204
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,440
just ask Mingxu.

205
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Tell him.

206
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
If he refuses,

207
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,740
I'll deal with him.

208
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Don't worry.

209
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,770
Mingxu has always treated me well.

210
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,440
I do have one request for your approval.

211
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Go ahead.

212
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
On the wedding day,

213
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,180
I would like to perform a play.

214
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,360
It would be a way to repay

215
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,690
the master-disciple bond between Mule Society and Lu Shun.

216
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
What do you

217
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
think?

218
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
I believe

219
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Zhiyi's request is reasonable.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,920
After all, there is a master-disciple relationship to consider.

221
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,840
A public performance would look good too.

222
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
Besides, on such an auspicious wedding day,

223
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,520
you can legitimately obtain 'Old Dreams'

224
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,980
which is also a good thing.

225
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,680
No problem.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
It's fine.

227
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Since everyone is already here,

228
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,450
what is there for me to worry about?

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,520
We'll do as you suggest.

230
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,500
We'll proceed with your plan.

231
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,520
Sir,

232
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
do you take care of all the flowers

233
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,960
and plants in this courtyard?

234
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Yes.

235
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,300
Is there something I can help you with, miss?

236
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm a guest staying here.

237
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,180
Just taking a stroll with nothing else to do.

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Do you know

239
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,600
where I might find narcissus flowers here?

240
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
We didn't have any before,

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
but

242
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
I heard a few days ago

243
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
they actually brought in two cartloads of narcissus.

244
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
They were taken to the master's treasure room though.

245
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,560
That place

246
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,160
can only be accessed by the master and young master.

247
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,960
I suppose

248
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
the master bought them

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
as gifts for some officials.

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,320
We servants don't know more than that.

251
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,960
So,

252
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,680
where is this treasure room?

253
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,210
It's in the back courtyard,

254
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,440
but miss, you'd better not go there.

255
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,940
The master doesn't like outsiders asking about his business.

256
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,960
Alright.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Thank you.

258
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,090
You're welcome.

259
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,240
Sister,

260
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,080
what brings you here?

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,060
I smelled the fragrance of narcissus

262
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
so I came to see.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,080
I think you must be mistaken, Sister.

264
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,760
None of the flowers in the yard have bloomed,

265
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,220
and the He family has never grown narcissus.

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,360
I know you like them.

267
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
In the next few days,

268
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,810
I'll have someone buy some for you.

269
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,480
But

270
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,160
I faintly

271
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,920
smell flower fragrance coming from this room.

272
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,640
So what is this place?

273
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,920
Why,

274
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,720
we're about to get married

275
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,040
and you still have secrets from me?

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,840
Alright then,

277
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,050
I won't ask anymore.

278
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
No,

279
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,320
Sister,

280
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
I'm already yours completely.

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
How could I have any secrets?

282
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,080
This place

283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,610
is He Zhen's treasure room.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
The He family

285
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,680
has always had connections with both legitimate and underground circles in Haicheng,

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,610
so there's naturally a lot of gift-giving involved.

287
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,760
He Zhen almost never lets anyone in there.

288
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Only sometimes,

289
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,200
when he arranges for me to meet important people

290
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
and gifts are needed,

291
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,610
does he allow me inside.

292
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,400
There are many imported Western items inside.

293
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,680
What you smelled must be

294
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,410
perfume or something similar.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,840
It's alright.

296
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,360
If you like it,

297
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,420
I'll find some for you elsewhere.

298
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,160
I have something

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,330
I'd like you to help me with.

300
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,960
On our wedding day,

301
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,640
I want someone to be present.

302
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,000
You're talking about

303
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,380
Ruan Suiqing, aren't you?

304
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,400
Yes.

305
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,780
But don't misunderstand.

306
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,640
I just feel that

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,480
after how he's harmed me,

308
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,760
now I want to break free from the past

309
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
and have a new beginning.

310
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,720
I want him, before he dies,

311
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,119
to see with his own eyes,

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,090
to watch me leave him behind

313
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,120
and have a better, happier life.

314
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,960
That would be the greatest punishment for him.

315
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
Also,

316
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,040
it would

317
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,720
comfort the spirits of my senior fellow apprentice

318
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
and my master in heaven.

319
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,280
If doing this

320
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,840
will make you feel better,

321
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,200
I'll find a way.

322
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Sister,

323
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
I want you to know

324
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
how important you are to me.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,640
Whatever you want,

326
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,640
I will give you.

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Alright,

328
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,490
let's not talk about this anymore.

329
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,440
In a few days, we'll be married.

330
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,640
Whenever I think about it,

331
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,400
I can't help feeling happy inside.
