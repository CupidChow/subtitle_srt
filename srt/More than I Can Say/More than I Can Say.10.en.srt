1
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,010
Who's there?

2
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,400
You're the murderer,

3
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
working with them,

4
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,210
killing to silence witnesses.

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you also involved in Lu Nanfeng's case?

6
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,970
Open your eyes and look carefully.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
Didn't you want to see an official?

8
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
The official is right here.

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,520
But investigation is police business.

10
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,160
So what exactly are you doing here, Young Master Ruan?

11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Police.

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,280
The police aren't doing their job.

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,009
What's all this arguing about?

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,680
Fine then, Young Master Ruan.

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,800
Come with me.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Lin Dalin, are you crazy?

17
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,539
You didn't even tell me you were back,

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
and the first thing you do is try to dislocate my arm.

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Your arm is still attached, isn't it?

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Besides,

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,080
it's been so long since I've seen you.

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,720
How was I supposed to know you've gotten weaker?

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,919
Young Master Ruan,

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,800
that's not how you investigate a case.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,860
Let me tell you something.

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,400
What you're doing is called torture.

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,930
Investigations need to be based on evidence.

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,020
If you keep this up,

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,600
you'll alert the suspects. Do you understand?

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,560
I get it.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
Weren't you doing well in the neighboring province?

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,850
Why did you suddenly come back?

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Officially,

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,440
I was specially transferred here

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,320
for this case.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
But honestly,

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,160
I just couldn't get along

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
with those people.

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,240
I was surrounded by sycophants,

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,600
and I couldn't stand it.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,000
It's fine.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
A justice warrior like me

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,880
will shine wherever I go.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,370
Enough about me.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
How are you doing?

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,540
Don't even ask.

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,200
Earlier,

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,140
I could have rescued Nanfeng,

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,160
but then a one-eyed man showed up out of nowhere,

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
and everything got delayed.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,579
That's what happens when you're so flashy all the time.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Have you heard about the old man?

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, I have.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,280
After Old Man Wan disappeared,

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,480
I had people follow up for quite a while,

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,180
but there were no results.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
This old man

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,340
has always been a free spirit.

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
He probably went off somewhere without telling his family,

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,160
so I didn't continue searching.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,000
Since I've returned,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
besides investigating Nanfeng's case,

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,420
I also visited the Hongfeng Theater Troupe.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,640
This is an inventory list

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
I copied from the old man's room.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Flower tea.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
And I think

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,130
although the old man likes to have fun,

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,080
based on what we know about him,

70
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,220
he wouldn't travel far without telling his family.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
After all,

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,839
a whole opera troupe is waiting for him to take charge.

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,880
Are you saying

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,040
the old man's disappearance

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,450
isn't just a simple case of going missing?

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,500
It's hard to say right now,

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,560
but I feel there's more to it.

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Alright then.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
Keep an eye on this matter,

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
and if you need

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
any help with it later,

82
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,450
just let me know.

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
You rascal.

84
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,960
Welcome back.

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
Suiqing.

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,680
Suiqing.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Ruan Suiqing,

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
slow down,

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
wait for me!

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Hurry up!

91
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,700
We'll miss the show if we're late.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,600
If your father finds out you skipped class to watch the opera,

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,330
he'll break your legs for sure.

94
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,720
Don't drag me into it when that happens.

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Let's go!

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
What are you looking at?

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,380
You're not in a hurry anymore?

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Are you crazy?

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
That's your allowance for the month.

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
Why give it all to a beggar?

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Wait.

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,280
Why are you taking it back?

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,770
Something's not right.

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
Have you ever seen a beggar

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,480
who doesn't react to three silver dollars?

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,960
He's not blind.

107
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,600
He can clearly see.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Let's go.

109
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,740
Aren't you watching the show?

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,760
I knew it.

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,840
No one has ever

112
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,600
been able to refuse

113
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,340
Young Master Ruan's request.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Look,

115
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
he's ignoring you.

116
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
And look at his hands,

117
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,580
they don't look like a typical beggar's.

118
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Sir,

119
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,800
you've eaten the food and taken the money.

120
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Time to speak up, don't you think?

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,930
What are you looking at?

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,960
Tell me,

123
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,240
what do you see?

124
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,820
A noodle stand.

125
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
A father and son

126
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,610
selling noodles there.

127
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,640
Noodles with meat cost one coin more than those with pickles.

128
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Just now,

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
the father scolded his son

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
because he cooked

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,640
an extra serving of noodles.

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
Nothing special about that.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,640
Father,

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
The world is in chaos now.

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Why don't we gather our former troops

136
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,120
and raise an army during this turmoil

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,380
to reclaim the empire?

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,740
My son, your words are misguided.

139
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,420
Though the world is full of conflict,

140
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
we are no longer royal father and son.

141
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,640
This world belongs to the common people.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Since we have fallen to this state,

143
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,920
we must forget our past identities

144
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,560
and start anew.

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
But the national grudge and family hatred

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,559
I will never forget as long as I live!

147
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,280
Father, as the rightful emperor,

148
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,480
are you truly content

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
to remain in this small corner of the world?

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
Throughout history

151
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
there have been countless rises and falls.

152
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,320
How could we, father and son,

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
expect to prosper forever?

154
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,680
As they say,

155
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,170
'When will the cycle of revenge ever end?'

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,840
Enough.

157
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Speak no more of restoring our country.

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
From now on, we are simply

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
common noodle sellers in the marketplace.

160
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
One bowl at a time,

161
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,020
earning our living by our skills.

162
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,940
Your methods, sir,

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,520
are truly remarkable.

164
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,520
Let's go.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,600
Sir,

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
I have one more question to ask.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
Everything in this world

168
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
is essentially about relationships between people.

169
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Find these connections,

170
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,400
and you can write the story in your heart.

171
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,680
As they say,

172
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,520
when you have the universe in your mind,

173
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,880
your vision naturally broadens.

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,240
This young man is quite interesting.

175
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,320
Observant,

176
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,560
with just one glance at my hands,

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,640
he knew I was no ordinary beggar.

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,120
Sir, your thinking is profound.

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm ashamed I can't match it.

180
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,920
I hope to become your student.

181
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,120
Please be generous with your guidance.

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Master.

183
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
Thank you.

184
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,240
Thanks.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
Qishilin bakery has bread at half price.

186
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,160
And pastries too.

187
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,490
Hurry up and get in line!

188
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,040
Brother.

189
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,660
You must be starving after kneeling all day.

190
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Yi'er.

192
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,840
I still have some things

193
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
I need to tell you.

194
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,200
You've been learning opera with me and your senior brother since you were little.

195
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,960
I know you have talent

196
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,760
and are born for the stage.

197
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,280
But being a woman has always

198
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,740
kept you from performing.

199
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,960
I've been cautious all my life

200
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,160
and thought about taking a step forward.

201
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
But as I've grown older,

202
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,720
I've become more traditional.

203
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,360
After your eldest brother left,

204
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,200
Mule Opera Troupe has no one left.

205
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,880
From now on,

206
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,160
you must make your own decisions.

207
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,600
Today I want to give you 'Old Dreams',

208
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,320
but you must promise me two things.

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,000
First.

210
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,850
If you decide to perform opera,

211
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,120
then 'Old Dreams'

212
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,800
is a play you must perform.

213
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
But I want you to wait five years,

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,120
before you can open it.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,640
Second.

216
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,840
If you marry,

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
I hope the person standing beside you

218
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,520
will be someone you truly love

219
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,320
and who genuinely cares for you.

220
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
Don't be like me,

221
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,480
trapped by worldly constraints.

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
Child.

223
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,720
Remember this.

224
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,840
No one can stay by your side forever.

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,640
In life,

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,240
the paths we take

227
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,360
are all walked by ourselves.

228
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,000
Only the path you forge yourself

229
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,640
is the most solid one.

230
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,800
Whether you choose to perform

231
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
or to marry,

232
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,160
I hope

233
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,440
you follow your heart.

234
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
I believe that someday,

235
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,640
whether on stage or in life,

236
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
my Yi'er

237
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
will shine with her own light.

238
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh, right.

239
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,690
I've prepared a small gift for you,

240
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,100
but didn't have time to give it to you.

241
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,050
It's in the small box in my room,

242
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,580
remember to check it when you go back.

243
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,780
I'm grateful you went on stage for me that day

244
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,980
and stood up for me.

245
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,000
Deep down,

246
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,330
I've always wanted to see you perform.

247
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
Perhaps someday,

248
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,560
I'll have to respectfully

249
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,960
call you Boss Chen.

250
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,440
Marriage.

251
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,840
Shepherd.

252
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,300
Makeup.

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Brother.

254
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,800
Why are you so good to me?

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,359
As your senior brother,

256
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,359
I should be nice to my junior sister.

257
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,280
Really?

258
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,079
Is that all?

259
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,920
Of course not.

260
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,760
Everyone in Mule Opera Troupe

261
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
should help each other,

262
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,319
that's what makes us family.

263
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,600
I don't just follow rules,

264
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,380
I follow what's right.

265
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,370
You're grown up now.

266
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,100
You need to learn how to behave properly.

267
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,080
Senior Brother.

268
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,600
Go get him.

269
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,040
Since he's joined us,

270
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,410
he should show some sincerity.

271
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
Go tell him

272
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,250
to find that girl from Mule Society

273
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,460
and bring 'Old Dreams'

274
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
back to me.
