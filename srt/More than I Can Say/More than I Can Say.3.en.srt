1
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Watch where you're going!

2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,720
You blind little girl.

3
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,880
Are you being reasonable?

4
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,010
You're the one who suddenly appeared.

5
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,220
What are you doing?

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,380
Miss, where did you get this bell?

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,479
What's going on here?

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,560
In broad daylight,

9
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,820
several grown men bullying a young girl.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,520
What?

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,009
You think it's right to bump into someone?

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,140
I apologize

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
for my servant's carelessness.

14
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,740
Are you alright, miss?

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,440
Why does this person look so familiar?

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,360
There are plenty of people who look alike.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
Being a young lady, when you go out

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
don't argue with others.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
What if you end up at a disadvantage?

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Why do you keep following me?

21
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:45,960
I...

22
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,560
Master.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,930
You wanted to see me?

24
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,080
Nanfeng.

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,600
You've been studying at Mule Opera Troupe

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,260
for about 20 years now, right?

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,100
I started learning the craft at five.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,450
Thanks to your guidance

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,980
and careful instruction,

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
until now,

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,520
it has been exactly 23 years.

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,400
Now

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,360
you've become a lead performer.

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,640
This is your indenture contract.

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,640
This...

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Master.

38
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,880
Are you sending me away?

39
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,410
You've completed your apprenticeship for three years now.

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,240
You've earned enough reputation

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,700
for the Mule Opera Troupe.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
However,

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
once an opera performer enters the real world,

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,800
dealing with people and social affairs

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,680
becomes a required course.

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Nanfeng,

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,360
I have nothing more

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,480
to teach you.

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
A jade pot holds a pure heart,

50
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,399
a vermilion brush writes the teacher's spirit.

51
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,529
The kindness from master to disciple,

52
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,300
I would never dare forget.

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,160
I only wish to stay by your side,

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
to be like you,

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
and pass down everything

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,300
from Mule Society.

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,159
Come.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Alright.

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,480
Let's not say more.

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,620
Since you're willing to stay,

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,980
remind your junior disciples to practice diligently.

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,800
Especially Zhiyi.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,500
She's still young,

64
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,180
and doesn't understand many things.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,730
As the senior disciple,

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
you must guide her often.

67
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Yes.

68
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
By the way,

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,290
there's an exchange opportunity in Shanghai recently.

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,120
I want you to go and see.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
First,

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,700
to broaden your horizons.

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,360
Second,

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
I want Mule Society

75
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,220
to reach a wider audience.

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
When you return,

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
it will be time

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,409
to pass 'Old Dreams'

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,840
on to you.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
No! No!

81
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,170
I suppose those opera troupes that used to rely on Boss He

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,040
have seen similar situations before.

83
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
But if Boss He

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
thinks this will make me bow down to him,

85
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,720
he's underestimating this old beggar.

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Boss Wan,

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
why so angry?

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,200
I respect that you're a veteran in the opera business.

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,000
As long as you sign this contract,

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
from now on,

91
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,080
we'll be on the same side.

92
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Senior.

93
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
You're still awake?

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
I lost something important.

95
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,410
It's been on my mind.

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,280
Can't sleep.

97
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,440
It seems you've

98
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,450
already found it for me.

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
Of course

100
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,760
I had to bring it back to you.

101
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,080
Those things she wrote to you...

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
If others saw them,

103
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
who knows what they'd say about you.

104
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
Lu Nanfeng,

105
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,159
come to your senses.

106
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
You're the pillar of Mule Society.

107
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,520
Enough!

108
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,400
What spell has she cast on you

109
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,460
that makes you protect her like this?

110
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,760
Even giving her hairpins.

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
If I had known

112
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,120
that hairpin was for her,

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
I would have thrown it away long ago.

114
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,920
Senior Brother.

115
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,020
I shouldn't have stolen your letter.

117
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,480
Since I was little at Mule Society,

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
you've always cared for me the most.

119
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
If you get together with Miss Xie,

120
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,920
you'll abandon me.

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
I don't want you to be with her.

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
My relationship with Miss Xie isn't what you think.

123
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
You cannot insult her.

124
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
Lu Nanfeng.

125
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,920
Have you forgotten?

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Since you first performed on stage,

127
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
who was it that carefully drew your eyebrows?

128
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,720
Who made you soup on cold days?

129
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,120
The things I can do for you,

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,360
she will never do in her lifetime.

131
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
Just tell me,

132
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
can that Miss Xie,

133
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
can she disregard everything

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
to perform with you at Mule Society?

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
That's between her and me.

136
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
She can't. She can't.

137
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
She can't do anything.

138
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Lu Nanfeng.

139
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,600
I don't want you two together.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
It seems I've spoiled you too much,

141
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
which has made you

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
so unreasonable and willful now.

143
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,480
I...

144
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Now you're calling me unreasonable and willful.

145
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,760
You never used to scold me before.

146
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Fine.

147
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,960
Fine.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm willful.

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm going to find Master right now.

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,720
I'll tell him that for a woman,

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
you're abandoning Mule Society.

152
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,650
Can't you be more sensible?

153
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,850
You stole my letter,

154
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,450
and I pretended not to know.

155
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
I can forgive your unreasonable behavior.

156
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,120
But if you walk out now

157
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,040
and thoughtlessly

158
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,560
make the contents of the letter public,

159
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
you'll be insulting Miss Xie's reputation

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,160
and forcing me to leave.

161
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Between us,

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,060
there will be nothing more to say.

163
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Fine.

164
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
Lu Nanfeng.

165
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,130
I'll give you what you want.

166
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,060
Junior Sister.

167
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
What you said,

168
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
I understand all too well.

169
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,120
I shouldn't have had such hopes and fantasies.

170
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
So,

171
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,530
I'll find an opportunity to clarify things with Miss Xie

172
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
and find a proper way

173
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,560
to end all of this.

174
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
I won't leave you,

175
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
nor will I leave Master,

176
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,560
and certainly not Mule Society.

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Since childhood,

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,050
I've always given in to you.

179
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,520
But this time,

180
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
please listen to me for once.

181
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,580
Consider it my plea to you.

182
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,280
Alright?

183
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,970
This theater troupe is my life.

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,100
I won't let you take it away so easily.

185
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,960
Since Manager Wan refuses to recognize our theater guild,

186
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,960
if anything happens in the future,

187
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,600
don't blame me for not looking after you.

188
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Manager He, just keep your own people in line.

189
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,160
If they cause trouble again

190
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,900
at my Hongfeng Theater Troupe for no reason,

191
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
if there's a next time,

192
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,280
I'm afraid my punishment

193
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,360
will be even more severe than yours.

194
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
Since Mr. Wan has made up his mind,

195
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,320
I won't insist that he stays.

196
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,280
Go,

197
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
escort Mr. Wan home safely.

198
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,520
No need.

199
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,600
I gave him the opportunity,

200
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
since he doesn't want it,

201
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,440
I have nothing more to say.

202
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
This way,

203
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,320
the Hongfeng Opera Troupe is gone.

204
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,180
Of the two toughest nuts to crack,

205
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
only the Mule Society remains.

206
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Heaven is truly on my side.

207
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,200
Lu Shun,

208
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,160
let's see how you can protect your

209
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Mule Society this time.
