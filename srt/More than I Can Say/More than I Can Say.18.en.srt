1
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,039
How is it?

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Do you like it?

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
I do.

4
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,840
Great.

5
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,720
Now,

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,479
let's welcome the head of our Mule Opera Troupe

7
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
to say a few words.

8
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,479
Say something.

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Go ahead,

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
say something, senior.

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Why don't you sing something?

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes, sing something!

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Sing!

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Go on, Ms. Chen.

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,960
Come on!

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
Thank you all.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,760
Thank you for your support

18
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
and for making me the new head of the Mule Opera Troupe.

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
You deserve it.

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
Well deserved.

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,380
Zhiyi sings beautifully.

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,560
I know

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,520
you recognized me because of my performance yesterday,

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
and I truly appreciate that.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm really grateful.

26
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,600
But I can't accept.

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm truly happy

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
to see all of you seniors

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,170
return to the Mule Opera Troupe again.

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
And also,

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
this sign behind me

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
has been hung up once more.

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,800
I believe

34
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,880
whatever happened in the past

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,090
is all behind us now.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Moreover,

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
at this very moment,

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,200
I believe my master

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
is watching us from heaven.

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
He would be pleased.

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
Actually,

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
after I went on stage yesterday,

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
I was very scared.

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
Extremely scared.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,970
Now you want me to be the troupe leader,

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm even more terrified.

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
Mule Society.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,840
That's our home.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
Think about it.

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,360
As a female troupe leader...

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
It's everyone's life,

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
and mine too.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
So I can't perform.

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
I can't be the leader either.

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Chen Zhiyi.

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,010
Do you realize what you're saying?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Suiqing,

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,740
you don't understand.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
If this continues...

60
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,500
No, you don't understand.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,720
You've sacrificed so much for the Mule Society.

62
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,380
We're all willing to help you,

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,279
but now you want to quit?

64
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,540
What does that make us?

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,900
Are you making a joke of the Mule Society?

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,960
Chen Zhiyi.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
I always thought

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,860
performing on stage was your greatest wish.

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
Now your wish has come true.

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,320
All your fellow performers have returned.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
They want to help you.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
What are they after?

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,880
They just want to find someone

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,240
who can dedicate themselves to Mule Society,

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,680
a troupe leader who would risk everything for opera,

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,540
so that Mule Society can survive.

77
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,180
What are you afraid of?

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Where is the Zhiyi I used to know?

79
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,340
Young Master Ruan.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Since I am unwilling.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,530
Second Brother.

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,010
Now is not the time to take her side.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Suiqing.

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,240
You're right.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
It's all my fault.

86
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
All this time,

87
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,520
you've misjudged me.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
This is my fate.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,650
I must accept it.

90
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,400
Zhiyi! Senior! Zhiyi!

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Senior, that's not what I meant.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,120
I keep dogs to guard my house,

94
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
not to create more problems.

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,360
Have you forgotten what you're supposed to do?

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,820
That Officer Lin is already watching the He family.

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
Go clean up your mess.

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,440
Don't make me fix your problems again.

99
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Father.

100
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,840
I promise it won't happen again.

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,280
You mad dog,

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,970
once you bite...

103
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,640
Mr. Ruan,

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,780
we have great respect for you.

105
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
After all,

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,760
the influence of Haicheng Daily

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
is well known to us.

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,960
Captain Xu, you flatter me.

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,000
I

110
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
am just making a living

111
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,320
with my pen.

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,800
May I ask what brings you two here today?

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,280
Mr. Ruan is straightforward,

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,140
then we'll get right to the point.

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
The old general has passed away,

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
and the young general will be entering the city in a day or two.

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,400
However,

118
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
there have been some false rumors lately

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,460
that are giving us a headache.

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,120
So regarding public opinion and propaganda,

121
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,050
we'd appreciate your assistance.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,100
Colonel Zhang,

123
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
please,

124
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
have some tea.

125
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,440
A literary master like Mr. Ruan

126
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
enjoys white tea.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
White tea is cooling

128
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,500
and good for reducing inner heat.

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,320
It requires no additional processing

130
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,280
and best preserves the natural character of the tea leaves.

131
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,159
I heard your son is good at writing articles

132
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,159
and has excellent calligraphy.

133
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
Not at all.

134
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,159
His skill level

135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
is nowhere near good enough to write for the Young Marshal.

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,760
He spends all day fooling around.

137
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
He only writes about romantic affairs.

138
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,080
It's embarrassing.

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,290
I won't show you his work and make a fool of myself.

140
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
You're too modest.

141
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
I think

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,760
writing a welcome piece for the Young Marshal

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,840
is a great opportunity that would be perfect for you.

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,400
I'd be most reassured.

145
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,520
If you accept this task,

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,480
then the Young Marshal's public image in Haicheng

147
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
will be well protected.

148
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
As for me,

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,460
I will certainly look after your interests.

150
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
Perhaps

151
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
I could help your son

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,450
secure a position in the Young Marshal's circle.

153
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
Then your Ruan family

154
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,000
would have a strong backer.

155
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
What do you think?

156
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,180
Take care, you two.

157
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Why are soldiers coming to our home?

158
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,280
Things are unstable these days.

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Stay quietly at home.

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Don't wander around.

161
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,120
Lost your soul?

162
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Boss,

163
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,610
another plate of lamb, please.

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,560
What's up?

165
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,060
Suddenly decided to buy me a drink today?

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,600
Had a fight with your boss Chen?

167
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
About the Young Marshal coming to town,

168
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
do you know anything?

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Why are you asking about this?

170
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Never mind that.

171
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,540
Just tell me what you know.

172
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
It's happening in the next few days.

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,040
Everyone at our police station,

174
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,360
to welcome this Young Marshal,

175
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
has meetings every day.

176
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,120
I haven't been home for days.

177
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,440
So what are you all doing?

178
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,680
What else?

179
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,040
Maintaining order.

180
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,040
Speaking of which,

181
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm warning you,

182
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,200
you better behave yourself these days.

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Once the Young Marshal enters the city,

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
everything in Haicheng will change.

185
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,920
Colonel Zhang's soldiers have been arresting people lately.

186
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,320
Anyone who opposes the warlords

187
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,800
or calls them feudal bureaucrats

188
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,760
gets taken away.

189
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Look,

190
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,050
they've already arrested more than ten intellectuals.

191
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
These heartless bastards.

192
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,800
Accept your fate.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,440
Now is not the time to stand out and be brave.

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm warning you,

195
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,840
behave yourself and don't cause trouble.

196
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Do you hear me?

197
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,520
Drink slowly.

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,250
You don't handle alcohol well.

199
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,480
If you get drunk, I won't carry you home.

200
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,970
You pay the bill.

201
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,850
Where are you going?

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,560
Who taught you this?

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,360
You invite me for drinks but I have to pay.

204
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
Isn't that robbery?

205
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,320
Boss!

206
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,530
I don't want that lamb anymore.

207
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,780
Young Master Ruan!

208
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080
Haven't seen you for a long time.

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,200
Why don't you go to Xiaodong Tian anymore?

210
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
I was just

211
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
passing by.

212
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Why are you packing up so early today?

213
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,040
No.

214
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,640
I forgot to bring two sets of Second Brother's costumes.

215
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,300
I came back to get them for him.

216
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
Why don't you come with me later?

217
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,520
But

218
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Senior Sister isn't here today.

219
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I won't go.

220
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
I was just passing by.

221
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,840
I need to tell you something.

222
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,570
The city isn't safe these days.

223
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
Warlords are coming into the city.

224
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Tell Second Brother to be careful.

225
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,640
If necessary,

226
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
just cancel the performances for a couple of days.

227
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Alright.

228
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,160
Do you

229
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
have anything else to say?

230
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,920
No.

231
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,820
Just remember what I told you.

232
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,530
Tell Second Brother

233
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,340
to remember this at all costs.

234
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Miss,

235
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,530
who are you looking for?

236
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,800
Sorry to bother you.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,800
I...

238
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
I had a friend who used to live here.

239
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,280
I came to see him.

240
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Friend?

241
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,640
No one has lived here for quite some time.

242
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,160
An opera troupe used to stay here before.

243
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,690
What's your friend's name?

244
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
His surname is Lu.

245
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,760
Oh, Mr. Lu's friend.

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
He's not here anymore.

247
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,480
I heard he offended someone.

248
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Got sent to the battlefield.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
Mule Opera Troupe had bad luck too.

250
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Such a popular troupe.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Just disbanded like that.

252
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,040
Miss.

253
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,160
If you don't have any business here, you should leave.

254
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm just the doorkeeper.

255
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,160
It wouldn't look good if the owner sees you.

256
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Sir.

257
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,440
Could I go in and take a look?

258
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,210
I'll leave right after.

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
All right.

260
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Be quick.

261
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,160
I'll lock up at sunset.

262
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,600
Thank you.

263
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,680
If she has committed a grave mistake today,

264
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm willing to share the punishment with my junior sister.

265
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
I hope Master will grant this request.

266
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,920
I believe that someday,

267
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,840
whether on stage or in life,

268
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
my daughter

269
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,160
will shine with her own brilliance.

270
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,040
We've been through so much together.

271
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,440
When I saw you standing on that stage today,

272
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,320
I felt so happy inside.

273
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Your dream has come true.

274
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,880
I just hope you can keep on singing.

275
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,640
That's who you truly are.

276
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,960
Perhaps someday,

277
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
we might part ways.

278
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
But I hope

279
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,880
in your life's memories,

280
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
you'll always remember there's someone

281
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,280
who will stand behind you unconditionally.

282
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Supporting you,

283
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,360
protecting you.

284
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,440
Miss,

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,120
I need to close up now.

286
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,000
Please leave.

287
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,480
Both of you, put away this screen carefully later,

288
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,120
load it onto the cart,

289
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,650
and deliver it to the owner.

290
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,640
Be careful.

291
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,890
Don't damage it.

292
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,040
Why?

293
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm asking you why.

294
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,180
What do you mean 'why'?

295
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,120
I told you to stay at home,

296
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
but you went out fooling around again.

297
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,960
Why are you writing articles for that damn Young Marshal?

298
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,760
Get out.

299
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,800
He beats students,

300
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,240
arrests anyone who opposes him.

301
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,600
Who does he think he is?

302
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
The emperor?

303
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Even the emperor has been deposed now.

304
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,330
I don't understand.

305
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,440
The person who taught me to stand by my principles,

306
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
how could you become like this?

307
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,160
Enough.

308
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,440
I told you to get out.

309
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
This is not your concern.

310
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,360
For the greater good of the nation,

311
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,160
how can I shy away from hardship?

312
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,319
How could I bow and scrape before the powerful,

313
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,180
which would only bring me misery?

314
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,040
Enough!

315
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Use a blunt pen to write sharp articles,

316
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
and a sharp pen to write dull ones.

317
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,119
Wasting time.

318
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,839
Yes.

319
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,839
If I hadn't been 'wasting time,'

320
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,720
I wouldn't have known that my father,

321
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,319
the owner of Haicheng Daily,

322
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,520
has now become a lackey of the warlords,

323
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,079
and an accomplice in harming innocent people.

324
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,520
You.

325
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,520
You're in no position

326
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
to lecture me about scholarly integrity.

327
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,440
What you see

328
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,640
is just the tip of the iceberg.

329
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,120
Do you truly understand

330
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,760
the situation in Haicheng?

331
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,730
Do you know who holds

332
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
the real power

333
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,440
in this city?

334
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
All you see

335
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,080
are innocent students being arrested.

336
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
But do you realize

337
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,120
if I don't write this article,

338
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,050
who will suffer the consequences?

339
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,880
If we also take a stance against it,

340
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,040
how many intellectuals in Haicheng will suffer,

341
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,120
how many newspapers

342
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,680
will fall into the hands of those villains.

343
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Do you know all this?

344
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,640
I only know that

345
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,050
the first character you taught me to write, holding my hand,

346
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,080
was 'human'.
