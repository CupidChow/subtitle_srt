1
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,760
Mule Opera Troupe is indeed going downhill.

2
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,840
Not only is their performance terrible,

3
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,039
but after losing their star performer,

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,520
they have to rely on a mere girl.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,039
Watch your mouth.

6
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,100
What are you doing,

7
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,580
Young Master Ruan?

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
I've already been very respectful to you.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
If you don't appreciate that,

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
don't blame my brothers for taking action.

11
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,680
I always thought

12
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,380
Xiaodong Theater was a place where talent matters.

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,530
What did you say?

15
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,560
Easy now.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Calm down, please.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,479
My junior sister doesn't know how to speak properly.

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,600
Everyone, please calm down.

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,840
Please calm down.

20
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,770
Second Brother.

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Zhiyi is right.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,280
They're the ones who claimed this territory first.

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
Who are you saying claimed territory?

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,759
Xiaodong Theater is a place where skill matters.

25
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,680
If you don't have what it takes,

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
then get out of here now.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
You call this earning your keep with skill?

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
First you all come demanding money,

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,300
now you're kicking us out,

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,620
all because you say our performance isn't good enough.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,600
Our Mule Troupe, no matter when,

32
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,840
will never be judged by a bunch of street performers like you.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,079
Zhiyi, you woman, how dare you talk about us like that!

34
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
Is your Mule Troupe any good?

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
You know the truth. Easy now, calm down.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Brother, stop wasting words on them.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Attack!

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,520
Calm down.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,650
How dare you push me!

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Stop!

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
You filthy opera performers!

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,440
What do you want?

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,300
Stop fighting!

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,540
Let's get them!

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,760
What now?

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,840
Stop it!

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,760
Get him!

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,860
You said our Mule Society isn't good enough.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,970
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
Okay.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,480
Alright.

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,240
Fine.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,400
Good.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,480
Sure.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,690
We've got a full house tonight, everyone.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,760
Little Walnut is here to collect tips for our performers.

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Come on.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,490
Wealth and good fortune to you all.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,120
How about giving a coin?

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,850
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
Zhiyi.

62
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,080
Don't worry.

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
There's a reward now.

64
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,960
Besides,

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
it's still daylight.

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
Was I too impulsive?

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
Second Brother has been singing all day.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,240
I...

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,500
This isn't your fault.

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Given the situation,

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,890
if we want to stay at Xiaodong Tian,

72
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
this is our only option.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
But

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
20 silver dollars!

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,850
I'm here for you.

76
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,570
Second Brother is coming down.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,650
Second Brother,

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
thank you for your hard work.

79
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
You saw it with your own eyes.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,130
Alright, I understand.

81
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,050
Young Master He.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,930
Young Master He.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
Manager Feng,

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,920
why aren't you supervising at Suiyin Pavilion right now?

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,580
Why did you come here instead?

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Young Master He, please wait.

87
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,770
Young Master He.

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,580
You're not going to Mule Society again, are you?

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,120
What is it?

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,650
Manager Feng has something to say?

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,810
I wouldn't dare.

92
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
I...

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
It's just that

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,320
the master has strong opinions

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,930
about Mule Society lately.

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
I think

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,500
you should avoid going to Mule Society and interacting with them.

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Manager Feng,

99
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
are you warning me?

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
I wouldn't dare.

101
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,970
Young Master He.

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
As you know,

103
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,880
the master has assigned

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,540
the Mule Society matter to me.

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
I'm just worried

106
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,160
it might cause trouble for you.

107
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,120
I think

108
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,250
you're afraid I'll cause trouble for you.

109
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Mr. He.

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
You're being too modest.

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,680
I wouldn't dare.

112
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,400
No, no.

113
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Manager Feng.

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
In my opinion,

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,100
instead of worrying about me,

116
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
you should worry about yourself.

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
Mr. He is right.

118
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
Take care, Mr. He.

119
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,240
All right.

120
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
A man does not shed tears easily,

121
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,600
only because he hasn't reached

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,159
the point of heartbreak.

123
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Good.

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
Sir,

125
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,240
would you like to see a show?

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,960
No, thanks.

127
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,920
Sir,

128
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,780
come see a show.

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,240
The singing is excellent. Right this way.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,100
Please come in.

131
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Sir, would you like to see a show?

132
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
No, I won't go.

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Sir, please come see a show.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
No, I won't go.

135
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,720
Second Brother,

136
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,440
water.

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,690
Have another sip, Second Brother.

138
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
No need, Hetao.

139
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,330
I just need to rest my eyes for a moment.

140
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,490
Second Brother,

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
this can't go on.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You won't be able to take it anymore.

143
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,060
Why don't we...

144
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Why don't we go find Third Brother?

145
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
After all, you trained under the same master.

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
He should be willing to help.

147
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
But...

148
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,520
he's with Fuchun Hall now.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,920
Brother.

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
Wait.

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,730
Young Master He,

152
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,400
why are you fighting your own people?

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Our own people?

154
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,660
Young Master Ruan,

155
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,880
it really is you.

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
Long time no see.

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Since we paid respects to our master last time,

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
I haven't seen you at all.

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,880
What have you been up to lately?

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,600
Xiaowu,

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,520
let's get to the point.

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,760
Mule Society is in trouble.

163
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,520
Please see if

164
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Third Brother or anyone else can help.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
Come with me.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,890
Mule Society is in trouble?

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
But...

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,800
last time, Third Brother and you...

169
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,840
I can't worry about that now.

170
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,360
Second Brother will lose his life if he keeps singing.

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Xiaowu,

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm begging you.

173
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,540
Help me figure something out.

174
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,700
Third Senior Brother.

175
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
Ruan Suiqing,

176
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,770
what are you doing here?

177
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay.

178
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,170
Young Master He,

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
Foreman Feng has already explained everything.

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
Rest assured.

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,620
I can handle this well.

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I'll do it according to your wishes.

183
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,010
We still need five more pieces,

184
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,170
Senior Brother.

185
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,970
Senior Brother.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,300
Senior Brother, are you okay?

187
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,810
Young Master He,

188
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,490
that's exactly what I mean.

189
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,980
That's why I'm telling you

190
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
we're all on the same side.

191
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,040
Besides,

192
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,900
everything has been arranged with Feng's team.

193
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,640
You wouldn't make things difficult for a brother, would you?

194
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,440
Right?

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,040
Third Senior, hurry up!

196
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,760
Until you visit a garden,

197
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,800
how can you know how beautiful spring truly is?

198
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
This...

199
00:12:50,720 --> 00:13:01,680
How could I know spring would be so beautiful?

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,760
Alright.

201
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,640
Young Master He.

202
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,240
No.

203
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Listen to me, please.

204
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,680
I think you've forgotten

205
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,840
who your real master is.

206
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,210
Young Master He, please don't.

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,520
Alright.

208
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,160
Fine.

209
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
Remember what I told you.

210
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,440
Get out.

211
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Yes, yes.

212
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,040
Okay.

213
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
Come on.

214
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
Everyone fill your glasses.

215
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,600
This is my finest wine I've been saving for years.

216
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Fill it up.

217
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,160
Well,

218
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll drink first to show my respect.

219
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Wait, wait.

220
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,600
Brother.

221
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
We've come from so far away,

222
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,480
how can you drink first?

223
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,560
Well,

224
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,520
shouldn't you say a few words?

225
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,020
You've prepared all this food and drink.

226
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,360
You're the most senior member of Mule Society now.

227
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,160
But you just picked up your cup and drank without a word.

228
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,280
That's not right.

229
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,300
It's embarrassing for our Mule Society.

230
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,880
You need to say something,

231
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
right, brothers?

232
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,240
Yes, Second Brother.

233
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
Say something!

234
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,360
I'm not really good at speeches, you know.

235
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,400
Hurry up.

236
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,120
It's rare to have everyone here today.

237
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
Well,

238
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,800
say something.

239
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
Say a few words, come on.
