1
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,420
You've got quite a sharp nose.

2
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
So?

3
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,480
Do you remember

4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,210
that list you showed me before?

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,780
The problem is right here.

6
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I thought it was strange when I first saw it,

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,400
and now I realize there really is an issue.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,720
You mean...

9
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,520
Exactly.

10
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
The death of the Xie family maid and Old Wan's disappearance

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
must be connected,

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
and both are related to this flower.

13
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,370
You must have noticed this before, right?

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,360
I was puzzled when I saw it.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
If I remember correctly,

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,199
the old beggar never drank tea.

17
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Suiqing.

18
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,600
You've been in Haicheng for a long time.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,530
What do you think

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
this might be related to?

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,660
Although that maid came from the Xie family,

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,860
killing her would only draw more attention.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,760
Besides, Master Xie is a merchant

24
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,810
and has no connection with Old Wan.

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
So,

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,000
what has a direct connection to the Hongfeng Opera Troupe and Master Xie

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,120
is...

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,720
Buddha.

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,010
Chen Zhiyi is here to receive punishment.

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
If it weren't for me,

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
senior brother wouldn't have left,

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,170
Mule Society wouldn't have lost its reputation,

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,520
and Master wouldn't have...

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
Buddha.

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
As a girl,

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,640
I was adopted by Master when I was little

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,530
and grew up in the opera troupe.

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,720
I was mischievous

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
and caused a lot of trouble.

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Thanks to my senior brothers' care,

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,920
they never blamed me.

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,520
Later,

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
I met Ruan Suiqing.

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,720
He and my senior brother were like brothers,

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
and we grew up together.

46
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,280
Although Ruan Suiqing often teased me,

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
usually

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,200
he was the only one willing to do outrageous things for me.

49
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,600
But this time,

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,480
he couldn't save my eldest senior brother.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,840
I admit

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
I blamed him.

53
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,080
But

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
this is all my fault in the end.

55
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,420
If I hadn't stubbornly insisted on performing on stage...

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,640
That's right,

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,530
I am a harbinger of misfortune.

58
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
When I was little,

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,120
you made my brother leave me,

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
and you were right.

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
But Buddha,

62
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,040
I still have Master's last wish to fulfill,

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
and I must wait for my eldest senior brother to return.

64
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,040
Buddha has clear eyes

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,000
and can see what we cannot.

66
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,080
If you think Zhiyi is at fault,

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,200
then send a gust of wind

68
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
to extinguish this lamp before me.

69
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,080
I will then go find Master.

70
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,320
If you think

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
Zhiyi still has unfinished business,

72
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,760
then do nothing.

73
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,840
After I fulfill my promise,

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
I will come back to you.

75
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,080
A tree stands by the water before the mountain,

76
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,810
the mountain's reflection appears in the water.

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,410
Past noon at dusk, shadows cover the tree,

78
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,360
this shadow resembles a temple.

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,920
Dreamy Love

80
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,280
I thought

81
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,220
I had saved Lu Nanfeng.

82
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,640
You could then live peacefully.

83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,980
I never expected this.

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
Young Master He.

85
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,640
How do you know this poem?

86
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,680
I not only know this poem,

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,610
I also recognize your bell.

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,960
Originally,

89
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,720
I wanted to find the right moment

90
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,210
to tell you all this.

91
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,920
Chen Zhiyi.

92
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
If you truly want someone to rely on,

93
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,760
why would you

94
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,940
place your feelings in a candle lamp?

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Twenty years ago.

96
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,610
The brother you lost in that ruined temple

97
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,460
is now standing right in front of you.

98
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,520
Sister,

99
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
it's been a long time.

100
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Huaiqing.

101
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
You're still weak,

102
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,440
let me feed you.

103
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
It's alright.

104
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,640
I can do it myself.

105
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Sister,

106
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,320
you've caught a cold,

107
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
you must keep yourself warm.

108
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,640
Chen Zhiyi,

109
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm coming in.

110
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Mr. He,

111
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,440
what are you doing?

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,130
Good morning, Mr. Ruan.

113
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,640
About what happened yesterday,

114
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,880
that's basically it.

115
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,320
It's been

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
20 years now.

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,440
It seems Mr. Ruan

118
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,080
isn't very interested

119
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,410
in our sibling reunion.

120
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
How could that be?

121
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
You've reunited after so long.

122
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
As your friend,

123
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,900
I'm certainly happy for you both.

124
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
I just have a question

125
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,900
I'd like to ask you, Mr. He.

126
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,660
Please go ahead, Mr. Ruan.

127
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,040
Actually,

128
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
you already knew Zhiyi was your sister,

129
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,600
didn't you?

130
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
Perhaps this is fate.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,460
Do you remember, Mr. Ruan,

132
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,180
our brief encounter that day?

133
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,540
That time at the He residence,

134
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,520
you, Mr. Ruan,

135
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,600
also barged in just like this.

136
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,520
It was on that day

137
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,770
I recognized my sister's bell.

138
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
So that's how it was.

139
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,280
Then it seems

140
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,440
Mr. He really cares

141
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,720
about Zhiyi.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,240
Otherwise, given the relationship between the He family and Mule Society,

143
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
I wouldn't have expected

144
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,920
you would help us.

145
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
Suiqing.

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,920
Sister.

147
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,440
It's understandable

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,930
that Mr. Ruan would think this way.

149
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Moreover,

150
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
I believe Mr. Ruan

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,800
must be regretting that he couldn't fulfill

152
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,170
the three-day promise.

153
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
Mr. Ruan,

154
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
I can tell you responsibly

155
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,780
that you're right.

156
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,320
Simply because Chen Zhiyi is my sister,

157
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,920
I would do anything for her.

158
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
Now that I'm back,

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
I won't let her suffer any harm.

160
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,860
Sister, don't catch cold.

161
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Mr. Ruan,

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
I just want to tell you

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,440
that from now on, my sister's affairs

164
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
will be properly arranged by me.

165
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't mean anything else by it.

166
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
First of all,

167
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,040
since we're not related,

168
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,480
always troubling you

169
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,410
isn't very convenient.

170
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
Secondly,

171
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,520
if there's really an emergency,

172
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,800
you're so busy usually,

173
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,560
and if things get delayed, that's one thing,

174
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
but these matters

175
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,320
piling up in your mind

176
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,200
make me feel guilty.

177
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,250
Don't you agree?

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,520
Ruan Suiqing,

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
why have you come

180
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,120
so early to see me?

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Zhiyi.

182
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,560
I need to tell you something.

183
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Everyone's here.

184
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,960
Zhiyi

185
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,610
The lease expires at the end of this month.

186
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Sister,

187
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,540
why don't you move out?

188
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,920
I know some landlords in the city.

189
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
If you move there,

190
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
don't worry about the rent.

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
It'll be on me.

192
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,480
Everyone has friends.

193
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Don't show off.

194
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Zhiyi,

195
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,680
if you ask me,

196
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
you should stay here.

197
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
You've lived here for so long,

198
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,290
you must be attached to this place.

199
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,480
The landlord took some of my calligraphy pieces before,

200
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
and I didn't charge him.

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,240
I'll talk to him this time.

202
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,520
Young masters,

203
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,580
junior sister,

204
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,040
let me say something.

205
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,560
The current situation of Mule Society,

206
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,360
I think,

207
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
is clear to everyone.

208
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Money...

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Master did leave us some.

210
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,680
But the opera

211
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,650
no one performs it anymore.

212
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,640
Even if we're fortunate enough

213
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,200
to get help from both of you,

214
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
staying here any longer

215
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,570
is not a sustainable solution.

216
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
It's alright, Second Brother.

217
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,840
Let's solve the housing issue first,

218
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,570
and worry about the rest later.

219
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,890
Second Brother,

220
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
what do you think?

221
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,520
In the south of the city,

222
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,920
there's an old warehouse

223
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,480
where I lived before joining Mule Society.

224
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,480
It has rooms,

225
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,400
a courtyard,

226
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,640
we can make fire there,

227
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,040
and it's spacious enough for our opera props.

228
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,970
Second Brother,

229
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,920
there are many affordable places to live.

230
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,960
Why go to such a place?

231
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,920
Young Master He is right.

232
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Indeed,

233
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,290
we could live anywhere,

234
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,720
but what's important is

235
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Xiaodong Tian is not far from there.

236
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,960
Xiaodong Theater

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,160
A bustling marketplace like brocade,

238
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,000
Voices flowing like endless tides,

239
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,760
Spectators delighted like immortals,

240
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Infinite wonders, infinite views.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Xiaodong Theater

242
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,320
is actually a gathering place for street performers.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,120
The south of the city

244
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,160
is the road everyone must take before entering the city,

245
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,290
so there's always heavy foot traffic.

246
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
Many performers, before getting their entry permits,

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,560
have to wait there for a long time.

248
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,490
So they stop their carriages and unload their goods.

249
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,520
As time passes,

250
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,840
they think to themselves,

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,040
"Since we're just sitting around anyway,

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,500
we might as well perform."

253
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,720
Over time,

254
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,460
it became a major attraction for common people.

255
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
Actually, many masters of various arts

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
before becoming famous,

257
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
performed there.

258
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
That means

259
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,680
you must have spent time there before, Second Brother.

260
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
I won't hide it from you, Young Master Ruan,

261
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,080
in the past,

262
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,680
I did perform some rather crude pieces.

263
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,120
It was Master who saw potential in me

264
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
and allowed me to join the Mule Society.

265
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,940
Young Master Ruan,

266
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,040
are you suggesting that Mule Society

267
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,770
should perform on the streets?

268
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,680
I understand what you mean, Young Master He.

269
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,640
Return to where

270
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,720
we came from.

271
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,960
But

272
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,720
the fate of Mule Society is in our hands now.

273
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,480
Rather than waiting here to die,

274
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
we might as well find something to do

275
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
and then make further plans.

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,520
If you're worried about losing face,

277
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,880
we won't use our name.

278
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,560
Second Brother is right.

279
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
Being able to stay together

280
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
is more important than anything else.

281
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
If that's the case,

282
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,410
why not perform at Fuchun Hall?

283
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,180
After all, they're all Mule Society people too.

284
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,560
Brother,

285
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll go with you.

286
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,680
Really.

287
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Living in a warehouse?

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't mind.

289
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Going to Xiaodong Theater?

290
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll assist you.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,720
But the Mule Society name

292
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,940
must be displayed.

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
Everyone needs to know

294
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,580
that Mule Society hasn't fallen.

295
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
When First Brother returns,

296
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,720
he'll know

297
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
that the people of Mule Society

298
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,800
have been waiting for him all along.

299
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Alright.

300
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Since

301
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,920
we've made the decision,

302
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,960
let's set off as soon as possible.
