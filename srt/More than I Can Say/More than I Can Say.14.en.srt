1
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Officer Lin, you're too kind.

2
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,080
Although the He family has achieved some success in business,

3
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,360
we originally made our fortune through the Fuchun Opera House.

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,640
So naturally, we care about the development of the opera industry.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,370
Haicheng is a major opera city.

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,039
The people love it,

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,800
there are many opera troupes,

8
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,729
but they lack unified management.

9
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,250
My father's proposal to establish an Opera Guild

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,039
is simply following the trend of the times,

11
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,770
and will naturally receive everyone's support.

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
Let me ask you something.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,480
I heard that you have quite a connection

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,440
with Commander Zhang from the military.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,840
You must look after me in the future.

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,680
Just kidding.

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,720
So you must be the He family's adopted son.

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,079
Old Master He has shown me some respect after all.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
However,

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,930
you two indeed don't look alike at all.

21
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Since childhood,

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,980
I was adopted by the He family.

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm fortunate that Master He

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,840
has shown me great care

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,650
and treated me like his own son.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
That's why I dare to call him father.

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,640
I haven't had time to introduce myself.

28
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,320
He Mingxu.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Interesting.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,920
Come, sit down.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Officer Lin,

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,970
my father went to great lengths

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,180
to arrange this meeting with you.

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Is that so?

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Young Master He.

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
No rush.

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,920
I brought my own tea leaves.

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
Here, try mine.

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,960
I don't usually wear this uniform,

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,360
so I forgot where I put it.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Here it is.

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,060
Officer Lin is quite particular,

43
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,280
bringing your own tea.

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,079
Try it

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,780
and see if it suits your taste.

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
I heard

47
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,640
you've been in Haicheng for some time now.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,450
Are you here on official business?

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,540
Don't even mention it.

50
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
I've been in Haicheng

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
for quite a while now.

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
Initially,

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,920
I was just investigating a simple missing person case.

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
You know,

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,720
the director of the Hongfeng Opera Troupe disappeared.

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,050
Have you heard about it?

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,279
But then,

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,760
a maid from the Xie family died.

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,120
That case landed on my desk too.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
I really am...

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
Please don't mind me.

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I just feel comfortable with you

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,320
to vent a little.

64
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,560
What is this?

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Narcissus

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
tea.

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
You know what?

68
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,280
A young flower seller

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,080
told me

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,440
these can be made into tea.

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
When I heard that,

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
I thought it was quite novel.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,640
So when I came to visit today,

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,920
I brought some for you.

75
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Mr. He,

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,900
let me tell you something.

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Sometimes,

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,850
those who drink tea may not understand it,

79
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
and neither might those who make it.

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
So this tea,

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
did you make it yourself, Officer Lin?

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
No, no, no.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Mr. He, you may not be aware,

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,920
narcissus flowers are toxic.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,080
Making them into tea reduces the toxicity somewhat,

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,159
but it's still not suitable for regular consumption.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Finally made it on time.

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,730
Second Brother,

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
it's up to you now.

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,040
Here you go, sir.

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,880
You scared me!

93
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
You're sneaking around

94
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,200
and got yourself all dirty.

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,640
What's wrong?

96
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,920
Are you already planning to mess up before we even start?

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,380
Let me tell you something.

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,680
You volunteered for this job yourself.

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Second Brother is nothing like you.

100
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,960
Tell me,

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,040
where did you go with Second Brother this morning?

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,159
What could we possibly be doing?

103
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,090
Obviously something legitimate.

104
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,620
Who knows what trouble you two were causing.

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
There's porridge on the table.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
While it's still warm,

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
hurry up and drink it.

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,930
What a display of endurance and patience.

109
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
What?

110
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,260
There were so many people.

111
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,960
What do you mean?

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
My second senior and I

113
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
went to the main street of Xiaodong Tian today.

114
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,010
So you really went to do their bidding?

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,080
No.

116
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
Spectators.

117
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,060
We went as spectators.

118
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,440
After seeing how domineering they were yesterday,

119
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
I wanted to see

120
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,250
what they're actually capable of.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
And then?

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,100
You guessed right.

123
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,290
They're just a bunch of petty thieves.

124
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
So what do they do?

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
Are they street performers too?

126
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,760
So

127
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,740
they're afraid we'll steal their business?

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,120
Yes,

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,770
but not exactly.

130
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,290
What does that mean?

131
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,039
Look at all this mud on me.

132
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,799
Did you get into another fight?

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
No.

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,559
What I mean is there were so many people there.

135
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,960
I finally experienced

136
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
what it means to pay money

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,320
and still not be guaranteed entry.

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
You paid again?

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
My point is

140
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,160
the crowd.

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,360
If my second senior hadn't cleared the way ahead,

142
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200
I wouldn't have been able to see what was happening at all,

143
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,930
not to mention how disheveled I was when leaving.

144
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
The tips

145
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
were scattered everywhere,

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
and nobody even bothered to pick them up.

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
The money I gave yesterday,

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,920
they didn't care about it at all.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Young Master Ruan finally knows the value of money.

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,800
I was paying for the experience.

151
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Now I know what Wuxian Dongtian means,

152
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Wuxian Guan.

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,760
So does Young Master Ruan feel the money spent yesterday was wasted?

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Yes.

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Mule Society's affairs are my affairs.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,560
I, Ruan Suiqing,

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
will do my duty without hesitation.

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Where are you going in the middle of our conversation?

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm going to prepare something for Second Senior.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,040
Young Master Ruan, please drink your porridge quickly.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,570
It's not good for your stomach when it's cold.

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,020
It's not good for the stomach when it's cold.

163
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
So what about that case involving the prince

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,760
from the neighboring province you investigated?

165
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,360
Isn't it obvious?

166
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,820
What can a small-time cop like you do anyway?

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,240
Officer Lin,

168
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,440
you truly are a man of integrity.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,160
Haicheng is fortunate

170
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,720
to have someone like you transferred here.

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,860
What do you mean 'fortunate'?

172
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,380
We both know the truth.

173
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,200
It sounds nice to call it a transfer,

174
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,160
but to be blunt,

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,560
they just wanted to get rid of you.

176
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,620
They didn't want you around anymore.

177
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
So in the end,

178
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,800
did they catch the culprit?

179
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,260
Long gone without a trace.

180
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,140
Let me tell you something.

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
The worst thing for a case

182
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,240
isn't losing the leads,

183
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
it's losing the people who follow those leads.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
That's true.

185
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,480
But Haicheng has always had good public security.

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,920
If you're hoping to solve big cases here, Officer Lin,

187
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
Peace and order are certainly good things.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,060
But let me tell you,

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,320
though Haicheng is small,

191
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,380
there are quite a few interesting things going on here.

192
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,600
What do you mean?

193
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,880
Classified.

194
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,680
Confidential.

195
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,840
Officer Lin, feel free to drop by anytime.

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,360
I quite enjoy hearing about these matters.

197
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
Mr. He,

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
it's better not to expect me to visit often.

199
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,840
Not at all.

200
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,120
Well,

201
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,740
I should get going now.

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Officer Lin,

203
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,560
why don't you

204
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
stay for lunch before leaving?

205
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,530
I've already asked them to prepare it.

206
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Mr. He,

207
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
now you're being too formal.

208
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
I have other matters to handle at the bureau.

209
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,400
There will be

210
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
plenty of opportunities in the future.

211
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,840
All right.

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
I won't keep you any longer then.

213
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
Your tea.

214
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
Keep this.

215
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,240
I brought it especially for you.

216
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,280
When your father returns,

217
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,410
let him try some too.

218
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
I actually

219
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
don't drink tea much myself.

220
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,960
Someone,

221
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,080
escort Officer Lin out.

222
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,140
Make sure Officer Lin takes the prepared gifts.

223
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,450
Young Master He,

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,450
what is all this?

225
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,810
There's so much!

226
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,140
Officer Lin, please don't be modest.

227
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
You've just arrived in Haicheng,

228
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
someone should welcome you properly.

229
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,040
Just a small token of appreciation.

230
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,770
Please accept it, Officer Lin.

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,340
If Officer Lin needs anything in the future,

232
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,320
the He family

233
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,040
will do our humble best

234
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,160
to support you.

235
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Of course,

236
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,200
we're all working

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
for the safety of Haicheng.

238
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,610
Alright,

239
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,080
I'll accept then.

240
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Sir,

241
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,300
please have mercy.

242
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

243
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,260
Thank you, master.

244
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Young master!

245
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,840
Something terrible has happened!

246
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
Please go check the gate immediately.

247
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,960
There's a group of beggars blocking our entrance.

248
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,800
They say the He Mansion is benefiting Haicheng.

249
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,600
By distributing silver coins.

250
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,640
They refuse to leave without payment.

251
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,440
They're even holding boxes with our family crest.

252
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,200
Alright.

253
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,490
Second Brother.

254
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,210
Have some water.

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,340
Good job, Second Brother.

256
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you all, gentlemen.

257
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Coming!

258
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,860
Senior Sister,

259
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
Brother Suiqing,

260
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,600
look at

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,360
all this!

262
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,980
My Second Brother is really amazing.

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,700
Haicheng audiences know good opera.

264
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
Before, when Big Brother was here,

265
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,410
the audience loved raw performances.

266
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,720
These days, I can tell

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,680
what the audience really likes.

268
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,930
We need to add more martial arts moves.

269
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Great idea, Second Brother!

270
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm good at martial arts.

271
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I can help you.

272
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,690
Second Brother,

273
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
you're carrying this whole stage by yourself now,

274
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
performing all day long.

275
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
If you add more martial arts,

276
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,960
it's not sustainable in the long run.

277
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,240
It's alright, Young Master Ruan.

278
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,100
I can handle it.

279
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,330
Second Brother,

280
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
Suiqing is right.

281
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,400
Why don't we take a day off tomorrow?

282
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,220
Junior Sister,

283
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,740
Young Master Ruan,

284
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,900
I know you're concerned about me,

285
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,920
but at a place like Xiaodong Theater,

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,250
we can't afford to rest.

287
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,000
If we leave the audience hanging for a day,

288
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,660
they might think we're not good enough anymore.

289
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,320
Our success here

290
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
depends on word of mouth.

291
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
At the very least,

292
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,520
I can rest more between performances.

293
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,850
That's better than not performing at all.

294
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,720
Why

295
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,570
are you finishing so early?

296
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,040
Good timing.

297
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,920
We'll pack up and leave today.

298
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,780
Let's go check.

299
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
Gentlemen.

300
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,410
Yesterday we were strangers here.

301
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,760
Sorry for bothering you all.

302
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,600
But what's this about today?

303
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,000
It's them.

304
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,440
Why?

305
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,170
I should be the one asking you that.

306
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,450
The amount isn't right.

307
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Pay up.

308
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
You looking down on me?

309
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,320
Not at all.

310
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
Please don't say that.

311
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,040
That's not what we meant.

312
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Didn't you say before

313
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,220
that we could perform here after paying you?

314
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
You took our money,

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,680
doesn't that mean you agreed?

316
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Who agreed?

317
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,560
You useless

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,280
worthless fools!

319
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,160
Are you blind?

320
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
This is the young master from Haicheng Daily,

321
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,970
you dare take money from Ruan Suiqing?

322
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
Master Ruan.

323
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
My men don't know any better.

324
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Please forgive our offense.

325
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,680
So you know who I am.

326
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,240
It's fine.

327
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,400
Conflicts lead to friendship.

328
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,200
In the future,

329
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,480
cause less trouble

330
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,849
and don't come back.

331
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,319
I'm sorry, Master Ruan.

332
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,220
But this performance,

333
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,760
you still can't put it on.

334
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,210
What do you mean?

335
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,040
Since you're here,

336
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,240
this place

337
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,040
must be Mule Society, right?

338
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,520
Yes,

339
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
this is Mule Society.

340
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
So what?

341
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,320
Since this is Mule Society,

342
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,880
a while ago,

343
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,640
the incident with Boss Lu

344
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,960
caused quite a stir

345
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
everyone knows about it.

346
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
Our establishment is too small.

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
You're a big shot.

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,480
We can't accommodate you.

349
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Pack up.

350
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,490
Get out of here by tomorrow.

351
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,320
Let's go.

352
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,040
Wait.

353
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,320
Since you know Master Ruan,

354
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,840
you must know what really happened.

355
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Boss Lu was completely wronged.

356
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,760
Junior.

357
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,240
In this theater company,

358
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,160
how did a young woman appear?

359
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,480
I had heard before

360
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,210
that Mule Society has women performing on stage.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,120
Looks like it's true.

362
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,040
Mule Society has really fallen.

363
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Not only is their performance poor,

364
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,540
but after their star performer fell,

365
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
they have to rely on a little woman.

366
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Watch your mouth.
