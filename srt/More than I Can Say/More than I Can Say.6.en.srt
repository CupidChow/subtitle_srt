1
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
This unworthy person

2
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,760
has disrupted Master Xie's birthday banquet.

3
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,880
How should I make amends?

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,289
I have nothing to say in my defense.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,680
However,

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,289
regarding the matter with your daughter,

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,800
this issue

8
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,370
is of great importance.

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
There might be some misunderstanding.

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,039
I humbly request Master Xie

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,300
to give us a chance to clarify the situation,

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
so the two young people can prove their innocence.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
Innocence.

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,320
In broad daylight,

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,440
an actor

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,100
was lying half-naked in my daughter's chamber.

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
If this gets out,

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Mr. Lu,

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
tell me,

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,920
how can anyone remain innocent?

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,720
Nanfeng has

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
grown up by my side since childhood.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
I can vouch

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,040
for his character.

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,079
Miss Xie's reputation

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,970
cannot be compromised.

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
But I've heard

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,730
that these two young people

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,900
are actually in love with each other.

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,640
Old Master,

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
I respect you because you performed

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,300
for the Emperor and Empress Dowager,

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
which is why I'm showing you some courtesy.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
I didn't call you here today

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,680
to listen to your explanations.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
If even a word about Yan'er's situation

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
gets out,

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,600
your Mule Theater Company

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
will be shut down.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
As for Lu Nanfeng,

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,440
attempted misconduct.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Please, officer,

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,300
just take him away.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,079
No, you can't!

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,530
Master, please save my senior!

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Senior, say something!

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,460
Isn't there some misunderstanding?

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,040
Senior!

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
How could there be any misunderstanding?

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,480
I saw him enter the young lady's chamber with my own eyes.

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
He must have seduced the young lady.

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
Mr. Xie,

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
this matter

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,840
can still be negotiated.

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
There's nothing to discuss.

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,840
Guards!

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
Show them out.

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
No way.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,120
I wondered what the big deal was.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
So it's about Miss Xie

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,720
being defiled by an actor.

62
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,680
Ruan Suiqing!

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Mind your words.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
Your father runs

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
the most prestigious newspaper in Haicheng.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,120
He's known for his fairness.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Don't let the words of a wastrel like you

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,290
ruin both our families' reputations.

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,560
I certainly wouldn't slander Miss Xie.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,840
Our newspaper doesn't publish falsehoods.

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,300
It's just that if this news

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,360
reaches the tabloid reporters,

73
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,620
they might write something even worse than what I've said.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
Even if you kill Nanfeng then,

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,800
it won't restore Miss Xie's reputation.

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,240
You!

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,520
You spoiled brat!

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Everyone knows

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,930
you've always been good friends with Lu Nanfeng.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,280
A newspaper owner's son

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
who spends all his time at theaters,

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,600
throwing money around to support actors,

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,730
and now you dare threaten me like this.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,440
I swear

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,200
I'll have you, you lawless scoundrel,

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
sent to the authorities too.

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,240
You're the lawless one.

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
Based solely on your word,

89
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,900
you've already concluded this case.

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,360
That's a complete disregard for human life.

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
How dare you!

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,380
I witnessed this with my own eyes.

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
Lu Nanfeng offered no defense.

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,650
My household maid can testify.

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,060
How am I disregarding human life?

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,840
Everyone present during the incident was from your Xie household.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,500
You can say whatever you want.

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,560
Furthermore,

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
why doesn't Nanfeng say anything?

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
It's to protect

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
that precious daughter of yours

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,700
and your Xie family's lofty reputation.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,600
You condemn him without any due process.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
It's complete nonsense.

105
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,000
You!

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
But Uncle Xie,

107
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,120
I was just joking with you,

108
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,880
please don't take it personally.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Anyway,

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,520
I do have a solution

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,570
to restore Miss Xie's reputation.

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,159
As you mentioned earlier,

113
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,159
my family's newspaper

114
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,480
is the most influential in all of Haicheng.

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,080
If I ask my father to write an article

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,920
clearing Miss Xie's name,

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,850
then this matter

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,420
would be easily resolved.

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
Easy for you to say.

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm afraid

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,800
your father doesn't even want to see you.

122
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
I know you don't believe me,

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
but right now

124
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,180
you have no choice but to trust me.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Two options:

126
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,000
Either Nanfeng stays here

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,130
and I return with the newspaper that solves the problem.

128
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Or you take Nanfeng away,

129
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
and tomorrow all of Haicheng

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,640
will be talking about your family's scandal.

131
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,370
You're absolutely shameless.

132
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,280
How do I know this isn't just a delaying tactic?

133
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Three days.

134
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,700
I only need three days.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
In three days,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,080
I'll return with the newspaper that solves the problem,

137
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,520
and you'll withdraw the case at the police station.

138
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,650
If I don't come back,

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,760
you can do whatever you want.

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,200
How about it?

141
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Mr. Xie,

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,320
this deal

143
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,020
is a win-win, isn't it?

144
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,640
Mr. Xie,

145
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
don't waste time talking to him.

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,560
We've seen plenty of people like him.

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
We police officers don't just sit around doing nothing.

148
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
The facts are clear.

149
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Officer Li, please wait.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Uncle Xie,

151
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,040
I hope you don't mind me

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,800
speaking as an outsider.

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,409
I actually think what Mr. Ruan said

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,850
makes a lot of sense.

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,520
If Mr. Ruan fails to fulfill his promise,

156
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,450
you can still deal with Lu Nanfeng.

157
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,040
If he succeeds,

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
it would benefit the Xie family

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
and Miss Xie,

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
which would be good for everyone.

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,090
Either way, you won't lose.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Officer Li,

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,840
I believe

164
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,180
you certainly uphold the law fairly.

165
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,200
But even under the law, there's room for compassion.

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,460
After all, this matter

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,680
concerns the reputation of the Xie family.

168
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,010
If anything goes wrong,

169
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm afraid Miss Xie's reputation

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,250
will still be compromised.

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
If you're concerned,

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,410
you can take Lu Nanfeng away first,

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,260
but don't convict him.

174
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
In three days,

175
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,360
we'll see the outcome at the police station.

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,490
Is that acceptable?

177
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,080
All right.

178
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Today,

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,120
for the sake of the He family,

180
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll trust you this once.

181
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,480
Three days.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,039
You only have three days.

183
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
If you don't come,

184
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,840
no one can save Lu Nanfeng's life.

185
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,560
Show them out.

186
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,040
Get up.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,970
Senior Brother.

188
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,240
I told you she was trouble.

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,640
But you wouldn't listen.

190
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,280
You insisted on taking her in.

191
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,480
Spoiling her.

192
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Letting her perform on stage.

193
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,760
Letting her sing in the opera.

194
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,840
And now letting her get Nanfeng killed.

195
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,440
What's next?

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Master Feng.

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,000
Mind your words.

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Don't jump to conclusions before we know the facts.

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
Besides.

200
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,960
What kind of person she is

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,560
is not for you to judge.

202
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,680
Fine.

203
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,560
I don't have time to discuss her.

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,720
Tell me.

205
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
What should we do now?

206
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
Are we going to save Lu Nanfeng or not?

207
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,780
What will happen to Mule Society?

208
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Master.

209
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,680
Master.

210
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,850
Someone from the He family is here.

211
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,960
Zhiyi,

212
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
don't listen to their nonsense.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,330
Nanfeng must have been framed by someone.

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Today I used the newspaper issue

215
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
to threaten Mr. Xie,

216
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,840
and also to warn them

217
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,040
not to act rashly.

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,770
Don't overthink it.

219
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,300
I'll definitely come back with the newspaper to save Nanfeng.

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
You're always trying to score points.

221
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
Master is still angry.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,320
She hasn't spoken to her all day.

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
Why are you going over there now?

224
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,810
Looking to get scolded?

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Senior Sister has been kneeling all morning.

226
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
If she keeps kneeling,

227
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,370
her legs will be ruined.

228
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,980
That's why I say you're silly.

229
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
Master is truly angry this time.

230
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
Doing this

231
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,240
will also teach her a lesson.

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
Besides,

233
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,840
if you let Junior Sister play the victim a bit,

234
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
once Master's heart softens,

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
she might forgive her.

236
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,480
I really don't understand you anymore.

237
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,440
Now

238
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,240
the situation is clear.

239
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,920
Either Nanfeng admits his wrongdoing,

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
the Xie family stops pursuing Mule Society,

241
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,660
and we still have a chance to make a comeback.

242
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,040
Or

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,100
I go humble myself to the He family

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
and ask them to mediate for us.

245
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
But look at you,

246
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,440
you refuse both options

247
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,360
and insist on choosing a dead end.

248
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Master.

249
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
Mr. Lu.

250
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
I know what you're thinking.

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,420
Even though Nanfeng's

252
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
innocence is important,

253
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
he's already in his twilight years.

254
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,120
Between Nanfeng and Mule Society,

255
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,740
you need to be clear about what matters more.

256
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Let me be frank.

257
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,720
If you can't let go of Lu Nanfeng,

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,440
you can't save Mule Society.

259
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,530
When the birds are gone,

260
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
the bow is put away.

261
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,300
When the cunning hare is dead,

262
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,020
the hunting dog is cooked.

263
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,680
Brother Feng, are you teaching me

264
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
how to cut losses to save myself?

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Nanfeng

266
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,320
is not Mule Society's cash cow.

267
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,400
I nurtured him from a seedling

268
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
into a thousand-year timber.

269
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,880
Decades of care

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
cannot at this moment

271
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
bend his backbone.

272
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,960
Fine.

273
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm heartless.

274
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
But you must consider

275
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,440
those dozen or so mouths waiting to be fed.

276
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
You weren't willing before

277
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,960
to join the theater guild, that's fine.

278
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
Now Mule Society is in trouble,

279
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
and the He family is willing to help us.

280
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
If you go humble yourself and apologize,

281
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,010
perhaps we could...

282
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,840
All these years,

283
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
I understand

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,080
your contributions to Mule Society.

285
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,880
That's why most decisions you've made,

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,320
I've followed.

287
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,560
The rules you've set,

288
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,040
I've never questioned.

289
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,460
But what kind of place is Fuchun Hall?

290
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
He Zhen's character,

291
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
I know best.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Enough.

293
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,240
For performers,

294
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,560
there's always a beginning and an end.

295
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
Some things

296
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,480
are destined.

297
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,520
As the troupe master,

298
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,120
I will be responsible for Mule Society

299
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,040
and every decision

300
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,920
I make.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Fine.

302
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Fine.

303
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
Master Lu.

304
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,160
If you can kneel until this stone slab wears through,

305
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,290
perhaps a miracle might still happen.

306
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,140
Now you realize your mistake.

307
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,360
It's too late.

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,760
Harbinger of doom.

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
Senior.

310
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,840
Come.

311
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,920
Senior,

312
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,330
where are you going?

313
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
Let her in.

314
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,640
So

315
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
you're that little girl who wanted to perform on stage.

316
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
It's you.

317
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
I didn't expect

318
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,680
that Mule Society was hiding

319
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,400
such a brave young lady.

320
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,920
I

321
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,160
just want to ask you, Mr. He,

322
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
to put in a good word for my senior apprentice brother

323
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,840
and see if he can be released first.

324
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,600
After all, Ruan Suiqing has already promised

325
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,160
he'll bring back the newspaper in three days.

326
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Waiting at home is better than being in prison.

327
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,440
I also came from a theater troupe.

328
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,480
I know very well how actors

329
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,460
are viewed in society.

330
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Your senior apprentice brother

331
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,880
won't be easy to save.

332
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
But I've seen the Xie family

333
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,650
and how those police officers treat young Master He.

334
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,200
You're the head of the He family,

335
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,880
the owner of Fuchun Hall,

336
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,060
and the manager of the Theater Guild.

337
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,600
If you step forward,

338
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,120
there must be a way.

339
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
Such a silver tongue.

340
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,040
Well then,

341
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,119
considering you're from the theater community,

342
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,400
young lady,

343
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,170
I'll point you in the right direction.

344
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,680
Are you

345
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
willing to help now?

346
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't you know that Ruan boy?

347
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
You can ask his father

348
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,599
to publish an article

349
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,839
on the front page of Haicheng Daily.

350
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,170
Just say that Lu Nanfeng

351
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
is of poor character

352
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,040
and attempted

353
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,290
to harass a respectable woman.

354
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,620
Then it would have nothing to do with your Mule Society.

355
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,970
As long as you distance yourself from him,

356
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,520
sacrifice Lu Nanfeng,

357
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
and you can

358
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
save your Mule Society.

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,200
No,

360
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,320
that's impossible.

361
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't abandon my senior apprentice brother.

362
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,260
M-Master wouldn't agree to that either.

363
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,920
What is Lu Shun to you?

364
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
He is my master.

365
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,560
I lost both my parents when I was young.

366
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
Master raised me

367
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,880
as his own child.

368
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,160
Why didn't you say so earlier!

369
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
So you're

370
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
my grand-niece who's come to visit.

371
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,480
Well,

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,960
originally,

373
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,960
your master refused to sign

374
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,640
to acknowledge

375
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,060
the Theater Guild I established.

376
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,930
So when the Mule Society got into trouble,

377
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,320
it wasn't convenient for me to intervene, you see.

378
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,920
But since

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,920
you've come to me for help,

380
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,040
