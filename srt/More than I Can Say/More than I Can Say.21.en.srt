1
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,200
How's your case going?

2
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't even ask.

3
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm completely free of official duties now.

4
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,960
I've been suspended.

5
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,600
Right after I lost track of He Mingxu

6
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
shortly after Fengshen was killed.

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,680
So,

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm becoming more and more suspicious

9
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,400
that this refined young master of the He family

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
has some serious issues.

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,920
He Mingxu.

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,900
So I've been thinking,

13
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
I must perform in opera,

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,970
perform what I want to perform,

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,039
become who I truly want to be.

16
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
Only when I'm on stage

17
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,840
am I truly myself.

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I

19
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,640
am really scared.

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Forget it.

21
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,560
It's not a big deal if I don't perform.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,090
I can still live without it.

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,579
But you need to think clearly.

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,600
Is that really what you want?

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,640
Deep down, senior brother

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,880
I really want to see you on stage.

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,040
Maybe then

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll have to respectfully

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
call you Boss Chen.

30
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,880
Young lady,

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,490
these fallen leaves

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,560
don't necessarily need to return to their roots.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
As long as they're buried in soil

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,440
and nourish new life,

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
they will be reborn.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,120
Come back!

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
Where are you going?

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,340
You all drove senior sister away.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
She finally came back.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,980
I need to go talk to her.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Come back!

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,640
She just returned.

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,100
You can't upset her again.

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,480
I'm stewing chicken right now.

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,800
Let's bring her a bowl first before talking.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,840
No, I can't wait.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm going to apologize to junior sister now.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,640
Come back!

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,690
Senior brother.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,360
Zhiyi, senior sister.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Your third senior brother bought you a chicken.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
He said it's to satisfy your cravings.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,680
So,

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,210
we'll have meat to eat soon.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,760
Junior sister, let me tell you.

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
Senior brother, I think... just say it.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes, second senior brother is right.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Senior brothers,

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,400
I want to tell you something.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,680
Go ahead.

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,200
The other day,

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,240
I ran off without telling you and didn't come back.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
I made you worry.

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
It's okay.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,330
It's good that you're back.

67
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Don't worry,

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,800
I won't be so impulsive anymore.

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
These past few days,

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
I met a friend.

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,399
She's also an opera performer.

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,920
She took me to their small theater.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,920
I found it very interesting.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
Watching her perform

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,520
is like

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,440
seeing myself on stage.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Really?

78
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Zhiyi,

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,250
don't overthink it.

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
We were wrong that day.

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,360
We won't force you to be the lead anymore.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,159
Yes,

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,440
we were wrong.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,040
We should be supporting the Mule Opera Troupe.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Don't worry, little sister.

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
If you want to perform, then perform.

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
If you don't,

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,260
I'll take care of you for life.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
About performing or not,

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,440
I haven't decided yet.

91
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
But

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,940
I've been thinking carefully

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,480
about what you all said to Ruan Suiqing.

94
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
I understand everything.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
You're looking out for me

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,560
and for the troupe.

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
So...

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
If

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
you're still willing to trust me,

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
I'd like

101
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
to try again.

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,500
That's wonderful!

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,360
When Master Ruan hears about this,

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
he'll be delighted too.

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,480
Has Ruan Suiqing been here recently?

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,440
I did see Master Ruan once.

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,080
A few days ago,

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,800
he came to tell us

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
that the Young Marshal will be coming to town.

110
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
The streets won't be safe,

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,610
so we should be careful.

112
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
Then he left.

113
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
Well,

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,159
did he say anything else?

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,360
Zhiyi,

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Master Ruan might be tied up with something.

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Perhaps

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
he'll be here in a few days,

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
right?

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,520
Yes, yes.

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,240
The chicken is almost ready.

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
Come on, let's eat. Hurry.

123
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,760
Let's go, sister.

124
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,520
I won't eat now.

125
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,159
I have something to do.

126
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,620
I need to go out for a while.

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Why is she leaving again?

128
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,560
Okay.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,480
If I remember correctly,

130
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,820
the Young Marshal also enjoys opera.

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,960
I've already looked into it.

132
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
The Young Marshal particularly loves Beijing Opera.

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
Here's what I'm thinking.

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
After the Young Marshal arrives and settles in,

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll take the lead

136
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
to organize a small competition

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
to welcome him.

138
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
That's thoughtful of you,

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,320
Mr. He.

140
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,840
It's the least I can do.

141
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,409
About that matter I asked you to handle recently,

142
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,300
how's it going?

143
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
It's all arranged,

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,760
but we need to wait two more days.

145
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
We don't have much time left.

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
You need to hurry it up.

147
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,159
I know, I know.

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Is this the place you mentioned?

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
That's right.

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,020
This is where I lost track of He Mingxu last time.

151
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
I feel there's something mysterious about this temple,

152
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
but I couldn't figure out what it is.

153
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
Are you sure

154
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,720
that Fengsun's death and the old beggar incident

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
are both connected to the He family?

156
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,700
Young Master Ruan,

157
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,860
where do you usually get your inspiration for writing?

158
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,300
Inspiration is something

159
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,570
unpredictable.

160
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,840
Sometimes it just comes suddenly

161
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,040
and can't be stopped.

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
So, great writer,

163
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,680
please respect a professional police officer's instincts.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm always accurate.

165
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,240
Yes,

166
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,610
so accurate that you found nothing last time.

167
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,260
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,800
Weren't you the one insisting I bring you here?

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,840
If you don't want to investigate, then leave.

170
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
I was just thinking

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
I could learn how to investigate cases from you, Officer,

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
right?

173
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,040
We do have some clues.

174
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,400
Look.

175
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,560
What's this?

176
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,520
Moss.

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
This stuff

178
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,360
is quite rare in the north.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
So?

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,880
It's unusual.

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
When we investigate cases,

182
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,320
we always pay attention to

183
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,250
abnormal things in everyday life.

184
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,760
If this old temple is connected to our case,

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,559
there must be clues left behind.

186
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
So according to what you're saying,

187
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,260
this stone is also quite unusual.

188
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,970
I didn't notice it last time I was here.

189
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,400
Often the things we can't see on the surface

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,040
might be hidden inside.

191
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,040
I suspect

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,600
there's a secret door in this temple.

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,800
But I've been here twice and couldn't find any mechanism.

194
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,080
What are you doing?

195
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,370
Paying my respects.

196
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,800
When you come to someone's territory, you should light incense and pay respects.

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,440
How else would you ask for help?

198
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,970
Perhaps after you worship,

199
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
the secret door

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
will reveal itself.

201
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Joke.

202
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
Secret door.

203
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
A secret door!

204
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Secret door.

205
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Why is there only a candlestick but no candle?

206
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,640
That's so stingy.

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Wait.

208
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,440
What did you just say?

209
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,970
I said this candlestick

210
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
doesn't even come with a candle.

211
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
How strange.

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,520
There were candles last time.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,160
Why isn't there any wax left?

214
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
It's stuck.

215
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,880
Why can't I get it off?

216
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,620
Be careful!

217
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
Dalin!

218
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,680
Who are you?

219
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
Dalin!

220
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,120
Run!

221
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Suiqing!

222
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,820
Get out of here!

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Dalin,

224
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
are you okay?

225
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm used to getting hurt.

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,120
It's nothing.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,930
If it weren't for

228
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,440
this guy being so vicious

229
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
and attacking from behind,

230
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
would I have been bitten by this dog?

231
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
Indeed.

232
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,640
Every strike was lethal.

233
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,450
Seems like they came prepared.

234
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
But it also indirectly proves

235
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,930
that our investigation is on the right track.

236
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Yes,

237
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
looks like I was right.

238
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,160
This temple

239
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,320
must have secrets.

240
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
If only I hadn't been suspended and had my gun.

241
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,640
I...

242
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Being incompetent has nothing to do with having a gun.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,160
How can you say that?

244
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,440
You insisted on coming along.

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,770
Without you, I'd have less to worry about.

246
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,280
Is your wound okay?

247
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm actually fine.

248
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,880
I must have burned incense and prayed to Buddha.

249
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,410
Buddha is watching over me.

250
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
By the way.

251
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
I have plans tonight.

252
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,760
Let me take you home first.

253
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,890
Don't die on the way.

254
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,860
Wish me better luck than that.

255
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,600
It's nothing. Just a minor injury.

256
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,320
Let's go.

257
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Take it slow.

258
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Stop right there.

259
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Come here.

260
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,530
What do you want from me?

261
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Sit down.

262
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,400
Take a seat.

263
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,130
Having a meal with your father.

264
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,300
Is that too much to ask?

265
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Take it easy.

266
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,880
I've taught you to be well-mannered since you were little.

267
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,600
Look at yourself now.

268
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,520
I was wrong that day.

269
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,360
I shouldn't have hit you.

270
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
I had hoped

271
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,530
to raise you to be someone with dreams and ambitions.

272
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,490
But after your mother passed away,

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,360
I suddenly realized

274
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,970
none of that matters to me anymore.

275
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,010
In times like these,

276
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm just glad if you can live well.

277
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
That day...

278
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,380
I have plans with someone.

279
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
If you want to apologize,

280
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,240
we can talk when I get back tonight.

281
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
It's Miss Chen, isn't it?

282
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,520
I put a check in your coat pocket.

283
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
When you're on a date with a girl,

284
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,040
don't be stingy.

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't need your advice on this.

286
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,800
You take after me.

287
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
Take her away.

288
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,960
Miss,

289
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
the show is over.

290
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,970
Aren't you leaving?

291
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,040
Mingxu, why are you here?

292
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
Sister,

293
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,020
it's getting cold.

294
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
Let's go home.

295
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
Senior, senior!

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Senior, something terrible happened!

297
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,400
Come quickly!

298
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,079
Bastard!

299
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,560
They're nothing but a bunch of robbers!

300
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,280
The He family is hosting some exchange competition

301
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
What right do they have to use our 'Old Dreams' as a prize?

302
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,480
And nobody even asked if we agreed to this!

303
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,569
This whole thing

304
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,160
was planned by He Zhen all along.

305
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,160
Under the pretext of welcoming the Young Marshal to town,

306
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,359
he organized this competition

307
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,690
just to force us to hand over 'Old Dreams'.

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
But why?

309
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
Why?

310
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,290
He knows we don't have the power to fight against him.

311
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,560
If he wins,

312
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,360
'Old Dreams' will naturally fall into his hands.

313
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,760
If we don't participate,

314
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,400
it would be disrespectful to the Young Marshal

315
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,060
and an insult to the military.

316
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,680
How could a small theater troupe like us

317
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,810
possibly stand against the military?

318
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,780
So what do we do?

319
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Do we just

320
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,080
swallow this bitter pill?

321
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
Let's just

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,240
go all the way.

323
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,570
We can move away,

324
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,970
find another place.

325
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,370
We can perform anywhere, can't we?

326
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,360
Sister,

327
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
what do you think?

328
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
Is Manager Chen here?

329
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
What can I do for you?

330
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
This is unexpected.

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,360
The legendary Mule Society

332
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,960
is actually in such a remote little courtyard.

333
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,080
When my master was alive,

334
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,960
Mule Society was one of the

335
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,680
most prestigious opera troupes.

336
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Please mind your words, sir.
