1
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
Who says women are inferior to men?

2
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,120
I, Ruan Suiqing, will ensure your success.

3
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,960
What's wrong with being a girl?

4
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Are you crazy?

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,050
I mean girls should sing when they need to.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
The audience isn't deaf.

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,460
They can tell for themselves if it's good or not.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
If all else fails,

9
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
I'll give you

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
my full support on stage.

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,560
Promise?

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,360
You build the stage, I'll perform.

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
It's a deal.

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,760
When Ruan Suiqing told me those words,

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,080
I truly longed in my heart

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
to one day step onto the stage.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Perhaps

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
from the day he encouraged me to perform,

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
he held

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,120
a special place in my heart.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,530
About Yan'er's matter,

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,320
if even half a word gets out,

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,880
Your Mule Club might as well prepare to shut down.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
As for Lu Nanfeng,

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,970
who attempted misconduct but failed,

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
please, officer,

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
just take him away.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,960
No, you can't.

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,360
It's because of my stubborn insistence to perform

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,090
that my senior is now in danger.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,020
At that moment,

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,329
the person standing in front of me,

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,360
it was him.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Three days.

35
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,360
I only need three days.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
After three days,

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
I'll come back with the newspaper,

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
and you'll withdraw the case at the police station.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
If I don't return,

40
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,040
you can do whatever you want.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,760
When he said those words,

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
I suddenly felt a bit of confidence.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,200
I believe

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,800
he'll come back with good news.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,480
Mr. Xie! Mr. Xie! Mr. Xie!

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Please wait a little longer, Mr. Xie.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
Mr. Xie.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Why are you pulling me?

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
But he stood me up.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040
Fortunately,

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,200
the most important person in my life appeared by my side then.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
At that time, I didn't know

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,160
that he was the one I had been longing for,

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,560
the brother I had been searching for.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,520
My willfulness has caused a grave mistake.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,320
I seek Buddha's guidance.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Sister,

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,720
do you remember me?

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Sister,

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
it's been a long time.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,970
If it weren't for Huaiqing,

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
I believe

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,200
my life that night

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
might have come to an end.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,440
Heaven still favored me.

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,000
It allowed me, at my lowest point,

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,560
to find my brother again.

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,640
Later,

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,100
my master passed away,

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,040
the Mule Society disbanded,

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,650
and I followed my senior

72
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
to perform at Xiaodong Theater.

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
To make a living,

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,680
I forced myself back onto the stage.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
But

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,100
I could never overcome that barrier in my heart.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,520
What

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,760
are you so afraid of?

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
Just say I'm possessed by inner demons.

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,520
You misjudged me.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,320
After that argument

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,480
when I saw him again

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
I never expected

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,130
it would be under such circumstances.

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,540
Looking at Ruan Suiqing, who was almost broken,

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,840
I had only one thought in my mind:

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,640
he needed me,

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,660
and I had to help him through this.

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
Later,

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
we won the competition together

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,570
and saved 'Old Dreams'.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
With his help,

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I finally dared to face

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
the person I was on stage.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
I knew

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,260
I wanted to perform opera.

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,360
As we were moving toward each other,

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,960
as I increasingly believed

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
that this person was truly

100
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,600
my destined one,

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
I unexpectedly

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,200
discovered the truth.

103
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
You

104
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,880
are the murderer.

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Listen.

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,740
You didn't do anything wrong.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Then I...

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Then why?

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Your mistake was...

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
The person you wanted to kill

111
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
was Chen Zhiyi.

112
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Take it

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,810
and leave Haicheng.

114
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,840
Now I know the whole truth.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,320
On my wedding day,

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,860
I want to unmask him with my own hands.

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
Let everyone know

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
who the real murderer is.

119
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,840
I thought I was marrying my perfect match.

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
Little did I know

121
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,800
he would be so cruel beneath his facade.

122
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
Why?

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
What are you doing?

124
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm seeking justice for myself,

125
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,050
clearing the names of those wrongfully accused,

126
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,050
and demanding justice for all who died unjustly.

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,040
Mr. Chen, what a brilliant turnaround performance!

128
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,840
Young Master, you're mistaken.

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,240
The play I just performed

130
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,610
is called 'Old Dreams'.

131
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,919
Nonsense!

132
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,450
This isn't 'Old Dreams' at all.

133
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,880
Guards!

134
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,120
Arrest these actors who are

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
spreading dangerous lies!

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
Nobody move!

137
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,840
Look carefully.

138
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,490
This is the 'Old Dreams' manuscript you've been desperately seeking.

139
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
You will never

140
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,160
get it.

141
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,560
Impossible.

142
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
It can't be.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,200
What my master passed down to me

144
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,130
how could it be a book with no words?

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,570
That's impossible.

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,560
It was you.

147
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,920
You switched it.

148
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,080
No.

149
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,800
It was Lu Shun.

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,080
He never intended to pass 'Old Dreams' to you.

151
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,080
He didn't want me to have it.

152
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,640
Tell me.

153
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Where have you hidden 'Old Dreams'?

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,640
I told you.

155
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,680
This is 'Old Dreams'.

156
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Nonsense!

157
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
How could I not know what 'Old Dreams' is?

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,520
Of course you don't know.

159
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,280
From the moment you abandoned Mule Society

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
and broke with your master,

161
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
you were destined

162
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,480
to never understand what 'Old Dreams' truly means.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,840
To obtain it,

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,010
you've committed countless atrocities.

165
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,080
You established the Opera Guild to win over the wealthy

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,680
while exploiting and persecuting your peers.

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
You used the opera troupe

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,690
to launder money and embezzle military funds for Commander Zhang.

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
And Commander Zhang

170
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,120
naturally became

171
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
your biggest backer in both legal and criminal worlds.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Shut up!

173
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,360
When I saw that the script

174
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,410
had not a single word written in it,

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
I finally understood

176
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,200
why my master

177
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,120
wanted me to wait five years before opening it.

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,610
He wanted to tell me that

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,490
while theater is indeed the foundation of Mule Society,

180
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,160
theater comes from life.

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,080
Each of us has

182
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,840
our own 'Old Dreams.'

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,600
It's something that can only be written

184
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
after experiencing life yourself.

185
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
He Zhen.

186
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
You originally

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
had your own copy of 'Old Dreams'.

188
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,800
Nonsense!

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,880
Guards!

190
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,520
Arrest this woman

191
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,560
who spreads lies.

192
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Wait.

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Young Commander.

194
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't listen to that woman's nonsense.

195
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,960
I've been loyal to your father

196
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,560
and to you all along.

197
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,370
I've been wholeheartedly helping you manage Haicheng.

198
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,060
You don't actually believe what that actress says, do you?

199
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,200
Colonel Zhang.

200
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
Actually, all these years,

201
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,840
my father knew everything

202
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
you've done in Haicheng.

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,280
He just spared you

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
out of old friendship.

205
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
But I'm not my father.

206
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,100
I've already collected evidence of your wrongdoings.

207
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,380
I've just been waiting for the right moment.

208
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
I want to expose you

209
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,850
in front of all Haicheng citizens.

210
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,980
Since you show no regard for our past,

211
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,560
don't blame me for what comes next.

212
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,520
He was sent to the Marshal's mansion when he was five.

213
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,320
Who is the most loyal one?

214
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
I know better than you.

215
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,440
Young Master.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,920
Listen to my explanation. I... I...

217
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
I have nothing

218
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,080
to do with him. I...

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Chen Zhiyi.

220
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,690
It's all your fault.

221
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll strangle you, you little liar.

222
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
Senior, Zhiyi, Zhiyi.

223
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,090
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

224
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't you have anything to say to me?

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
Fine.

226
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
So sister went to all this trouble

227
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,560
to make me bring him here

228
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
just for this moment.

229
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,250
But what difference does it make that you're standing here?

230
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,880
Don't forget who you are.

231
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
You're still a murderer.

232
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,480
You bastard.

233
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,410
Today I'll make sure you die knowing exactly why.

234
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,360
These are the white gloves I found on Dalin.

235
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,800
A pair of white gloves from who knows where.

236
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
What does that prove?

237
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I have many pairs of gloves like these.

238
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,680
If you like them, I can give you a pair.

239
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,760
You've always been careful,

240
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,040
but you made two fatal mistakes.

241
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,100
Dalin's hands were larger than others',

242
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,120
so only he could wear these gloves.

243
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,280
So what?

244
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,120
So you met him before he died,

245
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,800
you fought with him,

246
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
he shot and wounded you,

247
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
but the bullet casing mysteriously disappeared.

248
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
What does that prove?

249
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,440
Dalin seemed careless on the surface,

250
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,570
but he was actually quite meticulous.

251
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,160
Before he died,

252
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,820
with his last bit of strength,

253
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
he pressed that bullet casing

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
into your narcissus flower bed.

255
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,640
This finger

256
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,240
with its indentation

257
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
is the best evidence.

258
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,440
These are all just your guesses,

259
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,840
wild speculation.

260
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,800
That's your second mistake:

261
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,120
overconfidence.

262
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
Because of your confidence,

263
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
you didn't notice the white gloves on Dalin.

264
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,640
Because of your confidence,

265
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,720
you didn't check

266
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,360
before bringing the narcissus flowers for Zhiyi

267
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
to the He family.

268
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
So you married into the He family

269
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
and became my wife

270
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,560
just for this?

271
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,720
If I'm not mistaken,

272
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,500
that bullet casing

273
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,920
is buried in your daffodil field.

274
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,360
Buried alongside it

275
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,800
is also the old troupe leader of the Red Maple Opera,

276
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Wan Fuming's body.

277
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,200
He Mingxu.

278
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,080
Dalin's fatal wound was from a gunshot.

279
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,640
Do you dare take off your shirt

280
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,840
and let everyone see?

281
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,760
If your wound matches Dalin's,

282
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
then you are the murderer.

283
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
He Mingxu.

284
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
Do as he says.

285
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,240
You told me

286
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
when I missed you,

287
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I should make a wish to the daffodils

288
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,560
and the flower fairy would help me find you.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,930
All these years,

290
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,770
I've done many things against my will.

291
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
I've killed many people.

292
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Every time after I did these things,

293
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
I would leave a daffodil

294
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,840
to mourn them.

295
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
Because only this way,

296
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
when I see you again,

297
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,000
I can still be the pure person I once was.
