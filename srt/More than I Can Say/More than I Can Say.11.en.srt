1
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,960
Senior.

2
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,380
Someone's here to see you.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
Senior.

4
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,940
I'll leave you two to talk.

5
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,180
I've been thinking for a long time

6
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,280
and finally decided to come.

7
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,250
I've known Nanfeng for so long,

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,650
yet this is my first visit to Mule Society.

9
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,200
Living behind high walls,

10
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,100
sheltered from the world,

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,200
what's the use of mastering poetry and literature since childhood?

12
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
You might find it ridiculous.

13
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,079
It was Mr. Lu

14
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,720
whose every movement on stage

15
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,920
showed me the world beyond these walls.

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,840
It was his talent

17
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
that completely moved me.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
I once dreamed that someday

19
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,560
I could come with Nanfeng to meet all of you.

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,100
I never thought it would be like this now.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
Miss Xie.

22
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
I understand why you've come.

23
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
I don't want to make excuses.

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,200
I lost your letters.

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
If you want to scold me,

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,079
go ahead.

28
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,540
Perhaps it will make you feel better.

29
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,280
No wonder Nanfeng always mentions you.

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
He says that at Mule Society,

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,700
you're the one he worries about most.

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Actually, I came here

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
specifically to tell you one thing.

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
Do you believe me?

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,040
Nanfeng and I are innocent.

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,240
I believe you.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
I believe you both are innocent.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,480
I also don't believe Senior Brother

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
would do such a thing.

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,860
The current state of Mule Society...

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
It's because I went on stage without permission.

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
That's why, Zhiyi...

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,760
If not for our selfish actions,

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
Mule Society

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
wouldn't be in this situation now.

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,280
Nanfeng is gone.

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
But I know

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,400
that someday

50
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
he will return.

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
When that time comes,

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
the country will be peaceful

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
and prosperous.

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
At that time,

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,520
he'll be Mr. Lu again.

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,740
When that day truly comes,

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,720
I only wish to sit in the audience

58
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
and listen to him perform.

59
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,520
Miss,

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,330
you've been out for a long time.

61
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,090
Please don't anger your father again.

62
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,080
Zhiyi.

63
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,840
Please keep Mule Society going.

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,880
Even if it's just so that when Nanfeng returns,

65
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,700
he'll have a place to come back to.

66
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Feng Leader.

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
Feng Leader,

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
the master just passed away.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,480
We...

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,440
We...

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,650
Since Mule Society has disbanded,

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,820
what's the point of them keeping that thing?

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,450
Let's go.

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,640
Put it down.

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
Junior.

76
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,560
We heard about Master's passing

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,320
and came back specially to see him

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,780
and pay our last respects.

79
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Master doesn't need your respects.

80
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Please leave.

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Junior,

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,720
we've been fellow disciples for so many years.

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,120
Is this coldness really necessary?

84
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
So the troupe master doesn't need us to send him off,

85
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
but he needs you instead?

86
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
What?

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,860
Did I say something wrong?

88
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
This woman

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,320
has brought nothing but trouble

90
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,900
since the day she arrived at Mule Troupe.

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,720
The old troupe master was foolish.

92
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,600
He took her in like his own daughter

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,930
and spoiled her rotten.

94
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
And what has she done?

95
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Nothing but bring trouble to Mule Troupe,

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
ruin our reputation,

97
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,810
what else has she ever done?

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
Now Mule Troupe

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,520
has such a bad reputation because of her performances

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,480
that our name is mud,

101
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,280
and no theater will hire us.

102
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,080
Yet she

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
still clings to us.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Tell me,

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,000
who else

106
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
would harm their own family

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,480
so viciously?

108
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,960
By the way.

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,280
I've also heard

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
that before the old troupe master passed away,

111
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,520
only you two were in the room.

112
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,480
I want to ask you, Chen Zhiyi.

113
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,440
How did the troupe master

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
actually die?

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Fengsun.

116
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,880
In front of our master,

117
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
don't talk nonsense.

118
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,920
At least someone here knows how to behave.

119
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Zhiyi.

120
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,240
They are still Master's disciples.

121
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,140
Despite their faults,

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,240
they mean well.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,880
Pay your respects and leave.

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,680
Second Brother.

125
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,440
But they...

126
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,680
Lu Nanping,

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,960
you've come at the right time.

128
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,090
I need to talk to you.

129
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
What is it?

130
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Let's talk outside.

131
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,640
Master is here.

132
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,120
It's not appropriate.

133
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Wait.

134
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,159
It's perfect to do this in front of the old troupe master.

135
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,520
Let him be our witness.

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,679
What is it?

137
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
Before the troupe master passed away,

138
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,960
did he leave behind

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
a script of 'Old Dreams'?

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Fengsun,

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,560
how dare you!

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
Whatever Master left behind

143
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,560
is not something you, Feng the troupe leader, should be concerned with.

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,080
Yes.

145
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
If it were the troupe master's personal possession,

146
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,610
I would have nothing to say.

147
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,080
But this is something passed down from the Mule Troupe's ancestors.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Even if the Mule Troupe has disbanded,

149
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,500
it should have a rightful place to go.

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,800
So you came here for this thing.

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,280
You traitors.

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Traitors?

153
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,200
We're fighting for our lives out there

154
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,460
while you're reaping the benefits here.

155
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,840
This thing has been passed down for generations

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,370
only to be ruined by Lu Shun.

157
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
You call me a traitor,

158
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,970
but who's the real traitor?

159
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,760
Feng Lingban.

160
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,460
You left with everyone before Master even died.

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,320
Now,

162
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
his body isn't even cold yet

163
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
and you're back for 'Old Dreams'.

164
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't think

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know He Zhen sent you to ask for it.

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,320
Junior.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,720
Stop talking.

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,850
You're biting the hand that feeds you.

169
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
As for you,

170
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,120
you're just He Zhen's dog.

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
You all leave now.

172
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,480
Go.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,080
Not so easy.

174
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
You son of a

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,920
bitch! You motherless wretch!

176
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Today I'm

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,360
definitely going to teach you a lesson.

178
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,680
The old man is gone now.

179
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Who's going to protect you anymore?

180
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Feng!

181
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Feng!

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Feng Cun.

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
How dare you start a fight at a funeral hall?

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,920
Who gave you such audacity?

185
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,320
This is our family business.

186
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
It's none of your damn business.

187
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,840
Of course it's my business.

188
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Whatever concerns Mule Society

189
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,490
concerns me, Ruan Suiqing.

190
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,740
Young Master Ruan.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,680
You should at least consider

192
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
the He family's reputation.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
For this woman,

194
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
is it really worth it?

195
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm warning you.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
She's my person.

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,000
Just try to touch her and see what happens.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Young Master Ruan! Young Master Ruan!

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,160
We just came to burn incense for our master.

200
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
We never expected things would turn out like this.

201
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Bullshit!

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,180
Can't you see someone's been killed?

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,810
You're no better yourself,

204
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,500
watching your junior sister being bullied.

205
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,760
Mule Society has wasted resources raising you all,

206
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,020
ungrateful wretches.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
You're not done yet, are you?

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
If you hadn't encouraged my junior sister to perform on stage

209
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,340
and pass love notes to Xiaowu.

210
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
Our Mule Society

211
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,080
How could we have such a big issue today?

212
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,360
Let me tell you,

213
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
if you don't explain yourself clearly today,

214
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
you'll face serious consequences.

215
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,360
Fine.

216
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,060
I, Ruan Suiqing, don't respond well to threats.

217
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Not backing down, huh?

218
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
Today, right in front of our master's shrine,

219
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,560
let's settle this properly.

220
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm not afraid

221
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,000
of making headlines in tomorrow's Haicheng Daily.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,920
You.

223
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Third Senior.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,060
Young Master Ruan.

225
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Since Young Master Ruan has spoken,

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,720
let's not

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,160
hold it against him.

228
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,840
Forget it.

229
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Listen to me.

230
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
We won't argue with you today.

231
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,080
Let's go.

232
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,720
Chen Zhiyi,

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
remember this,

234
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
what's happening to the Mule Society today

235
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,280
is all your doing.

236
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,690
Let's go.

237
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
I didn't expect that during the days I was away

238
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,960
so many things happened.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Just now.

240
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
Thank you.

241
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,610
Fengsong is now with the He family,

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,960
yet you still stood up for me.

243
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
What are you talking about?

244
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,850
Don't worry about such things with me.

245
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,360
Now that Nanfeng isn't here,

246
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,690
of course I have to help.

247
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,980
Let's not talk about this now.

248
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,290
Look what I brought you.

249
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,480
I saw you liked these before,

250
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,920
so I bought some.

251
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,960
You should go back first.

252
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
If there's anything,

253
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,720
we can talk tomorrow.

254
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
I want to be alone for a while.

255
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,940
Thank you for buying me pastries.

256
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,130
Alright.

257
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,640
Get some rest early,

258
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,650
I'll come see you tomorrow.

259
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Chen Zhiyi.

260
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
Try some,

261
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
but don't eat too many.

262
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,900
You'll get fat.

263
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
Flowers.

264
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,320
Freshly picked flowers.

265
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,890
Little girl.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,930
Would you like to buy some flowers?

267
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,200
What kind of flowers are these?

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
These are narcissus.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
Please buy some.

270
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,760
They look beautiful as home decorations.

271
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,960
When dried, they can be used to make tea.

272
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,410
They can be used for tea?

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,560
The elders say that dried narcissus

274
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,890
can be used as medicine.

275
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,020
I'll take them all.

276
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
You should head home now.

277
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
Thank you, sir.

278
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,599
Young Master Ruan, what brings you

279
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,000
to my humble abode today?

280
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,720
Well, I'm here

281
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,920
to confess something to you.

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,319
Lin Dalin.

283
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,760
Lin Dalin has big hands.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
Lin Dalin really has big hands.

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
Why don't you change your name?

286
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,080
Big Hands.

287
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,460
Lin Big Hands sounds pretty good too.

288
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,450
Come on, is that really necessary?

289
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,920
White gloves.

290
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,440
A symbol of purity and justice.

291
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,160
Do you understand?

292
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,640
Yes,

293
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,770
I don't understand.

294
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,380
You're just a germaphobe.

295
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,740
Get your hands off.

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,360
What's that

297
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,640
garlic sprout smell?

298
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Get lost.

299
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
Let's talk business.

300
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
Narcissus flowers.

301
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,980
I just bought them from a girl.

302
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,800
They have the same perfume scent

303
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,200
that I smelled on the maid at the Xie family.

304
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,800
You've got quite the nose, haven't you?

305
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,600
So what?

306
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,560
Do you remember

307
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
that list you showed me before?
