[JCC Awards Ceremony Entrance]

188
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,770
- Ren!
- Nice work on winning that award.

189
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,070
Stop it.

190
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,220
- Look at that cute face.
- Stop.

191
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,560
It's fine. I haven't seen you in forever.

192
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,630
Kazuma, why are you here?

193
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, this is Yagami Ryunosuke from H and C Design.

194
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,850
He's a new employee, Takizawa Kazuma.

195
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,720
Nice to meet you.

196
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,570
Oh, so you're Kazuma-kun, huh?

197
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,000
Then maybe we should keep our relationship a secret.

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,070
- What are you saying?
- What?

199
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,890
- Stop that.
- But it's the truth.

200
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,790
I said stop.

201
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,590
Let go.

202
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,900
You seem close to Yagami-san.

203
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
Not really.

204
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,780
H and C Design is located near us, right?

205
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,500
So he won an award, too?

206
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,680
It has nothing to do with you.

207
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,180
I only went to the same high school as him in France.

208
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,350
Don't get any weird thoughts.

209
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,150
If you don't want me to get weird thoughts, just tell me.

210
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,900
Why did you suddenly disappear ten years ago?

211
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,700
Why did your last name change?

212
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,100
And Hide...

213
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,600
You won't tell me anything important.

214
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,110
Well then, let's toast to the award of Ishihara-san's team!

215
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:56,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

216
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,690
Isn't he incredible?

217
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm so jealous.

218
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,420
Ishihara-san, congratulations.

219
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,490
Isn't Ishihara-san incredible?

220
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,040
He's amazing.

221
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,580
You really are.

222
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,030
We look up to you.

223
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,160
What?

224
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,030
Oh, well, um...

225
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,390
Oh, right.

226
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,450
Hide's mom called me yesterday.

227
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,660
I covered for him.

228
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,430
Oh, don't do that anymore.

229
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,560
Why?

230
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,040
You could get in trouble, too.

231
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,260
Oh, are you jealous?

232
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,960
No.

233
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,610
Ren, are you there?

234
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,010
Yes.

235
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,770
I made some tea.

236
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,270
Do you want some?

237
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,030
I'll go get it.

238
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:50,713
[Sunday, 4 p.m., behind Taiho Hall. Let's have some fun together.]

239
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,010
Hey, Takizawa-san. Take care of Ishihara-san, okay?

240
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,770
Wait, I don't know his address.

241
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,170
- I thought you would, since you're close.
- No...

242
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,880
It's probably in his wallet, on his license or something.

243
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,150
Bye.

244
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,890
Come on, stand up.

245
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,689
[Sunday, 4 p.m., behind Taiho Hall. Let's have some fun together.]

246
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you really 17?

247
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,580
You sure are cute.

248
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
Ren!

249
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,250
What are you doing?

250
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,280
Who is this guy?

251
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,630
Don't touch him. I'll call the cops.

252
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,950
Are you stupid?

253
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,030
You're the stupid one.

254
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,530
Why?

255
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,810
I mean, you were going to a love hotel with that old man.

256
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,320
So what?

257
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,780
Hide has sex too.

258
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,340
Is it because he's a guy?

259
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,730
He's not forcing or threatening me.

260
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,930
I just want to have sex.

261
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,210
Got it? Don't get in the way.

262
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,570
Then do it with me.

263
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,960
If it's just sex that you want, then do it with me.

264
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,340
Are you okay?

265
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,730
Can you get your shoes off?

266
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
This way.

267
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,830
Here, drink this.

268
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,950
Okay, I'm fine now.

269
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,830
No, you're not.

270
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,320
Come on, let's go.

271
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,420
You've always been so nice.

272
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,970
Huh?

273
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,680
Hey!

274
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,180
If you act nice, I might misunderstand you.

275
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,400
I don't mind that.

276
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,460
We're friends, aren't we?

277
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,130
Sorry.

278
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,010
I'm just drunk.

279
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,590
Go home.

280
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,300
Ren.

281
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,630
Let's head to bed.

282
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,500
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

283
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,830
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

284
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,270
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

285
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:21,690
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

286
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,870
♫ If I were able to say this ♫

287
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,230
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

288
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,460
♫ Oh, one day ♫

289
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,890
[Preview]
So you don't want to be my sex friend.

290
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,680
Pain pours into my heart like a storm.

291
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,850
If you and Sanada fell into the river,

292
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,513
who will the president save?

293
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:57,213
Kazuma...

294
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,980
I really missed you.
