1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,000
If you act nice, I might misunderstand you.

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,080
I don't mind that.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,190
We're friends, aren't we?

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Sorry.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,610
I'm just drunk.

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,300
Go home.

7
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,010
Ren.

8
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,290
Let's head to bed.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,890
♫ Don't smile at my innocent face ♫

10
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,960
♫ When you don't know about my feelings ♫

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,440
♫ I must not change lest I fall apart ♫

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,940
♫ I can't be honest today ♫

13
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,950
♫ I love you a million times, ten billion times ♫

14
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,960
♫ I want to meet you, touch you and embrace you ♫

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,940
♫ I love you a million times, ten billion times ♫

16
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,690
♫ Only look at me ♫

17
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,450
♫ Despite knowing it's just in my head ♫

18
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,640
♫ I'll love you until you fade away ♫

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
[Tokyo in April is...]

20
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,240
Am I your first?

21
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,500
Sorry.

22
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,100
Your first time should be with a girl you like.

23
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,210
It's fine.

24
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,110
To be honest, this is my first time too.

25
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,610
Thank you for being my first.

26
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,870
Can we kiss?

27
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,010
We don't have to.

28
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,720
We can do it.

29
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,030
At that moment,

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
pain poured into my heart like a storm.

31
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,780
The guy who was always shining

32
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,720
didn't suit this place at all.

33
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,600
A cheap love hotel.

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,930
A bed that smells of mildew.

35
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,430
The loud sound of rain.

36
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,670
Thinking of this as his first time,

37
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,190
I couldn't help but cry.

38
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,970
Kazuma.

40
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,650
Don't cry.

41
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,340
I'm sorry I made you do this.

42
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,190
I'm really sorry.

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
That was

44
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,840
the last memory I had of him.

45
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,990
The next morning,

46
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,680
I had a fever of over 40 degrees

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,210
and was sent to the hospital.

48
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,190
They said I had acute pneumonia.

49
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,090
Then, I got meningitis from a virus along with that.

50
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,800
When I woke up, a month later,

51
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,830
Ren was already gone.

52
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,440
I missed you.

53
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,770
I really missed you, Ren.

54
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,420
This whole time.

55
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,710
This whole time.

56
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,310
Oh, are you awake?

57
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
Can I use your kitchen?

58
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,860
I'll make us something.

59
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,330
And here.

60
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,500
Do you remember last night?

61
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,970
Not just last night, but ten years ago too.

62
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,420
I want you to tell me about back then.

63
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,070
The things I need to know.

64
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,320
I want you to tell me.

65
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,670
- Ren, I came back to Tokyo because...
- Kazuma.

66
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,370
Last night, we were friends with benefits.

67
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,940
It had no special meaning.

68
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,180
So, let's respect each other's privacy.

69
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,320
You don't want to be my sex partner.

70
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,890
You're not gay, so I guess you'd like women more.

71
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,130
Well, I won't force you.

72
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,480
What?

73
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Sure.

74
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,810
Huh?

75
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,220
Let's be friends with benefits.

76
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,630
After four months here, it was the peak of summer in Tokyo.

77
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,670
Oh, Takizawa-san.

78
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,340
And I've been friends with benefits with Ren for one month.

79
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,120
Sex with Ren came with several rules.

80
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,660
For example, lights were kept off.

81
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,500
While doing it,

82
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,480
Ren will never show his face

83
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,970
or make a sound.

84
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,140
And after...

85
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,180
the sex was over, I always went home.

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,010
Other than that,

87
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,220
nothing has changed.

88
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,170
Good work.

89
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,790
You, too.

90
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,210
It's so hot.

91
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,610
Right?

92
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,510
I don't know how friends with benefits usually works,

93
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,240
but we have sex almost every day.

94
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, I had trouble finding someone who understood the situation over there,

95
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,010
so this is a huge help.

96
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm glad we can help.

97
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,470
I look forward to working with you.

98
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,170
Us, too.

99
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,330
Oh, can we talk, Ishihara-kun?

100
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,830
Sure.

101
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,260
I'll wait outside.

102
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,690
Okay.

103
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,660
Goodbye.

104
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Thank you.

105
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,780
You're different from when I worked there.

106
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,780
It's already been four years since I was an intern under you.

107
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,620
It's been that long? I'm so old now.

108
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,680
Takizawa-san is in HR, right?

109
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,780
Yes.

110
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,180
Is he okay?

111
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,080
A nice guy who grew up abroad.

112
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,250
Young and with a great academic background.

113
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,140
Sanada hates guys like that the most.

114
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,850
Watch over him, so he doesn't get harassed.

115
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,020
Actually, I never heard about

116
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,350
why you decided to quit here and work independently.

117
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,140
Was it Director Sanada?

118
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,760
You're a talented designer,

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,460
and I have heard you've been a big help in this company's growth.

120
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,980
But you know...

121
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,010
If you and Sanada fell into the river,

122
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,870
who would the president save?

123
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,360
I don't think he would save either of us.

124
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,120
He's not the type to sacrifice himself for others.

125
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,000
Nicely put.

126
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,140
It's as you said.

127
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,040
The reason I quit

128
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,110
was because I lost against Sanada.

129
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,390
It's not about what happened.

130
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:44,480
It's because no matter what happened, the president chose Sanada over me.

131
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,190
But you know,

132
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,730
you've grown enough so that I can tell you

133
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,130
that guy's weak point.

134
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,870
You want me to chase Director Sanada out?

135
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,605
Is that out of love for the company?

136
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,200
- Or...
- No, I don't care what happens at the company I left.

137
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,790
But it makes me mad when I think about how Sanada can keep doing what he does

138
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,720
without batting an eyelid.

139
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,690
Well, let me know if you ever need to know.

140
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,520
I'm back.

141
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,850
What did you talk about?

142
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,340
Nothing. Just life.

143
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,790
Are you going back to work?

144
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,150
No, I'm going home directly.

145
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,420
Then, do you want to do it now?

146
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,920
S-S-Sure.

147
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,090
Which is it?

148
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,930
Do you want a drink?

149
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,780
I want ice cream.

150
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,580
Were you an athlete?

151
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,330
I played football in high school.

152
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,020
Wow, I bet you were popular.

153
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,680
No, not really.

154
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,500
Hey, Ren.

155
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,010
Yeah?

156
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,640
Do you want to take a shower together?

157
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,220
What?

158
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,960
No, I can't. No way.

159
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,090
- Can we, please?
- I don't want to. Seriously.

160
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,750
- Please!
- Seriously, get off me, muscle head.

161
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,896
[Maeda Ayumi]

162
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,080
Be quiet, okay?

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,510
Okay.

164
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,190
Maeda-san? What's up?

165
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,900
Ishihara-san, did you see the news?

166
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,540
What? No.

167
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,060
Watch them right now!

168
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,670
- What do we do?
- Hey, calm down.

169
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,440
What is it?

170
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:31,920
Actor Furuya Kou was driving when he caused a crash on the road.

171
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Police report that drugs were found in his car,

172
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,520
- and investigations are underway.
- This is the worst.

173
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,780
Last night, actor Furuya Kou-san

174
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,790
caused a car accident under the influence of drugs.

175
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,640
We have three commercials right now that feature Furuya-san.

176
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,480
One of them is a commercial for Yotsugi Real Estate.

177
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,800
We have another version made for a different season,

178
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,820
so we'll ask if they would like to use that one.

179
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,510
For Aqua Holdings,

180
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,960
we plan to replace him with shots of the product.

181
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,500
The problem is Nittou Densan, whose commercial airs next month.

182
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,170
We'd like to ask the creative team about replacement ideas.

183
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,670
Yes.

184
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,200
Furuya-san has always been the actor for this series,

185
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,350
so it may be difficult to bring in another actor at this point.

186
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,980
Do we even have the budget for that?

187
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,760
So, without hiring someone or using any more budget,

188
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,470
we need a video that the client will accept.

189
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,190
I guess so.

190
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,280
I'll make it.

191
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,350
No way.

192
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,920
I'd like you all to handle client communications

193
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,060
and replacement work.

194
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,740
- I don't want to...
- I won't do that.

195
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,150
Oh, Takizawa-san.

196
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,620
Hello.

197
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,950
Is the Furuya-san case going okay?

198
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,700
Oh, Yotsugi Real Estate and Aqua Holdings seem okay,

199
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,330
but Ishihara-san is remaking the commercial for Nittou Densan now.

200
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,440
What? Is that okay?

201
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,650
Usually, it would be unthinkable,

202
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,470
but it's Ishihara-san.

203
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,140
We don't have an actor or the budget.

204
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,080
Jeez, what do we do?

205
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,260
How is it going?

206
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,010
I think it'll work out.

207
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
That video...

208
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,700
Oh, I took this in France.

209
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,210
I took some footage to use for competitions.

210
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,240
Wow, it's so pretty.

211
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,900
Are you staying late?

212
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,580
Yes, I have to get this done by tomorrow.

213
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,530
Can I wait for you?

214
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,710
Sure.

215
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,490
Ren won't show his weak side to me.

216
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,460
I wish he would depend on me more.

217
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,210
Ishihara-kun.

218
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,010
Thanks. You made a great commercial.

219
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,250
No, I'm glad we got it done in time.

220
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,820
We will take care of things now, so get some rest.

221
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,020
Good work.

222
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,930
Thank you.

223
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,370
It's all over now.

224
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,950
Yeah.

225
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Good work.

226
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,140
Hm?

227
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
Kazuma.

228
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,340
I want to do it. Right now.

229
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,470
♫ One day, one day, let me hold you one day, one day ♫

230
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,640
♫ Let me feel you one day, one day ♫

231
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,880
♫ Let me love you (let me love you) ♫

232
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,030
♫ Let me get you one day, one day ♫

233
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,230
♫ Let me hold you one day, one day ♫

234
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,470
♫ Let me feel you one day, one day ♫

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,610
♫ Let me love you (let me love you) ♫

236
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,270
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

237
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:07,570
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

238
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:14,010
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

239
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,380
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

240

♫ If I were able to say this ♫

241
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,040
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

242

♫ Oh, one day ♫

243
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,150
[Preview]
I just wanted to see you.

244
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,460
I would do anything.

245
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,220
Let's watch something now.

246
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,860
Nothing else mattered.

247
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,870
You're the only thing that's important to me, Ren.
