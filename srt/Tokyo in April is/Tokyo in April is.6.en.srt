00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,712
I suddenly remembered this morning.

2
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,441
It looks good on you.

3
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,361
We talked about food,

00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,721
gaining weight,

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,354
and other silly things.

6
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:23,490
When I left the room...

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,418
Wait a second.

8
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,916
he kept the door open

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,738
and kissed me.

10
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:31,703
What did

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,047
Kazuma say at that moment?

12
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:39,505
Have a good day, Ren.

13
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:45,024
Okay. Thank you.

30
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:28,147
Your father said he sent you to study in France,

31
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,183
since you wouldn't inherit the hospital.

32
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,587
After high school,

33
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,223
I got hired here instead.

34
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,490

- Really?

Will Kazuma die?

46
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,590
- It's possible.
- I can't accept you

47
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,890
- as part of the Saotome family.
- They found chats with a guy in their 30s...

Isn't he the hospital director's son?

51
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:14,909
I'd be ashamed to be his parent.

52

for liking you.

00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,559
It was raining.

66
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:11,597
I was waiting with an umbrella in hand.

67
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:15,816
But right now,

68
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:20,306

Just like before...

79
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:36,582
Ren vanished.

80
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,454
See you later.

81
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,480

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,454
There shouldn't be any proof.

172
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,334
So just fix all this.

173
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,131

174
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,877
I can't do that.

175

Did you forget about the power harassment I covered up?

176
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,888
Either way, the president is coming back from his trip to the U.S.

177
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:41,526
