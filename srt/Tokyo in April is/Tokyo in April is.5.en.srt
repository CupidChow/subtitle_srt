1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,380
Are you making them again this year?

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,930
Yes. Now that he works at a company,

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,980
I wanted to make him a simple shirt.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,580
That sounds nice. I hope he likes it.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,340
Who knows?

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,400
I haven't seen him much since he came back to Japan.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,670
I think he might resent me.

8
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,074
Didn't I tell you?

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,640
I wanted a next year's compilation for today's meeting.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,860
I told you. Now you've embarrassed me.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,726
Right. I'm sorry.

12
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:54,946
No, why didn't you do it?

13
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,870
You had enough time this morning, right?

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,110
Then...

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,000
You're wasting my time!

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,725
[Maeda Ayumi: Can you meet me here?]

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,200
♫ Don't smile at my innocent face ♫

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,210
♫ When you don't know about my feelings ♫

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,730
♫ I must not change lest I fall apart ♫

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,220
♫ I can't be honest today ♫

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,240
♫ I love you a million times, ten billion times ♫

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,250
♫ I want to meet you, touch you and embrace you ♫

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,250
♫ I love you a million times, ten billion times ♫

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,020
♫ Only look at me ♫

25
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,802
♫ Despite knowing it's just in my head ♫

26

00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,880
[Tokyo in April is...]

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,800
Welcome.

29
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,569
Sorry to bother you.

30
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,080
No, it's fine.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,000
Iced coffee, please.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,974
Coming right up.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,010
It's rare for you to invite me out.

34
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,713
Is there something wrong?

35
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,730
Do you remember Utsumi-san? She quit last month.

36
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,963
The contract worker.

37
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:45,283
Yes, but what about her?

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,950
She contacted me.

39
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,410
Okay.

40
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,527
To be honest,

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,492
Sanada-san...

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,190
What did Sanada-san do?

43
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,160
Sanada-san...

44
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,866
raped her.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,342
He offered to give her advice before her contract renewal...

46
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,700
and invited her for drinks.

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,720
When she woke up,

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,810
she had already been assaulted in the hotel.

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,950
She ran away in a hurry and fell down the stairs.

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,470
She was hospitalized.

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,130
Does she have any proof? Messages from back then? Anything?

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,950
How could this happen?

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm also a victim.

54
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,100
He used the same trick on me five years ago.

55
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,643
He failed though.

56
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,990
Why did you keep quiet?

57
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,380
I told someone higher up, but they kept it under wraps.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,730
How can you work with him?

59
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,236
Ishihara-san, I never felt okay around him.

60
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,800
But I was able to escape.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Even if I tried to sue him, with the way things are nowadays,

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,530
I knew I'd be the one to get hurt and chastised.

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,550
And what's more, I wanted to keep working there.

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,760
No, that's not it.

65
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,000
That's all just excuses.

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,650
I actually didn't have the courage.

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,330
I see.

68
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,780
Thanks for telling me.

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,170
I'll do everything I can.

70
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,138
Is something wrong?

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,360
What?

72
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,670
Well, you seem deep in thought.

73
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,000
Not really. What should we eat?

74
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,029
Oh, do you want me to cook?

75
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,456
I'll help.

76
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:47,506
It's fine. Keep working.

77
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,460
Sanada-san raped her.

78
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,120
I never felt okay around him.

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,350
I believe her.

80
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,820
He'd act that way when I was there, too.

81
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,870
There's no doubt about it.

82
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,480
Did no one press charges?

83
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,880
No.

84
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,380
The victims didn't want to make it a big deal.

85
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,650
But I told the president, hoping that it'd at least pull Sanada down.

86
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,850
But you see how it ended up.

87
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:06,090
But when I found out, more than a year had passed since the incident.

88
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,350
There was no proof either.

89
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,610
But this is different.

90
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,260
The victim spoke up.

91
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,226
And she has you.

92
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,508
But you'll need great resolve.

93
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,410
Are you really doing this?

94
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,940
Yes.

95
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,860
Then I'll try contacting the victim from before.

96
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,480
Thank you.

97
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,590
I'll let you know when anything happens.

98
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,090
Okay.

99
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,950
By the way, is Takizawa-san doing well?

100
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,748
Yes, he's a capable guy.

101
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,760
I feel at ease when I'm with him.

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,690
I see.

103
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,370
Thank you for today.

104
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,801
Sure.

105
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,890
Yeah? What's up?

106
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,490
It's rare for you to call me.

107
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,046
Has your company ever had any internal complaints?

108
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,694
No, probably not.

109
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:30,643
Why? Did someone sue you?

110
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,100
It's not me, but something happened to a female employee.

111
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,135
I see.

112
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:43,914
In that case, I think I could introduce her to a lawyer I know.

113
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,230
Tell me more later.

114
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,015
- Thanks.
- How is Friday night?

115
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,670
Maybe around 9 p.m.?

116
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,660
Okay, I'll keep it open.

117
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,670
Are things going well with that guy?

118
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,106
It's fine. Things are normal.

119
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,280
Oh, yeah?

120
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,090
What?

121
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,106
I'll talk to you later, then.

122
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,450
Sure, see you.

123
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,200
It's already been ten years.

124
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,860
I attended a boarding school in France to study art.

125
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,750
[10 Years Ago]
The middle schooler who came to study abroad

126
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,530
kept his distance and was always alone.

127
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,197
He'd be on his phone often,

128
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:56,576
but it never looked like he was talking to anyone.

129
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,990
Are you the new Japanese middle schooler?

130
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,270
I'm Japanese, too. My name is Yagami Ryunosuke.

131
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,024
Nice to meet you.

132
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,770
That's obnoxious.

133
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:35,321
But he never stopped using the phone.

134
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,950
There's a Monet exhibition these days, right?

135
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,380
- Yes, at Orsay Museum.
- That's awesome.

136
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,150
- We could draw.
- Yes, we could draw some sketches.

137
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,140
Absolutely, let's take some paper with us.

138
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,966
He couldn't speak a word of French, and was a loner at school.

139
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,020
He had lost his will to live.

140
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,840
I was worried about him.

141
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,619
Hey, you.

142
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,177
Hey.

143
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,200
Are you okay?

144
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,310
Who did this?

145
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,060
I don't know.

146
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:22,437
I just somehow got involved.

147
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,080
- Let's go to the hospital.
- No.

148
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,240
I don't want to go to the hospital.

149
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,500
Hey.

150
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,620
Hey, why did you come here when you can't speak the language?

151
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,660
It doesn't look like you have a dream in mind.

152
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,910
Well, you only have one life.

153
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,030
Live the way you want to.

154
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,190
Isn't there anything you want to do or get?

155
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,320
I want to call someone.

156
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:16,705
All he wanted was to get him on the phone.

157
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,840
Do you want to use my cell phone?

158
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,740
No, I can't leave a number behind.

159
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:42,923
We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.

160
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,377
The number you have dialed...

161
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,120
Kazuma and I were no longer connected.

162
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,740
Ishihara?

163
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,640
If I could only hear his answering machine,

164
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,590
then I'd know he's alive.

165
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,850
Hello?

166
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,230
Hide? It's me.

167
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,619
What?

168
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:37,891
No way.

169
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,584
Ren?

170
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,685
Ren, where are you?

171
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,663
We've been worried.

172
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,530
When the new semester started, they said you went to study abroad,

173
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,210
and that Kazuma went back to the U.S.

174
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,133
The U.S.? Kazuma did?

175
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:04,140
Yes. He was hospitalized all summer.

176
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,160
He left as soon as he was released.

177
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,100
And there were strange rumors.

178
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,320
Kazuma...

179
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,710
Hello? Ren?

180
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,540
He's alive. I'm so glad he's alive.

181
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,580
First love can turn anyone into an idiot.

182
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,040
[Takizawa Kazuma: Cooked to a nice simmer. What time are you coming back?]

183

I heard you're doing the speech for the new employees.

187
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,220
I have to do it because you wouldn't.

My condolences.

189
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,263
I mean, so many of them probably came because they look up to you.

190
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:35,933
They would get way more motivated if you came to speak.

191
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,284

- It's fine.

- Are you all right?
- Yes.

- It's okay.

Ishihara-san? What's wrong?

Nothing.

That's why I want to keep what happened ten years ago a secret.

No way. I don't wear suits.
