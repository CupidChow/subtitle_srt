189
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,790
whether I closed my eyes

190
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,050
or opened them, he'd be there.

191
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,870
That's so annoying.

192
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,690
What?

193
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,310
That was enough for me.

194
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,300
Nothing else mattered.

195
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,170
You're the only thing that's important to me, Ren.

196
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,150
Did something good happen, Takizawa-san?

197
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,770
What? Why?

198
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,610
I feel like your complexion is nice today.

199
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,190
Ishihara-san has been doing well lately, too.

200
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,950
I'm so jealous of you young people in your twenties.

201
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh, you wanted to ask about recruiting new contract workers, right?

202
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,240
Oh, right.

203
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,940
One of our workers until now, Utsumi-san,

204
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,040
was amazing at the job, but she suddenly quit.

205
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,240
Oh, really?

206
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,490
That's unfortunate.

207
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,800
Apparently, Director Sanada relied on her a lot.

208
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,580
It's not about what happened.

209
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,200
It's because no matter what happened, the president chose Sanada over me.

210
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,280
But it makes me mad when I think about how Sanada can keep doing what he does

211
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,080
without batting an eyelid.

212
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,350
Furuya has been accused of sexual violence

213
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,590
toward 16 women

214
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,080
through the introduction of the former CEO of a production company.

215
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,760
Furuya states that these claims are false,

216
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,960
and is suing the women for defamation.

217
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,770
Furuya sued the victims, apparently.

218
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,440
What an awful guy.

219
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,040
Yeah, the worst.

220
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,960
There were 1,355 cases of sexual assault.

221
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,070
I'll dry your hair.

222
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,360
That cake the other day was good.

223
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,580
Your cooking is not up to par. I thought you'd be better.

224
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,400
Shut up.

225
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,640
I can make more, since we have the ingredients.

226
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,180
Seriously?

227
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,150
Great.

228
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,650
I just got out of the shower.

229
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,250
So, I can't?

230
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,890
No, you can.

231
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,690
Then it's fine.

232
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,600
Hey, stop that.

233
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,740
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

234
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,080
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

235
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,510
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

236
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:26,930
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

237
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,120
♫ If I were able to say this ♫

238
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,290
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

239
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,710
♫ Oh, one day ♫

240
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,530
[Preview]
I'll meet him in Tokyo.

241
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,860
That was the only thing that kept my mind at ease.

242
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,130
You'll need great resolve. Are you really doing this?

243
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,030
Please don't take this miracle away from me.
