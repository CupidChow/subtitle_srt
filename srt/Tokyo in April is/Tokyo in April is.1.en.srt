00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,940
a nostalgic place for me.

00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,631
We'd usually have the head of HR meet you,

6
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:43,573
but it seems like the meeting is running late.

7
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,012
I see.

8
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,480
There's no point talking to you.

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,907
Please calm down.

Wait, Sanada-san. There's a new employee here.

- In our department?
- Yes.

I'm Takizawa Kazuma, and I'll be joining the HR Department.

- Nice to meet you.
- I'll call you later.

15

Geez, Ishihara-san!

16
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,429
You keep doing this.

17
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:18,603
Please get a grip already.

18
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,418
Hey, it's not my fault.

19
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:22,564
I was just saying the truth.

20
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:26,045
Sanada-san was wasting my team's time.

21
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:29,785
This is my team.

You've gotten taller.

You used to be so cute.

27
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:53,786
You know him, Ishihara-san?

28
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:57,210

Oh, he hasn't changed much.

Yes. It's not as good as my English,

99
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,226
but I learned enough from my roommate as a student to hold conversations.

100

Well,

129
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,462
if we do it for everyone,

130
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,966
the company will suddenly suffer a major burden.

131
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,035
Isn't it just for oversea temp workers?

132
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,966
What?

00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:06,839

- But...
- Don't be so arrogant.

135
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:12,778

00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,068
I want to go.

140
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,653
Kazuma's going, too.

141
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,968
Whoa, nice.

142
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,292
Will you wear a yukata?

143
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,293
- I will.
- For real?

144
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:04,066
Oh, it wasn't just the two of us.

145

Sorry, it took a while to put on the yukata.

152
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:34,097
I might not get to the meeting spot on time.

153
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:36,261
I figured.

154
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,778
So I came to get you.

155
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,104
It's a secret spot. Let's go.

156
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:50,677
Sure.

157
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,120
We made it.

158
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:11,129
Wow, that's pretty.

159
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,218
I couldn't say this to anyone,

160
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:37,180
but I actually wanted to go back to the U.S.

161
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,680
What?

162
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,028
My parents got divorced...

163
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:46,811
and everything changed after I started living with my mom.

164
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,864
I felt lonely.

165
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,171
But I'm fine now.

166
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,209
Because in Japan,

167
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,115
in Tokyo, I have you, Ren.

168
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,539

169
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:05,657

Yeah?

174

It's nothing.

175
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,420
Come on, just say it.

176
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,890
- No.
- Why?

177
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,377
Just say it.

178
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,939
Let's just watch the fireworks.

179
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:02,407
My days in Tokyo...

180
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,117
were the days I got to spend with Ren.

181
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,052
President, good morning.

182
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,118
Oh, Sanada-kun.

183

Thanks for yesterday's report.

184
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,168
It's no problem.

185
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,704
By the way, my suggestion for adding paid days off

186
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:39,211
wasn't for all employees, but just oversea temp workers.

187
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,116
If we do it for everyone,

188
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,668
the company will suddenly suffer a major burden.

189
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,755
Isn't it just for overseas temp workers?

190
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,714
What?

191
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:54,523
You're a newbie. What would you know?

192
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,749
- But...
- Don't be so arrogant.

193
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:59,625
Finish the report on time.

194
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,158
I sincerely apologize.

195
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,672
The new employee must have been mistaken.

196
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,313
That's fine.

197
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:09,475
But I see.

198
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,773
I knew it'd be strange of you to make a mistake.

199
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,947
Bye, then.

200
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,883
What's wrong, Ishihara-san?

201
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,762
I was wondering if the business cards are ready.

202
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:36,430
I'll meet a new customer in the afternoon.

203
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,845
Oh, I think they're here. One second.

204
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,217
Takizawa!

205
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,346
What the hell are you doing?

206
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:54,330
How dare you change up the report?

207
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,256
I did it as you said yesterday.

208
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,440
I told you the paid days off were not for all employees.

209
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,929
Only for oversea temp workers.

210
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:08,133
The president criticized me because of it.

211
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:12,811
Are you listening, Takizawa?

212
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,510
So annoying.

213
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:23,420
I was in the meeting room,

214
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,650
listening to you two talk.

215
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,309
The paid days off, right?

216
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:34,483
Can you leave us alone, Mr. Designer?

217
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:35,783
Oh, right.

218
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:39,264
I'm just a designer.

219
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,486
When a deadline comes up,

220
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:45,248
I have to keep my hands on my pen.

221
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,973
So, during meetings,

222
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,756
I like to rest my hands.

223
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,744
What's your point?

224
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,150
This is what I use.

225
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:02,120
Um, Director Sanada,

226
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,824
an increase for everyone's paid days off?

227
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,243
Yes, why?

228
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:11,397
Well, if we do it for everyone,

229
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,916
the company will suddenly suffer a major burden.

230
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,949
Isn't it just for oversea temp workers?

231
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,904
What?

232
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,934
You're a newbie. What would you know?

233
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,677
- But...
- Don't be so arrogant.

234
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,835
Drink this.

235
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,128
Thanks.

236
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,875
Forget about him.

237
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,124
He's a repeat offender.

238
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:59,878
He blames others and takes all the credit.

239
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,246
Even though ads are a team effort.

240
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,504
What is he thinking?

241
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:08,431
Sorry for bothering you.

242
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,472
It's fine.

243
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,782
Oh, do you know about the fireworks today?

244
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:22,682
What?

245
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:25,704
This is a secret spot.

246
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,041
Let's eat dinner after work.

247
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,791
Let's meet here at seven.

248
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,521
Oh, and bring ice cream.

249
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,766
Okay.

250
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,539
Finally.

251
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,247
Finally, I'm with Ren.

252
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,312
Just the two of us.

253
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:26,869
I told you it was a secret.

254
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,394
- You shouldn't do that.
- You shouldn't.

255
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,516
Or not, obviously.

256
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,653
Open it up already.

257
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:33,647
There he is.

258
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:37,007
- Oh, good work today!
- Hey, Takizawa!

259
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,748
Oh, here.

260
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,816
You brought it.

261
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,479
Thanks.

262
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:51,891
Oh, so pretty!

263
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,665
That's so pretty.

264
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:56,678
- It's so close to us.
- No way, right?

265
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:50,782
They got tired pretty fast.

266
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,952
They've had a lot of tough work lately.

267
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:58,128
Let's wake them up in 30 minutes.

268
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:59,628
Sure.

269
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:06,070
Oh crap, it melted. What a waste.

270
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,477
- Don't eat that.
- I want to.

271
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,377
It's fine.

272
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,875
I'll buy some more.

273
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,820
I'll buy more,

274
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,990
so let's meet just the two of us.

275
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,148
Aw, come on.

276
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:36,227
Damn, I can really feel the alcohol.

277
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,304
Ren, um...

278
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,478
This feels nice.

279
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:09,697
Yeah.

280
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,733
Just like back then.

281
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,398
That's right.

282
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,488
I...

283
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:02,404
Even now, I still...

284
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,380
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

285
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,750
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

286
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,120
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

287
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,580
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

288
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,780
♫ If I were able to say this ♫

289
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,960
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

290
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,460
♫ Oh, one day ♫

291
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:46,291
[Preview]
Cheers!

292
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,437
I think it's better to keep this relationship a secret.

293
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:50,104
Stop getting weird ideas.

294
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:51,941
Let's just talk it out.

295
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:55,891
Why'd you disappear ten years ago?

296
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:59,938
If you act so nice, I'll take it the wrong way.
