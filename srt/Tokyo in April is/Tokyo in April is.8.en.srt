00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,200
I wanted a peaceful romance.

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,685
I like you,

00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,016
Kazuma.

4
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,426
Since I met you,

5
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:33,189
you were my whole world.

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,850

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,380

♫ I can't be honest today ♫

00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,900
♫ I love you a million times, ten billion times ♫

[Tokyo in April is...]

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,881
Is this the thanks I get for keeping my mouth shut?

18
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:31,090
I'm going to treat you well tonight.

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,459
Be grateful.

20
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,970
What?

21
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:43,197
Director Sanada, what are you doing to Ren?

22
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,415
Don't you know?

23
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:52,746
He'll spread his legs for anyone, even if it's for a man.

24
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,928
He says he doesn't want it.

25
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:57,842
But it's just an act.

26
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:01,461
We were going to have some fun. Is that so bad?

27
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,101
Shut up!

28
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:07,493
A genius designer? Don't mess with me.

29
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:16,476
You're too scared to actually hit me. You're a coward.

30
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,696
Here, go ahead. Do it!

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,111
Ren, are you fin—

32
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:13,558
Director Sanada, what are you doing to Ren?

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,291
Don't you know?

34
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:22,602
He'll spread his legs for anyone, even if it's for a man.

35
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,867
- He says he doesn't want it...
- I dare you.

36
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:32,945
Do you know what will happen to your place in this company?

37
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,286
I'll never forgive you.

38
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,782
Ren!

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,999
When he transferred to my school, everyone was surprised.

40
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:13,585
We couldn't believe his parents would send him abroad when he can't speak any French.

41
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:19,492
I was the one who taught him French.

42
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:23,762
He couldn't even ride a train.

43
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,043
Do you know what that means?

44
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,975
His parents punished him

45
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,804
by disposing of him in a place where he doesn't know the language.

46
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,415
Ren!

47
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,208
Wait!

48
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,942
Ren!

49
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:57,765
Go away!

50
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,702
Come any closer...

51
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:07,873
and I'll die!

52
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,598
What would you want to do if you were dating someone?

53
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,189
Answer me.

54

00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,006
I'm sorry I left you alone.

58
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,938
You shouldered everything.

59
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:02,609
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

60
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,438
But...

61
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,459
I'll protect you from now on.

62
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:19,467

I promise to make you happy.

65

I don't...

66
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,533
want to be apart from you anymore.

69
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:49,969
Oh, you didn't give this to him yet?

70
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,741
Is Kazuma-kun still not answering his phone?

71
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,243
I couldn't call him.

72
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:05,250
I'm not sure how to tell him about Saotome-kun.

73
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:11,450
A decade ago, Saotome-kun cut his wrists

74
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,800
and was sent to the hospital.

75
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,429
I was at the hospital, too.

76
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,435
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,746
I'm sorry I like you.

78
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,874
Kazuma.

79
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,955
Please, don't die.

80
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:41,120
I got angry and wanted to chase him out.

81
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,359
I like you, Kazuma.

82
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,906
But I couldn't move.

83
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:52,564
I felt like, if it's him, Kazuma would respond.

84
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,410
But I was also scared.

85
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,082
Their feelings were too serious.

86
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,225
The next morning, a miracle happened.

87
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:34,955
Kazuma? Kazuma.

88
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,963
Where's Ren?

89
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,576
Where is he?

90
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:56,562
That's why I forced Kazuma to go to the U.S.

91
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,899
So that he'd never see Saotome-kun again.

92
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,741
If those two meet again,

93
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,152
nothing will ever separate them.

94
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:22,421
I've never had such a strong love.

95
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:51,177
Good morning.

It's Saturday, and we left the police office late last night.

100
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:20,159
No, I'm waking up.

101
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,414
I want to wash up.

102
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:41,466
Don't stare at me.

103
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,434
I look awful.

He'll spread his legs for anyone, even if it's for a man.

He says he doesn't want it.

117
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,949
But it's just an act.

118
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,726
We were going to have some fun.

119
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:43,088
Do you want this to go public?

120
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:48,126
We're victims.

121
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,181
In addition to us,

122
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,919
twelve other people in the past ten years have been sexually assaulted by him.

123
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,719
But...

124
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:04,342
isn't it better for you, too, to forget this ever happened?

125
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,600
If people misunderstand and think you like guys, it'll affect you, too.

126
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:21,638
I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm gay,

127
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:25,731
nor do I think it's a sin.

No can do.

136
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,885

You definitely can't, Maeda-san.

That's how our life as co-workers ended.

147
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:29,928
There have been many changes since then.

148

You brat.

That's what you've come to say after years of silence?

00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,599
You two are mistaken.

00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:12,976
Back then,

00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:16,048
I wasn't mad because you were two guys.

158

You two were underage.

159
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:21,413
You did something irresponsible behind our backs.

00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,306

We'll be in contact.

165
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:53,085
Kazuma and I will come visit.

You love Kazuma, don't you?

00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,761
You better call, too.

Even if you don't tell his father, he'll hear of it eventually.

170

Even something that seems impossible

171
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,345

184
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,375
- Ah, I don't know.
- Well...

185
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,874
Can I hang up now?

186
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:41,123
Former HR Director Sanada-sama, who worked at an ad agency,
[Suspect: Sanada Hayato (40), 12 cases of sexual assault against female employees in the last 10 years]

187
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:45,500
for the past decade, used sleeping drugs and alcohol

188
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,160
on a dozen female employees

189
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,541
in order to sexually assault them.

190
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:54,766
He has been arrested under suspicions of forcing sexual acts on them.

191
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,136
Police investigations on Sanada...

192
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:08,713
There's a showing in the afternoon.

193
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,511
I see.

194
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:15,353
Starting a business isn't easy, huh?

195
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,988
Are you tired?

196
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,465
You're so warm.

197
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:32,604
Kazuma, you're always like the sun.

198
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:37,314
You don't lie or hide anything.

199
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,511
You're always honest.

200
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,481
Every time you touch me,

201
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:47,572
your warmth spreads to me too.

202
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:54,998
I'm able to be myself because of you.

203
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:07,443
One day...

204
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,975
I might end up holding you back.

205
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,876
Honestly...

206
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,515
Thinking of your career,

207
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:24,492
you should be at a big company, rather than starting a company with me.

208
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:29,227
And one day,

209
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:32,215
we'll get married and have children.

210
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,715
Ren.

211
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:50,041
When we were apart...

212
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,952
How do I put this?

213
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:59,457
It felt like I was drifting away at sea.

214
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:06,524
But I was able to stay strong when I thought of you.

215
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:13,204
I knew for sure where to go next.

216
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,879
You guided me here, Ren.

217
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:28,052
You're more like the sun than me.

218
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:46,638
That's why I won't let you go anymore.

219
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,949
I won't let you out of my sight.

220
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,817
You're my everything.

221
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,552
You're my life.

222
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,723
You're my Tokyo in April.

223
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,110
Tokyo is

224
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:18,303
a nostalgic place for me.

225
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:29,645
And now...

226
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:37,622
everything that matters to me is right here.

227
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,358
Why are you grinning?

228
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,768
I just remembered the first time I met you.

229
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:47,970
What did you think of me?

230
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,490
Well, let me think.

231
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,962
You were shining.

232
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,695
What?

233
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:01,445
Oh, you surprised me when you suddenly called me to the roof.

234
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,210
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

235
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:13,580
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

236
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,940
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

237
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,390
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

238
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,630
♫ If I were able to say this ♫

239
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,790
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

240
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:42,260
♫ Oh, one day ♫
