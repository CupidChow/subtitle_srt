00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:17,381
Why was Ren the only one that felt so special to me?

2
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:26,374
How was he different

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,628
from other people?

4
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,894
I don't know.

5
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,235
But...

6
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,680
in my life until now...

7
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:54,186
I cherished no one as much as I cherished Ren.

8
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,667
That was an undeniable truth.

9
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:14,740

22
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,595
The contract worker.

00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:28,281
I'll be back by dinner.

27
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,131
Really?

28
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,119
Then I'll wait at your place tonight.

29
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,522

30
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:41,505
That shirt

31
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,942
doesn't suit you.

32
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,240
Tell me one thing.

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,178
Was Ishihara the one who reported me to an outside agency?

34
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:03,048
That guy... Where is he now?

35
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,536
You're so creepy.

36
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,890
This is none of your business.

37
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,580
Oh, it's not?

38
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,882
You're freeloading off me.

40
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:05,911
Jeez. Your call came out of nowhere.

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,369
I got worried and brought you home, but...

42
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:10,869

is confirmation on this color draft.

47

48

49
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:53,286
Hey.

50
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,895
You get so stupid when it's about that guy.

51
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,301
I forgot.

52
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:06,305
That's for what you did at the awards ceremony.

53
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,443
You damned brat.

54
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,530
When you did that...

55
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:19,683
I thought Kazuma got the wrong idea

56
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:23,155
that I'd sleep with anyone.

57
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,744
If he threw me away,

58
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:35,300
I'd die.

59
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,160
You...

60
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,409
I know that this isn't right.

61
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:49,915
That's why I'm going to finish things.

62
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:00,392
Shouldn't you tell him?

63
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:05,925
It's fine.

64
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:10,804
He's good-natured to a fault.

65
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,273
What I did...

66
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,404
What I'm about to do...

67
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,560
He wouldn't let it happen.

68
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,152
I can't do that.

69
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:32,558
I can't get him involved with my life.

70
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,302
You idiot.

71
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:46,806
Don't talk big when you're running away.

72
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,822
Ren's disappearance

73
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:11,096
made me realize something.

74
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,568
Oh, long time no see.

75
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,792
I didn't know

76
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:21,373
anything about Ren.

77
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,244
Please don't see him anymore.

78
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:29,081
If you act nice, I might misunderstand you.

79

You were right there...

81
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,490
But I couldn't break through when it mattered.

82
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:41,890
It's only natural

83
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,197
you couldn't depend on me.

84
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:50,013
That's why...

86

87

88
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,825
I'll...

89
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,080
You took your sweet time.

90
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,380
I heard that you took over the color draft

91

92
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:01,286

93

Please tell me where Ren is!

94

95

97
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,235
Nothing.

98
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:39,511

99

101
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:50,656

102
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,158
Great from behind too, right?

- You're lying.

107
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,643
You don't know anything about him, do you?

108
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,686
Oh, right.

109
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:26,225
If you tease him a bit and pound him hard, he really feels that.

110
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,066
Try it.

111
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,396

112

117
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,878

everyone was surprised.

157
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:17,743

Do you know what that means?

161

188
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,218
It was popular in the U.S.

189
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:08,353
Are you making the ad?

190
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,557
Yeah. Have you been there?

191
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,850
Yeah.

192
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,292
I had it every day in high school.

193
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,394
It seems like fast food,

194
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,923
but it's handmade, and the burger is pretty thick.

195
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,573
Wow.

196
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:25,403
I'd make bets with friends to see who could eat the most.

197
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,171
What?

198
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:33,912
No, I just thought it sounds fun.

199
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,221
What about you?

200
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:44,974
What?

201
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,259
How was your life in France?

202
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,865
It was fine.

203
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:53,765
I'm sure it was great.

204
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,034
How did you live?

205
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,808
- Whoa, doesn't this look good?
- What?

206
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,947
The one with potato, bacon, and cheese.

207
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,849
This one's good too.

208
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,019
I could make it at home.

209
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,933
Where is Ren now?

210
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,915
He's packing up his things at the office.

211
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,257
One more thing.

212
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:56,494
He couldn't have sex.

213
00:19:56,494 --> 00:20:00,098
He tried with me too, but we always failed.

214
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,567
He'd hyperventilate.

215
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:10,208
If he's able to connect with someone...

216
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,895
that means

217
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:16,429
that person is the one he chose in his heart.

218
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,489
Director Sanada.

219
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,648
Were you drinking?

220
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:54,018
It must be hard working this late.

221
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:00,291
Well then, goodbye.

222
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,090
Did you want to keep it a secret?

223
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,540
I saw you several years ago.

224
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,503
You were in front of a gay bar in Nichome

225
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:19,210
with that designer, Yagami.

226
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,523
Is this the thanks I get for keeping my mouth shut?

227
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,764
I'm going to treat you well tonight.

228
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,130
Be grateful.

229
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:49,307
I wanted a peaceful romance.

230
00:21:56,156 --> 00:22:00,267
A quiet, intimate time.

231
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,091
The warm sun's light.

232
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:16,534
And you.

233
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,669
That's the life

234
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,695
I wanted to live.

235
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,895
I like you,

236
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,355
Kazuma.

237
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:56,474
Since I met you,

238
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:01,045
you were my whole world.

239
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,620
♫ The sound of heavy rainfall is getting louder ♫

240
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,990
♫ It suddenly started to rain ♫

241
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:20,420
♫ Seems like it won't stop until morning ♫

242
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:26,750
♫ Come to me tonight if it's like this ♫

243

♫ If I were able to say this ♫

244
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,310
♫ I would have just nodded at you shyly one day in midsummer ♫

♫ Oh, one day ♫

[Preview]
I like you.

247
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,716
Do you know what will happen to your place in this company?

248
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:52,715
Even something that seems impossible

249
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:54,727
can work out

250
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:57,135
if you face it with courage.

251
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,005
You guided me here, Ren.
