5
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,370
The wine-stained shirt.

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,700
I painted it.

7
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,970
I hope you like it.

8
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,570
What the hell’s on your shirt?

9
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,850
It’s fashion. It’s a wine-stained shirt.

10
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,800
Mr. Koh.

11
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,400
I’m afraid this is the best I could do
to wash the wine stain.

12
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,670
I’m beginning to like this bar.

13
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,990
Do my friends come here often?

14
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,650
Jira, you mean?

15
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,770
He just started frequenting the place.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,900
And Pheem?

17
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,350
Forget him.

18
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,700
But I never ignored his calls.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,800
Maybe this is important.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,930
Try it.

21
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,000
There’s a first time for everything.

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,370
Are you… alright?

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,270
Give me a minute.

24
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,010
I think this is too soon.

25
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Yeah.

26
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,550
I understand.

27
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,900
Maybe we’re really going too fast,
like you said.

28
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,300
I’ll go home.

29
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,900
I’ll let you rest.

30
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,550
Alright?

31
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,730
Pheem.

32
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,150
I’m sorry.

33
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,550
Pheem, I’m off.

34
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,870
Okay.

35
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,400
I’ll see you again.

36
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,370
See you.

37
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:40,970
What?

38
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,970
How come you took her home?

39
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,530
Don’t tell me
you couldn’t get the job done.

40
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,630
Well, I got it done
with this one, didn’t I?

41
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, you loser.

42
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,750
Just admit that you’re a loser, my dude.

43
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,460
Why don’t you just get out my face, jerk?

44
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,460
This bugs me, you know?

45
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,940
Alright.

46
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,550
I’ll take this seriously, too.

47
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,800
Think about it.

48
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,600
I stalk his social media every day.

49
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,640
I listen to the 2000’s music he likes.

50
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,180
I looked up art movements for hours
just to be able to talk to him.

51
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,350
I recently saw his post on Miró,

52
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,860
so I went and looked up Miró’s art that
I thought both he and I would like…

53
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,940
and got it tattooed!

54
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,270
Why isn’t it working?

55
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,670
I think you’re trying too hard.

56
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,970
Maybe that’s why it doesn’t feel natural—

57
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,700
Crap. Not natural, my ass.

58
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,100
The more obsessed I am with him,

59
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,070
the more interested I am about him.

60
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,570
You and I are overly logical.

61
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,150
Our job in tech just made us that way.

62
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,400
But he’s an artist.

63
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,630
He leads his life with his emotions,

64
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,700
and mind you, I was the one
who told him he should do that.

65
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,050
But imagine that

66
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,630
someone who’s emotional
and follows his whims

67
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,850
will always find a way to go.

68
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
It makes me think about myself.

69
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,450
Maybe I do have that chronic
Stockholm syndrome or whatever you said,

70
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,150
but I feel like I’ll heal from that…

71
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,950
because of him.

72
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,200
Alright, man.

73
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you think you can get past Koh, then?

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,210
KOH

75
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,490
Hello.

76
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
Why didn’t you pick up the phone
last night?

77
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,430
I was busy with some family stuff.

78
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,970
At 10?

79
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,170
Give me the truth.

80
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,270
Okay, jerk.

81
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,840
The truth is…

82
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,350
I was hooking up with a girl.

83
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,750
That’s it.

84
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,450
Yeah?

85
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,240
Do I know her?

86
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,200
Like, you don’t need to know
everything about me, man.

87
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, what were you calling me about?

88
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,370
We got the agreement for
our merger with Thames.

89
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,220
I need you to sign it.

90
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,750
I told the butler.

91
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,549
(He’ll let you into my place.)

92
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,100
You’re not home?

93
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,030
No.

94
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,400
Where you at?

95
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,000
You don’t need to know
everything about me.

96
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,080
Bastard.

97
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,929
(Just sign the papers.)

98
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,400
(I’ll probably be home
by the time you’re there.)

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,980
When you drew this,

100
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,350
did you enjoy it?

101
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,030
Yes.

102
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,400
But not as much as I did the last one.

103
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,250
When painting,

104
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
you need to connect with the model.

105
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,300
How did you connect with him?

106
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,450
What were you talking about
when you drew him?

107
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,150
He wasn’t with me in the moment.

108
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,110
It just felt like we were flirting.

109
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,230
I was very happy…

110
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,100
So happy I didn’t want to work.

111
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,600
I guess he really likes you.

112
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,600
Maybe he’s not used to this?

113
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,550
Taking him to art galleries
and admiring art?

114
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,500
You know you’re not inspired by
such beautiful things.

115
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,150
Someone like you is inspired by
something awful, a lowlife.

116
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,980
Someone bad and evil,

117
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,110
like Koh.

118
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,150
He’s exactly that.

119
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,560
I just can’t figure out what I need to do.

120
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,700
What to do…

121
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,850
Didn’t you say he likes smashing things?

122
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Rage room?

123
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,450
Yeah, that.

124
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,670
Maybe you like that better,
the ‘tough love,’

125
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,870
like Koh’s.

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,010
I don’t like him.

127
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,800
Stop bringing up his name.

128
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,750
I’d be spooked to see him again.

129
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,760
Whatever.

130
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,450
KOH

131
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,200
Hell is calling.

132
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,730
Take it.

133
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,250
Give me a minute.

134
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,150
I didn’t answer his call last night.

135
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,200
Okay. I’ll answer the phone.

136
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,400
But you need to be my alibi,
since he’s definitely going to ask,

137
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,000
and say I was with you last night.

138
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,060
Hmm.

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,900
Explain yourself.

140
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,850
About what?

141
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,370
Why didn’t you answer your phone
last night?

142
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,600
I stayed over at my friend’s place
last night.

143
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,100
I didn’t want to be on the phone
and bother her.

144
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,800
I’m still with her, actually.

145
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,100
You can ask her if you don’t believe me.

146
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,400
He’s right.

147
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,300
Jira was with me last night.

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,700
Hello?

149
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,010
Can you hear me?

150
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,450
He’s not saying anything.

151
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey.

152
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,500
Do not hand your phone over to
someone else when you’re talking to me.

153
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,170
I’ll deduct your salary.

154
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,700
Sorry.

155
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,170
I thought you wouldn’t believe me.

156
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,410
Why are you calling me?

157
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,200
We’ll see each other soon.

158
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,130
Come sooner.

159
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,900
I have a surprise for you.

160
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,380
What kind of surprise?

161
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,080
Ugh, damn it! I’ve had enough!

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,650
One bouquet of tulips, please.

163
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,200
What color?

164
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,200
Red.

165
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,770
How would you like them wrapped?

166
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,970
Whatever is fine.

167
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,910
It’ll help me decide if you let me know
who is receiving it.

168
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Let’s just say,

169
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,800
once he receives it,
he’ll definitely fall in love with me.

170
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,800
Of course.

171
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,650
Hey.

172
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,800
You didn’t get enough sleep or something?

173
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,500
None of your business.

174
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Who gave you that?

175
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,250
I bought it myself.

176
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,450
You did?

177
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,650
When are you ever into flowers?

178
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,600
I am now.

179
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,380
Here.

180
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,250
All signed.

181
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,330
MR. JIRA IS HERE.

182
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,950
My next appointment is here.

183
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,450
You have an appointment with Koh?

184
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,400
He called all of a sudden.

185
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,330
You?

186
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,300
I just wrapped things up with him.

187
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,800
I’m heading back to the office.

188
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,550
Good luck.

189
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,090
You too.

190
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,270
Pheem.

191
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,800
Yes?

192
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,120
Are we…

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,100
Are you okay about last night?

194
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,170
To be honest,

195
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,500
I was kinda disappointed.

196
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,910
But I’m more worried about

197
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,980
how you feel about me.

198
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,070
I still feel the same way about you.

199
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,800
But it’s because I’m serious about this

200
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,030
that I want to get to know you better.

201
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,910
Don’t we know each other well enough?

202
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,430
I’ve only seen your good side.

203
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,550
I want to see all of you.

204
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,800
And if you saw all of me and
you don’t like it?

205
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,800
Hey.

206
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
Be confident.

207
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,150
You’re not an easy person to turn down.

208
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,700
You did.

209
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,960
I never turned you down.

210
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
I just want some time.

211
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,890
I don’t want us to have just
some easy casual sex.

212
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,750
I wouldn't mind easy.

213
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,150
I want to draw you after work today.

214
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,350
Of course.

215
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
I’ll make some space for you at home.

216
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,750
Just drawing, though.

217
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,800
Nothing else.

218
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,500
Okay.

219
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,650
I get it.

220
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,540
I won’t insist.

221
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,700
I’ve learned my lesson.

222
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,770
See you, then.

223
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,870
Umm.

224
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,900
Trying to impress your employee?

225
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,300
Yes.

226
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,850
You don’t like it?

227
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,170
I do.

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,130
Still not my favorite.

229
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,530
You’re hard to impress, huh?

230
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,700
Hey.

231
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
How about this?

232
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,880
I have a game.

233
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,700
I’ll guess your favorite flower.

234
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,980
If I get it right,
you have to work overtime.

235
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,600
If I get it wrong,

236
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,300
I’ll pay you double of what we agreed on.

237
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
What are you thinking?

238
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,150
What got you interested in this game?

239
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,500
So I can appreciate your art better.

240
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,700
Go ahead.

241
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,700
The tulips are still worth something,

242
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,600
so keep them.

243
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,700
What does that mean?

244
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,130
Long ago,

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,850
the price of tulips was so jacked up
in Europe,

246
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,550
just like in Thailand
at one point with monstera,

247
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,700
that they ended up being too overpriced.

248
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,630
In the end, they were worth nothing.

249
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,500
Of course, there’s nothing but money
in your head, like a straight guy.

250
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,599
What do you actually want to say?

251
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,050
Nothing.

252
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,500
I’m just saying…

253
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,609
Don’t be like tulips.

254
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,369
Jacking up your price
until it’s unrealistic.

255
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,569
When the bubble bursts,

256
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,300
you’ll be worth nothing.

257
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,200
What a nice advice,

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
but I don’t need it.

259
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,130
Might as well just insult me.

260
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,000
The clothes are in the bathroom.

261
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,500
Go get changed.

262
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,360
I’ll be there today.

263
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,650
Tell them I’m from Memento Couture.

264
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:52,870
Hey!

265
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,040
You’re attending a meeting

266
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,700
on the government grants
for fashion soft power at THACCA.

267
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,700
That serious?

268
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,970
We’re attending it as the representative
For Memento Couture.

269
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,450
You own Memento?

270
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes.

271
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,450
It’s my nominee.

272
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,050
You don’t have to worry about that.

273
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,170
Your job is to do whatever it takes

274
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,250
to prevent Thames from
receiving this grant.

275
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,400
Let’s go.

276
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,250
I’ll let you off here.

277
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,250
I’ll pick you up after work.

278
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,870
You’re just gonna leave me here?

279
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,850
Where are you going?

280
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,350
I’m going to take a guess.

281
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,550
What are you saying?

282
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,900
Just stay with me.

283
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,800
I’ll be talking to you.

284
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,300
Go.

285
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,400
It’s almost time.

286
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,210
Are you inside?

287
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,450
How is it?

288
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,100
I’m so scared I might pee my pants.

289
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,400
I see Thames.

290
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,250
He’s walking toward me.

291
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,300
Hello.

292
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,750
Hello, Mr. K.

293
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,770
I need your help today.

294
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,700
It’d be my pleasure.

295
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,410
For my Young Designer project,

296
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,530
(I think if Hive could share some
experience in e-commerce with us,)

297
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,440
it would draw a lot of attention
from the youth.

298
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,700
Of course.

299
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,200
(Don’t talk to him too much.)

300
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,500
Remember.

301
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,300
We’re not here to win him over
like last time.

302
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,250
The thing is

303
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,920
I’ve learned that someone from a certain
company will also attend the meeting.

304
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,300
I know for a fact that
this company’s just restructured…

305
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,060
They overhealed their entire
management team.

306
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,900
They’ll likely vote against me to make sure
I don’t get this government grant.

307
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,300
What’s the name of this company?

308
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,120
Memento.

309
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,250
Hello.

310
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,450
The meeting room is now ready.

311
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,360
This way, please.

312
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,600
What kind of flowers would you like today?

313
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,270
Do you happen to know
what the flower in this painting is?

314
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,800
It looks like either a narcissus,

315
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,540
or iris.

316
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,700
I can’t be sure.

317
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,350
I’d like both.

318
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
One bouquet of each.

319
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,970
Of course.

320
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,100
What does narcissus mean?

321
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,400
(The myth of narcissus
tells a story of Narcissus,)

322
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,900
(a beautiful man who falls in love
with his own beauty.)

323
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,250
(One day, he sees his reflection
in the water,)

324
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,600
(and falls so deeply in love that
he cannot take his gaze away.)

325
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,100
(In the end, he dies
because of his own vanity,)

326
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,810
(and turns into the flower
we know as narcissus today.)

327
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,800
What about iris?

328
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,650
(Iris, in Greek mythology,)

329
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,850
(means hope, rainbows, and communication.)

330
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,380
(In art, it is typically connected
with an artist’s inner feelings.)

331
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,810
Memento Couture’s seat
is over there, Mr. K.

332
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,340
Hello, all.

333
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,950
The main agenda today is the grant
for the Young Designer program,

334
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,700
requested by Library.

335
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,770
You’ll be one of the committees.

336
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,850
You have one job:

337
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,300
Tell this story in a way that sounds
as realistic as possible.

338
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,200
This program is called
‘Revitalizing Fashion.’

339
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,450
Letting young designers revive and design

340
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,980
is the heart of this project.

341
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,300
As a former young designer myself,

342
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,970
I believe that the fashion industry is
in the hands of the young people of today.

343
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,150
What’s wrong?

344
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,650
Get in the car.

345
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,170
This is getting too much.

346
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,900
You can’t ask me to lie in front of
the committees like that.

347
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,670
I won’t do it.

348
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,100
Whether or not it’s a lie or a truth
depends on where you’re looking at it.

349
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,650
As long as you convince
the majority of people, it’s all good.

350
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,280
Even I am not convinced.

351
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,650
How can I convince anyone else?

352
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,350
I do like the concept,

353
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,700
but Mr. Thames, I must ask,

354
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,500
this budget for a seminar in France…

355
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,000
Is it necessary?

356
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,980
The budget you’re requesting is,
by no means, small.

357
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,900
When I was making a name for myself,

358
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,520
the chance to witness the world fashion
with my own eyes

359
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,900
was one of the key events
that helped me in my career.

360
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,980
It made me aware of the world stage.

361
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,500
I want young designers
to experience it, too.

362
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
What do I need to do for you
to be more confident?

363
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,050
Do I need to say some vile things,

364
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,800
a personal attack on your self-worth,
like I did when we first met?

365
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,950
No need for such lowly behavior.

366
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,230
Just tell me if he really doesn’t want
to support young designers.

367
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,650
I’ll understand.

368
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,970
Does anyone else in the committee
have any more questions?

369
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Turn on the mic

370
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,770
and repeat after me.

371
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,600
As a representative for Memento Couture,

372
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,650
everyone in this committee,
no matter from what industry,

373
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,850
doesn’t deserve this grant.

374
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,530
…doesn’t deserve this grant.

375
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,070
(Because there is a conflict of interest.)

376
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,000
Because there is a conflict of interest.

377
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,140
(This is the first reason.)

378
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,220
This is the first reason.

379
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,450
(If that reason alone isn’t
strong enough,)

380
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,710
(there are two more points
I would like to add.)

381
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,400
If the first reason isn’t strong enough,

382
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,550
allow me to clarify with two more points.

383
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,090
-(According to the name of the project…)
-According to the name of the project…

384
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,390
The objective for this grant is
to aid young designers…

385
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,320
But from what Mr. Thames has said

386
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,330
-(...about his budget resolution plan,)
-...about his budget resolution plan,

387
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,610
-(we can see that the money)
-we can see that the money

388
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,900
-(is going to Library’s subsidiary.)
-is going to Library’s subsidiary.

389
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,500
I completely disagree.

390
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,930
I very much disagree.

391
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,090
I believe…

392
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,590
I do believe…

393
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,400
We need to support a newcomer brand
trying to venture into this industry.

394
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,850
Instead of helping out a brand
that’s simply trying to reposition itself.

395
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,550
The whole industry knows Mr. Thames
does not support young designers.

396
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,900
He has also claimed
young designers’ work as his own.

397
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,250
(If you all…)

398
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,200
If you all…

399
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,050
…still want to support Library.

400
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,850
…still believe that Library deserves this grant,

401
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,600
(Memento Couture would like to step down
from our role in the committee.)

402
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,070
Memento Couture would like to step down
from our role in the committee.

403
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,970
(That is all.)

404
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,050
That’s all.

405
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,260
(Turn off the mic.)

406
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,550
(Don’t answer any more questions.)

407
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,970
Alright. Hop in.

408
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,050
I know you’re tensed up,

409
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,500
but you did the right thing.

410
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,350
You saved our nation’s budget from being
exploited by someone for their own gain.

411
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,970
Yet you benefit from this.

412
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,970
And?

413
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,700
Are you still stressed out?

414
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,250
I have something to make you feel better.

415
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,250
Here.

416
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,500
Are you impressed now?

417
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,300
The narcissus are beautiful.

418
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,970
But it’s still not my favorite.

419
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,250
Hang on a minute.

420
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,950
This is iris.

421
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,700
Do you like it?

422
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,550
I won.

423
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,750
You have to work overtime.

424
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,300
Draw me today.

425
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,120
Can we do this some other time?

426
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,900
I’ll let you keep the overtime pay.

427
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,300
I have something to go to today.

428
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,000
What is it?

429
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Is it important?

430
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,350
Tell me.

431
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,250
I’ll decide.

432
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,400
I have an appointment with a friend.

433
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,180
Who?

434
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,700
Ing.

435
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,850
That woman?

436
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,000
I’ll talk to her.

437
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,000
Call her.

438
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,120
No, no.

439
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,000
I’ll talk to her.

440
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,300
Yes, Mr. Koh?

441
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,550
Hello.

442
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,460
(Hello.)

443
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,800
What are you doing?

444
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,440
Cleaning up the place.

445
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,350
It’s damn tiring.

446
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,800
If you do it all at once,
of course it will be tiring.

447
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,900
When will you be here?

448
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,950
I’m still busy with work.

449
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
I may need to take a rain check today.

450
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,350
Oh? Really?

451
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,980
Are you mad at me?

452
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,050
Of course not.

453
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,250
I got to clean up, after all, didn’t I?

454
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,240
I’ll hang up now.

455
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,200
I have to go.

456
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,200
Umm.

457
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,050
Hey.

458
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,300
Just let me know when you need me gone.

459
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:44,950
No need.

460
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,170
He’s not coming.

461
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,550
What?

462
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,050
No way.

463
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,920
He ditched you again?

464
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,370
It’s okay, bud.

465
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
I’ll be your drinking buddy.

466
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,470
I don’t feel like it.

467
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,360
Go.

468
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,480
Go back to your room.

469
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,600
Fine.

470
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,850
Hello.

471
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,400
Hey.

472
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,350
You busy?

473
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,900
It would be best if you try not to move
anything in this room.

474
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,980
What got into you?

475
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,250
I knew you’d be stressed by that meeting,

476
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,570
so I thought this might inspire you.

477
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,900
Are you ready to draw now?

478
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,350
I can get into it.

479
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,300
Do you like it?

480
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,070
The flowers are beautiful,

481
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,530
but your room is still a mess.

482
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,730
I’m asking if you like it.

483
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,170
I do.

484
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,770
I do like the stark contrast.

485
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,050
How do you mean?

486
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,450
In art,

487
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,320
flowers are never just flowers.

488
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,700
Georgia O’Keeffe drew an iris
to resemble a woman’s vagina.

489
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,980
Van Gogh drew it to feel better.

490
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,800
Well…

491
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,800
Can you draw me with the iris?

492
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,930
Maybe I’ll feel better, too.

493
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,660
I’m no Van Gogh.

494
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,150
I draw my own kind of iris.

495
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,650
Just be at ease.

496
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,370
Do whatever you want.

497
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,950
I’ll think about what to draw.

498
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,699
Are you gonna lay down
for my drawing again?

499
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,150
It’s repetitive…

500
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,050
I can’t get in the mood.

501
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,330
What can I do to get you
in the mood, then?

502
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,730
Come closer.

503
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,270
Did that help?

504
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,980
I got it.

505
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,370
I have an appointment with Koh.

506
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,850
A moment, please.

507
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,330
It’s beautiful.

508
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,550
What?

509
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,800
You among the flowers.

510
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,000
Show me.

511
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,470
I told you I don’t like showing
the sketch.

512
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,960
Stop dawdling.

513
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,900
If I showed you,

514
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,660
I’d be executed.

515
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,750
Can you speak like a normal person?

516
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,250
It’s from One Thousand and One Nights.

517
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,950
Scheherazade knows not to finish
a tale in one night.

518
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,200
She can’t risk losing the upper hand
and get killed by the mad king.

519
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,300
I’m no king.

520
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,800
Can I see it?

521
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,950
Fine.

522
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,700
You won’t be able to tell
what I’m drawing anyway.

523
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,050
You’re right. I can’t.

524
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,370
You…

525
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,130
You told me to come here.

526
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,500
What do you need me for?

527
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,650
Nothing.

528
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:15,000
I just think there’s way too much
communication where I’m left in the dark.

529
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,300
You really don’t know

530
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,400
that I know about you two?

531
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,950
So you can stop bullshitting me.

532
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,950
He lied to you to be with me.

533
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,750
You lied to me to be with him.

534
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,200
Stop this right now.

535
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,720
If you can’t do it, you can both resign.

536
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,970
You’re so freaking boring.

537
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,600
All these threats…

538
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,500
You think I wouldn’t do it?

539
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,400
You won’t.

540
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,900
I know you well.

541
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,480
Maybe I’m not the same person.

542
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,510
Yeah?

543
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,650
As if someone like you would
abandon your whole department

544
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,300
for something like this.

545
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,600
I quit.

546
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:44,800
Jira.

547
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,170
You don’t have to put up
with a jerk like him.

548
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,970
Come with me.

549
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,370
Jira.

550
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,450
Don’t you forget

551
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,000
I’m the only person who sees
any value in your art.

552
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,860
Jira.

553
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:30,970
Come to me.

554
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,230
I don’t like betrayal.

555
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,700
It’s fucked up!

556
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,450
This is your plan, isn’t it?

557
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,100
Yes.

558
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,030
Do you really think I’m into you?

559
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,600
I’m gonna hop in the shower.

560
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,150
Once I’m done,

561
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,650
you can keep drawing me.

562
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,350
Are you gonna keep drawing?

563
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,650
I can’t get in the mood.

564
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,420
Plum wine?

565
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,170
Maybe it will make you feel better.

566
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,500
Can I just go home?

567
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:47,980
I’ll give you a ride.

568
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,870
No.

569
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,500
I can go home by myself.

570
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,070
If you wish.

571
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,200
I think Pheem is furious with me.

572
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,050
He won’t pick up the phone even now.

573
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,300
This love is strong enough

574
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,370
to make you break through
your psychological cage.

575
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,800
The bad news is…

576
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,300
Will you be able to accept it?

577
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,250
Accept what?

578
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,900
You’re attached to him.

579
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,170
If he doesn’t feel the same way,

580
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,450
your only option is pain.

581
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,250
Are you still mad at me for firing Pheem?

582
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,470
It’s not just about Pheem.

583
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,750
But it’s about how you always
toy with people.

584
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,070
Can you give me a goodnight kiss?

585
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,500
Maybe it will help me sleep.

586
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,770
What an excuse.
