00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,730
Characters, actions, places, occupations,

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,740
and events in this series are fictional and
created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,440
They are not intended to urge

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,800
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,550
Are you okay about last night?

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,020
To be honest, I was kinda disappointed.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,900
I think you’re trying too hard.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,700
Are you gonna lay down
for my drawing again?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,350
It’s repetitive…

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,150
I can’t get in the mood.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,150
What can I do to get you
in the mood, then?

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,650
You told me to come here.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,650
What do you need me for?

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,100
You can stop bullshitting me.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,530
Stop this right now.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,850
If you can’t do it, you can both resign.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,070
I quit.

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,720
This is your plan, isn’t it?

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,450
Yes.

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,020
Do you really think I’m into you?

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,160
(Yes, Mr. Koh?)

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Jira is on his way down.

23
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,500
I must ask you
to hail him a cab, Mr. Butler.

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,650
(Of course, sir.)

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,050
Mr. Jira.

26
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,010
Mr. Koh has asked me
to secure you a ride home.

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,850
Please, wait a moment.

28
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,300
I’d rather not impose.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,150
Mr. Jira.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
If you don’t get in the car I get you,
I’ll be in trouble.

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,850
Okay.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,100
Fine.

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,570
I’ll wait right here.

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,900
Thank you.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,100
Thank you.

36
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,300
He’s been calling.

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,600
Why aren’t you picking up?

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,450
And I won’t.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,100
You’re always my problem
when you’re drunk, huh?

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,700
What?

41
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,070
I’ll go to bed on my own.

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Just be quiet.

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,930
JIRA

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,500
Honestly.

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Just take the call.

46
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,700
Maybe he has something important
to explain to you.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,490
JIRA

48
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,250
What?

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,930
Hello.

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,610
Are you home?

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,420
Yes.

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,700
I’m drunk.

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,550
Just say what you call to say.

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,300
About today…

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,890
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you the truth.

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,900
What truth?

57
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you mean the fact that
you lied to me to be with Koh?

58
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,610
If that’s the one, you can screw it.

59
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,200
It’s not what you think.

60
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,350
Everything that happened was Koh’s plan.

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,370
He made me.

62
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,200
He made you?

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,350
What did he make you do?

64
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,600
Tell me.

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,020
If you can’t give me answers,

66
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,550
(that means he did not
make you do anything.)

67
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,290
If I wasn’t there, you guys
would have gone through with it.

68
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,600
So there’s nothing you can tell me.

69
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,700
Well, bye. I’m busy.

70
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,880
No, no, no.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,409
Don’t hang up. I care about you.

72
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,200
I called because I care about you.

73
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,250
I wanted to know if you’re okay.

74
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,800
I’m clearly not.

75
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,250
What can I do to make you feel okay?

76
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,500
I’ll do anything.

77
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,800
Then just be honest with me
and tell me the truth.

78
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,450
What is this between you and Koh?

79
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,800
Do you fancy him?

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,550
I don’t.

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
I hate him.

82
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,430
Did you quit your job?

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,350
No.

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,700
Goodbye, then.

85
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:29,980
Screw it.

86
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,100
Come on.

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,150
Nothing freaking goes my way.

88
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,150
Calm down, man.

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,030
Do you think I’m a jerk

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,550
for wanting him
to quit his job like I did?

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,100
Wow. Yeah.

92
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,310
Why would you want him
to quit a perfectly fine job?

93
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,470
Oh, you bastard…

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,930
Weren’t you pushing me to quit my job
just the other day?

95
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,450
That’s your case.

96
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,550
I couldn’t stand seeing you
and your Stockholm syndrome.

97
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,760
Your friend might not be like that.

98
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,250
Listen, he has it!

99
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,500
That’s why he doesn’t
have the guts to quit.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,900
Now what do I have to do to help someone
who also has Stockholm syndrome

101
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,250
to find a way out of it?

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,450
Normally, it’s possible to develop
a mild case of Stockholm syndrome at work.

103
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,200
It’s when an employee ties
their worth to their boss.

104
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,000
So no matter how vicious their boss is,

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,500
the employee will feel empathetic
toward the boss.

106
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,600
Before this, you showed all the signs.

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,330
That’s why I’m asking you

108
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,970
what made you suddenly
break the patterns?

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,550
I think, at that moment…

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,370
I just wanted to be with Jira,
just the two of us.

111
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,350
I don’t want Koh to get involved
in any freaking way.

112
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,150
That’s so obvious.

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,850
What is?

114
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,400
It means you now tie
your self-worth to Jira.

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,450
That’s why you no longer care about Koh.

116
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,260
This love is strong enough to make you
break out of your psychological cage.

117
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,200
Bad news is…

118
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,850
Will you be able to accept it?

119
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,900
Accept what?

120
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,020
Now that you’re attached to him,

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,050
if he doesn’t feel the same way,

122
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,900
your only option is pain.

123
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,930
Can you accept that?

124
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,870
You’re asking me what I think about this?

125
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,150
I think you’re being a bitch
and a jerk about it.

126
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,250
Are you two-timing?

127
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,250
I was just following my emotions.

128
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,900
It looks like Pheem is furious with me.

129
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,600
He’s not picking up the phone at all.

130
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,490
What should I do?

131
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,200
I’d be furious, too.

132
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,020
But if he doesn’t pick up the phone,

133
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,750
why not just show up?

134
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,900
You’re telling me I should
just go to his place?

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah.

136
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,670
But if he didn’t come see me at the lobby,
I’d be wasting my time, right?

137
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,000
Should I… call his friend?

138
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,450
Mawin is his name, I think.

139
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,900
He came in for an audition once.

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,570
I can call right now.

141
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,470
Wow.

142
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,330
Do you have to bring your own bat?

143
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,350
It doesn’t feel as good
when it’s not mine.

144
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,600
You ready to go now?

145
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,740
Wait a sec.

146
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,000
That job I went auditioning for
is calling me.

147
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes?

148
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,250
Hello.

149
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,700
Mawin, isn’t it?

150
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,550
This is Ing, the casting director.

151
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,300
Are you calling because I got a call back?

152
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,900
Oh, no.

153
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,300
I just have a favor to ask.

154
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,530
Well…

155
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,020
My friend wants to
talk things out with Pheem.

156
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,900
(Would you be able to help, Mawin?)

157
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,900
(Pheem refuses to answer the phone.)

158
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,330
Uhh…

159
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,300
What?

160
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,000
Dude.

161
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,300
Jira’s friend wants to talk to you.

162
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,550
Tell her I don’t want to.

163
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,650
(Hello.)

164
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,200
He can pick the place.

165
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,500
We can let them talk privately.

166
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,750
Can you, please, help me out, Mawin?

167
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,700
(I’ll definitely do my best
to help you with the castings.)

168
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,370
Oh, well…

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,610
I’m really sorry.

170
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,700
My friend and I are going out right now,

171
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,500
and I don’t want to betray him.

172
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,350
It’s alright.

173
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,300
Thank you.

174
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,300
Of course.

175
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,900
He is definitely betraying his friend.

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,600
Trust me.

177
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,200
Well?

178
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,320
You happy now?

179
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,870
I won’t tell them where you’re at, bro.

180
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,800
I’m a trustworthy guy.

181
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,430
You ready to go, bud?

182
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,870
Alright. I am.

183
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,800
Got it.

184
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,230
Here’s the location.

185
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,000
Grab a motorbike and go.

186
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,050
They’re heading over there.

187
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,000
Hey.

188
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,600
Oh, hey.

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,840
It’s been a while since I last saw you.

190
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,100
Thought I’d never see you again, actually.

191
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,800
I found a new catharsis.

192
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,400
But hey, I’m back.

193
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,100
Cool.

194
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,010
Mawin, which plan you aiming for today?

195
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,750
The 500-baht plan, per usual.

196
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Half an hour.

197
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,800
20 pieces.

198
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,900
I want to go all out today.

199
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,330
You want the 1000-baht plan
with 50 pieces instead?

200
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,850
You up for that?

201
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,450
I’ve been pent up for a whole month.

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,850
I’ll go with the 2000-baht plan.

203
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,000
2000?

204
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,600
I’ll have the 2000-baht plan, please.

205
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,450
Okay.

206
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,680
Enjoy your exercise.

207
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,660
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
Hello. Is this your first time here?

209
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,770
Yes.

210
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
You can choose your plan here.

211
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,900
I’m actually here with Pheem.

212
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,550
Oh, you’re Pheem’s friend?

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
He’s inside. You can go right in.

214
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,930
Thanks.

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,150
Hey, it ain’t me.

216
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,370
I haven’t even said anything.

217
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,200
Giving yourself away?

218
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,870
Well…

219
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,830
Why don’t you two talk things out?

220
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,250
I’ll wait outside.

221
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,150
What are you doing here?

222
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,800
How’d you know I’m here?

223
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,550
Because I know you.

224
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,700
No bars are open right now.

225
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,100
So this must be the place.

226
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,100
Don’t act like you know me.

227
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,850
What do I have to do for you
to talk to me like usual?

228
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,100
Quit your job.

229
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,350
That’s easy for you to say.

230
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,900
Because it is easy to do.

231
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,000
Can I ask you honestly?

232
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,900
Let’s say I quit my job,

233
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,170
can you guarantee that I’ll be fine?

234
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,300
You know…

235
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,100
I’ve always had trouble with money.

236
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,530
I have no backup plan.

237
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,500
Everything I have, I have to work for it.

238
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,400
I want you to understand that.

239
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,700
All along,

240
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,350
you had a stable job.

241
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,450
So if you quit,

242
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,470
you’ll be able to live just fine
for a year or two.

243
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,600
You don’t understand what it’s like
to be unemployed.

244
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,650
But me…

245
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,970
I don’t want to go back to that life.

246
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,100
You love him, don’t you?

247
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,010
That’s not it.

248
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,900
I can't quit because I need the money.

249
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,500
Nothing else.

250
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,700
Why else would I be here
explaining this to you?

251
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,370
You stop being mad at me now?

252
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,650
Shit!

253
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,450
Shit! Shit! Shit!

254
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,800
I let you have your way

255
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,250
and you think I’d always do, don’t you?

256
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,850
Huh?

257
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,570
Are you this angry with me?

258
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,850
Of course, I am, you jerk!
I am so freaking angry.

259
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,900
Shit!

260
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,260
Shit!

261
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,800
Shit!

262
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,300
You…

263
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,370
You made a fool out of me, you know that?

264
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,980
I’ve never let anyone treat me
the way I let you.

265
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,200
Did you know I won the national
math competition when I was a kid?

266
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,900
From secondary all through high school.

267
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,800
The tech week in Lisbon,
I went five years in a row, alone!

268
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,569
Shit!

269
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,010
But you…

270
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,900
You’re so freaking cruel, you know that?

271
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,200
You’re so cruel!

272
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,770
You know I can’t quit you!

273
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,200
But you’re definitely going to leave me!

274
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,430
Why do you keep circling back to me?

275
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,450
Huh?

276
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,500
Are you having fun
playing with my feelings? Are you?

277
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,700
We’ve been pushing and pulling.

278
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,900
You should understand me just a little.

279
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:43,850
Shit!

280
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,770
And do you know…

281
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,010
Look at me.

282
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,500
Look!

283
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,450
In my head, I keep asking myself
the same question.

284
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,020
Why?

285
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,150
Why?

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,450
Why does it have to be Koh?

287
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,370
You and I are like two prisoners under
the watchful eye of an asshole guard!

288
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,750
You should have fallen for me
and run away with me!

289
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,550
And now what?

290
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,050
You’ve fallen for the guard?

291
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,100
What the fuck are you thinking?

292
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,360
Why?

293
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,400
Why?

294
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,100
Why?!

295
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,370
Why won’t you choose me?

296
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,850
I don’t want to love you anymore.

297
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,300
It hurts.

298
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,630
Are you scared of me?

299
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,470
Yes.

300
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,300
I’m just like you.

301
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,400
Emotional.

302
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,500
But I’m dumb,

303
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,400
so I use my emotions to wreck things.

304
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,300
I don’t know when you’re going
to stop being mad at me.

305
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,350
But I want to draw you right now.

306
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,750
What?

307
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,400
What the hell is wrong with you?

308
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,880
You want to draw me…

309
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,020
do this?

310
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,650
No.

311
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,150
Art isn’t that straightforward.

312
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,050
What I see in you right now

313
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,800
is a man’s fragility

314
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,250
that comes out as aggression.

315
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,250
It’s because of you.

316
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,950
So?

317
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,500
Well?

318
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,500
What do I have to do?

319
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,650
Just do whatever you want in this room.

320
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,690
I only need some time to sketch.

321
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,850
Can you…

322
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,700
Can you draw me like you draw Koh?

323
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,150
Just be who you are.

324
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,170
I like you just the way you are.

325
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,280
Oh, shit.

326
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,450
Did you get so angry you lost
your shirt like The Hulk?

327
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,900
Hey, you okay?

328
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,250
I don’t know.

329
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,900
I was crying, too.

330
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,000
I’m so confused.

331
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,320
Shit.

332
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,500
What happened?

333
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,300
I saw him leave in a hurry.

334
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,350
I think he got inspired or something.

335
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,300
He said…

336
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,250
He wanted to draw me right away.

337
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,750
Help me grab this.

338
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,150
What?

339
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,700
What you smiling at?

340
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,600
Nothing much.

341
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,050
Just think I should warn you to leave
a little room for disappointment.

342
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,850
What do you mean?

343
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,960
He’s cute and all,

344
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,600
but it seems like you and he are from
two different worlds.

345
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,450
What?

346
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,150
You were telling me
he and I were perfect for each other.

347
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,700
No, man.

348
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,370
From my personal experience,

349
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,050
I’ve dated an artist before.

350
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,030
It was all nice and sweet at first.

351
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,950
We had what the other lacked
and all that, you know?

352
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,450
But at the end of the day,

353
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,570
no matter how radicalized they seem,

354
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,100
these artists will just have to
give in to capitalism.

355
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,970
You can’t overgeneralize like that.

356
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,650
I’m not.

357
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,980
It's just pure facts.

358
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,650
Take artists from history for example,

359
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,900
they all had patrons.

360
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,420
The one I dated

361
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,650
went straight to a millionaire
the minute we broke up.

362
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,900
So I have it cracked that maybe
they like someone who sees their worth

363
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,850
and appreciates their art
better than I could.

364
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,850
You get my drift?

365
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,700
That’s your ex.

366
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,850
You can’t say they’re the same.

367
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,020
This is Jira we’re talking about.

368
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,850
Maybe he’s not like that.

369
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,200
Sure.

370
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,300
If he’s not, then that’s great.

371
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,250
Maybe your love is strong enough.

372
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,890
What’s up?

373
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,050
I can’t sleep.

374
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,240
Come see me.

375
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,650
No.

376
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,730
If you don’t, I’ll go to your place.

377
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,650
(What?)

378
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,500
(I’m not home.)

379
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,700
You are.

380
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,750
Hey.

381
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
Did you track my phone again?

382
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,640
This is an emergency.

383
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,510
(How so?)

384
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,690
(Because you can’t sleep?)

385
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,470
If I can’t sleep, it’s an emergency.

386
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,890
If you don’t come here,
I’ll sleep at your place.

387
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,700
Don’t come. I’m painting.

388
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,570
KOH

389
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,310
What now?

390
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,870
I told you I’m not going.

391
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,250
(I’m downstairs.)

392
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,460
(Come get me.)

393
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,100
What?

394
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,800
Come and get me right now.

395
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,100
I’m not home.

396
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,760
Hey!

397
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,400
Stop.

398
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,540
What are you doing barging in?

399
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,640
You’re invading.

400
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,130
You stalker, get out!

401
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,300
I can’t take it anymore.
Just sleep with me.

402
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,900
You want to sleep?

403
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,210
Yeah.

404
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,460
Then I’m leaving.

405
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
Hey, hey!

406
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,720
Hey.

407
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,770
Hey.

408
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,320
Hello.

409
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,400
Where are you?

410
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,400
I’m right out front.

411
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,300
Hurry up.

412
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,800
Hey.

413
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,250
Come back with me.

414
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,100
I told you to come back with me.

415
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,100
Why aren’t you talking to me?

416
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,670
What’s wrong?

417
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,200
Hey, over here!

418
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,550
Stop it.

419
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,800
Wherever you run,
I’ll be right behind you.

420
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,650
Even if you go to your friend’s place,
I’ll be there.

421
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,150
Try it, then.

422
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,710
Let’s go.

423
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,010
Hello.

424
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,300
Get out of there.

425
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,800
Why the hell would I?

426
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,600
You said you could follow me anywhere.

427
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,270
Listen.

428
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,200
If you get out of there right now,
I’ll pay you more.

429
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,670
Hey.

430
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
What do you think I am?

431
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,130
A commodity?

432
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,300
I’m not going!

433
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,400
Fine.

434
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,200
I’ll wait here.

435
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,400
Keep waiting, then.

436
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,650
The place opens until 4.

437
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,800
If you dare, just get in here.

438
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,950
Can we leave now?

439
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,930
Leave?

440
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,600
Don’t you see I’m enjoying myself?

441
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,120
I don’t like it here. Let’s go home.

442
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,550
If you don’t like it, leave, then.

443
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,300
Why fight it?

444
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,160
Go.

445
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,550
Go!

446
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,400
Make some noise, underdogs!

447
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,370

448
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,210

What? You don’t like the song?

456
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,500
Hey!

457
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,400
Hey!

458
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,360
Hey!

459
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,500
Hey!

460
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,600
Hey!

461
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,650
Can you help me?

462
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,030
Go on ahead.

463
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,550
I got this.

464
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,980
This car.

465
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,250
I’ll take him to the hospital.

466
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,000
Ugh.

467
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,300
Where’s your key?

468
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Get in.

469
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,170
Get in.

470
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,870
Thank you.

471
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:24,800
Hey.

472
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,199
-Hey.
-What?

473
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,600
You don’t have to take me to the hospital.

474
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,699
I’m fine.

475
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,330
Are you sure?

476
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,300
You don’t look fine.

477
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,100
Just let me rest.

478
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
I’ll feel better.

479
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,250
Is there any water in the car?

480
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,500
In the back.

481
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,480
Crap.

482
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,270
I always lose the last game before bed.

483
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,400
You wanna play another game?

484
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,400
I’ll stay up with you.

485
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,770
Nah.

486
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
I’ve been tired out
since the rage room thing.

487
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,650
You need to go to bed, too.

488
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,400
No one is hiring right this moment.

489
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,870
But I don’t want to miss
any opportunities.

490
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,100
Who knows, right?

491
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,600
And it’s still morning
in the US timezone, man.

492
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,500
Pheem.

493
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,850
Yeah?

494
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,560
You got away from Koh.

495
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,950
Why don’t you take this time to rest
and get to know yourself?

496
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,250
You have some savings, right?

497
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,850
I don’t want to waste my time.

498
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,600
Right now, you and I are both unemployed.

499
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,200
I want to find work as soon as possible,

500
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,570
so I can support Jira, too.

501
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,860
Oi, dude!

502
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,830
What the hell got into you?

503
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,400
Pheem, you jerk.

504
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,010
Nothing. I’m just happy.

505
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,300
Well, it’s good that you’re happy.

506
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,420
Be sure not
to let it slip away now, alright?

507
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,030
Well?

508
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,650
Better now?

509
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,250
Yeah.

510
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,400
I feel better.

511
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,000
I still have a headache, though.

512
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,800
I’m going home, then.

513
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,550
Hey.

514
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,200
Wait.

515
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:33,800
Hey.

516
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,170
What?

517
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,970
Are you…

518
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,300
Mad at me about firing Pheem?

519
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,700
It’s not just about Pheem.

520
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,800
I’m mad because you seem to love
toying with other people’s feelings.

521
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,000
Is it fun?

522
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,600
It was fun.

523
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,800
But it’s not fun anymore.

524
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
When you’re gone,

525
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,300
I don’t think I sleep properly at all.

526
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,300
See?

527
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,510
Even now, you’re only thinking
about yourself.

528
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,700
Yes.

529
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,270
I do think about myself.

530
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,970
That’s why I came out here
looking for you.

531
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,000
If I keep being alone, I’ll be in trouble.

532
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,850
You’re all I have right now.

533
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,850
Can you make it home?

534
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,040
Can you give me a ride?

535
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Your place.

536
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,300
Hey.

537
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,020
We’re here.

538
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,430
Hey.

539
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,000
Can you walk me home?

540
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,850
I’ll have Mr. Butler call you a cab home.

541
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,850
I don’t feel okay at all.

542
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,060
No.

543
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,850
This is as far as I’ll stay.

544
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,980
Call your butler if you don’t feel better.

545
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,570
Can you get the car, please?

546
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,360
Come on.

547
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,030
Walk upright.

548
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:49,980
Hey!

549
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,850
What the hell?

550
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,500
Ugh.

551
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,770
This is exhausting.

552
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,740
Hey.

553
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,270
Can you get me some water?

554
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,300
I’m so thirsty.

555
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:30,850
Where is it?

556
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,180
There.

557
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,530
Here.

558
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,800
Are you sick?

559
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,570
Medicine?

560
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,970
No.

561
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
Take a rest, then.

562
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,700
Hey.

563
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,990
Sit with me.

564
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,980
I dreamed about you.

565
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,600
In my dream,

566
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,720
I saw myself sleeping,
just like in your painting.

567
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,770
A tiny angel who looked just like you

568
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,100
came to kiss me.

569
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,600
How about this?

570
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,800
Can you kiss me before you leave?

571
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,400
Maybe I’ll sleep better.

572
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,150
What an excuse.

573
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,800
It’s not a difficult thing to do, right?

574
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,400
I’m only asking you to stay.

575
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,930
Okay, then.

576
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,430
It’s alright.

577
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,100
I’m sick of asking.

578
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,970
I’m sorry for today, though.

579
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,400
I’ll call you a cab.

580
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,700
No need.

581
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,100
I’ll stay.

582
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,370
It’s almost morning, after all.

583
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,070
Why don’t you get in bed with me?

584
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,300
No.

585
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,690
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

586
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,760
You’re not busy today.

587
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,340
Let’s go to my childhood home.

588
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,580
Why?

589
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,100
Because I want you to.

590
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,100
You should know
it’s not everyone I show it to.

591
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,000
Hey.

592
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,460
I have a favor to ask.

593
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,970
Hold it right there. Stop.

594
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,450
You and all your men, huh?

595
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,300
You’re too attached.

596
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,890
If he doesn’t want to play along,
just move on to someone else.

597
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,150
Next time, I’ll be the one
messing with him.

598
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,200
You’ve been acting weird recently.

599
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,800
Didn’t you say you don’t like me?

600
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:11,850
I like you.
