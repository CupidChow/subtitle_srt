00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,730
Characters, actions, places, occupations,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,700
and events in this series are fictional and
created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,430
They are not intended to urge
or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,600
There’s a place I know.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,980
It’s called Burnout Bar.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,130
Sounds like I’ll be in a worse place
if I go there.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,930
It’s a good place for people
who are burnt out.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,020
Your palm says you’re going to
get a new job soon.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,050
What’s your name?

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,750
Am I in a job interview?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Yes.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,210
If I like your answers,
you’ll get the job.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,230
You got the job.

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,400
Leave me your contact.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,900
I’ll get in touch when I need you to work.

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
I take the job.

18
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,300
Mr. K.

19
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,150
Hello.

20
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,300
Can you see me?

21
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,600
I can.

22
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,240
Excuse me for not turning
on my camera today.

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,400
It’s alright.

24
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,600
You can take your time until you’re ready.

25
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,060
How is your insomnia?

26
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,890
Is it better?

27
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,900
It’s the same.

28
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,980
Can’t you give me a heavier dose?

29
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,980
Of course.

30
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,900
I can talk to the psychiatry department.

31
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,300
But before we jump ahead to that,
I suggest you increase your exercise time,

32
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,500
and we can talk about
upping your dose later.

33
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,200
Of course.

34
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,400
I’ll try swimming.

35
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,600
How was the restaurant experience?

36
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,829
Did you apply any of the skills
we mentioned last time?

37
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,300
I made sure to choose a restaurant
with less crowd.

38
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,250
But there was still the issue of security.

39
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,900
So I thought I’d make an appointment
at one restaurant,

40
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,700
and then go to a different one,

41
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,100
and send a car to pick them up.

42
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,570
Mr. K, wouldn’t that be
adding more to the issue

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
of making yourself
the center of the problem?

44
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,900
Most of the time, we cannot change people,
but we can change ourselves.

45
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,000
There is this theory of
the freedom to choose.

46
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,450
You can choose to do whatever you want

47
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,750
and take its consequences.

48
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,600
That means freedom doesn’t mean
you can do anything.

49
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,150
It means you can do something
whose consequences you’re willing to take.

50
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,760
This thing we’re talking about,

51
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,250
do you think you can apply it
to meeting people?

52
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,350
I don’t meet people much.

53
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
But if I can’t avoid it,

54
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,500
I think I just found myself
a short-term solution to it.

55
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,050
I met someone.

56
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Who is it, Mr. K?

57
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,240
Hmm!

58
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,450
It’s very basil-y!

59
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay. Cut.

60
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,990
That was good. But let’s get
another take just in case.

61
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,100
Can we make it over the top this time?

62
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright?

63
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,000
Camera.

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Ready. In three, two, one.

65
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,900
Action.

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,390
Hmm!

67
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,600
It’s very basil-y!

68
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,950
Cut.

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,800
Got it.

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,980
What’s with you?

71
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,100
Hey.

72
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,650
I need your help.

73
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,650
It’s an emergency.

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,800
What?

75
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,400
So he just walked around naked in his room
while you were still there?

76
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,800
What was he thinking?

77
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,800
Isn’t that weird?

78
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,300
It is.

79
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,250
You know why he said
I passed the interview?

80
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,150
He said he didn’t feel a thing
staring at my face.

81
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,770
I guess the walking-around-naked
is just a normal thing guys do?

82
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,750
So?

83
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,950
You saw him naked…

84
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,400
and now you want him?

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,000
Is that why you want to work with him?

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,700
Ugh!

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,900
You out of your mind?

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
It’s only because it pays well.

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Careful.

90
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,300
Rich and mysterious…

91
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,300
He could be a mafia.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,570
What if next thing you know
you were shipped to the border,

93
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,750
being forced to scam people?

94
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,450
I can’t save you, I’ll have you know.

95
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,800
That’s exactly
why I’m here talking to you.

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh?

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,670
What?

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,350
He’s just sent me a response.

99
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,430
What should I do?

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,730
Speaking of the devil…

101
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,170
Do you remember anything at all?

102
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,850
Think again.

103
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,850
Maybe there’s a lead somewhere
about who he is.

104
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,050
To tell you the truth,

105
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,250
I can’t think of anything.

106
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,750
I only saw his dong, you know?

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,000
I knew it.

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,200
Mr. K, from our conversations
in the previous sessions,

109
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,800
I’m quite surprised you opened up to him.

110
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,670
What made you trust him?

111
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,530
I wouldn’t say I trust him.

112
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,730
But he’s not a complex person.

113
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,850
He speaks his mind.

114
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,500
I just think he’s easy to read.

115
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,450
I’m reading through his social media.

116
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,150
He posts everything he thinks.

117
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
It’s almost like a diary, really.

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,650
“Expert mastery is required,
but then the salary is entry level.”

119
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,370
“What the fuck, jerks?”

120
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,429
He’s money-hungry.

121
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,150
It’s easy when they can be controlled
with money.

122
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,799
Hello.

123
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,750
Hello.

124
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,400
Mr. Jira, is it?

125
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,030
Yes.

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,050
I’m Mr. Koh’s butler.

127
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,050
Please come this way.

128
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,650
One more thing,

129
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,800
he’s not in my industry at all.

130
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,170
I think he doesn’t know and likely
doesn't have what it takes to hurt me.

131
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,250
Mr. Butler.

132
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
What is Mr. Koh’s full name?

133
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,400
I am not allowed to reveal
my boss’ secrets.

134
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Before we go, I must be so impolite
as to ask to pat your down,

135
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,400
as well as take away your phone, sir.

136
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,300
What?

137
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,300
I won’t leak any information
about your boss.

138
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,450
This is Mr. Koh’s demand.

139
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,430
Excuse me.

140
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,030
All done.

141
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,470
Please hand me your bag.

142
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,600
This is the keycard
to the penthouse suite.

143
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,850
Do you have to take away
my phone and bag?

144
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,770
We haven’t signed our contract.

145
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,400
I have to be careful.

146
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,030
Take a look at that paper.

147
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,150
What is this?

148
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,960
An NDA.

149
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,450
What’s an NDA?

150
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,550
It is what it says.

151
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,700
Non-disclosure agreement.

152
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,100
An agreement to make sure none of
my information gets disclosed.

153
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,500
If you talk about me,

154
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,300
or leak anything about this,

155
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,930
I can sue you.

156
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,300
What?

157
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,500
Sue?

158
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,150
It’s protocol.

159
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,650
If we were to work together,
we need contracts.

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh, and I added an extra item.

161
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,650
You must allow me to access
your social media and location.

162
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,700
Are you for real?

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,600
It’s for emergencies.

164
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,950
All my employees have to sign it.

165
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,700
Well, what does an NDA cover?

166
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,150
What do you mean?

167
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,020
Can I talk to my friends about you?

168
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,970
Not at all.

169
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,850
What if someone sees us together?

170
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,800
What should I say?

171
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,950
Lie.

172
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,250
And if I don’t agree with this?

173
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,700
Then you can go home right now.

174
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,530
In the contract,

175
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,400
there’s gotta be the name of
the employee, right?

176
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,130
Whose signature is this?

177
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,550
It’s beautiful.

178
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,340
Yours?

179
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,900
No.

180
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,800
That’s my company's legal representative.

181
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,500
There you go.

182
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,450
Since I’m in your employment now,

183
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,260
can I ask you something, Boss?

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,710
What is it?

185
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,830
Nothing much.

186
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,400
If you ask me to do something
I don’t feel like doing,

187
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,930
I’m reserving my right to send in
my resignation notice.

188
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,140
Noted.

189
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,990
But not promised.

190
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,350
When he goes to the toilet or whatever,

191
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,900
just look through his stuff.

192
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,650
His wallet and his desk and such.

193
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,700
There’s gotta be something
that tells you who he is.

194
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,500
Hello.

195
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,850
You saw him, didn’t you?

196
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,530
What I’m offering is an opportunity.

197
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,230
In our sector, we’ve always been examined
and scrutinized, haven’t we?

198
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,050
The cool thing about what I’m about
to offer is tech.

199
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,400
It’s new.

200
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,500
And because it’s new,
no law’s been written about it yet.

201
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,200
A guy in tech like him,

202
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,550
there’s gotta be at least a trophy
or certificate of some kind.

203
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,750
And since it’s a startup,
we don’t need a lot of resources.

204
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,200
You don’t have to worry about
your investment.

205
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,370
I’ll launder it fast and good,
like dry cleaning.

206
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,960
The return of investment will definitely
be higher than last time.

207
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,900
What do you say?

208
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,500
This might bother you a little, Mr. Jira,

209
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,000
but before you leave this place,

210
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,900
you will be patted down again
to make sure nothing gets taken.

211
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,730
Hello.

212
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,700
Hey.

213
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,010
The investors are on board.

214
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,900
For real?

215
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,550
You’re really something.

216
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,250
We’ll handle the money like usual.

217
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,030
But the investors want us to cut costs
in the year-end production.

218
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,300
We need to lay some people off
this quarter.

219
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,300
How many people?

220
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,350
Your whole department.

221
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,100
Who’s telling my team this?

222
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,400
You are.

223
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,960
Turn around.

224
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,750
What is this for?

225
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,950
Tailoring.

226
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Your shoulders are small.

227
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,900
Well, I tried.

228
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,900
It’s alright.

229
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,200
I’ll make them look wider.

230
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,450
So what exactly am I here to do?

231
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,550
You’re going to be Mr. K.

232
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,350
Mr. K?

233
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,030
What’s that?

234
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,100
Me.

235
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,600
Koh.

236
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,300
So you want me to be you?

237
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,030
Yeah.

238
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,750
I want you to represent me
in my business negotiation.

239
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,200
Why don’t you do it yourself?

240
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,970
I hate meeting people.

241
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,400
Too much drama.

242
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,550
Too much chaos.

243
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,970
Is that so?

244
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,470
I count as people, you know?

245
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,850
And you’re fine meeting me.

246
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,650
If you’re gonna mess with me,
we might as well just call this off.

247
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,170
Well, my bad.

248
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,750
Ugh.

249
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,130
I’m sorry, then.

250
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,010
All done.

251
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,010
Mr. Butler.

252
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,230
Can you find a suit that’s perfect for
a sweet-looking guy who works in fashion?

253
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,250
I just sent you the measurements.

254
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,200
I need it by 4 o’clock.

255
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,650
Now we’ll try to imitate me.

256
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,900
I’m taking over your company.

257
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,150
What?

258
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,150
Repeat after me.

259
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,020
I need a seat at the board.

260
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,170
With this number, I believe it’s not
too much trouble—

261
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,940
Hold on, hold on.

262
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,600
Hold on.

263
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,450
What’s the context here?

264
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,450
I literally don’t know anything.

265
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,400
You said you’re an actor.

266
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,770
Hey, an actor needs to know the character
and their background.

267
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,070
I don’t know what kind of man you are.

268
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,350
I can’t play.

269
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,570
It’s so obvious and you need more context?

270
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,670
It’s a business negotiation.

271
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,550
Try the same line. Again.

272
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
I’m taking over your company.

273
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Is repeating after me too much of a feat?

274
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,600
It’s acting.

275
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,650
I’m not a robot you can just key
the information in and ready to go.

276
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,610
I need emotions and feelings.

277
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,740
Alright.

278
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,750
I’ll make you play Jira.

279
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,020
Be yourself.

280
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,030
Whichever interview you walk in,

281
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,050
you already know,

282
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,250
they’re going to turn you down.

283
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,700
The interviews are just formality.

284
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,100
In the end, you burst out.

285
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,300
You get the situation?

286
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,100
Being yourself

287
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,450
is not too difficult for you, is it?

288
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,600
Let’s begin, shall we?

289
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,900
I understand.

290
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,500
I’m used to it.

291
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,500
You won’t give me the job.

292
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,720
I understand…

293
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,020
-You were picking me apart
-I’m used to it.

294
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,580
-from the moment I walked into the room,
-I know you won’t give me the job.

295
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,010
pointing out my flaws.

296
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,400
You were pickling me apart

297
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,200
from the moment I walked into the room,

298
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,400
pointing out my flaws.

299
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,050
Repeat after me faster.

300
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,850
What should I get up early in the morning
and get dressed for?

301
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,820
What should I get up early in the morning
and get dressed for?

302
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,300
For a few people to decide
my future for me?

303
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,130
For a few people to decide
my future for me?

304
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,800
To work myself to death for a few grands?

305
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,600
-To work myself to death for a few grands?
-If I could choose,

306
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,600
I wouldn’t be begging you for this job.

307
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,900
If I could choose,

308
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,500
-I wouldn’t be begging you for this job.
-And when I get the job,

309
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,700
I have to worry
I’d be laid off any minute.

310
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,700
-And when I get the job,
-Taking your frustration out on me.

311
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,940
I have to worry
I’d be laid off any minute.

312
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,470
I’d feel like an emotional dustbin
for the likes of you.

313
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,400
Taking your frustration out on me.

314
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,300
I’d feel like an emotional dustbin
for the likes of you.

315
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,500
It seems you got it.

316
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,020
How do you feel?

317
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,500
I…

318
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,550
I just…

319
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,500
I feel like…

320
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,850
I feel like I don’t belong anywhere.

321
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,550
I’m not good at anything.

322
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,300
What I want to know is

323
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,250
how good do I have to be to be chosen?

324
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,600
I’m choosing you.

325
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,300
Did…

326
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,050
Did you look through my social media?

327
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,930
You’re a jerk.

328
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,800
Yeah.

329
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,850
You did well.

330
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,550
But no drama for this job.

331
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,470
I have no use for your tears.

332
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,750
I drink plum wine when I’m stressed.

333
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,350
I make this myself, you know?

334
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,850
Drink it.

335
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,600
It’ll help you focus on the task at hand.

336
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,800
Guys.

337
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,600
I have an announcement to make.

338
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,600
Happy birthday to you.

339
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,210
Happy birthday to you.

340
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,960
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

341
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,510
Happy birthday to you.

342
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,950
Hey.

343
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,600
Happy birthday, buddy.

344
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,150
What’s wrong?

345
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,530
Frowning on your birthday…

346
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,890
You don’t like surprises?

347
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,600
It’s not that.

348
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,970
I have something to tell you.

349
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Don’t tell anyone yet.

350
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,650
I don’t want everyone to freak out.

351
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,600
Fire away.

352
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,700
Our company is restructuring.

353
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,500
Restructuring, that means…

354
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,750
That means we’re reorganzing.

355
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,150
Do you remember that two years ago,

356
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,350
Hive had the production
and design departments?

357
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,630
Koh restructured the company,

358
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,530
and now we outsourced.

359
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,150
Last year, he restructured
the marketing team,

360
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,650
and replaced them with algorithms.

361
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,750
This year,

362
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,180
he’s restructuring
the application development team.

363
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,050
He’s replacing us with
the AI we developed.

364
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,400
We need less people.

365
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,000
Are you telling me

366
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,700
I did all that coding only
to get rid of myself?

367
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,300
Those are such pretty words
just to fire people, ain’t they?

368
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,670
Honestly, aren’t you friends with him?

369
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,130
Why do you keep letting him do
whatever he wants?

370
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,630
What can I do?

371
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,570
Shit.

372
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,430
If I’m getting fired anyway,

373
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,870
can you let me see him for like once?

374
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,140
I just need one shot at the jerk!

375
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,020
Calm down.

376
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,270
There’s nothing you can do now
even if you see him.

377
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,020
I think you need to think about
what you’re gonna do to get through this.

378
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,500
What’s your plan?

379
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,250
Damn it.

380
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,200
When I got the job here,

381
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,970
you people made me sign
a non-competition agreement.

382
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,450
I can’t ask you to start
a company together.

383
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,560
I can’t use my own coding elsewhere.

384
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,350
Fuck that!

385
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,700
How about this?

386
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,020
Start saving up your money.

387
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,700
And…

388
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,400
You can stay at my place
for the time being.

389
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,670
Yeah.

390
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,350
I’ll count on that.

391
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,030
And I won’t help you pay a damn baht.

392
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,570
I spent all my money on your damn cake.

393
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh, fuck.

394
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,020
You ready to work?

395
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,250
The suit is here.

396
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,170
Sure.

397
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,020
The situation isn’t complicated today.

398
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,150
You’re a nominee.

399
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,250
Your job is to make sure the partner
we’re meeting today feels at ease,

400
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,550
and takes our investment.

401
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,620
Why don’t you hire some lawyer to do this,
or an actual businessman?

402
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,700
Why me?

403
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,700
I sent all those.

404
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,000
He always resisted.

405
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,300
I guess those people I sent don’t know
much about fashion, unlike you.

406
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,450
I believe you can do it.

407
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,100
Who’s this partner we’re meeting?

408
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,470
Library.

409
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,430
Thames’.

410
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:43,870
What?

411
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,350
I told you I worked with him before.

412
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,500
He knows my face.

413
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,100
Don’t worry.

414
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,350
Thames only sees people
who are useful to him.

415
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I’ll be honest with you.

416
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,900
He won’t remember you.

417
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:09,940
You done?

418
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,200
We’re in a hurry.

419
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,700
Some fashionable suit this is.

420
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,950
What’s this?

421
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,020
Give it to him when I tell you to.

422
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,020
Stop fidgeting.

423
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,200
Hey.

424
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,200
What should I say to him?

425
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,350
Talk about art.

426
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,400
Say something that shows your depth.

427
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,850
Charm him.

428
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,350
When his guard is down,
I’ll tell you what to say.

429
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,250
How do I get his guard down?

430
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,630
A hook to the face?

431
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,900
Thames is here.

432
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,250
Get ready.

433
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,700
Imagine this.

434
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,300
Let’s say you were Vermeer.

435
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,000
You just painted something
so damn beautiful.

436
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,270
What kind of buyer
would you like to sell it to?

437
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,200
You know Vermeer was broke
until his very last day?

438
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,630
Yeah, whatever.

439
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,410
What kind of people would you sell
your painting to?

440
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,100
Someone who sees the value
in my painting, I guess.

441
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,750
That’s how you should make him feel.

442
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,470
Hello, Mr. Thames.

443
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,000
I’m K.

444
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,290
Sorry for the sudden change of
the meeting place.

445
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,570
Would you like something to eat?

446
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,900
No, I don’t think so.

447
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,230
Talk to him about whatever
you find interesting.

448
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,130
Mention his brand or something.

449
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,250
I like your Spring collection.

450
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,530
Thank you.

451
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,370
When can we expect to see your next one?

452
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,500
Give him that paper.

453
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,300
Right now.

454
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,950
At this price, what do you want from me?

455
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,450
A seat at the board, with this number…

456
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,500
A seat at the board,

457
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,830
with this number,

458
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,120
isn’t too much for you, is it?

459
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,820
We’ll see if we can get along
in the long run.

460
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,100
What do you think, Mr. Thames?

461
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,250
I know what you’re trying to do.

462
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,300
You can stop trying.

463
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,900
You won’t succeed.

464
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,800
Make him stay.

465
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,970
Hurry up!

466
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,750
Ugh!

467
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,270
Sorry.

468
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:46,950
Follow him.

469
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,020
What are you doing just sitting there?

470
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,130
What can I even say?

471
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,900
Just talk about your dumb art or whatever.

472
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,550
I hired you.

473
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,700
Can you at least showcase any sign
of intelligence so I don’t regret it?

474
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:57,870
Go.

475
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,400
Go!

476
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,570
Excuse me.

477
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,770
Do you need help?

478
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,730
How many companies have you done this to?

479
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,750
If I said yours is my first,

480
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,850
would you believe me?

481
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,850
This suit…

482
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,550
It’s the DNA of your brand.

483
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,700
1991, isn’t it?

484
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,650
You know that?

485
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,560
I wrote my thesis on you.

486
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,540
You did?

487
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,450
Yes.

488
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,230
I interviewed you myself, actually,

489
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,250
at your old warehouse.

490
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,470
I guess you don’t remember me.

491
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,000
What was your thesis about?

492
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,850
I was just wondering
if there’s art in fashion

493
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,810
since high-end brands seem to change
their designers so frequently.

494
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,980
Their products are beautiful and
have artistic values, but don’t sell.

495
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,200
Meanwhile, some brands are
lower in quality,

496
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,940
lacking their uniqueness,

497
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,950
and yet, they sell.

498
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,150
I wasn’t sure which one of them
would get to keep their job.

499
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,030
What was the conclusion of your thesis?

500
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,630
Is fashion art?

501
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,970
Whether it is or isn’t
isn’t the point, is it?

502
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,200
Don’t they all say nowadays that
good fashion is the one that sells?

503
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,900
Do you mean to say Library doesn’t sell
because it’s bad?

504
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,300
Fashion isn’t fine art.

505
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,600
It’s capitalism.

506
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,150
But to tell you the truth,

507
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,940
I don’t think that.

508
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,230
But if I were to join your management,

509
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,000
I need to be honest with you.

510
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,610
You can go back to making clothes
the way you like.

511
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,430
I’ll be the one bullshitting
our way through,

512
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,100
telling people it’s fine art.

513
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,170
One seat only.

514
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,300
Aren’t you going to order
something to drink?

515
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,400
You've been sitting here a while.

516
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,270
I’m waiting for someone.

517
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,370
I’ll order when he’s here.

518
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,030
I see.

519
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,850
I guess I don’t need to match you
with someone today, then?

520
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,600
Fine by me.

521
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,850
How are you doing?

522
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,300
Did you get through that old issue?

523
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,200
I got a new job.

524
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,020
But it seems I’ll be unemployed soon.

525
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,700
Here.

526
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,550
Your work is done.

527
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:01,970
You were good.

528
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,010
I thought you weren’t gonna pull through.

529
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
Are you trying to compliment or insult me?

530
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,430
It’s a compliment.

531
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,050
I always make sure I am worth my payroll.

532
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,200
I get paid task-by-task.

533
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,600
My boss is demanding and orders me around.

534
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,770
If he hires me again,
I don’t think I’ll accept.

535
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,050
If you want my opinion,

536
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,850
you should stick with your job
if you have one.

537
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,450
That’s what everyone says.

538
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,750
What’s your plan?

539
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,200
Rebranding Library?

540
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,750
What are you gonna do with
that one seat at the board?

541
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,500
You don’t need to think about that.

542
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,000
There’s no plans.

543
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,670
We’re just taking over his company.

544
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,330
I know that.

545
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,800
But what are you going to do next?

546
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,020
Hello.

547
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,650
Beautiful suit.

548
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,000
Did you go to work?

549
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,470
It fits you nicely.

550
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:11,950
What?

551
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,410
You’re taking it off?

552
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,130
It’s hot in here.

553
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,800
I have a drink for you.

554
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,980
“Workplace Romance.”

555
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,500
It’s perfect for people who are in love
with their colleague.

556
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,970
When you did my palm reading,
you got almost everything right.

557
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,150
I did?

558
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,400
Tell me.

559
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,830
The hard-earned job that pays well.

560
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,530
Classic.

561
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,430
Well? How do you like it?

562
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,500
I don’t like it at all.

563
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,420
If I have to go back, I’d rather eat shit.

564
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,970
Now I wonder what kind of job it is.

565
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,200
It’s basically scamming.

566
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,210
I had to trick people
into making a deal with me.

567
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,300
It’s awful.

568
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,040
I want his archive so I can develop my AI.

569
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,330
What do you mean?

570
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,150
I’ll make AI study his fashion design.

571
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,250
I can’t keep waiting around for
those designers to have ideas, you know.

572
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,500
Fashion isn’t about trendsetting.

573
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,150
It’s all about how to best keep up
with the trends.

574
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,600
That’s the important part.

575
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,940
His is our country’s legendary
fashion brand.

576
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,600
A legendary copycat is what he is.

577
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,200
He copies the design from European brands.

578
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,210
That’s exactly why I want
his archive for my AI.

579
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,020
When we have copyright strikes, we can
just say the AI learns it from his brand.

580
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,050
Hey.

581
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,400
He’s got a signature and
very valuable craftsmanship.

582
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,900
You just said it yourself that
fashion is capitalism.

583
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,010
Don’t worry.

584
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,100
I’ll make sure his ending
is at least elegant.

585
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,870
How can you do this?

586
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,700
I’m telling him.

587
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,510
Did you forget you signed an NDA?

588
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,350
You can’t take the consequences.

589
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,430
I quit.

590
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,150
You don’t get to.

591
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,300
I’m firing you.

592
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,020
We’re done here.

593
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,750
Bye.

594
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,840
Let’s change the subject.

595
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,450
“What do you like and don’t like
about your job?”

596
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,350
I said all those.

597
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,200
You tell me.

598
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,250
How’s work?

599
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,650
Mine?

600
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,420
Well… Quite bad.

601
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,950
I have to fire a friend.

602
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,510
I’ve been working here a long time,

603
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,370
and now I’m asking myself
if I want to keep doing it.

604
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,470
You know what the worst part is?

605
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,700
I don’t have the gut to quit.

606
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,570
I’ve been working this job forever.

607
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,000
I feel like it’s a part of who I am now.

608
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,830
Quit.

609
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,770
You gotta step out of your
safe zone sometimes, you know?

610
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,100
I don’t have it in me.

611
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,850
You see…

612
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
My career line is not very strong.

613
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,250
I fear I’d make things worse if I quit.

614
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,830
But…

615
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,850
At least there’s something good going on.

616
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,550
I get to meet you on my birthday,
after all.

617
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,650
What?

618
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,230
Is it your birthday today?

619
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,000
Mhmm.

620
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,700
Happy birthday.

621
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,600
I don’t have anything for you, though.

622
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,500
It’s alright.

623
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,650
You didn’t know.

624
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,250
I have an idea.

625
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,450
If I make you a birthday present,

626
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,600
would you take it?

627
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,500
Alright.

628
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,170
You ready?

629
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,450
Hold on.

630
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,900
Give me a minute to
mentally prepare myself.

631
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,020
I got this idea when my boss
splashed wine on our client.

632
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,300
The wine stain looked really pretty.

633
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,900
It kinda seemed artful.

634
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,630
Would you like to see it?

635
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,600
I can show you.

636
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,000
Hold–Hold up.

637
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,500
Are you saying you want to
splash wine on me?

638
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,600
Is that it?

639
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,400
Oh… When you put it like that,
it sounds weird.

640
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,430
I’m basically asking you
to be washed in wine.

641
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,020
Right?

642
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:51,950
It’s not exactly weird.

643
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,700
It’s my birthday.

644
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,500
I came prepared for a surprise.

645
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,750
Alright. I’m ready.

646
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,570
Okay.

647
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,430
One.

648
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,020
Two.

649
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,200
Three.

650
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,930
Shit.

651
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,150
Sorry.

652
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,630
I didn’t think it would turn out like this.

653
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,000
What? Did you miss?

654
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,550
No. It just doesn't live up
to the expectations.

655
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,700
Can I take it home so I can paint it?

656
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,500
Of course.

657
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:45,500
Here.

658
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,900
What’s the matter?

659
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,500
I didn’t expect an IT guy like you
to have a tattoo like that.

660
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,450
You like it?

661
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:24,600
Yes.

662
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,890
Mr. Jira sent the suit back to us.

663
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,850
He requested we send his clothes back.
[Please return to Korawic Kitiwela.]

664
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,300
They’re in the bathroom.

665
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,400
Send them back to him.

666
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,250
Should I put him on our blacklist, sir?

667
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,050
Not yet.

668
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,050
Hey.

669
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,100
Did you have to close
the entire pool down for this?

670
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,980
Who is this?

671
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,350
Your friend?

672
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,970
Don’t stare.

673
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,800
Don’t mind me.

674
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,000
I’m just a fly on the wall.
