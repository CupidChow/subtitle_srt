00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,750
and events in this series are fictional
and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,530
I don’t know when you’re going
to stop being mad at me.

6
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,600
But I want to draw you right now.

7
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,700
What?

8
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,400
What I see in you right now

9
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,500
is a man’s fragility
that comes out as aggression.

10
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,900
Are you mad at me for firing Pheem?

11
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,400
It’s not just about Pheem.

12
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,200
I’m mad because you seem to love
toying with other people’s feelings.

13
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,600
Is it fun?

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,600
Can you kiss me before you leave?

15
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,400
Maybe I’ll sleep better.

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,150
All these years in business,

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,100
and you still don’t know
how to read people?

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
I’m sure he meant no harm.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,850
This is exactly why no one respects you.

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,500
(I’ll find a way to fix this.)

21
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,800
(Fix this?)

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,200
(How? Like you always did?)

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,950
It never worked.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,400
Our son is here.

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,390
You tell him.

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,980
(Is something the matter?)

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,000
(It’s nothing, love.)

28
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,650
(Your mom and I are just talking.)

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,970
Why don’t you go to your room?

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,810
Alright?

31
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,450
Sit down, Koh.

32
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,630
You know why your father is like this?

33
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,300
Because he had a stroke?

34
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,050
No.

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,900
He’s like this

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,650
because he’s an idiot.

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,220
Remember this, Koh.

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,600
When you do business,

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,750
don’t get attached to anyone.

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,100
If you trust someone,

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,900
this is how you’re going to end up.

42
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,350
The scariest people

43
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,700
are the ones closest to you.

44
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,850
Why are you up so early?

45
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,930
You couldn’t sleep?

46
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,400
I got this today.

47
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,100
I just thought I could
assemble it right away.

48
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,409
What’s with you and computers?

49
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,800
It’s my favorite thing.

50
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,600
If there’s nothing else, I’ll go home.

51
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,800
Hold on.

52
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,950
Stay for breakfast.

53
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,900
I had Mr. Butler prepare some breakfast
and some clothes for you.

54
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,750
You can take a shower here.

55
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,800
Alright.

56
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,250
Why can’t I touch it?

57
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,370
Are you messing with me?

58
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,360
Excuse me.

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,300
Ing’s calling.

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,750
Hey. What’s up?

61
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,350
I knew you’d be awake.

62
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
Why are you calling?

63
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,450
I just want to talk to you.

64
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,800
What are you doing?

65
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,350
Are you watering your plants?

66
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,050
What?

67
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,900
How’d you know that?

68
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,800
(How’s the orchid doing?)

69
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,700
Well…

70
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,280
Now that I have time to take care of it,

71
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,200
it refuses to bloom.

72
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,500
Playing hard to get, I’ll bet.

73
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,150
And you?

74
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,300
How are you? Are you okay?

75
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,900
I was up late.

76
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,750
(What for?)

77
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,570
Trying to get a job.

78
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,200
You’re a talented person
and you will find work soon.

79
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,010
They’ll hire you the minute they see
your handsome profile on LinkedIn.

80
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,400
You’re good at this, huh.

81
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,810
Oh, I finished your drawing.

82
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,900
I’ll show you some time.

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,920
Really?

84
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,700
When can I see you?

85
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,930
Tomorrow.

86
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,500
Wanna meet up?

87
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,350
Hold on. I think Ing is calling me.

88
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,100
I have to talk to her about some job.

89
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,200
I have to go.

90
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,630
Okay. Of course.

91
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,350
I’ll talk to you later.

92
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,580
Hey, dude!

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,700
Dude!

94
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,350
I–I–I got a callback!

95
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,150
They want me to audition.

96
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,500
They’ll send me the script soon.

97
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,000
You help me read my lines, alright?

98
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,900
I’ll get hired before you do!

99
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,850
Oh, idiot.

100
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,049
An audition is basically just an interview.

101
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,630
Don’t act like you’re already hired.

102
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,700
Well, what about you?

103
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,970
You been hearing back from anyone yet?

104
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,400
I would have if I wanted to, jerk.

105
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,250
You would, huh?

106
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,280
I think we need to change the hairstyle.

107
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,400
Straighten it.

108
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,830
Excuse me.

109
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,810
What are you calling me so early
in the morning for?

110
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,100
Hey. I need your help.

111
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes?

112
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,200
I was talking to Pheem
and told him you were calling me.

113
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,980
I’m afraid Mawin might find this out later.

114
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,300
Can you cover up for me?

115
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,770
Sorry. What?

116
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,500
I don’t get it.

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,700
So you were talking to Pheem?

118
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,300
Who did you lie to?

119
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,250
Pheem?

120
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,300
I lied to Pheem that you were calling me,

121
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,250
but I am actually with Koh.

122
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,600
(I don’t want Pheem getting suspicious
and ask Mawin to look into this.)

123
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,400
And I told Koh that I was
on the phone with you,

124
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,300
but I was actually talking to Pheem.

125
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,500
Enough. Stop it.

126
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,250
You and your multiple men.

127
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,500
I’m confused.

128
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,700
Just wrap it up and tell me
what you need me to do.

129
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,100
Let’s say, no matter who’s calling you,

130
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,250
just tell them you were just on the phone
with me about some job.

131
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,630
And you need to keep
talking to me for a bit

132
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,400
because I need to walk in sounding like
I really have been talking to you.

133
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,200
Alright?

134
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,330
Yeah.

135
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
It’s always gotta be my job.

136
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,630
I’m ready.

137
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,610
(Action.)

138
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,500
Okay.

139
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,900
(What should I talk about?)

140
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,400
Animal?

141
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,600
Bitch!

142
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,350
Do you have to get me involved
in your two-timing?

143
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,300
Hey.

144
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,660
Can you save the insult for later?
I wasn’t prepared for that.

145
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,850
(But you deserve it.)

146
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,350
Fine.

147
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,570
Whoever calls me after this, I’ll lie.

148
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,700
(Okay?)

149
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,200
Thank you.

150
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,600
Let me buy you dinner or something.

151
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,900
Bye.

152
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,700
Sorry about that.

153
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,100
We got caught up a little bit.

154
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,550
Your breakfast.

155
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,900
You can take a shower after you eat.

156
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,740
Where should I sit?

157
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,500
Look at the state of your room.

158
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,850
You can sit anywhere you want.

159
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,500
You’re not busy today.

160
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,270
That’s right.

161
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,300
I’ll go home after I eat.

162
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,890
Let’s visit my childhood home.

163
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,020
Why?

164
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,070
I want you to.

165
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,350
You should know I don’t let
a whole lot of people there.

166
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,250
I’ll take it as work.

167
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,500
Do I get paid?

168
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,550
I’m only asking you to accompany me.

169
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,350
So come with me.

170
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,850
How do you actually feel about me?

171
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,700
You’ve been acting contradictory lately.

172
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,250
You said you don’t like me.

173
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,650
I said that?

174
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,800
Yes, you did.

175
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,230
Well, I guess I wasn’t telling the truth.

176
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,700
Then tell me the truth.

177
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,300
The truth is simple enough…

178
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,170
Yeah.

179
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,730
I like you.

180
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,650
Will you come with me?

181
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,900
This is your house?

182
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,750
Yeah, it is.

183
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,940
Why?

184
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,680
It resembles a factory more than a house.

185
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,530
You’re exactly right.

186
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,750
It used to be a fabric factory.

187
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,650
You see that over there?

188
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,020
That was the sewing room.

189
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,180
The sound of the machine
used to be so loud,

190
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,810
but I loved it.

191
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,650
The uncles and aunties who worked here
would work and eat in that room.

192
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,450
I always came and talked
to them after school.

193
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,290
Does that mean Baby Koh was friendly?

194
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,400
It sounds like you were a lovely kid.

195
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,650
I don’t know about that.

196
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,500
But that was my childhood.

197
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,230
This place was actually
sold to someone else

198
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,100
when my family was going to court.

199
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,600
But when I had enough money,

200
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,800
I bought it back.

201
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,520
I’m gonna renovate it

202
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,740
or just knock it all down
and rebuild the whole thing.

203
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,300
I want to start on a clean slate.

204
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,600
But I still haven’t
come up with any ideas.

205
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,100
What do you think?

206
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,900
I want it to be somewhere
you’d want to live in.

207
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,230
Are you…

208
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,470
Asking me to move in?

209
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,930
Yes.

210
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,500
I need time to decide.

211
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,270
Okay.

212
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,650
While I wait for you to decide,

213
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,300
can you tell me how I can
improve this place?

214
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,150
I need some ideas from an artist like you.

215
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,240
I want it to look good.

216
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,250
Don’t think about what I like.

217
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,770
Just focus on you.

218
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,700
What do you like?

219
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,450
You remember what I told you?

220
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,500
How I used to love sleeping on
a pile of laundry?

221
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,850
That’s what I like.

222
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,900
Can you show me?

223
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,280
Let’s go.

224
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,750
You had to walk up four levels
every day as a kid?

225
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah.

226
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,450
The first floor was our factory.

227
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,850
The second and third floors
were our office.

228
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,250
My parents and I
lived on the fourth floor.

229
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,950
Not the best weather to walk around, huh.

230
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,750
Yeah.

231
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,900
Wait here.

232
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,500
I’ll grab an umbrella.

233
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,050
We don’t want you
getting sick now, do we?

234
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,900
Come on.

235
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,339
This was my bedroom.

236
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,849
I came back to sleep here a few times.

237
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,300
But I still couldn’t sleep.

238
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,630
So I never came back here again.

239
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,510
To be honest,

240
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,089
I don’t think I can sleep anywhere anymore

241
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,750
unless you’re with me.

242
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,850
There’s a leak.

243
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah.

244
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,670
It’s raining.

245
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,700
I think there’s a leak in the roof.

246
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,050
What’s that?

247
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,300
My camping set.

248
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,350
You liked camping?

249
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, with my dad.

250
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,630
Wait here.

251
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,550
I’ll go check the rooftop.

252
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,400
Mom.

253
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,150
What would you say

254
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,750
that I brought someone home today?

255
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,150
You told me not to trust people.

256
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,290
And I’ve always tried to do that…

257
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,630
But would it be okay, just this once,

258
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,170
for me to trust someone?

259
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,300
Please don’t be mad at me, Mom.

260
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,570
When I’m with him, I’m really happy.

261
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,570
Maybe it’s because I haven’t been
with someone in a long time,

262
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,600
and he was there at the right moment,

263
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,530
but I just want to take risks with him.

264
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,650
I don’t care if someone calls me an idiot

265
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,650
or if I end up like Dad.

266
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,350
I don’t even know how this will end,

267
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,500
but I will accept it regardless.

268
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,320
Did you get it done?

269
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,950
It’s still leaking, though.

270
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,400
No.

271
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,950
I couldn’t find the key to the rooftop.

272
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,730
I think I’ll just try to climb up there
from the balcony.

273
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,710
You sure it’s alright?

274
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,200
Of course. I got this.

275
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,070
Hey.

276
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,670
What are you doing out here?

277
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,970
Just get down from there.
It’s too dangerous.

278
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,550
You should get back inside.

279
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,750
You’ll get soaked.

280
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,700
Hey.

281
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
Come back inside with me.

282
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,150
I’m worried about you.

283
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,510
Did you say you’re worried about me?

284
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,330
Yes.

285
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,700
Why’d you throw them there?

286
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,200
I want to sleep like I did
when I was a kid.

287
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
You want to take a nap with me?

288
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,850
Besides work,

289
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,900
what do you like about me?

290
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,050
You’re pretty.

291
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,400
What do you like about me?

292
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,000
When did I ever say I like you?

293
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,450
Your body

294
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,980
is more honest than your words.

295
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,650
Are you a physical therapist or something?

296
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,450
You tired?

297
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,990
Wanna do that again?

298
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,510
Maybe later.

299
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,870
Hey.

300
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,200
I’m thinking about opening
an art space or a gallery.

301
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,000
What do you think?

302
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,050
What got into you?

303
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,000
I’m just thinking of
the old townhouse areas in London.

304
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,800
Soho and Shoreditch, you know?

305
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,900
This neighborhood is full of
old townhouses, too.

306
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,130
We can start from one building

307
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,200
and then slowly expand into a community.

308
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,900
I think it’s pretty interesting.

309
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,470
Someone like you supporting art?

310
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,330
What evil plan do you have in mind?

311
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,600
Just be honest with me.

312
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,500
You’re right.

313
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,050
I’m trying this new technology with Hive.

314
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,900
If things go well,

315
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,700
I’ll sell everything
by the end of the year.

316
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,900
Why do you want to sell it?

317
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
It’s practically minting money
for you, isn’t it?

318
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,600
Let me explain it like this.

319
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,470
It’s a cycle of my start-up businesses.

320
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,700
I build it up and sell it for some profit,

321
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,700
and it gives me more than breakeven.

322
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,900
Hive is not entirely flawless,
legally speaking.

323
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,150
So it’s best if I sell it
before things get exposed.

324
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,600
I’ll hibernate and stay lowkey
from then on.

325
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,670
What?

326
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,600
Are you a toad?

327
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,900
No.

328
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,980
It’s just a typical cycle.

329
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,980
Whenever I sell some shady businesses,

330
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,550
I have to keep a low profile and stay inside

331
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,670
to avoid getting washed in pee, shot,
or made to disappear.

332
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,200
You can hide with me here.

333
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,470
Hey.

334
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,800
You want me to die here?

335
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,200
What if we were chatting and some sniper
went “pew, pew, pew, argh!”?

336
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,600
We’ll all be dead.

337
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,600
I won’t let that happen.

338
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,950
We can just live our lives.

339
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,700
Let someone renovate
the empty space downstairs

340
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,980
while we cuddle up up here.

341
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,500
We can screw all day.

342
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,900
You can keep painting my nudes.

343
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,350
I’ll hire some curator to curate your work,

344
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,600
and we can finally open a gallery.

345
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,300
So you’re looking to use art
to launder money?

346
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,300
Won’t it be better to do something else?

347
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,050
You’ll be able to sleep with no paranoia.

348
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,300
I can sleep as long as I have you.

349
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,970
It depends on you.

350
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,450
Are you interested?

351
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,830
Reality is brutal, isn’t it?

352
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,800
Why are you here?

353
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,530
What the hell did you come back here for?

354
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,000
I came back for you.

355
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
I thought you wanted to see me.

356
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,550
Don’t flatter yourself.

357
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,700
No one wants to see you!

358
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,200
Really?

359
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,800
Don’t you know that my parents
are sleeping upstairs?

360
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,800
They thought you left.

361
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,150
I wanted to surprise you.

362
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,500
I can shout for my papa.

363
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,000
He can see you with his own eyes.

364
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,600
You wouldn’t dare.

365
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,980
Are you trying to blackmail me
into falling in love with you?

366
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,000
Let me tell you right now
that it won’t work.

367
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,250
Don’t you realize what you’re doing?

368
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,070
You know what I want.

369
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,570
Just let me have it.

370
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,170
I…

371
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,400
Hold up.

372
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,450
Just let me have it.

373
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,400
It ain’t hard to do.

374
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,350
Just go back.

375
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,450
Or else I’ll have to…

376
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
What are you gonna do?

377
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,090
I’ll have to kill you!

378
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:03,900
Sorry, man.

379
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,100
-I’m sorry.
-Oh, you jerk.

380
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,680
Let’s try again.

381
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,600
I was finally able to stay in character.

382
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,200
Can you please read the lines through
to the very end?

383
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,980
Okay.

384
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,870
I’m sorry.

385
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,710
Let’s do it again.

386
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,370
I won’t laugh now.

387
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,440
-Come on.
-Again?

388
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,400
Let’s start again.

389
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,100
I’ll have to kill you!

390
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
But if you do that,

391
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,700
you’ll go to jail.

392
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,950
I hate you.

393
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,350
I hate us.

394
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,980
I hate our relationship.

395
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,500
Shit.

396
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,780
Shit.

397
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,810
Alright.

398
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,230
Crap.

399
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,170
I can’t do this.

400
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,930
Honestly? This script is shit!

401
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,600
You really think you’re gonna
start your acting career off with this?

402
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,350
Oh, jerk.

403
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,500
If you’re not gonna help,
at least don’t look down on me.

404
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,180
Come on. Let’s try one more time.

405
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,980
No way.

406
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,200
Your acting is the same every time.

407
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,980
I think your chance of getting
this role is below 1%.

408
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,600
I’ll take that 1%.

409
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,850
At least it would be 1% higher chance
than you getting together with Jira.

410
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh, asshole.

411
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,100
Take it back right now.

412
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,900
You take it back. You started it!

413
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,800
What the fuck is wrong with you?

414
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,500
It’s not like my words are gonna
make it true, you know?

415
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,230
You know how to read palms, dude.

416
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,250
Your words have power.

417
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,900
Fine. Alright.

418
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,410
I’m sorry.

419
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,100
I take it back.

420
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,500
But honestly, you don’t think
you’re too serious about this?

421
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,400
You’ve never acted before, you know?

422
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,250
But I can try it out, right?

423
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,400
I have my connection.

424
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,400
If it doesn’t work out,

425
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,970
I’ll just let it go.

426
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
How nice that would be.

427
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,980
Whatever you think or do,
you can move on just like that.

428
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,050
Well, you should learn to do that, too.

429
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,270
You’re attached.

430
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,840
With Jira, for example.

431
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,950
If he doesn’t reciprocate your feelings,
just find someone else.

432
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,000
He said he’d draw me.

433
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,200
He’s going to show me
my painting tomorrow.

434
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,460
Your painting from the rage room?

435
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,300
Yeah.

436
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,740
He said he was inspired
when he saw me wreck things.

437
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,600
I can’t wait to see how he’d paint that.

438
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,550
What do you think?

439
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,750
This guy sure plays
with your feelings, doesn’t he?

440
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,250
Only because I let him.

441
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
You love getting played or something?

442
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,750
In both your work life and love life.

443
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,090
Yeah, I get it.

444
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,100
You don’t just heal from
Stockholm syndrome.

445
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,400
It’s like I’m talking to empty air.

446
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,050
Jerk.

447
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Just wait and see.

448
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,650
I’ll be the one playing
with his feelings next time.

449
00:31:59,390 --> 00:31:59,980
What’s wrong?

450
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,300
I’m worn out.

451
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,800
What do you mean?

452
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,500
I’m just tired.

453
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,600
Are you now?

454
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, you’re gonna be even more tired.

455
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,600
Hey.

456
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,800
Hey.

457
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,200
What are you playing?

458
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,390
Let me go.

459
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,200
No way.

460
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,400
Drink with me tonight.

461
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,300
No.

462
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,300
Why?

463
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,630
You don’t drink?

464
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,100
I’m a major drinker, mind you.

465
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,750
I just don’t think
I should drink with you.

466
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,550
My friend said I never think whenI speak
when I’m drunk.

467
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,300
I’ve got a loose-tongued, she said.

468
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,130
It’s alright.

469
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,400
I like it.

470
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,900
Are you trying to get me drunk right away?

471
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,500
Hey.

472
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,410
Do you want to pass out again?

473
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,600
I just want to make up
for not dancing with you that day.

474
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,020
Hey.

475
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,250
Don’t get handsy now.

476
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,030
Sorry. I’m drunk.

477
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,200
How can you be drunk?

478
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,790
You just started.

479
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,230
You getting moody already?

480
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,350
Let’s reset your mood.

481
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,310
♪ What can I even do ♪

482
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,900
♪ Can I ask you to stay ♪

483
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,150

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,520

♪ Make you pick me over her ♪

487
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,900

489
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,540
Hey!

490
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,290
Are you trying to piss me off?

491
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,530
You’re pissed off now?

492
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,900
Drink this whole thing.

493
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,980
What the fuck are you looking at?

494
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,300
You know,

495
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,300
when I first stepped foot into this room,

496
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,700
I didn’t think I’d have to be
whatever the hell Mr. K is.

497
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,850
I thought you wanted to pay me
to sleep with you.

498
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,700
But let me–let me tell you one thing.

499
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,400
I ain’t someone who lets people do
whatever they please with me.

500
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,450
I only let you have your way

501
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,300
because you’re hot.

502
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,850
Your friend is absolutely right.

503
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,900
About what?

504
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,400
You do have a loose tongue
when you’re drunk.

505
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,230
Who’s drunk?

506
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,930
I don’t see anyone drunk around here.

507
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,950
Did you ever blabber about me
when you’re out drinking?

508
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,100
You… Don’t you flatter yourself.

509
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,400
Alright?

510
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,400
What kind of man do you think I am?

511
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,300
An asshole.

512
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,800
Can I ask you something?

513
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,150
Go on.

514
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,610
If you think I’m such an asshole,

515
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,400
will you leave me?

516
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,200
I haven’t figured that out.

517
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,600
I don’t know.

518
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,300
If I’d had enough, I would leave.

519
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,500
What do you care?

520
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,100
You’ll replace me with someone.

521
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,100
But I don’t think I can replace you.

522
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,300
Ew.

523
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,270
I mean it.

524
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,800
What do you mean?

525
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,900
After everything we did,

526
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,900
should we just start dating?

527
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:22,970
Hey.

528
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,970
Hey.

529
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,300
Hey.

530
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,650
Hey.

531
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,600
You’re not going to bed?

532
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,850
You’re up already?

533
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,400
It’s only been a few hours
since you fell asleep.

534
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,950
Did I talk a lot when I was drunk?

535
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,100
A whole lot.

536
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,300
But I’m not gonna tell you.

537
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
It’s my precious secret now.

538
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,050
You’re not done with that?

539
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,540
Yeah.

540
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,820
You’re gonna pay more attention to
these metal scraps than me?

541
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,150
Careful.

542
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,600
These are delicate things.

543
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,600
You’ll ruin them.

544
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,700
Is that so?

545
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,450
What about this?

546
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,000
Is this delicate?

547
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,370
What do you think?

548
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,620
Delicate and strong.

549
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,850
Why else would I draw it?

550
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,550
Can I see it again?

551
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,500
Can you wait until I finish
assembling this?

552
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,870
Of course.

553
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,100
Let me make you finish once

554
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,980
before you get back to work.

555
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,600
It’s okay.

556
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,300
I’ll buy a new one if this one’s ruined.

557
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,490
PHEEM: YOU UP?
WHERE SHOULD WE MEET TONIGHT?

558
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,100
If these two men were paintings,

559
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,750
which one do you like better?

560
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,800
Why are you so nice today?

561
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,300
You agree to everything I suggest.

562
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,610
Honeymoon phase.

563
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,500
It’ll expire soon.

564
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,410
Why does it sound like we’re dating?

565
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:11,850
Aren’t we?

566
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,300
You’ll get tired of Koh one day.

567
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,300
He only loves you as long as
you’re useful to him.

568
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,200
Flowers often represent genitals.

569
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,400
It’s not strange if you get aroused
looking at it.
