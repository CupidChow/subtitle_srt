00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,060
Mr. K, hello.

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,260
Can you see me?

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,660
Yes.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,980
Excuse me for not turning on
my camera today.

5
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,660
You’re a first-timer here, I take it?

6
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,340
What’s your name?

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,460
Jira.

[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH / GUN ATTHAPHAN AS JIRA]

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,300
The story begins
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH / GUN ATTHAPHAN AS JIRA]

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,020
when Jira gets laid off from work.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,100
He’s looking for a job.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,180
So now he’s doing odd jobs.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,780
He goes to auditions. He’s an escort.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,460
He does everything because he’s broke.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,980
While he’s at work one day,
he runs into this guy.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,460
He thinks Jira’s amazing.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,480
He isn’t afraid to use his words.

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,130
He wears…

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,060
-He’s not afraid to dress up.
-He’s not afraid to dress up.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,620
So he thinks Jira could be his nominee.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,380
And Jira gets the job.

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,580
That’s how we meet.

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:29,140
This character, Koh, is from
a somewhat well-to-do family.
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH]

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,020
They own a clothing factory.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,180
One day, the parents,
who own the business,

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,259
can no longer afford it.

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,060
So someone takes over their business.

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,420
That’s when Koh starts his own business,
a commercial application.

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,420
It’s a startup, kind of.

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,880
Koh hates meeting people.

31
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,900
He hates the consequences of
meeting people.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,380
He’s paranoid so he needs
someone to represent him.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,380
Someone who’s his face
and does things in his stead.

34
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,660
To be Koh’s nominee,
one must be able to do everything.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,860
No questions.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,360
He’s just ordering Jira around
on a wire, with a headphone in his ears.

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,660
He has to do everything in Koh’s stead.

38
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,900
He totally represents Koh.

39
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,740
I want you to be Mr. K.

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,700
What’s that?

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,500
That’s me. Kor.

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,180
I want you to do my business for me.

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,860
Why not just do it yourself?

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,700
I hate people.

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,020
Too much drama.

46
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,220
Too much chaos.

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,300
But before I meet him,
I already meet Dew.

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,300
You meet him first.

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,380
Jira’s burnt out so he goes to a bar.

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,660
He meets a guy who’s exactly his type,
who talks nice and looks nice.

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,140
They’re flirting a bit.

52
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,900
When you order a drink,

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,980
you’ll be given a table number.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,020
Another customer will be chosen
randomly to sit with you.

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,540
You’ll get to talk to a fellow
burnt out individual.

56
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,700
It’s a two-way therapy
to share your sorrows.

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,740
Someone who’s burnt out is a working adult
who works himself so much

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,980
he’s no longer passionate.

59
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,620
He’s exhausted.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,420
It’s quite common for this generation.

61
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,579
So I feel like this story is about
three people who are burnt out

62
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,820
and fall for each other.

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,660
It’s not this kind of love.

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,060
It starts off quite roughly.

65
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,900
They go through this and that,
and burst it out on each other.

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,780
Love just happens along the way.

67
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,940
When I was at the restaurant?

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,740
I was just there for the vibes,

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,500
and for people watching.

70
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,140
But someone caught my attention.

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,060
I play Koh.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,480
Koh is the CEO of
a fashion store platform/application.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,060
But he likes to remain anonymous.

74
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,779
He hates socializing.

75
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
He hates meeting people.

76
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,380
So whether in meetings or at award shows,
he needs someone to represent him.

77
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,500
His personality?

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,980
He’s mysterious.

79
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,940
He hides his feelings.

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,140
He doesn’t say everything
that’s on his mind,

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,140
with everyone in his life.

82
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,300
With Pheem, for example,
or Jira, and whoever is in his life.

83
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,220
Those people feel uncomfortable with him.

84
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,260
I think so.

85
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,540
Working with him makes
Jira think this guy’s a mystery.

86
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,860
From the surface, he doesn’t seem
to care about anything.

He doesn’t care for people.
[GUN ATTHAPHAN AS JIRA]

88
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,140
He likes being alone.

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,140
He doesn't associate himself with anyone.

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,300
Jira doesn’t know
how to read him at first.

91
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,860
Because he thinks Koh’s heartless
and relentless.

92
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Jira thinks he’s going to
get fired at every turn.

93
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,540
You’re the first person to buy my work.

94
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,100
What do you see in it?

95
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,020
What about you?

96
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,860
Why do you want to draw me?

97
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,260
The hardest part of playing Koh
is the preparation.

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,540
I have to work out
to be confident for this role.

99
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,860
That’s the hard part.

100
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,659
I was told that by the director, P’Nuchy.

101
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,260
She was like, “You have to do it.

102
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,220
If you can’t, you have to quit.”

103
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,520
I know she didn’t mean
to fire me for real,

104
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,180
but it was such a good motivation.

105
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,659
I pushed myself.

106
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,380
If no one had said that to me,
I wouldn’t have done it, or even tried it.

107
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,460
So the preparation for the role
was quite tough.

108
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,480
He did so well at getting fit.

109
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,060
He was smaller than me at one point.

110
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,540
His waist is smaller now.

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,620
I have to respect his determination.

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,820
Before this series,
usually he would buy snacks on set,

113
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,140
but he resisted it throughout this show.

114
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,080
He only—

115
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,660
-I eat fish.
-He only eats fish now.

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,740
I have to learn AI terms,
and tech terms,

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,700
so that I speak more naturally.

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,540
I also admire a lot of the art in the story.

119
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,980
The names of the artists and such,
how they paint, when they were born,

120
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,860
the titles of their paintings.

121
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,060
There are a lot of specifications
like that in the series.

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,980
It was quite difficult for me.

123
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,900
Koh and P’Off are totally different.
[EMI THASORN AS ING]

124
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,540
P’Off isn’t a poser at all,
[EMI THASORN AS ING]

125
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,780
but Koh is like…

126
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,460
He speaks slower.

127
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,460
He sounds calm.

128
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,300
It’s like his head
is always full of ideas.

129
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
I get that part.

130
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,820
Meanwhile, P’Off is such a force.

131
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,020
He’s loud and straightforward.

132
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,940
He’s like that.

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,780
I play Jira in this series.

134
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,540
You’ll see from the beginning
that Jira just lost his job.

135
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:34,060
Jira is working on getting hired,
but nothing comes through.

136
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,740
He goes to a friend for advice,

137
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,740
and his friend recommends him
for auditions and escort work.

138
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,260
Jira needs money for rent and stuff.

139
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,980
So he does whatever he can for money.

140
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,900
But actually Jira is an artist.

141
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,340
He loves drawing.

142
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,420
He’s good at art.

143
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,220
But he lacks passion and doesn’t
live up to his own expectations.

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,940
I think Jira is straightforward.

145
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,380
He is loyal to his friends.

146
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,260
He doesn’t take anything lying down.

147
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,100
He’s not afraid to clap back if someone
says something unkind to him.

148
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,980
Jira is straightforward.

149
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,140
He says what he thinks.

150
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,420
He’s not beating around the bush.

151
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,260
He’s addicted to social media.

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,100
He is always posting something.
Just like all of us.

153
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,740
Do you happen to…

154

155
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,180
Jira is an artist.
[DEW JIRAWAT AS PHEEM]

156
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,419
He trusts his emotions.

157
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,820
He leads his life by emotions.

158
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,179
If he doesn’t like something,
he won’t do it.

159
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,700
Jira is a fussy friend.

160
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,059
He’s always…

161
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,500
doubting this and that.

162
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,340
He’s not all that confident.

163
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,780
But as his friend, I’ll be like, “You can do it.”

164
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,220
“Try it first. Give it a go.”

165
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,860
I’d be the one making decisions for him.

166
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,820
Jira seems like a kid with me.

167
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,970
He’s always looking for assurances.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,340
So I’d give him a pat on the back and an order.

169
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,460
You want me to be…

170

You?

171
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,180
The hard part of playing this role is
speaking more seriously.

172
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,860
Right.

173
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,260
I have to learn how to draw a little.

174
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,860
Like how to hold a pen
and how to use tools.

175
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,260
I can’t act too boyish.

176
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,780
I have to make everything sound serious.

177
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,460
When talking about something serious,
I have to take it seriously.

178
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,780
I learned from P’Nuchy, actually.

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,460
She often said, “Take me as your model.

180
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,060
You’re playing someone like me.”

181
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
It’s like P’Gun has a switch.

182
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,740
When we start filming, his eyes
would be immediately full of emotions.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,660
I steal that from him all the time.

184
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,660
I match his energy.

185
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,660
P’Gun is so nice. He has always been.

186
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
He’s so easygoing, like me.

187
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,500
He’s also funny.

188
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,820
We break character laughing quite often.

189
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,820
I thought he’d be a more serious person,

190
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,820
but as it turned out,
he’s pretty laid back.

191
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,380
I think Gun fleshed out Jira in a way that
is unlike any of his other characters.

192
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,420
I think he’s way more b*tchy than most.

193
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,580
He doesn’t hold back at all.

194
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:26,020
I haven’t seen something like this
from Gun before, let’s say.

195
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,260
Tell me who the hell you are.

196
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,460
Will I keep being targeted like this?

197
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,620
No drama. No empathy.

198
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,580
No giving in.

199
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,580
And no arguing.

200
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,780
Between us, I think our dynamic
at work is still the same.

201
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,740
The hard part,
I think, lies in the characters.

202
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,100
This is quite new to us.

203
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,380
We both think it’s unusual,
especially the first scenes.

204
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,740
The lines don’t sound natural at first.

205
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,820
Right.

206
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,660
I feel like the chemistry
between Off-Gun in this series

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,660
is different from what I saw before.

208
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,660
It’s like watching
two people full of ego talk.

209
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,380
They’re just trying to one up each other.

210
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,660
It’s like they’re splitting fire,

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,400
but then you can feel the heat
coming off of them both.

212
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,340
Your heart will beat so fast.

213
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,540
It makes you feel like,
“Oh? What’s going on here?”

214
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,820
It’s different from what I was used to.

215
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,200
Your palm says
you’re getting a new job soon.

216
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,050
But…

217
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,400
It’s going to be hard-earned,

218
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,980
and likely bringing you a lot of mishaps.

219
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,140
I play Pheem.
[DEW JIRAWAT AS PHEEM]

220
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,860
He’s an IT guy working at Koh’s company.
[DEW JIRAWAT AS PHEEM]

221
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,180
Pheem is a man with good taste.

222
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,420
He’s smart.

223
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,500
He’s mature.

224
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,860
He’s neat.

225
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,300
Pheem has been Koh’s friend
since childhood.

226
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,860
They started the company together.

227
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,820
Pheem works in IT.
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH]

228
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,740
I’m kind of his employer.

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,700
Pheem is the head of
the IT department and I trust him.

230
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,900
Whatever happens,
I go to Pheem for advice.

231
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,100
He’s an IT developer for a company.

232
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,020
He’s not part of the commercial side
of the company,

233
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,100
but the technical side,
setting up systems and stuff.

234
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,900
He’s a well-mannered guy,

235
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,500
and an organized boss.

236
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,180
He has his routine.

237
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,900
He’s decisive, but not mean.

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,700
You’ll see that his team loves him.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,540
I meet Pheem for the first time
at Burnout Bar.
[GUN ATTHAPHAN AS JIRA]

240
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,380
We get to talk and
we breach each other’s walls.

241
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,580
We both feel like we can really talk.

242
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,460
Our conversations just flow.

243
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:57,380
His perfect appearances, his height,
everything about him is Jira’s type.

244
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,220
He’s what Jira likes.

245
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,460
Jira likes him from the start,

246
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,460
and lets him give him a ride home
on their first night.

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,300
Jira suspects that Pheem
may have feelings for him.

248
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,180
Yo.

249
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,780
Wanna come over to my place tonight?

250
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,780
This is so unfamiliar to me,
but I’m not saying I don’t get it.

251
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,420
Mainly, it’s Pheem’s way of talking.

252
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,980
This is someone who’s comfortable
making conversations with strangers.

253
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,140
That’s what I think.

254
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,860
I think who Pheem is depends
quite a bit on who he’s with.

255
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,380
But I think, you—

256
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,340
Pheem’s dialogues are usually very long.

257
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,020
It shows you how it looks like
when two people click

258
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,300
or how Pheem approaches someone.

259
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,820
Pheem has become
the in-house therapist, kind of.
[THOR THINNAPHAN AS BEN]

260
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,620
He frequents the place
and has become a regular.

261
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,780
Customers who are burnt out
and meet Pheem

262
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,140
want to come back to meet him again,
because he gives good advice.

263
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,940
I usually help other people heal.

264
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,780
But this one…

265
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
He heals me.

266
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,900
I think Dew is a much improved
actor than he ever was.
[AJ CHAYAPOL AS MAWIN]

267
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,140
He’s more mature now.

268
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,540
He’s really good.

269
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,220
He’s very determined. I like his acting.

270
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,660
His acting is great.

271
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,100
He embodies the feelings.

272
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,890
When he talks to the director,
whoever that is,

273
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,100
he’d ask detailed questions
even in acting classes.

274
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,780
He’d ask about character research,

275
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,980
or what to study to embody the character.

276
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,820
He’s really determined.

277
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,980
I do think Dew is amazing.

278
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,180
You’re the first person to buy my work.

279
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,380
Will you draw me like you do Koh?

280
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,050
I don’t like betrayal.

281
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,380
It’s f*cked up.

282
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,220
The chemistry between these three?

283
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,460
I think it’s quite new.

284
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,740
You’ve seen P’Off and P’Gun working
together countless times before,

285
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,700
but in this series, with Dew also there,

286
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,780
it’s even more interesting.

287
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,180
Like this?

288
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh, you think so?

289
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,060
Is that what you wanna do?

290
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,980
I feel like Dew and P’Gun’s chemistry…

291
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,980
surprises me a bit.

292
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,050
You know it makes Koh feel uneasy
when he sees Jira with Pheem.

293
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,380
When Jira is with Pheem,
he’s more mellow.

294
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,940
I’d be wary if I were Koh.

295
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,540
Pheem also comes on very strong.

296
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,350
He aims to get what he wants.

297
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,420
He doesn’t care who he’s up against.

298
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,260
So I think these two
make very interesting rivals.

299
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,580
Of course it’s different from my previous series.

300
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,780
Pheem is my best friend.

301
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,420
I’ve never played a character

302
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,420
where the character and his bestie
want the same person.

303
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,020
It’s new to me.

304
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,820
With Pheem being a hot nerd and such,

305
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,860
he’s different from my character.

306
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:01,500
So I guess he panics and has to come up
with plans to disrupt these two.

307
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,500
Someone like you

308
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,700
likes someone awful.

309
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,860
A jerk, a bad boy, a prick,

310
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,980
like Koh.

311
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,820
He’s exactly that.

312
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,500
I play Ing in the series.

313
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,300
Her name is Ing.

314
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,540
Ing is Jira’s biggest supporter.

315
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,260
She’s his best friend.

316
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,740
She's a full-time casting director.

317
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,620
But she has a second job,
stems from her personal interests,

318
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,900
you can say it’s her passion,
which is a curator.

319
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,570
This character is self-confident.

320
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,300
She’s an extrovert.

321
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,780
She’s not afraid to speak her mind
and act on her desires.

322
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,980
She’s confident in her advice
to her friend,

323
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,860
telling him to do this and that.

324
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,780
She’s a bit controlling.

325
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,020
Ing is Jira’s best friend.

326
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,940
I think he trusts her the most.
He’s only got just her, anyway.

327
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,940
He doesn’t have a lot of friends.

328
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,980
This is his best friend.

329
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,980
She’d lend money and find work for Jira.

330
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,579
She’s the friend Jira goes to
for everything.

331
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,339
A jerk, a bad boy, a prick,

332
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,940
like Koh.

333
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,740
The hard part of playing Ing is that…

334
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,339
Her lines are all so long.

335
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,490
Each character has their expertise
in a different field.

336
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,300
As a curator, I have to be able
to explain what Ing does.

337
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,830
Her lines are 7-8-line long.

338
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,900
The fun part is that I don’t have to
stick strictly to the words,

339
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,900
as long as I know
what a curator really does,

340
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,220
what the duty is.

341
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,900
Once I did some research
on what a curator is,

342
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,420
how they talk, what they do,

343
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,860
I feel like it’s more fun
and natural to play this role.

344
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,420
The character is such a confident
expert on her field of interest.

345
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,900
After doing some workshops with P’Nuchy,
she’s given me many inspirations

346
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,260
and I think that’s very interesting.

347
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,710
She’s such a natural at this.

348
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,140
It’s like the role
was written just for Emi.

349
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,580
She speaks every line
as if it’s her own words.

350
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,460
Emi is also a very charming actor.

351
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,900
Emi once played my older sister.

352
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,860
Right.

353
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,420
Now she plays my best friend.

354
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,580
Every time I’m on screen with Emi,

355
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,820
there’s not a single difficult moment.

356
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,500
I think Emi is amazing, and I know
she’s done her research well.

357
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,780
She’s also very nice.

358
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,700
I can always work so easily with her.

359
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,660
And I have fun every time
we’re working together.

360
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,140
Tell me who the hell you are.

361
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,460
Will I keep being targeted like this?

362
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,940
I play Mawin.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,340
Mawin is an expert on IT.

364
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,460
He knows a lot about
technology and programmes.

365
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,660
He also takes his job really seriously.

366
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,380
He’s loyal to his friends.

367
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,580
There are also other employees
in the department,

368
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,640
and we all know each other.

369
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,000
But Dew’s character is my closest friend

370
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,540
so I always go to him
about issues and stuff.

371
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,660
They always work together
to solve problems,

372
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,740
whether it’s external or internal.

373
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,540
Mawin is my closest colleague
at the office,

374
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,060
though he’s also my employee.

375
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,260
He’s one of the people affected by
the coming of AI.

376
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,180
Mawin kinda represents office workers.

377
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,180
He’s just a working adult affected
by decisions made by his higher-ups.

378
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
His personality?

379
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,620
When he sets his mind
to something, he goes for it.

380
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,860
When he makes up his mind,
no one can stop him.

381
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,780
He’s reckless.

382
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,460
Once he sets his mind to something,
he won’t take failure as an option.

383
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,260
I find his seriousness a bit funny.

384
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,380
When he takes things so seriously,
it borders on being comedic.

385
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,540
His mindset, his idea of getting results
can sometimes be comedic.

386
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,940
AJ and Mawin are one and the same.

387
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,940
AJ does such a good job portraying Mawin.

388
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,060
He did quite a lot of improvisation.

389
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,780
I broke character laughing.

390
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,740
It’s good for him.

391
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,860
But, like, tone it down, dude.

392
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,260
Look at AJ.

393
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,860
Look at his face.

394
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,180
To be honest, I broke character laughing
because of AJ too many times.

395
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,160
When we’re in a scene together—

396
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,180
There’s this one scene where
he has to hype his friend, Dew, up,

397
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,500
and he didn’t hold back at all.

398
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,980
These two have worked together
multiple times.

399
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,340
And they’re playing
best friends again in this series.

400
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,580
They act like two best friends
at a muay thai event.

401
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,580
They play around.

402
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I laughed so much.

403
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,300
With AJ, our chemistry as friends
just works out so well.

404
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,060
I love it.

405
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,540
We get along so well.

406
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,100
Come on. Get up!

407
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,780
Go on!

408
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,900
Mawin knows all about programming
and knows all these technical terms.

409
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,540
I don’t.

410
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,780
I have to do some research on
online business models and programming.

411
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,300
Things like lingos and such.

412
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,080
I believe if I know these things, I’d be able
to relate more to this character.

413
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,500
That will help me in
embodying the character, too.

414
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,260
I’ll have a better
understanding of his life.

415
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,400
I didn’t think Mawin is
a complex guy at first,

416
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,580
but when he’s at his turning point
when he gets laid off,

417
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,620
he’s unemployed now,

418
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,860
he’s become burnt out and lost his will.

419
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,540
I’ve never gone through
anything like that,

420
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,300
so to experience this through him,

421
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,820
I get to be in the headspace of someone
who’s going through this problem.

422
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,060
He’s trying to survive.

423
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,140
He’s looking for inspiration.

424
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,700
It’s a new perspective
about Mawin I get to learn.

425
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,260
So it’s quite deep.

426
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,500
Fine. I’ll handle it.

427
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,660
Don’t worry.

428
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,410
Burnout Bar is a place for people
who are burnt out.

429
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,100
It’s not exactly for dating purposes.
[EMI THASRON AS ING]

430
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:55,140
But when you get to talk
to a random stranger,
[EMI THASRON AS ING]

431
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,460
sometimes you get some
new inspiration from it.
[EMI THASRON AS ING]

432
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,260
You’ll get to talk to
a fellow burnt out individual.

433
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,460
It’s a two-way therapy
to share your sorrows.

434
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,630
I play Ben, the owner of Burnout Bar.
[THOR THINNAPHAN AS BEN]

435
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,460
Ben gives advice to people
who are burnt out.

436
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,540
He’s mysterious.

437
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,380
You’ll feel like there’s a wall between
Ben and his burnt out customers.

438
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,180
He listens to his customers openly,

439
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,460
though he’s not exactly
the one giving advice.

440
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,660
What I do at the bar is match
two people who are both burnt out,

441
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
so they can talk and get healed.

442
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,620
I am in charge of drinks.

443
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,460
I’d give drink recommendations
that suit each customer,

444
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,780
and explaining how each drink is

445
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,820
since the drink names are
related to specific burnout.

446
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,260
The rules of the bar are simple:

447
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,220
You get to the bar, order a drink,
and you’ll be given a table number.

448
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,460
The customer will take a seat at the table,

449
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,140
while I find someone who’s also
burnt out to sit with them.

450
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,260
They can share their perspectives
and get healed.

451
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,540
That would help them with their burnout.

452
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,420
Most customers order what they feel.

453
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,100
The hard part?

454
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,220
It’s bartending.

455
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,660
I have to learn the ropes of
being a bartender.

456
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,260
I don’t personally frequent bars
all that often.

457
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,620
That was quite hard.

458
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,100
Another hard part is the filming.

459
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,460
This is my first time
filming mostly at night.

460
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,060
I was amazed by how they work at night.

461
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,660
I have to try to keep my energy stable
or even up for night shoots.

462
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,580
That was also hard for me.

463
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,860
Hey, Thor. You hungry?

464
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,660
Oh, hey, look at that.

465
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,140
Oh, you!

466
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,140
Thor is the luckiest guy.
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH]

467
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,580
Because he’s always at the bar.
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH]

468
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,540
He only has one costume.
[OFF JUMPOL AS KOH]

469
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,340
But he has to really embody
the mysteriousness of the character.

470
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:10,060
He plays the bar owner
who meets a lot of people.

471
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,860
He has to know how to talk in a way
that makes people feel comfortable.

472
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,340
And I think Thor did an amazing job.

473
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,220
The lines are quite long.

474
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,340
Because it’s mostly advice for
people who are burnt out.

475
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,860
And I have to recommend drinks—

476
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,060
The drinks in the story are quite uniquely named.

477
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,100
I have to explain what the drinks are like.

478
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,580
The hurdle of being a bartender?

479
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,860
There was this scene
where I was mixing a drink.

480
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,980
I was shaking and shaking,

481
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:55,140
and the lid— it flew all the way into
a glass right behind me,

482
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,980
a part of the set.

483
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,940
Everything came crashing down
like dominoes.

484
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,180
It was a mess.

485
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
It seems like it would suit you.

486
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,300
But the drink may look sweet,

487
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
but it’s strong.

488
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,980
This is my first time working with Thor.

489
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,820
He’s perfect for the role.

490
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,540
Ben really does look like a bar owner.

491
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,260
Right.

492
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,060
He’s cool.

493
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,820
He seems knowledgeable about liquors.

494
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,140
He’s got tattoos.

495
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,740
He has this bad-boy look.

496
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,660
It’s cool.

497
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,940
What do you think?

498
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,860
See?

499
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,440
It takes a bit of time to put these on.

500
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,180
And it takes a bit more time
to take them off.

501
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,300
But I like this character.

502
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,340
He’s like me in terms of being
a good listener and good at giving advice.

503
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,980
Ben is like that.

504
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,060
Enjoy it.

505
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,100
What’s the definition of burnout?

506
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,940
Let’s say I’m thinking of making
a screenprint T-shirt.

507
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,260
But I just don’t seem to get inspired.

508
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,060
That would make me wonder...

509
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,140
if I’m feeling burnt out since ideas
just don’t come easily.

510
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,660
I’d find inspiration by going out
and hanging out with friends.

511
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,340
I’d do things I don’t usually do.

512
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,080
That will help me feel a little refreshed.

513
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,820
Right.

514
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,860
I think burnout is...

515
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,570
when you’ve been working
the same job for too many years.

516
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,820
Or when you’ve been repeating
the same routine

517
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,700
over and over for a very long time.

518
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,140
You can feel burnt out from that.

519
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,420
It’s quite common nowadays.

520
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,540
For people of all professions.

521
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,540
My friends and I have all experienced it.

522
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
Maybe you meet too many people.

523
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,100
You might not find all of them agreeable,

524
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,220
or you might have trouble
getting along with them at work.

525
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,840
You can burn out from that.

526
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,260
You might feel like avoiding work.

527
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,340
Because you don’t want to be
feeling uncomfortable

528
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,420
around your colleagues at the office.

529
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,540
For me personally, I’d shuffle up what I do.

530
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,380
I’d try to shift my focus to
something else,

531
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,660
something I really feel like doing.

532
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,580
Just take a break from what
makes you feel bad for a while.

533
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,140
If things don’t improve soon, I’d try
something new I’ve never done before.

534
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,900
Maybe I’ll try painting.

535
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,860
That could give me new ideas.

536
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,020
That could be fun and give me hope.

537
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,300
The only obstacle is the rain.

538
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,580
It’s monsoon season.

539
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,860
We even had to cancel the outdoor
filming one day because of it.

540
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,880
We got off work 3-4 hours early that day

541
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,620
because we just couldn’t
film anything at all.

542
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,860
Other than that, the hurdle is us
having trouble with our lines.

543
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,500
I think it’s quite hard to say the lines naturally

544
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,620
so we need to practice a lot.

545
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,020
That was one thing.

546
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,820
But there’s also the wire…

547
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,180
It has to look like I’m saying
what he tells me to say in my ears.

548
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,380
But in actuality, there is no wire.

549
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,500
We both have to remember these lines,
and they have to match.

550
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,160
We have to be in sync.

551
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,940
And to have one earphone in your ear
while talking is quite difficult.

552
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
I feel like I have lost hearing
in one of my ears.

553
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,580
Right.

554
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,540
It’s a noise-cancelling headphone,
so I lost one ear in the process.

555
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,420
That is hard.

556
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,250
It is.

557
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,900
It’s very hard.

558
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,940
You know, in scenes where I say something,
and then Gun says something.

559
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,740
You need to listen carefully
when you speak,

560
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,500
but imagine doing that
with diminished hearing.

561
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,500
It’s hard.

562
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,060
I lose my focus a little.

563
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,740
For me personally.

564
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,700
“Why should I worry about getting fired?”

565
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,260
“Even when—” Ah.

566
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,940
Okay.

567
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,820
Excuse me, guys.

568
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,100
What’s it like on set?

569
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,260
When we’re filming,

570
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,540
the actors, the director,
and all the crew are working hard.

571
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,080
Since the story is quite mature,
we can’t joke around too much.

572
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,260
We have to be serious.

573
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,100
It’s quite tense on set.

574
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,780
It’s P’Nuchy’s series,

575
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,820
so you can expect some
social commentary scenes in the story.

576
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,940
Words are actions.

577
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,260
It’s like waging wars.

578
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,450
The dialogues are vitriolic.

579
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,860
There’s this one scene of me
and Gun talking, like this.

580
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,460
We spent seven hours on that.

581
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,860
For one scene.

582
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,130
It was brutal.

583
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,300
Because, first, it’s full of technical terms.

584
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
Second, the lines are long.

585
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,100
Third, it’s filmed with one camera.

586
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,660
That’s amazing of you, P’Nuchy.

587
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,420
Bravo.

588
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
One camera.

589
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,060
As in, there’s only one camera used
no matter which shot it is.

590
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,660
I personally like it.

591
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,100
Because I get to keep repeating
the lines until they sound natural.

592
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,060
The story is a bit tense,
but it’s quite fun on set.

593
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,260
(Are you wearing this for the scene?)

594
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,700
Yes, baby. It’s sexy time.

595
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,420
Working with P’Nuchy,
you know we trust her.

596
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,940
We just know she’s going to have
some beautiful shots for the series.

597
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,020
Exactly.

598
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,220
P’Nuchy is an amazing director.

599
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,420
For each series, she has
a big picture in her mind,

600
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,340
which includes all the camerawork.

601
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:22,780
She can walk into a set and knows
which part of it she needs to adjust.

602
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,940
“Which lens is this?”

603
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,940
“40, ma’am.” She’d go, “No, I need 50.”

604
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,500
Yes.

605
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,060
She has an image in her mind.

606
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,660
She knows how she wants
a scene to turn out.

607
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,620
There are just so many cuts, though.

608
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,860
-Because there’s just one camera.
-Because there’s just one camera.

609
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,940
But I think this is just
how she prefers it.

610
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,950
When we have to shoot many takes,
we try to—

611
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,740
Make it new.

612
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,180
The good thing is that the lines
are now engraved in my mind.

613
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,620
After saying the lines enough times,
even the long ones are memorized.

614
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,480
And the later takes would be good enough.

615
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,500
When I get into a scene
with Papii, for example,

616
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,640
P’Nuchy would just tell us
to keep doing it until it feels natural.

617
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,340
Sometimes it’s a long take,

618
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,580
so we’d have to do it
in one take without a hitch.

619
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,820
And that is definitely difficult
when we have 7-8-page dialogues.

620
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,940
With technical terms, we have to
try to memorize everything.

621
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,500
I have to know what each word means,
or what the title of a painting is.

622
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,620
I have to look up a word and ask them
what it is supposed to convey.

623
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,420
It’s quite hard.

624
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,140
But I know P’Nuchy is very detailed
with her screenplay.

625
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
Grab your hair like this.

626
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,820
Do something that would… you know?

627
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,900
She’s so familiarized with her screenplay.

628
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,420
She knows all her characters.

629
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,580
She knows what they do
and knows quite deeply.

630
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,460
I love hearing her explain
how her characters are.

631
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,680
I totally get a lot out of
working with her.

632
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,160
I don’t think P’Nuchy is strict at all.

633
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,820
And her character really teaches me a lot.

634
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,060
This is my first time
working with P’Nuchy.

635
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,340
She’s very hardworking.

636
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,340
Her camerawork is amazing.
She’s so detailed.

637
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,580
I’m more than sure the final cut
is going to be amazing.

638
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,380
I was told working with P’Nuchy
is an amazing lesson.

639
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,100
She’s world-class, as you know.

640
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,620
I was quite nervous about my acting.

641
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
I feel like I’m new and
haven’t worked with her before.

642
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,060
But when I got to work with her,
I don’t think she’s strict at all.

643
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,740
She’s got her funny side.

644
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,100
I think she doesn’t know that.

645
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,660
But when she jokes around,
everything on set feels lighter.

646
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
It’s overall quite nice.

647
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,220
I feel like I’ve improved my acting
a lot in this series.

648
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,340
She would always ask me
how I’m doing in each scene.

649
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,700
She’d ask if I have anything to add.

650
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,180
P’Nuchy never neglects me in that regard.

651
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,540
I find it very reassuring.

652
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,300
When I was at the restaurant?

653
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,700
Someone caught my attention.

654
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,600
What do you want from me?!

655
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,380
Answer me!

656
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,940
An unmissable scene?

657
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,420
The first time I meet him,
I’m dressed in punk.

658
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,860
I remember screaming a lot.

659
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,699
Too many times.

660
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,900
I screamed until I was hoarse.

661
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
That was tough.

662
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,060
I did it all day.

663
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,219
An unmissable scene for me is
the one where Gun is drawing me.

664
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:37,659
There’s the actual moment of
drawing Koh, and the fantasy.

665
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,540
I feel like it adds more to that scene.

666
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,540
There’s a novel as well.

667
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,580
Burnout Syndrome, the novel.

668
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,739
The cover art, as well as
the art in the book, is done by Dew.

669
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,639
Right. Dew designs all the characters.

670
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,420
I remember the day
he got assigned the role.

671
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,860
He drew my character and showed it to me.

672
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,920
He was telling me how he drew me,

673
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,380
how my eyes would look.

674
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,260
I’ve wanted to try commercial art.

675
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,020
This is a great opportunity for me.

676
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,020
I’ll admit I still feel
a bit awkward about it.

677
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,620
Novels and comics are very different.

678
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,260
The character design
is based on actual people.

679
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,260
That is quite hard, too.

680
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,940
I have to make sure people recognize
who this is by the art alone.

681
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,100
You know?

682
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,180
See?

683
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,340
I love this one.

684
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,060
Doesn’t he look very P’Off-coded?

685
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,620
The look in his eyes.

686
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,540
He’s got that bad-boy vibe.

687
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,860
That’d be me, and this P’Gun.

688
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,220
I’m glad to have worked on this.

689
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,320
Dew did an amazing job
with the character design.

690
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,100
He captures the characters well.

691
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,580
Because each character is different.

692
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,560
Dew’s character is like a hot nerd, right?

693
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,540
And in the novel, I totally see that.

694
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,740
It turns out so well.

695
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,740
Jira is also amazing.

696
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,180
He’s a tiny guy.

697
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,220
Even Koh’s character is similar to me.

698
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,860
I’m sure Dew did his research
before drawing them.

699
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,020
And this is Burnout Syndrome.

700
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,260
It’s been amazing.

701
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,580
The fans have been looking forward to it.

702
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,330
We’ve been in series together quite a bit,

703
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,940
so I think the fans want to see
how this one will be.

704
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,460
I’m happy that people
are looking forward to it.

705
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,260
This Off-Gun-Dew chemistry is quite new.

706
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,580
It’s a love triangle.

707
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,860
It’s been amazing.

708
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,640
The reception from the fans
has been tremendous.

709
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,980
They seem to—

710
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,260
Many fans showed up that day
with their copy of the novel,

711
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,580
and those that have read it
have been sharing their feedback on X.

712
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,260
What you’ll get from this series is,
first of all, fun.

713
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:08,450
You’ll see how this chemistry between
P’Off, P’Gun, and Dew is.

714
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,500
It’ll speak more loudly to
people who are also burnt out.

715
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,620
I think everyone’s felt burnt out before,

716
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:25,050
and this series will show you being
burnt out isn’t the end of it.

717
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:32,030
But there are so many ways
and many new perspectives

718
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,580
that will keep you going.

719
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,060
People can see this as a model
and think to try something new.

720
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,420
It’s a slowburn series.

721
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,980
Everything builds up bit by bit,
and comes down bit by bit.

722
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,660
It’s not going to be heart-racing,

723
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,980
but with this silence, I feel like
you will feel even more immersed in it.

724
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,340
From the poster alone,

725
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,560
I guess people think
it’s just another love triangle.

726
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,060
But the subplot talks about the current
social atmosphere around AI

727
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,020
and office workers who are
experiencing burnout syndrome.

728
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,100
It’s about people who are trying to
fix things and relighting their passion.

729
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,500
There are many subplots
to look forward to.

730
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,560
But mainly, it talks about the relationships
between these three people,

731
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,060
and the people around them.

732
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,420
Please look forward to
the series Burnout Syndrome.

733
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,100
The story itself is interesting.

734
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:41,580
When I read the script, I thought
it was fun, dynamic and diverse.

735
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,660
The tension is quite high.

736
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,540
If you’re a passionate person,
I’d like you to give this series a try.

737
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,980
It’s amazing on pages,
and I can’t wait to see it on screen.

738
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,140
Every shot is beautiful and everyone
on set worked so hard for it.

739
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,820
Please look forward to it.

740
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,860
Please adore Koh.

741
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,550
Try not to hate on him too much, guys.

742
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,180
Watch until the end
before you judge him, let’s say.

743
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,580
If you hate on him
all through the episodes,

744
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,740
I’ll be reading up the comments,
and I will most likely reply.

745
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,090
Jira represents someone who’s burnt out.

746
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,780
He’s looking for his passion.

747
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,100
Give everything a try, like Jira.

748
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,940
Jira does a lot before this.

749
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,180
Please look out for my character
Jira in Burnout Syndrome.

750
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,780
Root for him and see
how his story will turn out.

751
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,620
Please look out for my character
Pheem in Burnout Syndrome.

752
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,500
Give this series a try,
not for my character alone,

753
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,220
but for the relationships
between all the characters,

754
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,420
and for the storytelling,

755
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
as well as this message about
corporate life and AI.

756
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,180
I really want you to check it out

757
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,860
because there are so many things
I never tried before in this series.

758
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,500
Look out for it.

759
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,570
Please look out for Ing.

760
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,980
Ing is quite a new role for me.

761
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:27,160
I’ve never played someone
who’s such an expert on something before,

762
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,900
who talks eloquently
in her field of interest.

763
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,280
I love playing this character so much,

764
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:40,650
because she makes me feel so confident
when I’m not usually so self-assured.

765
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,900
But when I play the character, I have fun.

766
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,700
So I think, if the actor herself
feels like that,

767
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,940
I’m sure the audience will feel it, too.

768
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,580
Please look forward to Ing
and Burnout Syndrome.

769
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,340
Please look out for my character Mawin.

770
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:05,380
Root for him in his journey
to get through his burnout.

771
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,420
And look out for Burnout Syndrome.

772
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,820
You won’t be let down.

773
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,300
Please look out for Ben
in Burnout Syndrome.

774
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,980
This role is new and
quite challenging for me.

775
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,760
I’d love it if you root for him
in this series.

776
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,460
There are so many characters
that will make this series fun.

777
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,380
So look out for this bar owner, Ben.

778
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,740
If you’re burnt out, I’ll be there.

779
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:45,180
If you want to see how Koh, Pheem,
and Jira will navigate this relationship,

780
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,340
I think you should tune in.

781
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,700
If you imagine yourself as Jira,
think along that,

782
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,420
between someone
who’s exactly your type,

783
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:02,820
and someone with
whom you feel magnetized to,

784
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,060
who’d you choose?

785
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,900
I’d love for you to see
how Jira will choose.

786
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,700
Please look out for our series
Burnout Syndrome.

787
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,350
Look out for it.

788
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,700
I don’t like being betrayed.

789
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,200
It’s f*cked up.

790
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,800
If you ever ask me to do things
I don’t want to do,

791
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,350
I’m handing in my resignation notice.
