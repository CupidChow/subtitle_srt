Look at me.

6
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,380
A bit to the left.

7
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,020
Umm… Chin down slightly.

8
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,860
Okay.

9
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,979
Okay. Good.

10
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,860
Take off your coat.

11
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,060
Okay. Great.

12
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,780
Follow me.

13
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,500
Jira.

14
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,220
Hmm?

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,540
Did we get any good photos?

16
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,020
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,900
Kai, you can go to the changing room.

18
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,860
Thank you.

19
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,740
Can you take a look at her makeup?

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,620
Is this alright?

21
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,620
I think the lips need changing.

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,180
Excuse me, can you…

23
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,060
Add some more red to her lips?

24
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,530
Mark this one.

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,180
Not this one.

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,700
Alright. Mark this.

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,400
I think this one’s good.

28
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,170
Mr. Thames is gonna love this.

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,730
Okay, nice.

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,380
Keep going.

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,000
Can I see the photos?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,260
Of course.

33
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,970
Why are they all the same?

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,460
What do you mean?

35
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,580
Who chose these?

36
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,260
We all helped.

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,430
Is there any part that you want us
to adjust, Mr. Thames?

38
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,500
Can I talk to you outside for a minute?

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,780
Jira.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,780
Hmm?

41
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,579
We’re taking a little break.

42
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,940
Guys, we’re done for today.

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,980
You’re free to go.

44
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,780
It’s already finished.

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,380
Thank you.

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,100
-What happened?
-You can all go.

47
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,540
Just a little bit of a problem.

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,540
You don’t have to worry.

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
You’ll hear from us if there’s any update.

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh, okay. Sure.

51
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,220
It’s a shame, though.

52
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,820
Sorry.

53
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,940
Let’s wrap up.

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,900
You can all go.

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,670
I’ll give you the money
for your trouble later.

56
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,500
How was it, Ing?

57
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,230
Was he pissed?

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,780
Yeah.

59
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,800
Damn right he was.

60
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,030
What did he say?

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,100
Did he hate my photos?

62
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,700
I told you I’m not really confident
with my photography skill.

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,230
It’s not the photos…

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,270
He doesn’t like the concept.

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,100
What?

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I thought he greenlit this concept.

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,860
I’m just as confused as you are.

68
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,860
All he said was that…

69
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,600
This wouldn’t sell.

70
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,900
Clients are like that sometimes.

71
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,580
They see the final cut
and change their mind.

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,180
What can we do?

73
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,180
It’s their money.

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,740
And Ji…

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,040
I don’t think you can put this
in your portfolio.

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,530
You might have to put your
photography career on hold for a while.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,070
Are there any casting calls?

78
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,870
I’m in a pinch lately.

79
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,600
Casting calls…

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,710
There’s a commercial.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,100
You interested?

82
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,970
I’ll do anything that pays.

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
But they won’t pay until much later…

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,690
I don’t mind lending you
some money, though.

85
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,600
I don’t think I can pay you back
any time soon

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,940
so you might as well find me work.

87
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,780
Umm.

88
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,800
I’ll go for one thousand.

89
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,400
[PRICE: 1000 BAHT]

90
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,370
I’m taking such good care of you.

91
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,850
Give me a flower that brings good luck.

92
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,210
Every drop is fresh.

93
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,530
Every cup is fun.

94
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,800
Feel awake!

95
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,380
Cut.

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,840
Let’s do it again.

97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,110
Can you make it a little more fun?

98
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,750
Take a breath.

99
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,580
Okay. Stay calm.

100
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,330
That last one was a little fake.

101
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,150
Let’s do it again.

102
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,170
Camera.

103
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,650
Ready.

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,430
Three, two, one.

105
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,290
Action.

106
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,750
Every drop is fresh.

107
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,960
Every cup is bright.

108
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,270
-Feel—
-It’s “every cup is fun.”

109
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,220
“Fun…”

110
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,750
Do it again.

111
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,370
-“Every cup is fun.”
-Get it together.

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,150
Three, two, one. Action.

113
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,630
Every drop is fresh.

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,000
Every cup is fun.

115
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,700
…Feel awake!

116
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,600
Perfect.

117
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,870
We’re done.

118
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,890
What’s the matter?

119
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you crying?

120
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,300
Hey…

121
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,000
It’s just a silly commercial.

122
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,150
When people say it’s not easy…

123
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,850
I didn’t think
it was going to be this hard.

124
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,070
It’s just a silly commercial.

125
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,330
Don’t take it seriously.

126
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,950
This isn’t about that.

127
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,850
I’m just…

128
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,300
I’m freaking bad at everything.

129
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,730
I can’t sell my drawings.

130
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
I can’t get cast.

131
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,070
Am I that much of a loser?

132
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,570
Not at all.

133
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,370
You’re actually very talented.

134
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,730
There are things you can do that I can’t.

135
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,230
It’s all very normal.

136
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,150
Is it?

137
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,740
You’re a passionate person.

138
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,930
That’s not a bad thing, but I think…

139
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,960
You need to find yourself,
and focus on something you really like.

140
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,770
I don’t know.

141
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,000
Let’s not talk about work.

142
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,380
I think you need to heal first.

143
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,180
Healing needs money.

144
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,550
I can’t even afford
to pay for electricity.

145
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,100
I have 5000 with me right now.

146
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,830
Take it.

147
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,030
Can I borrow a little more?

148
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,940
Oh, you jerk.

149
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,300
Did you squeeze those tears out just
to fool me into lending you some money?

150
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,970
I am honestly sentimental.

151
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,860
These tears aren’t fake.

152
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,070
But I just need some money
to cover my credit card debt.

153
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,380
Fine.

154
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,700
How much do you need?

155
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,570
Three cards, plus interest…

156
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,170
I need 100K.

157
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,500
Okay.

158
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,770
I also need some money for this and that.

159
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,970
Another 20K would suffice.

160
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,190
So 120K in total?

161
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,100
There’s also the electricity bill,
the water bill, and my rent.

162
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,100
Let’s say 150K in total.

163
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,300
The list keeps expanding, huh?

164
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,770
Fine. I’ll wire you the money.

165
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,650
Thank you.

166
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,350
Well, I have a request
in exchange for that.

167
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,670
For 150K, I order you
to get yourself healed.

168
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,900
There’s a place I know.

169
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,400
It’s called Burnout Bar.

170
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,410
Sounds like I’ll be in a worse place
if I go there.

171
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,180
It’s a good place for people
who are burnt out.

172
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,510
I went there and it worked.

173
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,150
You’re a first-timer, I take it?

174
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,770
What’s your name?

175
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,070
Jira.

176
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,370
I’m burnt out.

177
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,170
My friend recommended this place.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,800
I’m Ben.

179
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,940
I run this place.

180
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,570
Would you like to order right now?

181
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,050
Here.

182
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,530
These are some weird names.

183
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,570
In case our customers
don’t know what to order.

184
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,770
They can just order what they feel.

185
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,370
Then I found my drink.

186
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,070
“Empty Pocket.”

187
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,880
“Even a heartbreak
isn’t as bad as being broke.”

188
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,870
Sounds like it would suit you.

189
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,780
The drink may look pretty,

190
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,300
but I’ll warn you it’s strong.

191
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,460
Our rules are simple.

192
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,160
Once you have your drink,
you’ll get a table number.

193
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:16,900
Here.

194
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,300
Once you’re at your table,

195
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,100
I’ll randomly select another customer
to sit with you.

196
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,550
You’ll get to talk to another
burnt out individual.

197
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,500
It’s a two-way therapy
to share your sorrows.

198
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,660
If you don’t know where to start,

199
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,100
there are some conversation-opener
cards on the table.

200
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,650
You can use them.

201
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,400
I’m Pheem.

202
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,950
What’s your name?

203
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,030
Jira.

204
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,320
How old are you?

205
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,620
28.

206
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, we’re the same age.

207
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,070
Is this your first time here?

208
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,700
Yes, it is.

209
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,630
I’m still kinda confused, actually.

210
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,970
What about you?

211
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,270
It’s my third time.

212
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,270
“If you could go anywhere right now,
where would it be?”

213
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,740
I’d go to…

214
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,570
My friend’s gallery
in the old part of town.

215
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,130
Most people just say Japan.

216
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,300
It scares me just thinking about it.

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I’m kinda down and out lately.

218
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,900
What about you?

219
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,530
Me?

220
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,000
If we’re on a budget, then…

221
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,670
Oh, crap.

222
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,100
You’re going to think I’m aggressive.

223
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,700
Aggressive how?

224
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,300
Do you want to go somewhere a
straight guy would, like a Muay Thai club?

225
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,150
No.

226
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,800
If I’m being honest right now,

227
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,900
I want to go to…

228
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,349
A rage room.

229
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,670
You know what that is?

230
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,900
What’s that?

231
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,810
A rage room is a place you go to,

232
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,329
pay for a plan,

233
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,349
and they’d give you some stuff.

234
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,770
And then you smash everything.

235
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,569
Smash.

236
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,030
Smash.

237
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,470
That’s it.

238
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,330
It sounds…

239
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,070
Aggressive.

240
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,300
I know it sounds bad,

241
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,800
but I swear I’m actually a gentle person.

242
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,800
But don’t we all get this urge to just…

243
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,940
Smash something?

244
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,070
It’s cheaper than therapy, for one,

245
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,170
and definitely better for your body
than alcohol.

246
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,900
Well?

247
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,640
Do you think that’s a red flag?

248
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,400
I find red flags… thrilling.

249
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,850
You’re into bad boys, huh.

250
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,600
Can you give me your hand?

251
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,380
Why?

252
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,800
I’ll read your palm.

253
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,900
Here.

254
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,100
Excuse me.

255
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,950
I’m new to this so
I can’t read upside down.

256
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,400
You sure you know how to read palms?

257
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,700
I’ll have you know I’m superstitious.

258
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,550
Of course I can.

259
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,600
Show me, then.

260
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,050
But before that, let me ask you one thing.

261
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,470
What do you do for a living?

262
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,400
I…

263
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,770
I make art.

264
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,140
I’m still trying to find myself, though.

265
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,150
Nothing feels right right now.

266
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,670
What about you?

267
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,780
Me?

268
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,070
I work in IT.

269
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,580
Application development.

270
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,170
Oh?

271
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,600
Does that mean you’re rich?

272
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,770
It pays well, right?

273
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,270
It’s almost perfect,

274
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,970
except I have a jerk-ass colleague.

275
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,150
He isn’t all that open to my ideas.

276
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,000
I’d say he’s against them, in fact.

277
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,100
It seems like he’s always up for a fight.

278
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,470
Why not just quit?

279
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,150
You hit right on the mark.

280
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,060
Well…

281
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,000
He’s not just my colleague.

282
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,900
He’s also my friend.

283
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,300
We’ve built everything together.

284
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,260
I can’t just leave.

285
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,500
All I can do every day is pray

286
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,660
that he gets better.

287
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,980
I believe you’ll get through it.

288
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,440
Well?

289
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,000
How is my palm?

290
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,250
Let me see.

291
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,200
Thank you for the ride.

292
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,700
Tell me how much I owe you.

293
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
No need.

294
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,580
You can pay me back
when you get a new job.

295
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,300
I’ll walk you.

296
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,980
Wow.

297
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,450
You live here?

298
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,700
It looks archaic.

299
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,900
What’s your room number?

300
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,150
I know a little numerology, you know?

301
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,100
Now that’s weird.

302
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,100
Too obvious?

303
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,510
I thought I was being smooth.

304
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,700
But am I allowed to know
what your room number is?

305
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,300
It’s 69.

306
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,700
For real?

307
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,190
Now that’s a nice one.

308
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,100
You silly.

309
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,100
I live on the third floor,
the room on the left.

310
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,700
Okay.

311
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,500
Talk later.

312
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,100
Are you done?

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,350
Can I see?

314
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,000
I still need to tidy up some details.

315
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,880
It’s alright.

316
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,750
We’ll take what you have now.

317
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,800
Of course.

318
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,750
Here.

319
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,950
You’re quite detailed with your art.

320
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,500
You’ve got good taste when it comes
to lines and colors.

321
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,830
It needs to look more commercial, though.

322
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,330
One issue is that you’re quite slow.

323
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh, I have one more question
since we’ve just updated our policy.

324
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,250
Do you know how to use Generative AI?

325
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,370
AI?

326
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,980
I’m familiar with it.

327
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,400
The position is a storyboard artist,

328
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,550
but with our new policy,
the workload also increases.

329
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,800
If you can use AI to assist you,
it’ll save us a lot of time.

330
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
From your taste,

331
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,950
I do believe you’ll be able to choose
the perfect art for our work.

332
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,250
If you want AI to do most of the work,

333
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,030
what am I here to do?

334
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,130
You get to exercise your taste in art.

335
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,550
Can I be straightforward?

336
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,500
I want to work to prove myself.

337
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,800
I chose this studio because of its craft.

338
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,170
It’d be a shame to lose that.

339
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,200
So do you know how to use AI or not?

340
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,970
From the bottom of my heart,

341
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,700
I don’t want to.

342
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,300
You write in your resume
that you’re adaptable.

343
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,000
Is that not true?

344
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,470
You said you were adaptable.

345
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:53,980
Yes?

346
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,860
You got the job.

347
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,830
What?

348
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,980
What job?

349
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,100
I just got rejected from this job interview.

350
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,890
It’s a dinner companion job.

351
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,000
Dinner companion?

352
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,860
When did I agree to that?

353
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,660
Well, you certainly have
no right to say no.

354
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,760
It pays well.

355
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,000
How much?

356
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,540
It pays way more than a month’s worth
of storyboarding.

357
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
I don’t want to be an escort.

358
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,100
How else are you gonna feed yourself?

359
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,540
It’s tonight.

360
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,580
The dress code is punk.

361
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,850
The client wants you to be in character.

362
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,770
I ordered some clothes on Hide for you
and should be at your place right now.

363
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,490
Don’t let me down and get it done.

364
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,780
Umm.

365
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,070
Shit.

366
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,080
The quality is shit.

367
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,530
Hello, Mr. Don.

368
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,030
Wow.

369
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,270
Amazing.

370
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,900
This exceeds my expectations.

371
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,400
Sit down.

372
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,700
I’m Jira.

373
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,870
No, you’re not.

374
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,900
You’re not Jira right now.

375
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,500
I ordered this for you.

376
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,100
Do you like it?

377
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,860
I…

378
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,700
I can’t eat raw meat.

379
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,100
But you love this dish.

380
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,780
I’m sorry.

381
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
I really can’t eat it.

382
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,000
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you in advance.

383
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,800
Do you understand what I’m saying?

384
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,730
You must like this dish.

385
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,900
You can eat it.

386
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,140
Eat it.

387
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,900
Eat.

388
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,110
Hey.

389
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,580
Can you at least look happy?

390
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,970
The one I hired before this
wasn’t half as picky as you are.

391
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,660
If you like him, why don’t you
go and hire him again?

392
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,830
How can you say that?

393
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,000
I paid for you.

394
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,780
You do as I say.

395
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,200
But I told you I can’t eat it.
Just tell me to do something else.

396
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,510
I’ll give you some advice.

397
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,000
If you can’t live up to the role,
don’t take the job in the first place.

398
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,580
You’re incompetent.

399
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,400
I thought you said you were adaptable.

400
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,000
You said you were adaptable.

401
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,220
Is that not true?

402
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,380
You like punk, don’t you?

403
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,730
Get the hell away from my face!

404
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,940
If you don’t,
I’ll freaking keep screaming!

405
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,400
-Go away!
-Are you insane?

406
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,300
-Get out of my face!
-You brat!

407
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,350
This is for you.

408
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,050
I don’t want to eat.

409
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,180
That guy ordered for you.

410
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,800
What the hell now?

411
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,870
What the hell do you want from me?!

412
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Answer me!

413
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,600
It’s nothing.

414
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,000
I just want to take care of you.

415
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,300
You’re interesting.

416
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,170
That’s some bullshit!

417
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,750
It’s not.

418
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,770
Is this how you dress every day?

419
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,200
Do you always scream?

420
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,930
I was hired for it so I have to do it.

421
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,580
What the hell do you want?

422
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,370
Take a seat.

423
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,770
Is there someone who’s freaking
normal around here?

424
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,100
Here.

425
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,300
Drink.

426
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,330
What’s your name?

427
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,750
Jira.

428
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,550
Are you a full-time escort or
do you do something else, too?

429
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,300
Am I in a job interview?

430
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,100
Yes.

431
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,300
If I like your answers,
you’ll get the job.

432
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,450
I can do everything.

433
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,500
Drawing.

434
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,500
Acting, photography, and styling.

435
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,400
You famous?

436
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,100
What do you mean by acting?

437
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,000
Well, musicals and commercials.

438
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,500
So what exactly do you want to do?

439
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,650
Listen up.

440
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,500
In this day and age, I’ll do whatever
I’m told to do if I get paid.

441
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,950
If I want you to be someone
in order to do something,

442
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,780
will you do it?

443
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,530
As long as the instruction’s
not too shitty,

444
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,900
I’ll get it done.

445
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,450
Stare at me for 10 seconds.

446
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,470
How does that feel?

447
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,980
Well…

448
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,300
Kinda nervous.

449
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,570
That’s alright.

450
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,590
Practice will make perfect.

451
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,200
But that was good.

452
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,750
You’re alright.

453
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,240
What does that mean?

454
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,100
I don’t feel a thing for you.

455
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,570
What?

456
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,550
I don’t think this place is safe.

457
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,600
If you want to know more
about this job offer,

458
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,250
come back to the hotel with me.

459
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,900
How much do you pay?

460
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,700
You sure that’s not
an extra zero at the end?

461
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:23,980
I stand correct.

462
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,180
This has gotta be some bullshit.

463
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,600
I don’t even know if you have that money.

464
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,130
Just make up your mind.

465
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
I’m leaving.

466
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,900
Go ahead.

467
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,670
Well?

468
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,230
How is my palm?

469
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,850
Your palm says

470
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,850
you’re going to get a new job soon.

471
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,180
But…

472
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,500
It’s going to be hard-earned,

473
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,180
and likely to bring a lot of mishaps.

474
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,500
But you have nothing to worry about.

475
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,070
Everything will turn out just fine

476
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,699
as long as you trust your feelings.

477
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,050
Hey.

478
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,260
Hey.

479
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:31,969
Hey.

480
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,570
I’ll take it.

481
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,100
Can I just ask you this?

482
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,760
What is it that I have to do
that we have to talk in a hotel?

483
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,900
What do you think you have to do?

484
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,889
Do you do this often?

485
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,300
What do you mean?

486
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,380
Bringing someone you like home.

487
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,100
I don’t often find someone I like.

488
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,400
Get in the car.

489
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,450
You booked the place in advance for this?

490
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,100
I live here.

491
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,020
What?

492
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,830
The rent must be astronomical.

493
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,950
Hey.

494
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,030
Don’t you have a maid?

495
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,500
I don’t like having people in my space

496
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
unless it is necessary.

497
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,980
Is it necessary to bring me here, then?

498
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,730
You’re good-looking,

499
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,580
but put your clothes back on
and come sit over here.

500
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,620
You have really distinct eyebags.

501
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,510
Don’t you sleep?

502
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,380
I have insomnia.

503
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,670
With all this money and
there’s something keeping you up?

504
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,380
Let’s not talk about me.

505
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,540
What did you study?

506
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,260
Visual Communication.

507
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,930
Do you have a lot of friends at work?

508
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,770
What’s your social media presence?

509
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,900
Hey.

510
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,500
Are you planning to murder me?

511
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,060
I texted my friend
that I’m with you, though.

512
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,000
Don’t be ridiculous.

513
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,530
“When will I get to have a say
in my own life?”

514
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,700
“Make my own decisions.
Hate my own decisions.”

515
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,500
“Make my own mistakes.”

516
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,900
Who is this about?

517
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,300
Just forget it.

518
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,700
It’s just someone I worked for.

519
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,740
Who?

520
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,350
Which company?

521
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,120
I was working on the catalog
of some company called Library.

522
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:46,860
I see.

523
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:47,980
Thames?

524
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,380
You know him?

525
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,180
Since you asked me all these questions,

526
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,570
let me ask you something, too.

527
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,980
What’s your name?

528
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,260
What do you do for a living?

529
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,090
What am I here for?

530
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,350
Hey.

531
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,240
Answer me at least one of the questions.

532
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,700
My name is Koh.

533
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,100
Alright?

534
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,300
You got the job.

535
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,420
Leave me your contact.

536
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,450
I’ll get in touch when I need you to work.

537
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,860
What about today?

538
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,840
You can go.

539
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,200
Your heart line is very prominent.

540
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,900
If you let your emotions lead the way,

541
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,780
it’d be good for you.

542
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,700
What exactly am I here to do?

543
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,370
I want you to be Mr. K.

544
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,000
Just look through his stuff.

545
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,690
There’s gotta be something
that tells you who he is.

546
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,260
Do you need to take away
my phone and bag?

547
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,940
We haven’t signed a contract.

548
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,530
I need to be careful, don’t I?

549
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,960
Our company is restructuring.

550
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,540
There’s no need for pretty words
when you just want to fire people.

551
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,220
I didn’t expect an IT guy like you

552
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,820
to have a tattoo like that.

553
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,050
You like it?
