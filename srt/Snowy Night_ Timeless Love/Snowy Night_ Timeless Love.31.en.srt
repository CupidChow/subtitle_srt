1
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,490
Be careful!

2
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,240
You're injured?

3
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,710
I don't want to kill anyone today.

4
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,640
Get out of my way!

5
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,360
Seven.

6
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,150
Are you okay?

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
He's injured.

8
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,020
Envoy Miao Feng, you're so arrogant.

9
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,190
Do you think

10
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,630
you can get through us?

11
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,400
Don't push me.

12
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
If the seven of you fight against me together,

13
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,079
indeed, you can stop me.

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,430
But at least

15
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,829
half of you will die here.

16
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,240
I'm in a hurry to save someone's life.

17
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,370
Please don't make it difficult for me.

18
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,750
Let's just go our separate ways!

19
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,350
Save someone's life?

20
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,770
That person is so important to you?

21
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,560
Is that person Chang Wujue?

22
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,960
It's a woman.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,660
She has been poisoned.

24
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,200
Will you get out of my way or not?

25
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,810
We are in a hurry to go somewhere today.

26
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
We don't want to take advantage of you either.

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Let him go.

28
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Seventh Brother.

29
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,800
Seven,

30
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,560
he's from the Yuan Yi Palace.

31
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,029
He's seriously injured,

32
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,190
but he still prioritizes saving someone's life.

33
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,680
He's kind-hearted.

34
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,240
In the future,

35
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,410
if you still do bad things,

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,920
Sword Sect

37
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,240
won't let you go!

38
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,070
Zhan...bai.

39
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,040
Leave.

40
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,630
Looks like internal strife already started in the Yuan Yi Palace.

41
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's hurry up

42
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,490
and annihilate them in one go.

43
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,070
Seven!

44
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
What's wrong?

45
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,160
Nothing.

46
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
The entrance to the Yuan Yi Palace marked on the map

47
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
is right here.

48
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,490
But there's no road ahead.

49
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,630
Yeah.

50
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,310
Don't tell me

51
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,750
we need to jump.

52
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,390
The Yuan Yi Palace is in chaos.

53
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,850
We can't delay any longer.

54
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,159
I'll go down to take a look first.

55
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,510
Seven!

56
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Come down!

57
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,630
Indeed,

58
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
this is the entrance to the Yuan Yi Palace.

59
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,170
The terrain here is really unique.

60
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,120
One side of the mountain appears towering,

61
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
while the other side

62
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,950
slopes gently into a valley

63
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,210
with a modest descent.

64
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's move forward then.

65
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,000
It has been such a smooth journey.

66
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,170
No one has showed up to stop us.

67
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,480
It's so quiet.

68
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,030
I'm afraid something is wrong.

69
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,480
Yeah.

70
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
There's not even a guard.

71
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,750
I wonder where their leaders

72
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,600
are.

73
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,160
It's so quiet.

74
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
It's so quiet that it's a bit scary.

75
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,320
The palace just experienced internal strife.

76
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,250
Maybe they made some adjustments.

77
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,170
We'd better be careful.

78
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,450
It's Miao Kong, one of the Five Sages.

79
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,040
You'll know when you arrive

80
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,520
at the Yuan Yi Palace.

81
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,440
-Seventh Brother!
-Seven!

82
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,490
Sixth Brother,

83
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,240
is it you?

84
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
-Six?
-Sixth Brother?

85
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,030
Six?

86
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,150
You're finally here.

87
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,390
I've been waiting

88
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
for you.

89
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,770
Sixth Brother.

90
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,960
Six,

91
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,250
it's really you.

92
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,320
Seven.

93
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,410
Sixth Brother.

94
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Sixth Brother, it's really you.

95
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,760
You are still alive.

96
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,770
Sixth Brother,

97
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,450
why have you become like this?

98
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,650
What on earth happened?

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,750
Back then,

100
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,750
I was ordered by Chief

101
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,060
to fake my death and work undercover.

102
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,470
I've worked undercover for eight years

103
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,320
just for this moment:

104
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,320
to collaborate with you

105
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,630
to eliminate the Yuan Yi Palace.

106
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,440
Back then,

107
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,030
Seven wanted to take you back to Sword Sect.

108
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,670
Yes.

109
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,910
Seven wanted me

110
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,970
to go back with him.

111
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,410
I deliberately faked my death

112
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,950
by falling off the cliff.

113
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,320
I lied to you.

114
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,400
Everyone thought

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Seven killed you.

116
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,700
He faced much criticism for that.

117
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,200
But he never explained.

118
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,530
Sixth Brother.

119
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,530
It's good that you're still alive.

120
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,560
It's good that you're still alive.

121
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,630
If Junior knows you're still alive,

122
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,840
she would be very happy.

123
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,170
She would be very happy.

124
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
After so many years,

125
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
the eight swords of Sword Sect

126
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,290
are finally together.

127
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,530
Sixth Brother,

128
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,030
thank you for your hard work over the years.

129
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,720
Seven,

130
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,160
thank you for your hard work

131
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,820
over the past eight years.

132
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,870
I instigated internal strife in the Yuan Yi Palace.

133
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,510
Chang Wujue is dead.

134
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,840
The Yuan Yi Palace doesn't have a leader now.

135
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,100
It's chaotic and weak.

136
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,750
Now is the best time

137
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,150
to destroy them in one go.

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,330
Chang Wujue is dead?

139
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes.

140
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,600
Miao Shui betrayed him.

141
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,320
She died with Chang Wujue.

142
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,390
Miao Feng has left.

143
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,650
What about Eye?

144
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,910
Eye was severely injured by Chang Wujue.

145
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,270
He is being imprisoned in the Snow Prison.

146
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,470
He's in a living hell.

147
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,010
The Five Sages are all gone.

148
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,560
I cleared the obstacles

149
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
on your way here in advance.

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
No wonder it was so quiet

151
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,640
along the way.

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,630
It turns out Sixth Brother

153
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,240
cleared the obstacles in advance.

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,770
Let's go.

155
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,720
Let me take you

156
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,980
to Chang Wujue's body.

157
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,440
Okay.

158
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,300
Sixth Brother.

159
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,510
Mo...

160
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,510
I know.

161
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,910
He is Chang Wujue?

162
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
I heard from Chief

163
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,120
Chang Wujue practiced the Iron Horse Glacier

164
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,600
to make himself immortal.

165
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,600
I didn't expect him

166
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,130
to be like this when he died.

167
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,340
The golden needles...

168
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,030
Seven,

169
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,840
Chang Wujue is dead,

170
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,960
but we still have

171
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,760
something more important to do.

172
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,670
Many people who were taken here

173
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,960
are still being imprisoned.

174
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,790
We need to find a way

175
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,750
to save them.

176
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
They are imprisoned

177
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,900
in the Snow Prison,

178
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,910
the Asura Field,

179
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,840
and the dungeon.

180
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,790
Second,

181
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,200
let's go to the Snow Prison.

182
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,630
Okay.

183
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,320
Third Brother, Eighth Brother,

184
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,120
let's go to the dungeon.

185
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,550
Okay.

186
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,440
Then let's go to the Asura Field.

187
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,100
Eye is in charge of that place.

188
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,630
Perhaps there are still remnants.

189
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,030
Okay.

190
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,630
We'll go to the Asura Field.

191
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,960
Everyone, be careful.

192
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
Let's split up.

193
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,790
Okay.

194
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,280
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

195
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,440
Let's go.

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,440
Here.

197
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,650
Third Brother.

198
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,610
Let's go!

199
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,000
Go!

200
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,200
Go!

201
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,240
Eight,

202
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,860
protect the children!

203
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
How have you been?

204
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,670
Seven.

205
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,120
Eye?

206
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,250
Sixth Brother,

207
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,910
isn't he injured?

208
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,390
Don't look into his eyes.

209
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,720
Assess his positions

210
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,870
according to his movements.

211
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,590
-Okay.
-Okay.

212
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,080
Long time no see.

213
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,360
I don't want to see her distressed or heartbroken.

214
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,220
I don't want to fight against you.

215
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,590
But it seems unavoidable today.

216
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,390
I don't plan to fight against you.

217
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,270
With me here,

218
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,180
of course you don't need to fight.

219
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,220
Sixth Brother.

220
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,390
You...

221
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,010
Sixth Brother?

222
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,619
Who is your Sixth Brother?

223
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,000
This is Sword Sect's

224
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,920
business.

225
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,460
Handle it yourselves.

226
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,069
Sixth Brother, what are you doing?

227
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,270
Let Fifth Brother go!

228
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,920
Let him go?

229
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,069
So this is your trap.

230
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,589
That's right.

231
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,310
You betrayed Sword Sect?

232
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Which side are you on?

233
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,480
I figured it out long ago.

234
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,000
The good and the evil are irreconcilable?

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,130
Eliminate the evil to uphold justice?

236
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,480
That is just a lie.

237
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,000
I want to dominate the martial world in the Central Plains.

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,270
I want to become Sword Sect's chief.

239
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,090
You spent eight years with the devil,

240
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,410
and your temperament has changed.

241
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,570
It's been eight years.

242
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Eight years ago,

243
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,160
I volunteered

244
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,110
to work undercover in the Yuan Yi Palace

245
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,410
just to make contributions

246
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,880
to become the chief

247
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
of Sword Sect.

248
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,440
I abandoned my wife and son

249
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,340
and endured humiliation.

250
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,030
My life was a living hell.

251
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,040
All these years,

252
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
I've suffered much torment.

253
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,210
But what have I gained from it?

254
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,160
My family has been ruined.

255
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,960
My reputation has been damaged.

256
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,790
In the end,

257
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,770
you're the best candidate for the chief.

258
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,350
But what about me?

259
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,250
I can only hide in darkness.

260
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,350
I can't reunite with my wife.

261
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,350
I hate it.

262
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I hate there is

263
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,310
a deep bond between us.

264
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
I hate Chief

265
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
always favors you.

266
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,720
What I hate more is

267
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,110
I've gone through countless hardships,

268
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,370
but you want to take the credit in the end.

269
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,270
I've endured all those for so many years

270
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,870
and waited for so many years,

271
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,530
only to receive the news of Mo's death.

272
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,880
And what I have to bear

273
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,790
is that Qiushui still likes you.

274
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,550
I've had enough!

275
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
Chonghua,

276
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,350
you are so ungrateful!

277
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,310
Over the past eight years,

278
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,480
Seven risked his life

279
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
to look for medicine for Mo.

280
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,400
To keep his promise,

281
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,960
he's been taking care of your wife and son.

282
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,550
Yes!

283
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,640
I should thank Seven!

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
He is

285
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
a chivalrous hero.

286
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
But what about me?

287
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,320
I'm just someone

288
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,640
living in disgrace,

289
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,310
burdened with the label of a traitor!

290
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,160
I've never wanted to compete with you

291
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,690
for the chief of Sword Sect.

292
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,160
Senior, it's not too late to turn back now.

293
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
But there is no turning back!

294
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,790
Things have come this far.

295
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,000
There is no turning back.

296
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,030
I...

297
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,950
can't go back either.

298
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,170
What about Junior?

299
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,550
She's waiting for you to go back.

300
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,030
Don't you care about her?

301
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,070
After I become

302
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,480
the chief of Sword Sect,

303
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,640
I'll visit her.

304
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,930
Sixth Brother.

305
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,440
Now,

306
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,220
drop the Dark Soul Sword in your hand.

307
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,030
Seven,

308
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,750
you can't drop the sword!

309
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,780
Fifth Brother.

310
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,300
Drop your sword immediately.

311
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,110
Or

312
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,550
I'll kill him now.

313
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Seven,

314
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,240
don't worry about me.

315
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,830
Kill this

316
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,690
heartless and disloyal traitor!

317
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,130
Drop your sword.

318
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,290
Since I'm the one you hate,

319
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,380
do whatever you want to me.

320
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,480
Please let Fifth Brother go.

321
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
What I hate the most

322
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,650
is your self-righteous demeanor.

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,890
Don't worry.

324
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,510
I won't let you

325
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,030
die easily.

326
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,240
Eye,

327
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,460
cooperate with me.

328
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,200
Just do it.

329
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,880
Huo Zhanbai,

330
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,920
you didn't expect this, did you?

331
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll make you taste

332
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,370
the pain of losing your loved ones.

333
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,550
I'll make sure

334
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,480
all the brothers of Sword Sect

335
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,030
die because of you.

336
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,960
Wei Fengxing

337
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,070
will be the first one.

338
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,200
Eye,

339
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,160
you lied to me.

340
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,400
Why didn't you help me?

341
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,790
We had a deal.

342
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,070
I only told you to do it.

343
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,160
I never said

344
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,660
I would help you kill them.

345
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,790
The reason is simple.

346
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,640
Even someone like me

347
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
shouldn't have

348
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,640
an ally like you.

349
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,000
If I had killed you

350
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,440
back then,

351
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,310
Sword Sect

352
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,750
wouldn't have known you betrayed them.

353
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,790
They would only think the people of the Yuan Yi Palace

354
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,920
killed the people of Sword Sect again.

355
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Xu Chonghua,

356
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,270
you should thank Sword Sect

357
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,680
for keeping you alive for a few more hours.

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,640
Take care of Qiushui for me.

359
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,000
Seven.

360
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,650
Sixth Brother,

361
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,110
I've never wanted to defeat you.

362
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,000
He deserved it.

363
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
It has nothing to do with you.

364
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
It's almost over.

365
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,630
You can leave.

366
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,000
We want to take everyone

367
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,130
in the Asura Field and prisons with us.

368
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,440
What if I don't agree?

369
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,750
You won't stop us.

370
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,570
Because the people in the Asura Field

371
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,140
are just like the past you.

372
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,270
I advise you to leave

373
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,480
before I change my mind.

374
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,220
Seven, be careful with his Eye Magic!

375
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,220
Why did you help me?

376
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,410
You're the one Sister Ye cares about.

377
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,720
I won't hurt you.

378
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,070
She saved me.

379
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,960
I promised her

380
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,350
I won't kill innocent people again.

381
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,240
You saw her?

382
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,730
She came to the Yuan Yi Palace?

383
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,590
Chang Wujue suffered a disturbance of the inner balance.

384
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,790
He invited her to come here to treat him.

385
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,980
The golden needles...

386
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
They really are her golden needles.

387
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,440
Why did she come

388
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,900
to such a dangerous place?

389
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Considering her condition,

390
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,440
how could she take it?

391
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Where is she now?

392
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,480
Did she get hurt?

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,110
I asked Miao Kong.

394
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,790
He said

395
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,040
Miao Feng has taken her away.

396
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,010
I think they went back to the Apothecary Valley.

397
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,370
Fifth Brother,

398
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,370
I'll leave this to you.

399
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,140
Take Sixth Brother

400
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,900
back to Sword Sect too.

401
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:02,960
Okay.

402
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,590
Leave now.

403
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,800
Chief Xue!

404
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,200
Chief Xue!

405
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,240
Huo...

406
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,960
Huo...

407
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,550
Chief Xue.

408
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,980
You're finally awake.

409
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,510
Ya Mi.

410
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,200
It's me.

411
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,510
Look.

412
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Light.

413
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,750
Light.

414
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,880
So beautiful.

415
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,070
Yes.

416
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,680
So beautiful.

417
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
The light is so beautiful.

418
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,110
So beautiful.

419
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,920
Chief Xue.

420
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,510
I will save you.

421
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,440
I won't let you die.

422
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,640
I will save you.

423
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,510
Come on. Drink.

424
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,680
Come on. Drink.

425
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Drink.

426
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,270
Is there a doctor here?

427
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,590
Sir.

428
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,850
Is there a doctor here?

429
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,590
This...

430
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,370
I need a doctor.

431
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Get lost!

432
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,570
What... What happened?

433
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm a doctor.

434
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,610
You're a doctor?

435
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Take a look at her.

436
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,270
Take a look at her!

437
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,360
Save her.

438
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,360
Save her.

439
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,960
Please.

440
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,409
I can't save her.

441
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,590
You're a doctor.

442
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,710
Are you going to let her die?

443
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,710
Let her die?

444
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,030
She already died.

445
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,590
So I can't save her.

446
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,480
What did you say?

447
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,190
She was poisoned by the Soul Devouring Powder.

448
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,190
It's been four hours since she died.

449
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,430
Her hands are still warm.

450
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
I guess you have continuously

451
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,670
infused her with the primordial energy along the way

452
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,960
to keep her body warm

453
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,200
as if she were alive.

454
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,440
No!

455
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,150
Even though she was poisoned by the Soul Devouring Powder,

456
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,750
it won't take effect so soon.

457
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,800
You're lying!

458
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,480
She didn't die because of the Soul Devouring Powder.

459
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,590
Look at the Lianquan Acupuncture Point

460
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,390
on her throat.

461
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,110
Why?

462
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,920
Why?

463
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,550
Why?

464
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,590
Why?

465
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,110
After seven days of poisoning,

466
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,040
she would lose her consciousness.

467
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,440
The needle

468
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,400
pierced her Lianquan Acupuncture Point

469
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,920
accurately and deeply.

470
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,480
Don't be too sad.

471
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,630
When she died,

472
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,160
she didn't suffer too much.

473
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,000
She probably didn't want

474
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,710
to end up like that.

475
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
She must have been

476
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,710
a very proud woman.

477
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,390
I promised to take you

478
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,120
back to the Apothecary Valley.

479
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
I told you I would protect you.

480
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,670
Ziye?

481
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,710
Ziye.

482
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm sorry.

483
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,670
I'm late.

484
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,550
Were you blaming me?

485
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,510
You silly girl.

486
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Who allowed you to leave the valley?

487
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,280
Weren't you aware

488
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,540
of your own condition?

489
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,630
You always thought about saving others,

490
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,360
bringing Xuehuai back to life, and saving Mo.

491
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,510
You always thought about saving them

492
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,510
and saving Seven!

493
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,310
What about yourself?

494
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Didn't you care

495
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
about your own health?

496
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,590
God.

497
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,230
God!

498
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,440
My disciple was only in her 20s.

499
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,800
She had suffered enough in her life.

500
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Why do you treat her so unfairly?

501
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,670
Why do you treat her so unfairly?

502
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,550
When I saw you back then,

503
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,430
you were also this cold.

504
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,320
Is Chief Xue back?

505
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,070
Is Chief Xue back?
