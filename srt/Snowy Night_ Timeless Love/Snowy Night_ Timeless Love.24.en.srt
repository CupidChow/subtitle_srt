Remember to bury Laughing at the World wine

under the plum tree.

6
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,630
Let's drink together when I'm back.

7
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
I'll surely beat you.

♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,110
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

10
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,240
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,870
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

Doctrine Leader.

21
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,720
How's my condition?

22
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,190
Be honest!

23
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,950
This disruption to your cultivation

24
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,649
has hurt your internal organs

25
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,050
and even much of your meridians.

26
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,160
I have unclogged your blood flow.

27
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,670
But...

28
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,110
But even your Spring Breeze technique

29
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,170
can't do anything.

30
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,350
I'm incompetent.

31
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,070
Feng.

32
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,760
It's not your fault.

33
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,550
If even your Spring Breeze

34
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,630
can't do anything,

35
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,450
we can only get the extraordinary healer

36
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,950
from Apothecary Valley.

37
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,820
But you shouldn't be

38
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,500
traveling right now,

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
or you'll only get worse.

40
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,830
I can't go.

41
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,110
So bring her here.

42
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:04,950
Feng.

43
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,200
You're the kid I trust the most.

44
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,190
I believe you can

45
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,310
bring her here.

46
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,150
Right?

47
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,910
Yes.

48
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,950
Doctrine Leader.

49
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,710
Feng.

50
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,220
But remember,

51
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,910
you must be careful.

52
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,720
Come back within a month

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,910
to take the antidote

54
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,440
to the Ice Silkworm Poison.

55
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,040
Otherwise, my heart will ache.

56
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,270
Don’t worry.

57
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,310
I won't let you down.

58
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,230
Also,

59
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,850
this health disruption isn't a trivial matter.

60
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,210
No one apart from

61
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,490
you and Ming Li should

62
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,560
know about this.

63
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,790
Understand?

64
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,600
I've dealt with our disciples

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,060
guarding in the corridor.

66
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,110
But you haven’t shown up for a long time.

67
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,120
Some disciples

68
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,830
are itching to start things.

69
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,910
Perfect.

70
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,070
I can take this opportunity to lure the snake out of its hole

71
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,670
to see who wants me dead.

72
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,310
Go on.

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,310
Envoy Miao Shui.

74
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,800
What is this for?

75
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,350
Oh, it's Envoy Miao Feng.

76
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,180
It's dark and windy.

77
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,730
I thought there was a thief.

78
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,870
Fortunately, you're fine.

79
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,910
Otherwise, I'd feel

80
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,550
so guilty.

81
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,800
In that case,

82
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,860
please step aside.

83
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,270
What's the urgent matter?

84
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,510
You're leaving before dawn?

85
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,910
Do I need to

86
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,940
report to you?

87
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,630
Of course not.

88
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,590
But

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,360
I have to remind you again.

90
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,450
If you're lying

91
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
and our leader's harmed,

92
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,230
I really can't

93
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,150
let you go.

94
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,110
I don't care what your aim is.

95
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,610
If you dare to attack me again,

96
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,740
don't blame me for being rude.

97
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,710
Be rude?

98
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,350
You've always been kind.

99
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,310
I'd like to see

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,710
how you look

101
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,159
when you're being rude.

102
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,510
Envoy Miao Feng.

103
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,390
Why are you so serious?

104
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,830
Ease up.

105
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,060
It was just a joke.

106
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,030
But you're right.

107
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,720
You always have

108
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,190
a smile on your face.

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,550
I doubt I could tell

110
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,700
even if your smile's genuine.

111
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,669
That old geezer Chang Wujue

112
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,250
must really be in trouble.

[Yuan Yi Palace]

114
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,820
Mr. Eye.

115
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,990
Doctrine Leader is taking a nap.

116
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,720
Please wait.

117
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,500
Eye.

118
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,160
You're back.

119
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,430
Come in.

120
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,840
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

121
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,430
I went to Mount Changbai

122
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,170
to take the life of the Skypool Hermit

123
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,910
to avenge you

124
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,950
for the past sword feud.

125
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,430
You're indeed my trusted disciple.

126
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,590
You never let me down.

127
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,390
You came back from afar.

128
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,120
Just in time.

129
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,460
Check out

130
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,370
my newly recruited mastiffs.

131
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,070
Aren't they cute?

132
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,200
Do you recognize

133
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,670
this thing?

134
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,950
This is...

135
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,910
Sun Saintess,

136
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,630
Wuma.

137
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,990
What a foolish woman.

138
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,310
She even tried to kill me.

139
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,400
Who did she think she is?

140
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,270
Am I right?

141
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,150
Eye.

142
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,900
I only hate that

143
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
I couldn't kill her

144
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,180
for you.

145
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,790
The golden needle is still here.

146
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:02,990
Eye.

147
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,930
As long as you submit to me,

148
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,470
you can enjoy the luxuries

149
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,630
of the world.

150
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,990
Did he see through me?

151
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,270
Or was it just a test?

152
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,990
Chang Wu Jue is really unfathomable.

153
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,580
Thank goodness we didn't take action first,

154
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,790
or it'd be us two

155
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,810
who were dead.

156
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,110
That dead face

157
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,460
was even uglier than me.

158
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,950
His cultivation in seclusion failed

159
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,160
and he lost control.

160
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,750
He also barely calmed

161
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,410
the Sun Saintess' rebellion.

162
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,070
His vitality

163
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,550
is greatly weakened.

164
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,990
That sly old fox.

165
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,630
He actually summoned me

166
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,470
to avoid suspicion.

167
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,250
If I knew,

168
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,310
I'd have slain him

169
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,440
with my Lixue Sword.

170
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,360
Unfortunately,

171
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,550
I was squashed

172
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,310
by his bluff.

173
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,430
Couldn't that wretch Miao Shui

174
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,760
sent you a message or something?

175
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,480
We missed such a good opportunity!

176
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,080
It's fine.

177
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,160
Chang Wujue's cultivation is disrupted,

178
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,910
Miao Feng was sent out,

179
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,030
and even Ming Li's not in the palace.

180
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,430
Even if he summons

181
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,490
all the disciples,

182
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,790
it'd take some time for them to get back.

183
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,830
We have to act quickly.

184
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,110
Buddy.

185
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,730
It's all up to this one chance.

186
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,310
If we can't kill him this time,

187
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,510
there won't be another chance

188
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,440
to kill that damn doctrine leader.

189
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,510
Miao Feng should've

190
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,240
arrived at Apothecary Valley.

191
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,230
I wonder if

192
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,870
Xue Ziye will agree to his invite.

193
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,430
But

194
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,910
we have to do it

195
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,110
before he comes back.

196
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm not sure

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,590
if he knows

198
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,250
about the Dragon Blood Pearl.

199
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,430
If he does,

200
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,950
we would fail.

201
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
I told you we should've

202
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,190
killed that woman.

203
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,390
Why did you let her live?

204
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,760
Do you really want to study medicine?

205
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,390
Or do you like girls with long hair?

206
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,790
I really don't get you.

207
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,430
Do you have a screw loose?

208
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,890
Seriously, you...

209
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,450
Miao Huo.

210
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,160
As long as you're happy.

211
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,050
I'll pick some confidants

212
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,170
from Asura Field

213
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,650
to deal with Miao Feng.

214
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,630
With how powerful Miao Feng is,

215
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,960
they won't be his match.

216
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,190
But if they manage to

217
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,310
stall Miao Feng,

218
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,510
we could rush to

219
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,600
kill the leader.

220
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,970
When will we do it?

221
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,320
To cover up his deteriorating condition,

222
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,350
he'll go to Yuan Yi Hall

223
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,320
as per his routine.

224
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,230
We'll do it then.

225
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,190
First, I'll return to Asura Field's dark realm

226
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,150
and meditate

227
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,750
to boost my Eye Magic.

228
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,590
It's not the time yet.

229
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,570
Don't be hasty.

230
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,110
Okay.

231
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,470
Keep your eyes closed

232
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,670
for the next few days.

233
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,050
I'll inform Miao Shui.

234
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,750
We must seize this opportunity.

235
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,670
I'm here.

236
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,550
Don't worry.

237
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,110
Here.

238
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,590
Your song

239
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,310
seems like an invitation.

240
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,390
The tune

241
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,330
moves in the same trajectory

242
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,830
as the chess player who moves the black pieces,

243
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,910
warm and cozy

244
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,360
like the spring breeze.

245
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,120
If I'm not mistaken,

246
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,910
you're the chess player

247
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,030
I play with

248
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,190
whom I've never met.

249
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
I’ve been waiting here

250
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,010
for you for a long time.

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,370
You and I always come as we please.

252
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,000
Why are you waiting for me?

253
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,910
Farewell.

254
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,710
Today might be

255
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,510
the last game of chess

256
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,510
I play with you,

257
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,680
Chief Xue.

258
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,560
As a martial artist, I guess

259
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,870
there are many things out of your control.

260
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,750
Then let's

261
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,850
finish this game today.

262
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,810
Aren’t you curious

263
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,130
why it’s the last time?

264
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,370
We got acquainted playing chess

265
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,030
and talk about chess.

266
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,680
I know not to cross the line.

267
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,260
If it's personal,

268
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,470
there's no need to pursue it.

269
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,590
Besides,

270
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,300
the game has to end one day.

271
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,070
And there will always

272
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,680
come a time to bid farewell.

273
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,970
Chief Xue, you won.

274
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,950
Is something bothering you?

275
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,990
In the past,

276
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,790
your moves were always smooth,

277
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,310
meticulous,

278
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,880
gentle, patient,

279
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,720
and never hasty,

280
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,400
but never giving up.

281
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,290
You always found a way to turn things around.

282
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,270
But today...

283
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,990
What's wrong?

284
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,069
It was like you were supposed to win

285
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,069
but you sabotaged yourself.

286
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,550
Your first moves

287
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,950
were a bit too hasty.

288
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,910
As for your last moves,

289
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,680
you had a chance to rectify things,

290
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,910
but it was like you didn't realize it

291
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,270
and gave up.

292
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,310
Because it's our last game,

293
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,310
did you let me win?

294
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,110
Indeed...

295
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,790
I lost to you, Chief Xue.

296
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,350
This match

297
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,990
could have been better.

298
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,550
Now that the game is over,

299
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,870
let’s say goodbye.

300
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,750
Chief Xue.

301
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,250
I hope there will come a day

302
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,670
when we can play like this again.

303
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:13,140
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

304
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:20,820
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

305
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,670
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

306
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,900
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

307
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:40,010
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

308
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,220
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

309
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,070
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

310
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,570
[Caohai Inn]

311
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,860
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

312
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,110
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

313
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:38,950
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

314
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,030
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

315
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,800
Chief.

316
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:56,630
♫Longing etched in my heart, but I don't wish for your acknowledgement of my love♫

317
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,490
Mr. Seven went south to Yangzhou.

318
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:04,750
♫Asking the stars about our fate, as fireworks appear in my dream♫

319
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,770
It'll take at least a month to return.

320
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,810
The snowstorm outside the valley

321
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,490
is too huge.

322
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,440
You should go back and rest.

323
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,940
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

324
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,470
I'm stuffed.

325
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,760
I came out for a walk.

326
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,390
It's too cold.

327
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:19,470
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

328
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,110
Let's go back.

329
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,950
Okay.

330
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,660
Hong.

331
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,230
Coming.

332
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,310
Here.

333
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,100
Okay.

334
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,090
Who are you looking for?

335
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,300
I'm Huo Zhanbai, the seventh disciple of Sword Sect.

336
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,700
Greetings, Senior Liao.

337
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,620
Seven?

338
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,020
What brings you here?

339
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,750
You may not remember,

340
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,430
but I met you once.

341
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,870
Two years ago, at the Guazhou market,

342
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,330
you checked a kid's pulse.

343
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm that kid's uncle.

344
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,850
I remember now.

345
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,770
That seriously ill child?

346
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,710
Yes.

347
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,710
I'm here today

348
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,220
to convey a message on your disciple's behalf.

349
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,520
After all these years,

350
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,500
it's still finally came.

351
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,550
Come in.

352
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,990
Did you come from Apothecary Valley?

353
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,590
Yes.

354
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,420
How has Ziye's health been?

355
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,230
Not very well.

356
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,870
Her cold disease

357
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
is getting worse.

358
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,260
So it came to this after all.

359
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,770
Have a seat.

360
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,110
It's my fault as her master.

361
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,830
When Ziye was only 18 years old,

362
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,830
I left her in charge of Apothecary Valley.

363
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,830
All these years,

364
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,110
she must've had a tough time.

365
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,000
This hairpin

366
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,070
was a token I left to Ziye

367
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,360
when I left the valley.

368
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,430
That girl

369
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,280
is always smart and strong.

370
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,440
I thought her current

371
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,550
medical skills

372
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
were invincible.

373
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,030
To think

374
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,000
she can't avoid using this token.

375
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,430
Is she still adamant about

376
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,280
me helping her revive Xuehuai?

377
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
I told her long ago

378
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,340
that it's impossible.

379
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,130
I don't think it's Xuehuai...

380
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,710
but the child

381
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,710
I just mentioned.

382
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,310
I see.

383
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,070
This prescription

384
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,750
can’t cure Mo's illness,

385
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,750
but it can be said

386
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,210
to have saved three lives.

387
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,670
It seems this prescription

388
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,260
doesn't work on Mo.

389
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,470
Not only that.

390
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
Her initial

391
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
five-herb prescription

392
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,790
was actually useless.

393
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,230
Useless?

394
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,790
How could this be?

395
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,310
Why weren't

396
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,550
these herbs used?

397
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,030
Where's the Dragon Blood Pearl?

398
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,190
These herbs

399
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,070
are all extraordinary,

400
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,670
but they're all extremely potent

401
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,730
and incompatible.

402
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,460
It's impossible to combine them

403
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,720
into a medicinal drug.

404
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,040
What did you say?

405
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,500
So she's been lying to me all along?

406
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,910
She didn't lie to you.

407
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,110
But I...

408
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,430
But I spent eight years.

409
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,790
I spent eight years!

410
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,470
I went through fire and water

411
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,950
and gave my all

412
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,610
for eight years just for this.

413
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,790
How is this prescription useless?

414
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,830
How could it be?

415
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,110
Ziye said in the letter that

416
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,670
although this prescription is recorded in the ancient books,

417
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,630
she tested it and learned that

418
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,560
it doesn't help with Mo's illness.

419
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,210
Ziye must've gave her all

420
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,930
to help Mo survive till today.

421
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,270
Even now,

422
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,970
she’s still planning for Mo's survival.

423
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,610
I'll use these herbs separately

424
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,130
to create medicinal drugs

425
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,590
to extend Mo’s life.

426
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,430
I think

427
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,750
that's why she asked you

428
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,910
to find me with this.

429
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,760
But I spent a whole eight years.

430
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,360
Eight years!

431
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,130
She should've long told you

432
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,310
that Mo will eventually die.

433
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,720
But if she said that,

434
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,870
how will

435
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,350
you and Mo's mother

436
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,510
face that fact?

437
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,730
Ziye must know you very well.

438
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,740
So she couldn't tell you

439
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,710
the truth.

440
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,160
You've known her for eight years.

441
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,410
Do you know what she is obsessed with?

442
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,990
To find out the truth

443
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,790
of Mo Family Village's massacre

444
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,550
and awaken the person in the ice.

445
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,270
You two are very similar.

446
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,410
You both have obsessions,

447
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,790
desperately seeking

448
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,960
a glimmer of hope.

449
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,110
You know what?

450
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,230
This is the only token

451
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,230
I left to her.

452
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,950
I once told her

453
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,880
if she encountered difficulties,

454
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,630
she could bring this to me

455
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,990
and I'd do my best to help her.

456
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,750
I thought

457
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,130
she'd use this hairpin

458
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,510
to revive Xuehuai in the ice.

459
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,910
But I never imagined

460
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,390
that she'd use this

461
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,990
to save

462
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,410
a kid she has no ties with.

463
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,920
From now on,

464
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,800
I’ll be responsible

465
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,750
of Xu Mo's treatment.

466
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,310
Ziye did everything

467
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,390
to save Mo for you.

468
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,720
I think this is the only thing

469
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,040
she could do for you.

470
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,550
I know you can't accept it

471
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,710
for the time being.

472
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,830
Think about it.

473
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,680
Mo’s illness

474
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,750
can't be cured.

475
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,550
I've found an ancient prescription

476
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,750
to cure Mo's illness.

477
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,750
Only if you wake up can you save him.

478
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,480
Huo Zhanbai.

479
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,920
♫A cup of wine, a toast to the world, as wind and snow knock on the door♫

♫Life drifts like dust, when will we meet again?♫

482

I'm serious.

483
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,550
If you're severely injured again, don't come back.

484
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,350
I can't afford to waste my energy.

485
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:59,400
♫From vibrant warmth to icy cold, it's just a single turn away♫

495

This is Mo's medicine.

496
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:45,830
What?

497
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,950
You still can't bear to leave?

498

♫Love falls like silent snow, sweeping away lost souls♫

Actually,

501
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,400
all these years,

502
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,390
you've been trying your best

503
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,520
to extend Mo’s life.

504
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,640
It's enough.

505
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
Huo Zhanbai.

506
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,910
You huge fool.

507
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,290
I'm sorry.

♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

509

♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

512
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,150
when I saw you at the Guazhou market

513
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,520
and saw the jade pendant on your waist,

514
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,030
I already guessed

515
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,800
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

516
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,870
you were the former chief

517
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,130
of Apothecary Valley.

518
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,990
You said

519
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,660
Mo's illness is unmanageable.

520
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,690
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

521
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,870
Since then,

522
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,120
every time I think about

523
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,820
Chief Xue's hesitance when talking about Mo...

524
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:55,890
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

525
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,670
I've actually

526
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,630
long had my doubts.

00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:03,600
♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

528
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,760
Do you blame her?

529

♫I give my remaining years, how could I ever break free?♫

530
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,630
Like you said,

531
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:17,270
♫As long as you can recognize us every time♫

532
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,550
she prescribed

533
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,350
this impossible prescription.

534
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,110
She saved me,

535
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,470
Mo, and Mo's mother.

536
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,610
All these years,

537
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,830
she did everything

538
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,830
to save me

539
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,200
and Mo.

540
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,950
She kept hiding the truth

541
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,060
so I wouldn't lose hope.

542
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,590
I once told her that

543
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,020
obsession is like a crutch.

544
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,430
Without crutches,

545
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,890
one can't survive the snowstorm.

546
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,550
She knows that

547
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
as long as there's a glimmer of hope,

548
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,910
I'll do my best

549
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,800
for this hope.

550
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,630
Why would I blame her?

551
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,710
She just

552
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,660
gave you a chance to do your best

553
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,429
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

554
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,810
From what you said,

555
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,199
you'd already guessed that

556
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,429
the prescription might be ineffective.

557
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,290
Why didn't you verify it with her?

558
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,489
Regardless of the medicine's efficacy,

559
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,949
I'd have kept looking for the herbs.

560
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,429
In that case,

561
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,710
why should I ask?

562
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,710
No matter what,

563
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,940
I'll try my best to save Mo.

564
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,480
Don't worry.

565
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,310
I will do my best

566
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,889
to save Xu Mo.

567
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,280
I'll discuss it with my husband

568
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
when he gets back,

569
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,260
and we'll set out immediately.

570
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,310
I'll go pack up.

571
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,130
I kept persuading her to let go of her obsession,

572
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,830
but I couldn't

573
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,770
let mine go.

574
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,270
Ziye.

575
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,190
You could have

576
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,470
told me sooner.

577
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,070
Why did you have to

578
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,490
bear so much blame and torture yourself?

579
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,670
Honey.

580
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,990
Do we have a guest?

581
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,350
Seven?

582
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,300
Seven!

583
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,210
Fifth Brother?

584
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

585
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,940
I was about to tell you

586
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,470
my husband is your fifth brother.

587
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,230
I thought

588
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,350
you came to summon him back

589
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,130
to Sword Sect,

590
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,670
so I didn't reveal his identity.

591
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,270
It's fine.

592
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,380
Seven doesn't care about these.

593
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,710
Seven!

594
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,360
Why are you here?

595
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,030
It's a long story.

596
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,750
Seven came to me

597
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,610
with Ziye's handwritten letter.

598
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,470
She needs me to save someone in Guazhou.

599
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,610
He is in critical condition.

600
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,230
We've to leave tomorrow morning.

601
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,970
Who managed to get my wife's attention?

602
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,300
Sixth Brother's child,

603
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,670
Mo.

604
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,010
Six's child?

605
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,020
Where is he now?

606
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,490
Catch up later.

607
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,800
Bao peed again.

608
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,190
Okay.

609
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,780
Honey, hurry.

610
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,610
Change his diapers.

611
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,840
I'm here. I'm here.

612
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,690
Seven, take a seat.

613
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,450
Why are you back so late today?

614
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,810
Did you go drinking again?

615
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,770
I didn't!

616
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,230
Alright, my dear baby.

617
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,470
It’s okay.

618
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,630
Chief.

619
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,500
Someone's here to see you.

620
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,150
See me?

621
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,710
Do they have the Fate-Reversal Token?

622
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,190
Yes.

623
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,280
They even

624
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,430
have many of them.

625
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,360
What do you mean?

626
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,110
They have nine tokens.

627
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,230
You need medical treatment?

628
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,510
Isn’t this

629
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,030
your chess mate?

630
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,870
I'm Envoy Miao Feng from Yuan Yi Palace of Mount Kunlun.

631
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,910
I was ordered to come here

632
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,770
to seek treatment from Chief Xue.

633
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,700
You're actually from Yuan Yi Palace?

634
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,750
I heard

635
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,100
you like seclusion

636
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,960
and only provide treatment in this premise.

637
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,990
So I first followed

638
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,590
the person releasing the Fate-Reversal Tokens,

639
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,520
Ms. Shuang Hong,

640
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,310
and collected

641
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,780
all the tokens.

642
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,440
No wonder he said it was his last time

643
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,820
as my chess mate.

644
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,990
May I ask if

645
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,530
there are nine patients to treat?

646
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,810
There's only one patient.

647
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,150
But I was afraid

648
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,270
you wouldn't agree to the treatment

649
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,650
or how my treatment

650
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,700
would be hindered if you're also treating others,

651
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,360
so I just got multiple tokens.

652
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,200
It wasn't tough anyway.

653
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,360
Who is it that needs treatment?

654
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,720
Yuan Yi Palace's doctrine leader.

655
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,550
While

656
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,100
cultivating in seclusion,

657
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,390
he suddenly felt unwell.

658
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,090
He hasn't fully recovered

659
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,990
despite days of rest.

660
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,110
He heard that Apothecary Valley

661
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,040
has top-notch medical expertise,

662
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,990
so he ordered me

663
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,320
to come all the way here to seek treatment.

664
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,710
Chief Xue,

665
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,360
please visit Yuan Yi Palace to treat him.

666
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm sorry.

667
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,570
We never treat patients outside the valley.

668
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,870
Even this

669
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,430
won't cut it?

670
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,750
I heard that you ask for hefty medical fees.

671
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,880
100,000 to save one person.

672
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,550
My leader ordered me

673
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,410
to bring some meager things here.

674
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,890
He's willing to pay ten times the usual fees.

675
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm not feeling well.

676
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,070
I can't leave the valley.

677
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,550
I'm unable to

678
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,790
accede to your request.

679
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,630
I'll have to ask you to leave.

680
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,210
Before I came here,

681
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,230
I also heard that

682
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,440
you can’t leave the valley

683
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,630
because you can't withstand the cold

684
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,960
with your cold disease.

685
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,390
Is it true?

686
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,910
If so,

687
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,640
I can help you

688
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,200
get rid of the cold disease.

689
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,910
In that case,

690
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,320
your medical skills

691
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,050
are even better than mine.

692
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,710
You're the world's top healer.

693
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,710
Have you heard of the Spring Breeze?

694
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,310
You should worry about yourself first.

695
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,720
Your hair's turning blue

696
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,710
because of the Ice Silkworm Poison.

697
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,840
I was poisoned

698
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,540
with the Ice Silkworm Poison.

699
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,340
To resist the cold poison,

700
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,250
after 20 years,

701
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,750
I finally mastered the secret technique

702
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,010
of the Holy Fire Order.

703
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,390
The snow actually melted.

704
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
You’re an excellent doctor.

705
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,390
But compared to internal power,

706
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,730
there are areas where acupuncture falls short.

707
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,200
May I have the honor

708
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,640
to get rid of your cold disease?

709
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,150
Life and death are predestined.

710
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,260
Doctors never treat themselves

711
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,460
since ancient times.

712
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,390
I, Xue Ziye,

713
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,990
am not a coward who can be threatened

714
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,230
by death or threats.

715
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,670
Chief Xue.

716
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,980
If you refuse...

717
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,710
What?

718
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,080
Has the evil side been exposed?

719
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,190
Looks like Yuan Yi Palace

720
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,510
aren't that capable.

721
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,400
Envoy Miao Feng,

722
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,750
you should know

723
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,110
that if a doctor's not willing,

724
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,350
the patient will never recover.

725
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm not afraid of death.

726
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,770
You can't threaten me.

727
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,030
Even if I go with you for treatment,

728
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,580
you don't know medicine.

729
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,510
How can you tell

730
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,310
if my prescription is correct?

731
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,160
With just

732
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,200
mere adjustments

733
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,360
in the proportions,

734
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,930
I could make an unorthodox prescription

735
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,330
that

736
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,430
might cause your leader

737
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,710
to die sooner.

738
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,550
Of course,

739
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,590
I understand the risks.

740
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,870
So I've never

741
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,390
thought of offending you.

742
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,230
If you have to refuse...

743
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,430
Since I've failed my duty

744
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,960
and can't return to Kunlun,

745
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,550
I can only kill myself here.

746
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,020
Stop!

747
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,670
Chief Xue...

748
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,080
Since...

749
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,750
you saved me,

750
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,910
does it mean... you agree to treat my leader?

751
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,710
What a lunatic.

752
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,800
It seems your leader's orders

753
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,950
cannot be disobeyed.

754
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,510
Carry him into the valley.
