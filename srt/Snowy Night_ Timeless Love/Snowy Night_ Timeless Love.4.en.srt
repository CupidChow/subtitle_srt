[Winter Hall, Apothecary Valley]

5
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,230
Chief Xue.

6
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,290
I've come here today

7
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,820
specifically to thank you.

8
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,710
Saving lives is what healers do.

9
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,190
Besides, you've already paid me.

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,070
There's no need to thank me again.

11
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,000
You only accepted payment for one.

12
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,800
But you saved not only Mo

13
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,110
but also my junior

14
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,670
and me.

15
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,110
In the past,

16
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,910
I indeed misunderstood you

17
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,030
and thought you were mercenary, heartless,

18
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,030
and indifferent.

19
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,500
But when I saw you put your life at risk

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,900
to save Mo in the ice cave,

21
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,510
I knew I was wrong.

22
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,490
All these things have made me realize

23
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,050
that although you appear cold,

24
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,870
you're actually

25
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,329
warm-hearted and caring.

26
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,260
If it weren't for you,

27
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,470
I would've been a pile of ashes by now.

28
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,070
Also,

29
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,230
earlier, you mentioned to me

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,890
an ancient prescription for treating Mo.

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,620
I suppose it must have been hard

32
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,920
for you to obtain it.

33
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,190
Anyway,

34
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,680
thank you very much.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,860
I don't think you're here to thank me.

36
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,560
You just want the prescription.

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,690
I'm truly grateful,

38
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,930
but it's also true…

39
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,130
that I want the prescription.

40
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,300
You told me

41
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,750
that after I fully recovered,

42
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,630
you'd give me the ancient prescription.

43
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,560
I wonder if you can give it to me now.

44
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,430
Wait until tomorrow.

45
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,790
Thank you, Chief Xue.

46
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,190
These five things

47
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,140
are all rare medicines.

48
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,400
They're all so valuable

49
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,050
that everyone in the martial world wants to get them.

50
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,420
With just one of them,

51
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,170
a cultivator

52
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,670
can greatly increase their inner strength,

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,600
and a sick person

54
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,440
can recover like a miracle.

55
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,050
But I don't know if this prescription

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,510
can really work.

57
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,290
If it can save lives,

58
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,980
then it definitely works.

59
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,120
Moreover,

60
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,160
you didn't save just one person

61
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,590
but three.

62
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,580
Mr. Seven.

63
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,380
Ms. Qiushui.

64
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,710
Chief Xue.

65
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,770
This prescription

66
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,610
is recorded in ancient books.

67
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,070
Perhaps it was just

68
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,170
a whimsical scribble by the ancients.

69
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,900
No one has ever tried it before.

70
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,570
I don't know if it'll work.

71
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,680
Chief Xue,

72
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,390
just give me the prescription.

73
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,390
To save Mo's life,

74
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,950
I'll try my best.

75
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,230
This is the prescription for the Five Golden Pill.

76
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,110
It requires the Seven-Leaf Fungus

77
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,300
from the Holy Lake of the Moon Sect,

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,540
the Azure Phoenix Flower from the White Cloud Palace,

79
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,600
the Dragon's Tongue

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,910
from the cliffs of Mount Jun in Dongting,

81
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,380
the Snow Poppy from the Qingling Snow Mountain,

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,380
and the ten-thousand-year Dragon Blood Frost Pearl.

83
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,780
These things

84
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,670
are all rare and incredible medicines.

85
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,800
They definitely have reviving power.

86
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,750
Don't get too excited yet.

87
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,300
These five medicines

88
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,710
are scattered far across the world

89
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,000
and extremely difficult to obtain.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,550
Moreover, these five medicines

91
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,350
are all treasured possessions

92
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,000
of different sects in the martial world.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,870
Obtaining them is hard and dangerous.

94
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,909
Even if I needed to go to the ends of the earth

95
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,190
and brave all dangers,

96
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:46,970
I'd still get them.

97
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,430
Think twice.

98
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,070
If you take them by force,

99
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,070
you'll make enemies

100
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,230
with those sects.

101
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,930
You'll then be targeted

102
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,930
by a lot of people.

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,720
Your life will be in danger.

104
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,110
As long as I can save Mo,

105
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,330
I don't mind fighting against the world

106
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,590
or even losing my life.

107
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Death is the easiest.

108
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,120
It ends everything.

109
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,880
But with each medicine you get,

110
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,790
you'll become more hopeful.

111
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,150
I fear you might successfully get

112
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,910
four of them

113
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,120
but fail to get the last one.

114
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,300
Then all your efforts would be in vain,

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,960
and you'd be in utter despair.

116
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,320
That would be more painful than death.

117
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,570
Now that I have a way to save Mo,

118
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,240
I can't worry about the future.

119
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,560
Since you've made up your mind,

120
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,240
you can leave the mountain today.

121
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,430
Thank you, Chief Xue.

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,120
Shuang Hong.

123
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,060
After obtaining those five medicines,

124
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,410
put them in this box

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,210
to preserve their potency.

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,990
Before you get them,

127
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,730
Ms. Qiushui can bring Mo here

128
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,060
for regular check-ups.

129
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,910
I'll do my best to stabilize his condition.

130
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,660
Thank you, Chief Xue.

131
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,190
Chief has other matters to attend to.

132
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,720
Please see yourselves out.

133
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,770
Thank you a lot.

134
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,230
Chief,

135
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,309
Mr. Seven still has

136
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,890
the Fate-Reversal Token in his possession.

137
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,870
He hasn't left the valley yet.

138
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll go retrieve it now.

139
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,830
Wait.

140
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,660
We can wait to retrieve it

141
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,070
until he gathers all those five medicines.

142
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,350
How long will that take?

143
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,990
Three years? Five years?

144
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,350
Yeah.

145
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,270
How long will it take?

146
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:12,950
Huan.

147
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,910
It's cold outside.

148
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,270
Get in the carriage with Mo.

149
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,030
I need to have a word with my senior.

150
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,750
Yes, Madam.

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,830
Careful.

152
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,750
Senior.

153
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,430
Obtaining those medicines will be difficult.

154
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,830
You must be very careful.

155
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,310
I'll go to the Moon Sect

156
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,680
to get the Seven-Leaf Fungus first.

157
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,410
It shouldn't be too dangerous.

158
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,110
Junior,

159
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,390
after you return,

160
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,120
take good care of Mo.

161
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,220
I've told other juniors

162
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,890
to look after you and your son.

163
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,710
Senior.

164
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm not returning to the Sword Sect.

165
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,430
Being back there would only bring back painful memories.

166
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,290
Then where are you planning to go?

167
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,870
Chonghua has a house in Guazhou.

168
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,830
The climate there is pleasant.

169
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,230
I've thought it through.

170
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,350
I'll take Mo there for recuperation.

171
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,830
Senior,

172
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
you made a promise to Chonghua,

173
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,030
but you can't take care of us

174
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,870
for a lifetime, can you?

175
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,910
You'll eventually marry and start a family.

176
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,790
You'll have your own children too.

177
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,550
Mo and I

178
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,950
need to have our own home as well…

179
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,550
Junior,

180
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,490
it's not just for Chonghua

181
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,950
that I'm looking after you and your son.

182
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,710
I also want to repay

183
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,570
Master's kindness in raising me.

184
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,630
You and I

185
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,490
grew up together in the Celestial Alp Sect.

186
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,530
Between us,

187
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,530
isn't there also

188
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,190
the bond of fellow disciples?

189
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
Before Mo fully recovers,

190
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,950
I won't be selfish

191
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,680
and think about anything else.

I've resented

I hope you don't blame me.

It's understandable that you resented me.

for the past few years,

you've been treating us for free,

266
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,290
and you've even built an orphanage for us

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,120
so that

268
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,630

He'll make a good official.

If it weren't for that,

276

I wouldn't have thought of preparing this.

Besides,

384
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,310
You may rise.

385
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,710
You have indeed lived up to my expectations.

386
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,110
You are a born killer.

387
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,600
Just four years in the Asura Field,

388
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,830
and you've already fought your way out.

389
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,200
I am willing to serve the Doctrine Leader.

390
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,550
Come up.

392
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,230
From today on,

393
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,790
you are the

394
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,520
Yuan Yi Palace's top assassin.

395
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,910
I want to give you something.

396
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,240
This sword is called Lixue.

397
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,680
I've treasured it for many years.

398
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,960
Its blade is thin and light,

399
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,720
cutting through iron like mud.

400
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,610
From now on,

401
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,030
it's yours.

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,660
Remember,

403
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,390
it's not for

404
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,390
trimming flowers or cutting grass.

405
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,700
You may go now.

406
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,590
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

407
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,270
What are your orders, Doctrine Leader?

408
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,070
I need your help

409
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,400
to retrieve something.

410

The Seven-Leaf Fungus from the Moon Sect.

411
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,280
The Seven-Leaf Fungus from the Moon Sect?

412
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,370
Your Eye Magic

413
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,910
can control others' minds,

414
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,610
but the time is not ripe yet.

415
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,550
Do not use it.

416
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,160
Understood.

417
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,240
Go now.

418
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,540
If he can help me

419
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,940
retrieve that treasure,

420
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,390
I can more quickly

421
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,480
break through this level of cultivation

422
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,000
and enter a new realm.

423
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,150
Congratulations, Doctrine Leader, on gaining such a capable subordinate.

424
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,910
If your skills can further improve,

425
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,770
returning to the Central Plains

426
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,470
and regaining control of the martial world

427
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,670
will be within reach.

However, Eye

429
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,340
has a vicious nature.

430
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm afraid...

431
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,430
What I need is precisely

432
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,790
someone truly cold-blooded and heartless.

433

Right now, he is

the sharpest sword in my hand.

Why did you abandon me?

436

437
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,550

Come,

come here.

From now on, your name is Eye.

As long as the three golden needles in his body

448
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,720
continue to seal his memories,

449
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,820
he won't remember his past.

450
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,030
Don't forget to specially send

451
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,430
one of them to that place.

452

Make sure

453
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,870
that person can get the Fate-Reversal Token.

454
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,350
Yes.

don't you understand the Chief yet?

She never

459
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,400
lets us interfere in these things.

After all these years,

467
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,830
I've been investigating

468
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,890
the truth of what happened back then.

469
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,790
The arsenopyrite on this dart

470
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,950
is the only clue.

471
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,870
I hope

472
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,350
that through this clue,

473
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,130
I can find the culprit from back then.

474

[Chief of Moon Sect, Jing]

482
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,570
Who might you be?

483
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,710
Isn't it said that Apothecary Valley treats patients

484
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,810
without asking for identity,

485
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,740
and only demands those two things?

486
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,750
Since you've come to the Apothecary Valley,

487
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,280
you must know the rules of Apothecary Valley.

488
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,510
Bring it here.

are both here.

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,370
For treatment at Apothecary Valley,

492
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,000
only the patient may enter the valley,

493
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,530
with at most one companion.

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:00,990
This Apothecary Valley

499
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,870
is a place for treating illnesses.

Yes.

Please wait here for a moment.

This beauty before me

506
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,270
must be Chief Xue.

Black clothes with moon ornaments,

508
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,110
and the Nirvana tattoo of the Other Shore.

509
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,990
I presume you

510
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,090
must be the chief of the Moon Sect.

511
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,470
I called you a beauty.

512
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,550
Why didn't you return the compliment?

513
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,510
Not everyone

514
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,040
likes to be called a beauty.

515
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,510
Besides, you called me a beauty without permission.

516
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,910
I'm not pleased about it.

517
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,000
That's my mistake then.

518
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,030
I thought the Chief of Apothecary Valley,

519
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,200
greedy and lecherous,

520
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,310
is surely an old and

521
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,370
ugly person.

522
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,970
I didn't expect

523
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,830
to find such a sharp-tongued

524
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,090
and pretty young lady.

525
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,710
You attack before

526
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,840
we're done talking.

527
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,830
Is this your way

528
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,830
of treating guests?

529
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,540
You just used your skills to dodge,

530
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,220
now your Shenque and Qihai acupoints

531
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,020
should be burning and stinging.

532
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,750
At this moment, your Quchi and Tianjing acupoints

533
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,570
must feel like ice-cold snake bites.

534
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,630
Am I right or wrong?

535
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,310
In my opinion,

536
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,790
you're showing signs of poisoning.

537
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,830
Poisoning?

538
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,670
Since childhood, I've been dealing with

539
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,510
all kinds of poisons.

540
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,870
Disregarding whether anyone

541
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,870
could poison me

542
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,000
right under my nose,

543
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,090
I'm sure I can at least tell

544
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,030
if I'm poisoned or not.

545
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,430
Doctors can't treat themselves.

546
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,350
Although you're skilled in using poisons,

547
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,080
you're often the most likely to overlook poison.

548
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,350
The terrifying aspect of this poison

549
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,430
lies in the fact that

550
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,350
it lingers in

551
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,370
your vital areas,

552
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,440
persisting without an outbreak.

553
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,470
Unlike other poisons

554
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,910
that are fierce and violent,

555
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,370
it's not easily detected.

556
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,020
Look at your neck.

557
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,510
This is...

558
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,870
I've already applied acupuncture

559
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,480
to bring the toxins to the surface.

560
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,120
The faint

561
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,030
Manjushaka Nirvana marks on your neck

562
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,760
is evidence of your poisoning.

563
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,230
As expected of the Chief of Apothecary Valley.

564
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,030
You identified the cause at a glance.

565
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,670
It wasn't in vain that I

566
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,590
went through great trouble to obtain the Fate-Reversal Token

567
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,200
and traveled thousands of miles from Lingjiu Mountain

568
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,660
to this far northern land.

569
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,960
Then please, Chief, follow me inside.

570
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,930
I'll carefully check your pulse.

571
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,280
Alright.

572
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,190
The pulse is tight, rapid, and soft.

573
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,990
It's caused by gu poison.

574
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,270
Though it's rapid, it's soft.

575
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,270
Still treatable.

576
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,510
Who could have done it?

577
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,910
What medicine do you plan to use?

578
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,110
No need for medicine.

579
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,480
I will treat you with acupuncture.

580
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,870
I've traveled day and night to get here.

581
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,070
I'm really exhausted from the journey.

582
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,550
Could I rest for a few days

583
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,150
before receiving treatment?

584
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,110
I have my reason

585
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,760
for using acupuncture.

586
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,090
How about just one day of rest?

587
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,020
If you're not in a hurry to recover,

588
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,830
then you should leave the valley immediately.

589
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,270
How are you

590
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,230
more short-tempered

591
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,760
than me, the chief of a sect?

592
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,639
In this Apothecary Valley,

593
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,540
you are first and foremost a patient,

594
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,659
and secondly the Moon Sect Chief.

595
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,199
I've certainly learned my lesson.

596
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,190
No wonder you can single-handedly

597
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,389
manage Apothecary Valley

598
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,989
with ease at such a young age.

599
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,510
I'll follow your arrangements then.

600
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,830
It's better to recover soon anyway.

601
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,489
I can return to my sect earlier

602
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,710
to prevent any issues

603
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,440
that might arise in my absence.

604
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,390
Start preparing.

605
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,190
Yes.

606
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,950
You're here too.

607
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,030
Take a look at this.

608
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,150
This represents good fortune and wishes.

609
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,830
Is that true?

610
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,620
It is.

611
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,710
Vegetables, take a look.

612
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,550
The Seven-Leaf Fungus

613
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,810
is in the ancient tomb.

614
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,980
How many guards are there?

615
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,240
There are no guards.

616
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,020
You seem quite straightforward.

617
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,530
Let me give you a piece of advice.

618
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,390
It's not too late to turn back now.

619
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,960
Thanks for the warning,

620
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,660
but I must go.

621
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,190
The ancient tomb is located at the peak of Lingjiu Mountain.

622
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,670
It's surrounded by a forest.

623
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,880
Each tree has been watered

624
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,270
with the Moon Sect's unique arsenopyrite.

625
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,780
Thus, the trees are all highly poisonous,

[Lingjiu Mountain of Moon Sect]

627
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,990
forming a miasma.

628
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,930
You must get in and out quickly.

629
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,030
Don't linger.

630
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,190
As for what traps are in the ancient tomb,

631
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,280
I have no idea.

632
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,550
Because many people

633
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,180
have come for the Seven-Leaf Fungus,

634
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
but no one has ever

635
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,780
made it out alive.

636
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,530
[Miasma Forest of Moon Sect]

637
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,230
What a strong poisonous miasma.

638
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,490
Sect Chief.

639
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,950
Sect Chief?

640
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,980
[Ancient Tomb of Moon Sect]

641
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,910
Who are you?

642
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,650
I am the Moon Sect Chief,

643
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,860
Jing.

644
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,040
Is arsenopyrite

645
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,580
unique to the Moon Sect?

646
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,020
Yes.

647
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,720
Respected elders of the Moon Sect,

648
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,740
I, Huo Zhanbai of the Sword Sect,

649
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,650
have come today to save a friend's child.

650
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,280
I've come to your esteemed sect

651
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,380
to borrow the sacred Seven-Leaf Fungus.

652
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,440
I apologize for disturbing your rest

653
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,390
and hope you can forgive me.

654
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,470
In the future, if the Moon Sect

655
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,390
has any need,

656
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,790
I will not stop at anything

657
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,760
to help the Moon Sect.

658
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,880
Do you know about

659
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,340
the Mo Family Village in Wuling County?

660
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,950
Do you remember

661
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,990
the Mo Family Village in Wuling County?

662
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,190
Mo Family Village...

663
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,150
I remember.

664
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,760
What do you know?

665
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,230
Tell me quickly.

666
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,710
I once heard the former chief

667
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,750
and the priest planning

668
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,390
to attack Mo Family Village.

669
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,990
Over a hundred lives in Mo Family Village were exterminated.

670
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,190
So it was indeed the Moon Sect's doing.

671
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,230
I'm not...

672
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,910
I'm not sure.

673
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,690
How can you not be sure?

674
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,930
Think carefully.

675
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,430
In the fourth year of Huijia,

676
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,430
on New Year's Eve,

677
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,950
in the Mo Family Village of Wuling County,

678
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,630
what exactly did the Moon Sect do?
