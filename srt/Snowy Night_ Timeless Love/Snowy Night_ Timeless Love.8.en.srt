[Episode 8]

4
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,229
In a few days,

5
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,870
it will be the New Year festival.

6
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,670
If Mr. Huo

7
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,790
is not in a hurry to leave,

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,230
we could still have dumplings together.

9
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,890
That's right,

10
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,320
there are still four herbs to collect anyway.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,630
A few more days won't make a difference.

12
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,710
With one more person,

13
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,210
we can have a few more delicious dishes.

14
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,870
You're just thinking about food,

15
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,670
how could you understand his anxiety?

16
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,470
Haste makes waste,

17
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,270
you can't eat hot tofu in a hurry.

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,910
I hope Mr. Huo

19
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,610
can find the next herb soon.

20
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,070
That's hard to say.

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,670
He said he was going to Yangzhou.

22
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,720
I've heard Yangzhou is a world of splendor.

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,829
What if he goes there,

24
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,390
gets dazzled by the splendor,

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,670
and loses interest in searching for the herbs?

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,070
He's not one to indulge in worldly pleasures.

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,600
He certainly won't do that.

28
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,240
Chief.

29
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,180
But obtaining the next herb

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,250
is indeed difficult.

31
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,630
When we got the previous herb,

32
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,750
it was while Jing

33
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,910
happened to be away from the Moon Sect.

34
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,370
Though it was a close call,

35
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,329
there was still a glimmer of luck.

36
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm afraid that getting this second herb

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,410
will be even more challenging.

38
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,110
Silly bird,

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,610
your master has already left the valley.

40
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,810
Why did you come back?

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,230
Chief,

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,910
what did Mr. Seven write?

43
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,950
Determination is like a crutch,

44
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,190
helping one break through wind and snow.

45
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
That day, in my haste,

46
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,180
I falsely claimed this branch was a hairpin,

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,960
which allowed us to break through the storm together and return.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,090
I carved this branch

49
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,430
as an apology

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,110
and as mutual encouragement for us.

51
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,920
From: Seven.

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
So that day,

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
he was carving wood in the courtyard

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,790
for this.

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,510
His knife skills are not bad,

56
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,990
albeit a little clumsy.

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,950
That should be about right.

58
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,610
Take a look.

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,670
It's quite good.

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,330
Innkeeper,

61
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,560
please help me refill the wine.

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,090
Alright.

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,070
Young hero!

64
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,670
Do you remember me?

65
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,240
The kite, remember?

66
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,190
Of course I do.

67
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,409
How have you been?

68
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,510
My dear, come here.

69
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,030
Look,

70
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,080
look who's here.

71
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,050
Isn't this the young hero?

72
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,250
Young hero,

73
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,890
my surname is Meng.

74
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm a few years older than you.

75
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,350
From now on,

76
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,700
let's not be so formal.

77
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,510
You can call me Brother Meng.

78
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Then I'll respectfully comply.

79
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,870
Brother Meng.

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,170
Sister-in-law.

81
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,830
See?

82
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,390
The young hero is indeed a straightforward person.

83
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,190
Brother Meng.

84
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,300
Don't call me

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,190
"young hero" anymore.

86
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,030
My surname is Huo.

87
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,960
Just call me Huo.

88
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,270
Huo.

89
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,390
Huo.

90
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,590
Alright.

91
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,990
Okay.

92
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,030
Look,

93
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,190
we're already

94
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,580
addressing each other as brothers.

95
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,270
So today,

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,910
you must stay for a drink.

97
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,230
Brother Meng,

98
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm really in a hurry to get going.

99
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,070
After I fill up my wine,

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,930
I have to leave.

101
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,190
Look, it's already getting dark.

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,590
The road is dangerous at night.

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,310
A small delay wouldn't hurt,

104
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,310
would it?

105
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,270
You haven't tried

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,800
my wife's cooking yet, have you?

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,380
That's right.

108
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,750
You absolutely can't leave.

109
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,350
That's right.

110
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,080
You can't go.

111
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,230
Then I'll be imposing on you.

112
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,670
This Seven

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,190
not only stole our Moon Sect's sacred object

114
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,860
but also left the ancient tomb in this state.

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,260
Chief, please calm down.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,350
Oh, right.

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,510
I asked you to find

118
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,909
records about the Mo Family Village.

119
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,170
Did you find anything?

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,950
I did find something,

121
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,000
but...

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,730
Chief, please take a look.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,040
How could this have happened?

124
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,170
The bamboo scroll fell into

125
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,110
the pool next to the Seven-Leaf Fungus

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,110
and was corroded.

127
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,390
How am I supposed to

128
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,590
explain this to Ziye?

129
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,830
If I may be so bold,

130
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,590
may I know why you're

131
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,810
suddenly investigating the Mo Family Village incident?

132
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,280
When the Mo Family Village was massacred,

133
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,360
our sect's unique arsenopyrite was found there.

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,010
Our sect didn't participate in the massacre,

135
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,940
so why did the poison appear there?

136
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,330
The arsenopyrite was always kept in

137
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,310
the medicine room of the Moon Palace.

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,950
One year, the medicine room was robbed,

139
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,080
and only the arsenopyrite was stolen.

140
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,230
Which year was that?

141
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,690
The fourth year of Huijia.

142
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,070
Did we find the culprit

143
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,909
behind it?

144
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,350
The disciple guarding the medicine room that day

145
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,790
had a confrontation with the thief.

146
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,980
Where is that person now?

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,710
Find her.

148
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,830
Yes.

149
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,630
Why did you abandon me?

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,350
Why did you abandon me?

151
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,000
Such agile movements.

152
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,360
As expected from someone who came out of the Asura Field.

153
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,909
Miao Shui,

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,059
what's the matter?

155
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,030
Nothing.

156
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,470
Can't I come see you without a reason?

157
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,670
Eye,

158
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,190
has anyone ever told you

159
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,330
that your eyes are beautiful?

160
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,080
Are you afraid of me?

161
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,350
I'm not going to eat you.

162
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,630
What are you afraid of?

163
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,430
If there's nothing else,

164
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,750
please leave.

165
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,080
You're no fun.

166
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,530
I'm done messing with you.

167
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,150
The Doctrine Leader sent me.

168
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,390
The Doctrine Leader has ordered

169
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,920
for you to redeem yourself.

170
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,880
If you fail this important task again,

171
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,560
you know the consequences.

172
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,760
[Jiuyao Villa]

173
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,020
[Qiushui]

174
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,670
Mo, be good.

175
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,810
Mo, listen to your mother.

176
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,390
Drink it.

177
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,610
Drink your medicine.

178
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,430
Mo.

179
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,590
Won't the pain go away if you take the medicine?

180
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,250
Mo, be good.

181
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,590
Come on.

182
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,910
The medicine is bitter.

183
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,560
Come on, take a sip, Mo.

184
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,670
Mo, be good.

185
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,990

186
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,200
Mr. Seven.

Do you remember me?

190
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,270
Come here.

191
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,270
Let me carry you in my arms.

192
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,040
You've really grown up now.

193
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,270

195
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,190

196
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,710
Very good.

197
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,930
The last time I saw you,

198
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,250
you could only babble.

199
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,470
Now you can speak.

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,590
This is his first time seeing you

201
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,650
since he started to remember things.

202
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,720
That's true.

203
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,550
From now on,

204
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,620
I'll come to see Mo more often.

205
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,370
How does that sound?

206
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,800
Great.

207
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,700

What's this?

210
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
A few days ago, Mo

211
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,110
was playing in the courtyard

212
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,110
and caught a cold.

213
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,750
He usually loves drinking the medicine

214
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,110
prescribed by Chief Xue.

215
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,770
But he dislikes the medicine

216
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,630
prescribed by the doctor here...

217

218
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,130
Come on.

219
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,550
Please be good.

220
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,550
Just take one sip.

221
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
One sip will do.

222
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,340
I won't drink it. It's bitter.

223
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,870
Mo.

224
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,950
Be good, come on.

225
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,750
How can you get better if you don't take the medicine?

226
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,410
It's sweet.

227
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,510
Come on, Mo.

228
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,130
I won't drink it. It's bitter.

230

Look at this.

232

Do you like it?

233
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,910
I like it.

234
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,650
You like it?

235
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,110
How about this?

236
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,400
If you listen to your mother

237
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,550
and drink your medicine now,

238
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,750
after you get better,

239
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,710
I'll teach you swordsmanship.

240
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,840
How does that sound?

241
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:28,990
Okay.

242
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,590
Okay?

243
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,390
Then, come on.

244
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,990

Slowly now.

-Good job, Mo.
-It'll be done soon.

Come on, take another sip.

Well done, Mo.

251
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,950
Senior, you've just arrived.

252
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,670
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

253
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,190
Indeed.

254
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,680
I still need to hurry to Yangzhou to get medicine.

255
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,540
Mo has just caught a slight cold recently.

256
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,070
Senior, you needn't worry.

257
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,280
The sooner I gather all 5 herbs,

258
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,820
the sooner Mo can recover.

259
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,890
Every time I see Mo suffering,

260
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,670
I wish I could take his place

261
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,670
and bear the pain of illness for him.

262
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,710
But as his mother,

263
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,110
there's nothing I can do.

264

What Mo needs most right now

267
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,030
is your care.

268
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,800

As such, your daughter

289

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,030
Indenture contract.

384
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,790
Young master,

385
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,849
you've seen it too.

386
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,430
-Alright.
-I’m just the owner of...

387
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,630
We won't make things difficult for you.

388
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,500
Keep the money.

389
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,550
As long as we can save

390
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,310
all these ladies from their misery,

391
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,590
it's worth any amount of money.

392
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,320
You all should go home quickly.

393
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,050
Young master,

394
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,120
this won't do!

395
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,430
If you let them go,

396
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,870
how will my Linglong Flower Realm

397
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,000
continue to do business in the future?

398
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,760
Madam,

399
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,690
let these ladies go.

400
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,630
Those who still have a way out

401
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,510
[Courtesan of Linglong Flower Realm: Liu Feifei]

402
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,830
shouldn't be here at Linglong Flower Realm.

403
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,890
Don't force them against their will.

404
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,680
Could you be Liu Feifei, the top courtesan of Linglong Flower Realm?

405
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,030
Since Miss Liu has spoken,

406
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,950
let's do as she says.

407
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,350
Ladies,

408
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,810
you can all go home now.

409
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,780
Ladies,

410
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,950
you may go now.

411
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,190
Wait.

412
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,920
Great.

413
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,470
Which one of you is Ting'er?

414
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,510
I... I am Ting'er.

415
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,150
Hero,

416
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,750
thank you for your great kindness.

417
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,050
Hero...

418
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,620
Father.

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,530
Hero,

420
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,510
thank you for your immense kindness.

421
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,200
Our entire family

422
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,510
will remember you for eight generations...

423
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:40,790
No,

424
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,620
even in our ancestral graves,

425
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,030
we will never forget you.

426
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,510
Hero.

427
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,030
Old sir,

428
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,010
you're exaggerating.

429
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,590
If we're talking about this,

430
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,330
we should thank these two heroes.

431
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,320
Just thank them.

432
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,580
Thank you,

433
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,870
th-thank you, three heroes.

434
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,030
But my daughter and I

435
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,520
truly have no way to repay you.

436
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,180
It's all because of my illness

437
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,610
that drained our family's savings.

438
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,010
Otherwise, I...

439
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,610
Or maybe...

440
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,170
Hero, do you think my daughter is...

441
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,010
pleasing to the eye?

442
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,730
-Please don't.
-Father.

443
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,510
Old sir,

444
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,650
you absolutely must not

445
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,510
entrust your daughter

446
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,630
to just anyone.

447
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Well...

448
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,750
The two of you

449
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,570
should find a place to stay here.

450
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,230
After things settle down,

451
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,150
find some work.

452
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,430
Things will get better from there.

453
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,230
Alright,

454
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,000
thank you.

455
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,350
Thank you.

456
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,510
We'll be going then.

457
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,040
Let's go.

458
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's go.

459
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,470
Wait a moment.

460
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,470
Help a bro out.

461
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,270
Hurry.

462
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,900
Fourth Brother.

463
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,900
Old sir,

464
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,110
take this.

465
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,320
This... This...

466
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,790
For... For me?

467
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,550
Here's some more.

468
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,940
Thank you, heroes.

469
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,130
Thank you, heroes.

470
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,210
Let's go, let's go.

471
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,120
Fourth Brother.

472
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,160
Fourth Brother!

473
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,110
Don't walk so fast!

474
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,180
Seventh Brother,

475
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,150
it's been a long time since we've seen each other.

476
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,280
Let's get together.

477
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,110
Of course, let's go.

478
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,760
Alright.

479
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,430
[Hesheng Teahouse]

480
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,790
Fourth Brother.

481
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,720
Eighth Brother.

482
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,360
Today was truly exhilarating.

483
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,510
It's been about two years

484
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,750
since the three of us last met.

485
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,150
Come,

486
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,410
let's have a drink.

487
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,090
I won't drink with you.

488
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,950
Last time, because of you,

489
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,240
I missed the chance to meet Miss Liu Feifei

490
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,350
at the right moment.

491
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,750
This time, because of you again,

492
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,710
I couldn't see her beautiful face

493
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,870
even when she was right before us.

494
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,870
What rotten luck.

495
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,240
Eighth Brother.

496
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,670
I'm on official duty

497
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,670
and can't drink alcohol.

498
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,470
I'll have tea.

499
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,160
Alright,

500
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,450
then I'll drink alone.

501
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,430
By the way,

502
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,350
Seventh Brother,

503
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,950
why are you here in Yangzhou?

504
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,170
Is it for the Azure Phoenix Flower?

505
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
That's right.

506
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,270
This matter is fraught with difficulties.

507
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,630
As one of the seven disciples of the Sword Sect,

508
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,430
I've naturally come

509
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,430
to lend you a hand.

510
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,310
With your help,

511
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,660
we'll surely be able to stop Qin Tiancheng

512
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,520
from defecting to Yuan Yi Palace.

513
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,630
Qin Tiancheng of the Seven Disciples of White Cloud Palace

514
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,360
is defecting to Yuan Yi Palace?

515
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,050
That is truly despicable.

516
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,390
Indeed.

517
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,950
Not only did Qin Tiancheng defect,

518
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,430
but he also took the sacred object of White Cloud Palace,

519
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,680
the Azure Phoenix Flower,

520
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,540
to use it as a token of allegiance.

521
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,390
Yuan Yi Palace has been in retreat in Kunlun for years,

522
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,280
and we've rarely heard news of them.

523
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,000
Why have they suddenly appeared in the Central Plains?

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,190
It must be that Chang Wujue's evil ambitions haven't died.

525
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,250
The chief suspects

526
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,470
that Chang Wujue has been practicing

527
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,970
the Iron Horse Glacier technique for years,

528
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,510
but has been unable to break through.

529
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,630
This Azure Phoenix Flower

530
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,910
is likely to be of great benefit

531
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,340
to the mental technique he's cultivating.

532
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,510
If the Azure Phoenix Flower really falls

533
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,110
into the hands of Yuan Yi Palace,

534
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,230
the martial arts world of the Central Plains

535
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,230
will likely never know peace again.

536
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,540
As the leader of the righteous sects, the Sword Sect

537
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,990
should naturally assist White Cloud Palace

538
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,650
in preventing this martial world catastrophe.

539
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,040
Eighth Brother,

540
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,710
My intel is not up to date.

541
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,070
Do you know where and when

542
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
Qin Tiancheng and the people from Yuan Yi Palace

543
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,670
have agreed to meet?

544
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,830
The chief did indeed provide information.

545
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,090
Fourth Brother.

546
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,590
Seventh Brother,

547
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,630
the chief said

548
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,590
this is a secret message

549
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,510
that Qin Tiancheng sent to Yuan Yi Palace

550
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,170
to arrange the meeting place.

551
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,250
But this is just an ordinary poem.

552
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,500
Neither Fourth Brother nor I could see

553
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,630
the hidden message.

554
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,430
A poem?

555
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,710
On a cold night, the guest is served with tea instead of wine.

556
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,830
The bamboo stove boils, the fire just turning red.

557
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,960
The moon before the window is as usual.

558
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,690
But with plum blossoms, it's different indeed.

559
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,550
In the poem, tea was served in place of wine,

560
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
indicating that besides tea,

561
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,120
there should also be wine.

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,910
The phrase 'just turning red' is ambiguous,

563
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,640
the 'moon' actually refers to romance,

564
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,670
and the 'flower' actually means courtesan.

565
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,030
The only place in Yangzhou where one can

566
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,750
seek romance in the middle of the night

567
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,410
is the Linglong Flower Realm.

568
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,240
But I must

569
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,520
lead Eighth Brother and the others away.

570
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,510
Qin Tiancheng is being deliberately mysterious.

571
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,170
There must be some hidden meaning in this paper.

572
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,160
The location

573
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,890
is hidden in this poem.

574
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,010
Have you already figured out

575
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,930
the secret?

576
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,710
Here.

577
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,030
Look at this.

578
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,890
This is a poem about drinking tea.

579
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,800
It mentions the moon

580
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,310
and emphasizes

581
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,890
plum blossoms.

582
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,550
The signature dish of this restaurant

583
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,110
is the Nine-Curved Red Plum.

584
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,630
This indicates that the time and place

585
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,430
is tomorrow when the moon rises,

586
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,870
here at the Hesheng Teahouse.

587
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,630
You're not just

588
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,110
making far-fetched connections, are you?

589
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,790
What Seventh Brother said matches perfectly.

590
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,790
It should be this Hesheng Teahouse.

591
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,070
I'll go back and tell

592
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
the people from White Cloud Palace.

593
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,070
Tomorrow, we'll meet up with them

594
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,950
here

595
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,710
before going to catch the person.

596
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,390
Seventh Brother,

597
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,850
are you coming with us too?

598
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,230
Then I'll

599
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,790
wait for you here tomorrow.

600
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,600
Fourth Brother,

601
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,110
you're going too, right?

602
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm not going.

603
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,200
Why?

604
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,990
This matter is either him or me,

605
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,830
me or him.

606
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,810
You choose.

607
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,520
Fourth Brother,

608
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,140
Yuan Yi Palace's threat

609
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,200
is no small matter.

610
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,910
As disciples of the Sword Sect, it's our duty to eliminate evil and uphold righteousness.

611
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,230
We have no choice but to act.

612
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,030
This is not the time for us brothers to fight among ourselves.

613
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,830
Fight among ourselves, you say?

614
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,430
Who started this internal dispute?

615
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,680
The Sword Sect clearly had eight disciples.

616
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,990
How did it become seven disciples?

617
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,150
Xu Chonghua injured many

618
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,190
elders of the Sword Sect.

619
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,050
Since that day,

620
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,460
he was no longer one of the eight disciples.

621
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,750
I know Sixth Brother betrayed us.

622
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,390
But the chief only ordered

623
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,390
to bring him back.

624
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,070
He didn't say to kill him.

625
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,870
You didn't care about the friendship

626
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,800
between us eight disciples at all.

627
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,550
He used to care for you the most.

628
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,210
You were even sworn brothers.

629
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,930
You could have crippled his martial arts

630
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,260
or cut off one of his arms

631
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,770
and still spared his life.

632
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,110
Why did you have to go to such extremes?

633
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,580
Xu Chonghua betrayed the sect

634
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,740
and severely wounded his masters.

635
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,800
He deserved to die.

636
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
Seventh Brother did nothing wrong.

637
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,840
But in this world, there's not just the law,

638
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,100
there's also emotion.

639
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,390
Alright, stop arguing.

640
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:07,960
Shut up.

641
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,510
I...

642
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,720
Those who follow different paths cannot work together.

643
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,570
Eighth Brother...

644
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm leaving.

647
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
please settle the bill before leaving.

648
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,050
Didn't those two pay the bill yet?

649
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:40,620
Not yet.

650
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,970
I'm not trying to leave.

651
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,230
I'm just going to find someone.

652
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,290
I'll be right back.

653
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,140
Sir.

654
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,590
I've seen many people like you.

655
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,070
If you don't have money, just say so.

656
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,350
Trying to run away without paying

657
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,950
is absolutely not possible.

658
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,390
I'm not trying to skip out on the bill.

659
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,780
I...

660
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,430
Innkeeper,

661
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,910
put Mr. Huo's bill

662
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,760
on my tabs.

663
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,910
You must be

664
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,090
the famous courtesan,

665
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,810
Liu Feifei.

666
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,350
Nice to meet you, Mr. Seven.

667
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,600
You know who I am?

668
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,190
You may have forgotten,

669
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,350
but Mr. Xia had already revealed himself

670
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,440
as the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect.

671
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,630
And that Eighth Brother called you Seventh Brother.

672
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,640
If I didn't have even this much discernment,

673
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,950
then I as a courtesan

674
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,700
would be unworthy of my title.

675
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,150
I see.

676
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,950
Today at the Linglong Flower Realm,

677
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,010
I saw you from afar.

678
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,830
I didn't expect to run into you here again.

679
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,830
What a coincidence.

680
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,160
It's not a coincidence.

681
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,550
I came here

682
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,080
specifically for you, sir.

683
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,750
For me?

684
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,830
Although I am a courtesan,

685
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,070
I still understand right from wrong.

686
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,390
I despise forcing innocent girls into prostitution the most.

687
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,270
To be honest,

688
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,110
before you gentlemen arrived,

689
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,270
I also wanted to rescue

690
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,000
those girls.

691
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,640
But being in this world of courtesans,

692
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,150
I truly had the will but not the means.

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,760
Please consider

694
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,290
that meal's payment as my token of gratitude.

695
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,830
Helping those in need and acting righteously

696
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,690
is the duty of us martial artists.

697
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,920
We shouldn't ask for any reward.

698
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,590
However,

699
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,110
I am indeed short on funds.

700
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,810
So I'll respectfully accept your offer.

701
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,190
Thank you for your generous assistance.

702
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,790
Mr. Seven, there's no need for such formality.

703
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,410
Then I'll take my leave now.

704
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,360
We'll meet again if fate allows.

705
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,010
Until we meet again.

00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,090
Get lost!

760
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,030
Scram!

761
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,430
What are you here for?

762
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,400
Look at the place you've chosen.

763
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,870
You chose a brothel

764
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,830
to defect to our great Yuan Yi Palace?

765
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,560
I never drink with courtesans.

766
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,270
Now I'm covered

767
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,070
in the scent of rouge and powder.

768
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,720
There's a market in front

769
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,880
and a river behind.

770
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,410
If something goes wrong,

771
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,920
we can either hide in the chaos

772
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,860
or escape by boat.

773
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,110
Alright, alright, let's get on with it.

774
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,570
Tell me,

775
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,170
how did the White Cloud Palace mistreat you?

776
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,580
At the White Cloud Palace,

777
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,750
I am just one of the Seven Stars of

778
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,550
the Seven Star Sword Formation.

779
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,550
But at Yuan Yi Palace,

780
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,860
I want to be the sole master of the Asura Field.

781
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,710
You?

782
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,240
The sole master of the Asura Field?

783
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,760
Are you out of your mind?

784
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,890
Aren't you afraid the White Cloud Palace's people

785
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,890
will catch you

786
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,090
and flay you alive?

787
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,590
The White Cloud Palace relies on the Seven Stars Formation

788
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,250
to stand in the martial world.

789
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,530
I am the most crucial star

790
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,190
in the Seven Stars Formation.

791
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,470
Even if they knew,

792
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,470
they wouldn't dare touch me.

793
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,060
Before I defected,

794
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,190
I had already destroyed

795
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,430
all the scrolls about the Seven Stars Formation.

796
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,230
Once I'm gone,

797
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,750
the Seven Stars Formation will no longer exist in this world.

798
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,750
The martial world

799
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,950
will also be without the White Cloud Palace.

800
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,910
You beast!

801
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,830
Defecting to our Yuan Yi Palace is the right choice.

802
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,390
So, uh,

803
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,080
did you bring the Azure Phoenix Flower?

804
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,470
So this is the Azure Phoenix Flower.

805
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,410
I, Qin Tiancheng, wish to present this flower

806
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,740
to the Doctrine Leader.

807
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,400
May the Doctrine Leader

808
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,890
achieve divine power,

809
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,110
cleanse the Central Plains with blood,

810
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,910
and unifying the martial world.

811
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,790
Seven, you've come to persuade me too?

812
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,050
So you're Huo Zhanbai.

813
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,389
That's right.

814
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,429
I am your grandfather.

815
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,150
Impossible.

816
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,750
My grandfather died long ago.

817
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,679
Then I misspoke.

818
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,989
Actually, I am...

819
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,350
Your father.

820
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,120
That's even more impossible!

821
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,980
My father is even uglier than I am!

822
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,389
Enough nonsense.

823
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,690
Qin Tiancheng.

824
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,050
If Chang Wujue masters the divine skill,

825
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,030
the martial world of the Central Plains

826
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,350
will inevitably suffer countless deaths and injuries.

827
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,949
Blood will flow like rivers.

828
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,889
This Azure Phoenix Flower

829
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,250
absolutely cannot fall into their hands.

830
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,790
You can still turn back now.

831
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,060
Huo,

832
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,989
if you want to leave now,

833
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,639
it's already too late.

834
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,520
Catch me first, then we'll talk.

835
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,110
I'm going to beat you to death today!

836
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,470
Young master, are you waiting for someone?

837
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,350
That's right.

838
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,430
May I ask if you're called

839
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,420
Zhou Xingzhi?

840
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,400
Indeed, I am.

841
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,620
Someone entrusted me

842
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,170
to give this to you.

843
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,110
This is Seventh Brother's handwriting.

844
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,040
Eighth Brother,

845
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,510
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

846
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,750
The real transaction location

847
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,590
is at the Linglong Flower Realm in the east of the city.

848
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,050
I have already gone ahead.

849
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,990
I have great use for the Azure Phoenix Flower.

850
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,050
After the matter is settled,

851
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,420
I will personally go to the Chief

852
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,990
and Chief Lin to ask for forgiveness.

853
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,590
Seven.

854
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,530
What's the matter?

855
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,390
Seventh Brother's information was incorrect.

856
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,030
The transaction location is not here.

857
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,630
It's at the Linglong Flower Realm.

858
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,960
Linglong Flower Realm?

859
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,750
That's absurd.

860
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,750
It's completely in the opposite direction.

861
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,630
By the time we get there,

862
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,710
they'll have long escaped.

863
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,240
Let's go!

864
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,500
Eighth Brother.

865
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,720
Fourth Brother.

866
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,600
What happened?

867
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,230
The location has changed. I'll explain on the way.

868
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,760
Let's go.

869
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,030
[Linglong Flower Realm]

870
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,040
Please come in, honored guest.

871
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,190
Alright, alright.

872
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,270
Alright, alright!

873
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,590
Mr. Huo.

874
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
Can you still run?

875
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,710
I've even stopped to wait for you.

876
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,840
I can't run anymore.

877
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,470
But I still have the strength

878
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,600
to beat you to death!

879
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,660
Your martial arts are inadequate,

880
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,880
but your boasting skills are exceptional.

881
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,830
Are all the people from Yuan Yi Palace

882
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,750
like this?

883
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm different from those useless people.

884
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,950
Do you need to bring so many useless people

885
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,280
to deal with a mere seventh disciple

886
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,070
of the Sword Sect?

887
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,310
If even you

888
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,240
lose to me later,

889
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,910
then your Yuan Yi Palace

890
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,570
would lose face, wouldn't it?

891
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,730
How about this?

892
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,150
Call me your dad

893
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,910
and I'll spare your life.

894
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,750
Screw that! I already have a dad!

895
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,520
Die!

896
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,440
Seven?

897
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,840
You're back.

898
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,670
I'm grateful for your guidance, Seven.

899
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,460
I've thought it through.

900
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,200
I...

901
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,110
I'm already ugly enough,

902
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,870
and you still punched my face.

903
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,630
That's right, I'm pinching your cheek.

904
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,070
-Again?
-What’s wrong?

905
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,730
Let go of me!

906
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Hit me if you dare.

907
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,050
I'll punch you once you let go!

908
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,440
Alright.

909
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm done playing with you today.

910
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
When you see me, your dad, again,

911
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,110
remember to kowtow to admit your guilt.

912
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,710
Bullshit.

913
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,690
My dad would never strike my pressure points.

914
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,670
Come back!

915
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,210
Don't you dare leave!

916
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,150
I'll beat you to death one day!

917
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,780
Get out of the way!

918
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,010
Tiancheng!

919
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,200
Tiancheng.

920
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,890
Tiancheng?

921
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,890
Tiancheng!

922
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,230
How could this happen?

923
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,890
Tiancheng.

924
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,470
Wake up.

925
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:06,910
Tell me,

926
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,760
who did this?

927
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,280
Huo Zhanbai...

928
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,870
He stole the Azure Phoenix Flower.

929
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,640
He wanted to kill... kill me.

930
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,470
Just now...

931
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,160
Just now...

932
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,500
Tiancheng?

933
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,690
Tiancheng!

934
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,230
Tiancheng!

935
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,910
Tiancheng!

936
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,360
I will avenge you.

937
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,310
Find Huo Zhanbai.

938
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,140
I want him to pay with his life.

939
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,830
It can't be Seventh Brother.

940
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,470
Chief Lin.

941
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,550
This matter is suspicious and needs further investigation.

942
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,880
Before Tiancheng died,

943
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,060
he personally identified the killer.

944
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,260
How could it be false?

945
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,070
Moreover,

946
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,360
why were we late?

947
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,890
It was because of your dear Seventh Brother.

948
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,500
He deliberately led us to the west of the city

949
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,830
so he could take action.

950
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,710
Just now at the teahouse,

951
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,410
the tea shop owner left you a letter.

952
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,750
After you read it,

953
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,070
you realized the location was wrong.

954
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,400
Who left you the letter?

955
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,040
What did the letter say?

956
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,450
It's just an ordinary letter.

957
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,830
Chief Lin, you're overthinking it.

958
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,950
At this moment,

959
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,340
I can't help but be cautious.

960
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,050
Give me the letter.

961
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,990
Chief Lin,

962
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,570
is there some misunderstanding?

963
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,780
What letter?

964
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,330
Give me the letter!

965
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,750
Look carefully.

966
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,820
It's written in black and white.

967
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,550
Huo Zhanbai wanted to steal the Azure Phoenix Flower.

968
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,270
And the Azure Phoenix Flower

969
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,800
was on Tiancheng's person.

970
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,110
Now the flower is gone, and the person is dead.

971
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,470
How can you defend him?

972
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,210
He failed to steal the flower,

973
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,650
so he killed him for it.

974
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,880
He stole the treasures of the White Cloud Palace,

975
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,350
killed a member of the White Cloud Palace,

976
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,230
and destroyed our Seven Star Sword Formation.

977
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,030
That Huo Zhanbai has some nerve!

978
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,600
Everyone in our White Cloud Palace

979
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,670
will not let this go.

980
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,360
Find Huo Zhanbai

981
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,950
and make him pay with his life!

982
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,550
Yes.

983
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,150
Fourth Brother...
