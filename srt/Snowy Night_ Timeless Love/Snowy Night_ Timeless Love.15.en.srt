[Episode 15]

4
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,390
I can use acupuncture to forcibly

5
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,449
restore your sight

6
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,070
and temporarily

7
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,830
suppress the blood stasis in your head.

8
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,150
But after you recover,

9
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
if you fight again

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,790
during your herb search

11
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,830
and receive a concussion,

12
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,670
the blood stasis in your head can move at any time.

13
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,630
If you're lucky, you'll be blind forever.

14
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,870
If not, you will die.

15
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,670
You said it would take three months.

16
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,110
I'm sure there's a reason why

17
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,640
it would take three months.

18
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,550
So, why explain it to me?

19
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,350
It's because you keep asking

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,550
when you'll recover,

21
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,829
when you'll get better,

22
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,430
and when you can start

23
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,030
searching for the next herb.

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,950
I didn’t ask today, did I?

25
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,440
There’s only one ingredient left,

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,240
the Crimson Cold Dragon Blood Pearl.

27
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,290
This medicine has long disappeared

28
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,620
from the martial world.

29
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,720
Even if I leave now to search for it,

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,180
I’m afraid I won’t find it.

31
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,750
I might as well

32
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,030
take these three months

33
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,160
to rest and recover.

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,980
Meanwhile, I can send people out to inquire about it.

35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,070
But since I can't see for the

36
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,130
next three months,

37
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,550
moving around will be difficult for me.

38
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,950
Might as well behave

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,950
and stay indoors.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,470
If you walk around as you like,

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,400
you'll annoy me.

42
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,270
By the way, Chief Xue.

43
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,910
Is my luggage still here?

44
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,090
I haven’t brought it to your room yet.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,170
Could you bring it to me?

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,110
Is this what you’re looking for?

47
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,870
Yes.

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,520
I was on my way

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,950
to Qingling Snow Mountain

50
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,210
when I saw this purple-gold hand warmer.

51
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,610
It’s a gift for you.

52
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,980
For me?

53
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,230
Who else?

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
I don’t need it.

55
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,050
You have money to buy this

56
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,650
but no money to pay your debt?

57
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,150
I can afford

58
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,470
small things like this.

59
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,710
As for that huge debt…

60
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,630
Many a little makes a mickle.

61
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,950
If you don’t pay it back bit by bit,

62
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,150
when will you be able to clear your debt?

63
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,670
If you don't like it,

64
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,170
you can return it to me.

65
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,120
Once a gift is given,

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,380
you can't take it back.

67
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,830
Even though I have many hand warmers,

68
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,430
I don’t mind having another.

69
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,430
You woman...

70
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,210
The last ingredient left...

71
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,110
Ziye.

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,900
Are you still searching

73
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,490
for a cure for Mo?

74
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,550
Perhaps there was an oversight before.

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,280
You’ve memorized the books

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,909
in the library by heart.

77
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,670
If there were an oversight,

78
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,000
you would have noticed.

79
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,480
Then again,

80
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,390
if Mo's illness can be treated,

81
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,910
Mr. Huo's injuries

82
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,300
could have recovered faster.

83
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,230
Nothing escapes

84
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,830
your eyes, Granny.

85
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,710
You’re worried that gathering the medicine will be too difficult for him,

86
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,310
and you don’t want him to risk his life too soon.

87
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,910
So you’ve chosen a slower treatment

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,500
to keep him here longer.

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,080
I was the one who prescribed the treatment,

90
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,530
and I’m the one putting him in danger.

91
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,909
You prescribed that medicine to save Mo.

92
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,820
It also saved Mrs. Qiushui

93
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,909
and Mr. Huo.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,930
All these years,

95
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,630
I’ve witnessed it all.

96
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,480
That prescription

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,270
is the hope that’s sustained

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,030
the three of them to this day.

99
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,870
Saving someone

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,130
and then watching helplessly

101
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,790
as he risks his life again...

102
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,410
What sense does that make?

103
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,010
But no matter how slow the treatment,

104
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,400
there will come a day when he's healed.

105
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,270
Every extra day

106
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,920
of safety is worth it.

107
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,250
♫As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighs♫

108
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,130
♫You nestle close, your whisper slow and tender♫

109
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:34,390
♫In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untold♫

110
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,320
♫The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryear♫

111
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,660
♫Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long night♫

112
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,630
♫In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fate♫

113
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,030
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

114
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,940
♫Not to make my mark, just to make it all worth it♫

115
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,660
♫Traveling through hustle, you became my hope♫

116
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,680
♫Try to hide tears; how can I ever forget you?♫

117
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,380
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

118
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,670
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

119
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,940
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

120
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:35,030
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

121
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,830
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,570
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,840
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,620
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

125
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,710
You walk quite fast.

126
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,070
I have to thank you

127
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,300
for guiding the way with these elm-wood bells.

128
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,440
Otherwise, I would’ve been bored to death

129
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,370
in my room by now.

130
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,610
Those are just things

131
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,910
the girls hang up to play with.

132
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,640
They have nothing to do with me.

133
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,090
Let me do it.

134
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,780
You agreed so readily.

135
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Are you having me work off my debt again?

136
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm brewing this

137
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,950
medicinal wine for you anyway.

138
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,310
Naturally, you should contribute too.

139
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,240
Medicinal wine?

140
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,710
But I’m afraid this medicinal wine

141
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,690
isn’t as sweet as Laughing at the World.

142
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,020
Now you're being picky?

143
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,560
This medicinal wine is as good as Laughing at the World.

144
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,230
There’s a jar of finished brew here,

145
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,270
you can try it.

146
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,840
Sure.

147
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,680
What is this?

148
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,510
Wash water from the vat.

149
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,770
Pure and authentic, the sweetest of all.

150
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,330
Although your eyes cannot see,

151
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,990
it seems your sense of taste is fine.

152
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,670
Chief.

153
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,430
For brewing Mr. Huo's medicinal wine,

154
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,300
should we use snow from the plum trees,

155
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,470
or snow from the pines?

156
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,870
Snow from the plum trees.

157
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,920
Alright, Chief.

158
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,510
Why use snow from the plum trees?

159
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,430
Plum blossoms bloom in the cold.

160
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,710
The winter buds open in spring.

161
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,310
They receive the most primordial energy.

162
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,900
Buds that haven't bloomed are the strongest.

163
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,270
Their nature is cold, their taste sour, astringent, and bitter.

164
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,190
They help lift the clear yang energy.

165
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,750
Snow water contains the essence of the Taiyin.

166
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,910
Water is very much like earth.

167
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,510
Its quality is clear and pure.

168
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,510
Using plum tree snow to brew medicinal wine

169
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,440
will help with your eye condition.

170
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,720
Wouldn’t that mean making all the ladies

171
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,070
go through the trouble for me?

172
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,140
You just realized?

173
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,040
That has been the case every time you're hurt.

174
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,790
I do have a method

175
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,430
that can collect snow faster,

176
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,630
without climbing high or taking risks.

177
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,840
How about trying it?

178
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,750
Ladies,

179
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,070
are all the containers ready?

180
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,110
Ready.

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
What exactly is your method?

182
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,410
May I trouble you to come help?

183
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
How should I help?

♫We exchange glances, like medicine simmering slowly over time♫

[Yuan Yi Palace]

197
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,510
The Chief of Xiaoyao Villa is dead.

198
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,740
This is his head and sword.

199
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,910
Good.

200
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,950
Very good.

201
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,950
Tell me.

202
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,260
What kind of reward do you want?

203
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,350
I want the Asura Field.

204
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,600
That is...

205
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,550
The Asura Field is my place

206
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,350
for cultivating top assassins.

207
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,840
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you

208
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,240
for asking for the Asura Field?

209
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,350
You asked what I wanted,

210
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,480
so I answered.

211
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,790
Do you

212
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,350
want me to lie?

213
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,030
You want my Asura Field?

214
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,430
Fine.

215
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,670
I like young people

216
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,190
with ambition.

217
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,510
Since you want it,

218
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,130
I’ll give it to you.

219
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
From this day onward,

220
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,849
the Asura Field

221
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,800
is under Eye's control.

222
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,040
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

223
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,470
From today,

224
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,930
the Asura Field will be under my command.

225
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,600
What?

226
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,350
Who do you think you are?

227
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,910
Yeah, who do you think you are?

228
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,350
We only listen to the Doctrine Leader.

229
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,060
Yeah, yeah!

230
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,900
We only listen to the Doctrine Leader.

231
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,230
It doesn’t matter who you are.

232
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,560
Only the strong are honored here.

233
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,550
There’s no place for you here!

234
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,510
No place for you!

235
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,730
What...

236
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,230
What’s going on with him?

237
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,690
What...

238
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,130
What's happening?

239
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,970
Does anyone else

240
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,170
have any objections?

241
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,920
Getting into the Asura Field

242
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,430
already proves

243
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,630
your ability.

244
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,830
But that doesn’t mean

245
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,430
you’ll always survive here.

246
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,150
From today onward,

247
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,910
Asura Field will not house useless goons.

248
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,150
Understood?

249
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,510
Understood!

250
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,960
The sound of the silver bell

251
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,730
is so familiar.

252
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,370
How rare.

253
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,780
You were sleeping so peacefully.

254
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,230
It seems you had

255
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,650
a sweet dream last night.

256
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,430
What dream?

257
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,940
Tell me.

258
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,390
It has nothing to do with you.

259
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,070
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

260
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,430
But I still

261
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,790
need to tell you this:

262
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,990
When an assassin

263
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,280
sleeps too soundly,

264
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
they're not far

265
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,910
from death.

266
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,230
Being the master of the Asura Field

267
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,990
is no easy task,

268
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,230
Eye.

269
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,480
But don't worry,

270
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,850
I won’t tell the Doctrine Leader,

271
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,990
at least

272
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,430
not this time.

273
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,480
Let's go.

274
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,080
The Doctrine Leader has summoned us.

275
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,710
We’ve been casting the line for so long,

276
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,860
it’s time to reel in the big fish.

277
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,810
It’s strange, though—

278
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,370
there’s clearly a faster way

279
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,070
to cure Mr. Seven’s eye condition.

280
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,030
Why not use it?

281
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,510
I went to the library

282
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,710
and looked through medical books and case records for a long time,

283
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,350
but I couldn’t understand them.

284
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,220
The Chief must have

285
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,270
her reasons for doing this.

286
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,000
Let’s not make random guesses.

287
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,630
When I first returned to the valley,

288
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,470
she kept persuading me

289
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,190
not to continue searching for the herb,

290
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,230
and now she's deliberately using slow treatment

291
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,560
to keep me in the valley.

292
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,510
Why is she doing this?

293
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,190
Chief Xue.

294
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,670
Is that you?

295
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,550
How did you end up here?

296
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,430
Well,

297
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,790
didn't I send word to ask someone

298
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,310
to find the whereabouts of the Dragon Blood Pearl?

299
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,590
Now there’s some news.

300
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,150
Could you please

301
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,350
heal my eyes quickly

302
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,110
so I can depart soon?

303
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,880
I told you.

304
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,910
This eye condition will take three months.

305
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,310
I already know the truth.

306
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,390
Chief Xue,

307
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,190
why are you purposely dragging

308
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,920
the progress of the treatment?

309
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,550
Are you questioning my methods?

310
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,630
No.

311
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,070
I just want to know

312
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,930
why you're hiding things from me.

313
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,070
You’ve also advised me before

314
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,800
to stop searching for the herb.

315
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,990
Why is that?

316
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Are you worried about my safety,

317
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,950
or have you found another way

318
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,670
to treat Mo?

319
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,550
Or perhaps you...

320
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,330
I’m just tired

321
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,990
of treating you over and over.

322
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,280
Sorry.

323
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,290
There’s only one herb left now.

324
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,490
But that final one,

325
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,970
the Millennial Crimson Cold Dragon Blood Pearl,

326
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,370
is the hardest to find.

327
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,680
Even if you risk half your life,

328
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,870
you still might not get it.

329
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,800
As long as I have a breath left in me,

330
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,750
I will give it my all

331
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,810
to bring the Dragon Blood Pearl back.

332
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,890
I ask that Chief Xue

333
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,830
quickly heal my eyes.

334
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,910
Since you don’t value your life,

335
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,370
why should I worry for you?

336
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,590
Mr. Huo is not a fool.

337
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,620
When you first used this slow treatment,

338
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,650
you should have expected

339
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,750
he’d soon realize it.

340
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes.

341
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,390
When he asked me today,

342
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,670
I didn’t know how to answer him.

343
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,920
Answering correctly or incorrectly,

344
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,360
what’s the difference?

345
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,190
There are

346
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,800
very few people in this world

347
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,110
who could gather the previous four herbs,

348
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,410
which shows how firm

349
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,490
his resolve is.

350
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,610
The prescription to him

351
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,160
and Mrs. Qiushui

352
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,990
is like a faint light in the dark night.

353
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,120
Though the light is dim,

354
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
and the road is long,

355
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,350
as long as

356
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,940
Mo survives,

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,200
he will resolutely

358
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,310
follow that light

359
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,350
and seek the hope for Mo.

360
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,740
Yes.

361
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,430
So when he urged me to quickly heal him

362
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,090
so he could search for the final herb,

363
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,670
I wasn't really angry at him.

364
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,710
Instead, I was angry at myself.

365
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,830
You’re angry at yourself

366
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,070
because you can’t change Mo’s condition,

367
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,830
right?

368
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,400
Regarding Mo's matter,

369
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,110
you've done everything you can.

370
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,360
Don't be so hard on yourself

371
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,730
and let nature take its course.

372
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,950
♫As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighs♫

373
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,840
♫You nestle close, your whisper slow and tender♫

374
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,090
♫In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untold♫

375
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,030
♫The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryear♫

376
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,330
Open your eyes slowly.

377
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,430
Don't rush.

378
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,360
♫Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long night♫

379
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,120
♫In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fate♫

380
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,720
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

381
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,990
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

382
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,270
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

383
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,090
Thank you, Chief Xue.

384
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:05,370
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

385
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,070
Yesterday,

386
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,870
I was too reckless.

387
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,030
I’m sorry.

388
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,410
You’ve always acted recklessly,

389
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,690
I’m long used to it.

390
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,610
We've known each other for years.

391
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,650
I know you have

392
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,550
your reasons.

393
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,250
I shouldn't doubt you.

394
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,450
But it’s related to Mo.

395
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,280
So I...

396
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,810
Regardless,

397
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,340
you've already doubted me.

398
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,930
Since you've recovered,

399
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,460
there's no need to explain.

400
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Besides...

401
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,440
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

402
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,440
Then are you still...

403
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,270
mad at me?

404
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,250
Anger's bad for my health.

405
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,690
You're not worth getting angry over.

406
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,870
What are you waiting for?

407
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,910
Hurry and pack up

408
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,360
to leave the valley.

409
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,510
I've to visit a patient at Longmen Village.

410
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,570
I won't see you off.

411
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
Something's off outside,

412
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,680
Chief.

413
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,950
Why's this carriage lying in the middle of the road?

414
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,210
Where are the villagers?

415
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,030
Why's it so lifeless?

416
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,970
Careful.

417
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,740
There's poisonous smoke.

418
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,790
Open the windows

419
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,550
to detoxify everyone.

420
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,630
Protect yourselves.

421
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,290
-Yes.
-Yes.

422
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,190
Here.

423
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,150
Hurry.

424
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,160
Feng Lyu.

425
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,810
Take a look.

426
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,440
Hurry up.

427
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,350
Go!

428
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,310
Move it!

429
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,310
Go! Behave!

430
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,910
Let go of me!

431
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,310
Shut up or I'll kill you!

432
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,070
Let me go!

433
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,590
Hurry!

434
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,610
As my backup, you came so late.

435
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,270
Let go of me!

436
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,710
I wasn't late.

437
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,070
It was a long journey.

438
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,440
Doctrine Leader

439
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,730
didn't say it's so far.

440
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,310
Doctrine Leader?

441
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,550
They're from Yuan Yi Palace.

442
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,310
Go!

443
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,710
I really hate this place.

444
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,210
People are suffering,

445
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,110
yet they're smiling so happily.

446
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,630
Go!

447
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,550
How annoying.

448
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,670
Let go of me!

449
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,780
Apothecary Valley's on that mountain, right?

450
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,580
That's where the old man Qiushui

451
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
almost got killed by Eye.

452
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,590
Well, in the Mo Family Village incident,

453
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,350
that Qiushui

454
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,950
helped our leader after all.

455
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,620
You talk too much.

456
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,950
-Let go of me.
-Walk faster.

457
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,270
Go!

458
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:24,590
Go!

459
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,310
Go!

460
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,130
I'll kill you!

461
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,630
Hurry!

462
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,310
Go!

463
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,960
We can't just

464
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,790
let them go.

465
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,240
But we're outnumbered.

466
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,680
We're no match for them.

467
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,350
I'll stall them later.

468
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,550
Then, Lan Lan,

469
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,810
go back to the valley

470
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,870
and ask Huo Zhanbai for help.

471
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,230
Yes.

472
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,190
Shuang Hong, Feng Lyu,

473
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,390
you two play it by ear.

474
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,670
Once I shoot my needle,

475
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,790
you'll attack from both sides

476
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,710
from behind.

477
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,350
Xiao Cheng, Xiao Jing,

478
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,230
keep treating

479
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,390
the injured here.

480
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,950
But Chief,

481
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,750
it’s too dangerous.

482
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,390
This won't do.

483
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,120
Don't worry.

484
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,110
I have the Tenacious Needle to protect me.

485
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,310
Chief, let me go too.

486
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,000
Chief, me too.

487
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,910
Stop arguing.

488
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,060
Do as I said.

489
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,630
Go!

490
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,670
Go!

491
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,470
Let go of me!

492
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,270
Stop there.

493
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,070
Ms. Ye!

494
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,870
Come back!

495
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,790
I'll kill you if you keep running!

496
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,870
-Let go!
-Shut up!

497
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,490
Behave!

498
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,950
Didn't you say

499
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,230
the villagers were poisoned?

500
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,110
Who is this?

501
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,590
I don't think she's from the village.

502
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,230
Am I right?

503
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,270
Apothecary Valley's chief,

504
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,750
Xue Ziye.

505
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,350
It was you who saved

506
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,910
old Qiushui?

507
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,590
You know me?

508
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,910
You and a friend of mine

509
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,510
go way back.

510
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,950
You have friends?

511
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,790
Cut the crap.

512
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,060
Release the children now.

513
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,310
Chief Xue,

514
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,870
you're so humorous.

515
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
You're outnumbered.

516
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,430
Why should I let them go?

517
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,650
I advise you to

518
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,750
just go back to your valley.

519
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,630
Otherwise,

520
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,150
you might die.

521
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,870
I thought

522
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,740
Yuan Yi Palace's men

523
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,430
were capable.

524
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,070
To think

525
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,820
this is all.

526
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,670
Besides capturing

527
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,350
some helpless children,

528
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,030
you just know to threaten

529
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,390
a weak woman like me.

530
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,910
So useless.

531
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,060
Exactly.

532
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,790
Even I'm ashamed.

533
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,060
Killing's better.

534
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,530
Why don't I crush you to death?

535
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,360
You're from Yuan Yi Palace too?

536
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,950
Isn't it obvious?

537
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,840
You said

538
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,820
old Qiushui

539
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,790
helped your leader with

540
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,590
the Mo Family Village incident.

541
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,110
What did you mean?

542
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,150
I... I...

543
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:54,950
I...

544
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,270
What Mo Family Village?

545
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,350
Did you mention it?

546
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,950
No, I'm a mute.

547
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,230
Oh, I see.

548
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,190
Chief Xue, he didn’t mention it.

549
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,110
We're both women.

550
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,890
I don't want to embarrass you.

551
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,750
But if you don't step aside,

552
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,960
I'll have to teach you a lesson.

553
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,590
You think you can save yourself

554
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,030
just because you saved

555
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,870
Qiushui He?

556
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,710
Whether I can do it

557
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,750
isn't for you to decide.

558
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,030
Hide!

559
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,190
Their hidden weapons are poisonous.

560
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,850
Be careful.

561
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,630
Can she shoot through my thick body?

562
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,889
I'll crush them first!

563
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,830
I'll kill you!

564
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,790
Chief!

565
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,140

What did you say?

603

Yuan Yi Palace

609

But Qiushui He

611

with Yuan Yi Palace.

613
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,470
If they were in cahoots,

Qiushui He wouldn't

615
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,310
have admitted everything.

616
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,800
I tried to ask him,

617
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,070
but he was evasive.

618
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,350
He was clearly hiding something.

619
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,110
There must be

more than meets the eye.

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,120
I must go with you.

622
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,630
We'll find out the truth

623
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,320
and clarify things

to set him off.

639
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,220
I might be able to make him
