[Episode 27]

4
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,780
This feeling...

5
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,200
Since I've learned the Spring Breeze,

6
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,110
I've never felt it.

7
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,520
What's going on?

8
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,750
Why?

9
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,829
Why?

10
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,870
Is it just like what Miao Shui said?

11
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,850
Am I regretting it?

12
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,430
Oh no.

13
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,190
It's so cold.

14
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,980
Yueya Vale's right ahead.

15
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,790
There's a posthouse.

16
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,040
Don't worry.

17
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,600
You'll be warm soon.

18
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,240
Fourth Brother.

19
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,120
I know about Wuma's rebellion.

20
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,880
It's indeed a good time now.

21
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
But it's not wise to be hasty.

22
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,990
We must be prepared.

23
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,170
I've sent letters to the rest.

24
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,910
Before we set off,

25
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,070
Eldest Brother will organize our base

26
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,670
to pre-empt sneak attacks from Yuan Yi Palace.

27
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,400
When there are changes in Yuan Yi Palace,

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,730
that old fox Chang Wujue

29
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,280
will get more paranoid.

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,590
He'll surely summon back

31
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,120
all his disciples outside.

32
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,300
Second and Third Brothers

33
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,360
will surround them

34
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,000
outside West Kunlun

35
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,910
and do everything

36
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,170
to weaken their power.

37
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,190
Fourth Brother,

38
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,390
do you still remember

39
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,630
the inn where we saved the kids

40
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,760
of Longmen Village?

41
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,870
In my opinion,

42
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,110
it appears to be an inn,

43
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,350
but in fact,

44
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,110
it's a secret base of theirs,

45
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,430
with a lot of critical info

46
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,430
on Yuan Yi Palace.

47
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,990
Bring some men

48
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,650
to wipe out that place.

49
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,230
But those scoundrels

50
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,300
are cunning.

51
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,430
They'd have pre-emptive measures.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,630
There must be someone

53
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,510
surveilling the inn regularly.

54
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,790
So while you destroy the secret base,

55
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,590
someone has to

56
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,310
wait outside for the fish to take the bait.

57
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,870
By then,

58
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,430
subdue them all.

59
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,510
Fourth Brother.

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,840
The outside's settled.

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,510
Take them back to Sword Sect.

62
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,170
-Yes.
-Yes.

63
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,390
Junior.

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
It's time for your medicine.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,300
How was she?

66
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,720
Mo just passed away.

67
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,410
It's natural that she's emotional.

68
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,940
As a mother,

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,270
I can relate.

70
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,710
It's unlikely

71
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,700
that she'll ever get over it.

72
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,340
Senior Liao.

73
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,690
I actually have a favor to ask.

74
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,670
I came to see Mo.

75
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,750
Mo was sick for many years.

76
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,040
He had many dietary restrictions.

77
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,790
His condition also

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,090
meant he coudn't be emotional.

79
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,720
So he couldn't

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,250
play to his heart's content

81
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,310
like other kids.

82
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,190
I prepared

83
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,310
these things for Mo.

84
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,550
Mo loved sweets the most.

85
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,510
Especially these Cloud Cakes

86
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,860
and caramels.

87
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,940
He always bugged me to buy them at the market.

88
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,270
When he...

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,930
The day before that,

90
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,610
he was still bugging me for sweets.

91
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,190
I promised him.

92
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,870
I said...

93
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,390
♫How many obstacles must one overcome in life?♫

94
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,360
I told him to wait

95
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,670
until his birthday

96
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,770
next year.

97
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,430
♫Love is the hardest obstacle of all♫

98
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,670
Why did I

99
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,070
say next year?

100
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,040
♫We're like a lonely sail in the vast world♫

101
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,070
I should have bought it for him then.

102
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,230
♫Drifting always, looking for the shore♫

103
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,870
Which seven-year-old kid

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,930
plays with the rattle drum all day?

105
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,150
Mo had never

106
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,930
♫We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountains♫

107
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,770
had any close friends.

108
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,630
Every time

109
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,860
he played with other kids,

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,520
♫Why fear the coldness of fate?♫

111
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,670
I'd watch from the side.

112
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,670
♫If the night is lonely, I will be the lamp♫

113
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,910
If it got even a bit rough,

114
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,730
I'd stop him right away

115
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,390
and take him home.

116
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,390
♫And light up the rest of our lives♫

117
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,630
So he always stayed at the door

118
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,410
watching other kids

119
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,570
playing in groups.

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,530
♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

121
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,470
I know

122
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,309
he envied others from the bottom of his heart.

123
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:42,830
♫The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resolute♫

124
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,870

♫The past fades with the dimming night♫

And he...

130
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,950
never had a normal life even for a moment.

131

But what could I've done?

136
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,670
There was nothing I could do.

137

♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

138
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,540
Sometimes I asked myself...

whether it was right

140
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,870
to just

141
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,150
try to keep him alive

142
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,510
when he was suffering.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,380
But then when I thought

144
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,910
about Mo really leaving,

145
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,260
I didn't want to live either.

146
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,810
I'm a mother.

147
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,060
What I could do

148
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,430
was to

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
accompany him

150
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,950

Okay, Madam.

196

Good idea.

This should be

203
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,090
a peaceful tune.

204

But sometimes you make it

205
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,270
sound so sad.

206
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,630
It's a song

207
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,910
about homesickness.

208
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,230
Why is there

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,280
a scratch on your reed pipe?

384
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,690
But I didn't expect

385
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,480
he'd be bewitched by you

386
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,960
and want to rebel.

387
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,110
Luckily,

388
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,470
Miao Shui noticed it in time.

389
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,270
That moron was obviously

390
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,790
no match for Miao Shui.

391
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,970
You allied with the wrong person,

392
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,270
my Eye.

393
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,750
Who killed Miao Huo?

394
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,950
It was me.

395
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,870
Miao Huo betrayed our leader.

396
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,390
Shouldn't he be killed?

397
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,390
You wretch!

398
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,470
You wanted to kill him the most.

399
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,290
I'm loyal and devoted.

400
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,640
Don't slander me just because

401
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,660
you're desperate.

402
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,920
Please be discerning, Doctrine Leader.

403
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,200
I know. I know.

404
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,590
Miao Shui.

405
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,830
I know

406
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,150
you're loyal to me.

407
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,890
I also know that...

408
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,350
Eye

409
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,960
led the rebellion.

410
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,270
And you wasted no time

411
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,930
to intercept and kill a rebel.

412
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,720
The highest merit

413
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,250
goes to Ming Li and you!

414
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,270
Rise.

415
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,710
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

416
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,590
Go to hell!

417
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,080
Look, Doctrine Leader.

418
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,800
Even someone like Eye

419
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,480
can't resist the Soul Devouring Powder.

420
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,830
It really lives up to its reputation.

421
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,630
Soul Devouring Powder?

422
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,810
Are you scared now?

423
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,770
No one has ever found a way to counteract

424
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,970
this potent poison in the past century.

425
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,390
I heard that 20 years ago,

426
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,230
Chief Tang of Apothecary Valley

427
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,630
ruminated for a month

428
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,020
but got nothing.

429
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,770
Instead, he ended up dying after vomiting blood

430
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,230
due to mental exhaustion.

431
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,470
The scariest thing is

432
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,950
the poison will corrode your entire body

433
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,710
and you'll die

434
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,560
a painful death.

435
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,940
What a pity.

436
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,870
I'd always

437
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,150
seen you as my eyes.

438
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,390
But you betrayed me.

439
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:48,830
Eye.

440
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,350
Think about it.

441
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,400
Wuma rebelled before.

442
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,830
I couldn't be

443
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,060
that defenseless.

444
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,190
Eye.

445
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,070
Ming Li had never

446
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,510
left Yuan Yi Palace.

447
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,820
He has always been by my side.

448
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,680
It's your fault.

449
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,990
You were too impatient

450
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,810
and showed your true colors so early.

451
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,990
What a pity.

452
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,270
What a pity.

453
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,270
Eye.

454
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,540
If you don't want to die,

455
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,350
beg me for mercy.

456
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,070
Kill...

457
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,790
Kill me...

458
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,550
Kill me...

459
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,090
I'll be letting you off too easy

460
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,280
by killing you now.

461
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,270
How strange.

462
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
What gave you the courage to do this?

463
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,790
Could it be that you remember

464
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,790
your origin?

465
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,950
You really have regained your memory.

466
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,750
In that case,

467
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,980
you didn't

468
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,060
betray me just for your ambition

469
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,230
but also to avenge

470
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,150
the dead.

471
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,710
Eye.

472
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,270
I thought you've already

473
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,980
become a heartless child.

474
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,830
Why do you care so much

475
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,480
about the villagers

476
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,820
who died because of you?

477
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,160
My Eye.

478
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,510
There are things I don't tell you

479
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,560
because of my benevolence.

480
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,150
Since you don't appreciate it,

481
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,670
I'll take back

482
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,620
my benevolence.

483
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,590
Before you die,

484
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,970
I'll tell you everything that happened

485
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,730
back then.

486
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,410
That girl...

487
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,960
You call her sister, right?

488
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,470
You always thought

489
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,030
she abandoned you.

490
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,630
Even when

491
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,810
you lost your memory,

492
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,130
you still thought so.

493
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,830
Right?

494
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,320
Unfortunately,

495
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,200
they did

496
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,030
want to come back to save you.

497
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,840
But they were chased down by Miao Feng.

498
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,510
Later,

499
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,070
she and her friend

500
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,969
fell into the icy river together.

501
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,739
That boy

502
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,150
was frozen to death.

503
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,610
And that girl…

504
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,389
Sister Ye.

505
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,659
Sister Ye.

506
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:28,989
Eye.

507
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,100
Now that you know these things,

508
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,150
you must be

509
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,739
very sad.

510
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,219
You deserve it.

511
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,790
Really.

512
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,199
You deserve it.

513
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,070
I personally gave you

514
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,990
this Lixue Sword.

515
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,800
But now you want to kill me

516
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,730
with this sword.

517
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,950
You've really let me down.

518
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,110
You killed so many of

519
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,260
my beloved mastiffs

520
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,310
and Ming Li had to die.

521
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,910
Before the poison attacks,

522
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,230
why don't you be

523
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,030
my dog like before?

524
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,190
But since you've lost

525
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,470
your eyes,

526
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,710
you might be worse than a dog.

527
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,870
Guards.

528
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,530
Send him to the Snow Prison

529
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,600
and lock him up with my mastiff.

530
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,990
Yes.

531
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:34,990
Miao Shui.

532
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,670
Yes.

533
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,500
Send this sword to our armory.

534
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,840
Yes, Doctrine Leader.

535
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,870
Forget it.

536
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,320
I'll take care of it.

537
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,870
Go ahead.

538
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,130
I'll take my leave.

539
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,500
Miao Feng.

540
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,230
Why aren't you back yet?

541
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,110
Doctrine Leader.

542
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,000
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

543
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,390
Did you just find out about

544
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,670
the chaos in the palace?

545
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,330
I just scoured the entire

546
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,190
Yuan Yi Palace.

547
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,330
I've killed off Eye and Miao Huo's

548
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,730
remaining accomplices.

549
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,110
Please rest assured.

550
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,230
Really?

551
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,050
I have sent more men

552
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,270
to guard your chamber

553
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,150
to ensure your safety.

554
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,030
Okay.

555
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,790
Good job.

556
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,510
Eye.

557
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,950
You still failed.

558
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,950
Miao Shui.

559
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,670
Before entering the palace,

560
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,710
I already noticed

561
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,890
the leader was just Ming Li in disguise.

562
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,590
But I had

563
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,790
no time to stop you.

564
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,000
Since it had come to this,

565
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,410
why should I get myself involved?

566
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,490
You're a smart person.

567
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,320
You understand, right?

568
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,630
But it's really a pity.

569
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,950
Wretch.

570
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,190
Even a wretch is better than a dog.

571
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,390
Kill me.

572
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,800
Do you want to die?

573
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
It's not that easy.

574
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,350
The Soul Devouring Powder

575
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,280
will corrode your brain bit by bit.

576
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
You'll lose

577
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,050
part of your memory every day.

578
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,070
Seven days later,

579
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,070
you'll become

580
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,190
an idiot like a baby.

581
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,190
That's not all.

582
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,760
The poison will

583
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,190
seep into your muscles

584
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,070
through your brain and bones.

585
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,950
All your muscles

586
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,910
will rot and disintegrate

587
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,270
chunk by chunk.

588
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,970
Only until you become a skeleton

589
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,630
will you be able to die.

590
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,230
This is only your first day.

591
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,320
Before the poison attacks,

592
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,310
you'll just have to

593
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,870
be a subservient dog

594
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,670
until you die.

595
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,870
I heard there's a secret passage

596
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,070
at Asura Field that leads to the armory.

597
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,070
If you reveal

598
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,270
that to me,

599
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,710
I might show you mercy

600
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,280
and let you die soon.

601
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,990
I'll make you talk.

602
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,590
All my seniors and juniors' letters are here.

603
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,850
But where is Fifth Brother's?

604
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,550
Junior.

605
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,690
Junior!

606
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Why aren't you resting

607
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,030
in your room?

608
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,270
I know what you want to do.

609
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,150
Just go, Senior.

610
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,190
Don't worry about me.

611
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,030
Junior.

612
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,030
Since I was little,

613
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,480
I grew up

614
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,370
under my dad and your protection.

615
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,350
Even after I got married,

616
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,150
I was still

617
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,480
quite the carefree girl

618
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,110
from Celestial Alp Sect.

619
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,070
I always threw tantrums

620
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,630
and did many stupid things.

621
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,550
Until Chonghua,

622
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,110
Dad,

623
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,270
and Mo left,

624
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,910
I realized

625
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,670
no one would be by my side

626
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,630
forever.

627
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,390
Right?

628
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,030
I should learn

629
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,560
to face everything myself.

630
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,270
That doesn't

631
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,750
sound like

632
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,670
something

633
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,470
you'd say.

634
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,870
Then I've matured a bit.

635
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,530
What about you?

636
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:29,830
I...

637
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,350
Senior.

638
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,190
You've spent so many years

639
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,350
to protect Mo.

640
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,270
That's more than enough.

641
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,750
Now,

642
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,170
you should think about yourself.

643
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,030
Don't bear the burden

644
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,430
of this promise anymore.

645
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,510
I can tell that

646
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,910
you like Chief Xue.

647
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,670
So even though I once

648
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,510
had a sliver of unrealistic hope

649
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,750
that...

650
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,430
But later I felt that

651
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,600
you and Chief Xue are a great match.

652
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,230
No.

653
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,970
You're not a match.

654
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,410
Chief Xue is such an excellent woman.

655
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,550
Even though I’m your junior,

656
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,200
sometimes I actually think

657
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,000
you're not good enough for her.

658
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,870
I know you're busy.

659
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,610
I won't see you off.

660
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,850
Take care, Senior.

661
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:52,790
Take care.
