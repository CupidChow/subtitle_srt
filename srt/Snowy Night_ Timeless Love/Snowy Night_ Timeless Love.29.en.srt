1
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
You know everything?

2
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,520
Back then,

3
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,030
you used

4
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,630
the darts with arsenopyrite

5
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,120
and hit Xuehuai.

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,710
Then you used Spring Breeze

7
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
to break the ice

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,870
and plunged us into the icy river.

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
And you

10
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
knew

11
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,840
everything you did to us,

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,190
right?

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
In order to obtain the Eye Magic,

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,760
you led Qiushui He into the trap.

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,730
You burned the village,

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
killed innocent people,

17
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,310
and escaped unscathed.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,150
If Xuehuai hadn't

19
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,680
taken this dart for me,

20
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,190
I'd have been buried instead.

21
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,010
I don't want to hear your apology.

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Tell me.

24
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,710
Why did you do it?

25
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,280
I don't want to

26
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,750
hear it from others.

27
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
I want you to answer me in person.

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,070
Why?

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
Why did you do it?

30
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,800
Did the Doctrine Leader

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
ask you to do that?

32
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,630
Tell me.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,030
Was it the Doctrine Leader's order?

34
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,829
Why aren't you saying anything?

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,750
Answer me.

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,900
Why did you do that?

37
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,480
You’re injured.

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,320
Don’t worry about me.

39
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,960
It's from the cane.

40
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,190
That bastard leader of yours punished you.

41
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,320
You were so obedient

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,150
and loyal to him,

43
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,150
why did he hit you?

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,410
Chief Xue, don’t be rude to him.

45
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Thank you, Chief Xue.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
Is that person

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,810
so important to you?

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,210
No matter what he asks you to do,

49
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,390
you will agree.

50
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,810
Without the Doctrine Leader,

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,159
I would have long turned to dust.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't belong to myself.

53
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,310
I only live for the Doctrine Leader.

54
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,070
I see.

55
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,990
You may leave.

56
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,800
Since you now know the truth,

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
what would you do?

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,040
This is the territory of

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,100
the Yuan Yi Palace.

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
What can I do

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,630
alone here?

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,580
I hope you understand that

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,830
I will always be by the Doctrine Leader's side

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,190
to keep him safe.

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,920
As long as you

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,480
can cure the Doctrine Leader,

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,630
I will protect you

68
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,920
and the Apothecary Valley.

69
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,280
I want to save you.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
What should I do

71
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,600
to cure you,

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,750
Ya Mi?

73
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,330
It’s time to end it.

74
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
When Chief Xue cures

75
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,870
Doctrine Leader's sickness,

76
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll send her off the mountain as soon as possible

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,060
to avoid more trouble.

78
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,600
Ahead is the

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Yuan Yi Palace's territory.

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
There might be traps.

81
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,600
Be careful.

82
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,510
Let's take a look.

83
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,480
Let's go.

84
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,270
Seven.

85
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,210
Something seems to have happened there.

86
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,080
Eldest Brother.

87
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,370
The Wolf Fang Mace.

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
You know this weapon?

89
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,720
This is the famous weapon of Tong Jue,

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
an assassin of the Yuan Yi Palace's Asura Field.

91
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
He once dominated the Western Region

92
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,810
and took many lives.

93
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,270
Later, he became a top assassin

94
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
of Yuan Yi Palace,

95
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,690
one of the Eight Elites.

96
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,190
But why

97
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,510
is it found here?

98
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,920
Out of the Eight Elites,

99
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,250
seven of them died here.

100
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,720
Judging from their bodies' placement,

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,580
it seems to have been a formation.

102
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,120
Tong Jue.

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,910
Zhui Feng.

104
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,480
Nie Jing.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,240
Chen Fu.

106
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,830
Yan Zhi.

107
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,750
These five people

108
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
were obviously using Yuan Yi Palace's

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,640
Heaven's Net Formation.

110
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,430
The Eight Elites joined forces in an ambush,

111
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,830
but were all killed here.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,870
Their enemy's martial arts skill

113
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,920
is unbelievable.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,720
Looks like we need to

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,600
get to Yuan Yi Palace as soon as possible

116
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,130
in case something happens.

117
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,360
What a pity.

118
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,000
The Chief of the Apothecary Valley offended the Doctrine Leader

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,270
and was beheaded.

120
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,510
I lied to you.

121
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,880
Look how scared you were.

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,910
It seems you already know that Xue Ziye

123
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,240
is your old friend from Mo Family Village.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
You were afraid to let the Doctrine Leader

125
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,720
know about her identity.

126
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,360
That's why you held back from

127
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,560
recognizing her in Yuan Yi Hall, right?

128
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,670
That's rare.

129
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,030
To think there's someone in this world

130
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,430
whom you want to protect.

131
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you want?

132
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,150
Tell me.

133
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's exchange conditions.

134
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,960
As long as you tell me

135
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,490
the entrance to the armory,

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
I'll give you whatever you want.

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,380
The Doctrine Leader has put the Lixue

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,080
in the armory, right?

139
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
You failed once,

140
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,410
but you still want to kill him?

141
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,870
Next time,

142
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,750
you won't be so lucky

143
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,030
to get away unscathed.

144
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,630
It has nothing to do with you.

145
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,670
If you want to die faster,

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,470
just tell me.

147
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,550
Let her go back safely,

148
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,510
and I'll tell you.

149
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,360
Her?

150
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,510
Your sister?

151
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,190
That's right.

152
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,720
Okay.

153
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,480
I promise you.

154
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,550
I didn't expect

155
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,240
you would

156
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,030
also abandon yourself

157
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,840
to protect her.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,300
In the Asura Field.

159
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,570
The entrance is in the secret room

160
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,510
I always spend time alone in.

161
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,770
The mechanism is under the candlestick.

162
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
If you lie to me,

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,720
you know

164
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
what I will do, right?

165
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,280
And what if you break your promise?

166
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
In your current situation,

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,910
you can only trust me.

168
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
Don't be suspicious.

169
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,840
Still, Xue Ziye

170
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,200
is really amazing.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
She made Miao Feng

172
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,630
and you

173
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,670
protect her with your lives.

174
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Could it be that

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
she has

176
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
some kind of charm on her?

177
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,670
Miao Feng?

178
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes.

179
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Speaking of which,

180
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
I need to thank her.

181
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,670
Thanks to her,

182
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,120
The Spring Breeze mental technique has been broken.

183
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
Now he only has

184
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
70% of his power.

185
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,270
The most tricky Miao Feng

186
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,870
is now no longer a threat.

187
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,870
Miao Kong

188
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,510
doesn't care to be in charge.

189
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,870
Ming Li and Miao Huo are both dead,

190
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,150
and you've become like this.

191
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,520
There's only Miao Feng left.

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm afraid even without Spring Breeze,

193
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,000
Miao Feng wouldn't be

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,660
an easy opponent to deal with.

195
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,750
I don't need your advice.

196
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,200
I have a plan.

197
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,390
Mind your own business.

198
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
Chief Xue.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,910
Come in.

200
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,130
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

201
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,630
Okay.

202
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
Aren't you going to ask where you're going?

203
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,670
You're holding the Lixue sword.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,130
You've met Mingjie.

205
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,840
I like

206
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,370
dealing with smart people.

207
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,440
Let's go.

208
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,280
Don't worry.

209
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,960
I fed it something.

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
It won't wake up before dawn.

211
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,960
Let's go.

212
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,950
What's wrong?

213
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,200
That...

214
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,680
That is...

215
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,960
To break through the mental technique cultivation,

216
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,290
Chang Wujue needed children born at noon.

217
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,430
So I sent Ming Li to look for some.

218
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,390
One of them was a boy.

219
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,160
The safety lock

220
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,870
belonged to him.

221
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,620
What about that child?

222
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,500
What about the others?

223
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
Chang Wujue sought them

224
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,440
for an attempt.

225
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,650
It failed, unfortunately.

226
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,150
Since the children became useless,

227
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,670
they had to be disposed of.

228
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,360
Just like everyone who made a mistake

229
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,030
in Yuan Yi Palace,

230
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,090
they were buried in the garden.

231
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,070
He found this lock interesting,

232
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
so he kept it

233
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,030
and hung it on his favorite dog.

234
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,840
How ironic.

235
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,360
The safety lock failed to keep him safe.

236
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
This child

237
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,070
can probably

238
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,510
reunite with his family.

239
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,390
What?

240
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,030
Does this boy

241
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
have anything to do with you?

242
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
This safety lock

243
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,240
is for Chu's child.

244
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,850
Looks like he owes another blood debt.

245
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,790
Where is he?

246
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,960
At the end.

247
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,150
Mingjie.

248
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,120
Mingjie.

249
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,400
Get lost!

250
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,400
Mingjie.

251
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,720
It's me.

252
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,310
Miao Shui!

253
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,510
What do you want?

254
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,030
What exactly do you want?

255
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,550
Why did you bring her here?

256
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,880
Why did you bring her here?

257
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Why are you yelling at me?

258
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,790
I can be

259
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,440
kindhearted sometimes.

260
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,550
By the way,

261
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,790
I guess you two are reunited now.

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,640
Eye.

263
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,240
I've got the Lixue sword.

264
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,070
You two

265
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,590
should say your goodbyes.

266
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,830
Time is running out.

267
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll wait for you by the cage.

268
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,720
Mingjie...

269
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,030
Your eyes...

270
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,160
Leave me alone!

271
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,270
Get lost!

272
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,550
Mingjie...

273
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,640
Mingjie!

274
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,590
It's me, Mingjie!

275
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Your sister is here.

276
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,550
Why are you forcing me like this?

277
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,640
Why did you come?

278
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,590
I left the Apothecary Valley

279
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,720
because I don't want to implicate you.

280
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,030
Why did you come?

281
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,690
Your Mingjie died a long time ago.

282
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,880
He's long dead!

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,550
Mingjie.

284
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,450
Mingjie.

285
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,070
Don't...

286
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
Don't think that way.

287
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,240
Mingjie.

288
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,070
Mingjie, I know.

289
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,010
No matter what you become,

290
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,910
you'll always be my Mingjie.

291
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,860
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

292
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,030
I will take you out of here.

293
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,110
It's okay.

294
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
It's okay.

295
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,920
Mingjie.

296
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,510
Be good.

297
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,070
It's okay.

298
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,400
Let me see your wounds.

299
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,350
Let me see your wounds, okay?

300
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,400
It's useless.

301
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,390
It's useless.

302
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,440
It's useless now...

303
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,420
I was poisoned by Soul Devouring Powder.

304
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
Soul Devouring Powder?

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,790
I'm going to die.

306
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,270
Leave me alone.

307
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,310
Sister Ye.

308
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,480
I’m here.

309
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,070
I'm here.

310
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm right here.

311
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,070
I'm right here with you.

312
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,110
I know now.

313
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,000
You and Xuehuai

314
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,240
have never abandoned me.

315
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
Let's not talk about this.

316
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,350
Let's not talk about this anymore.

317
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,830
It's all in the past.

318
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,590
Something like that will never

319
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,390
happen again.

320
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,070
Don't save Chang Wujue.

321
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,000
He will kill you.

322
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Go down the mountain now.

323
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,070
I deserve this.

324
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
Don't waste your effort to save me.

325
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,480
Nonsense.

326
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,030
No matter what you did,

327
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,350
as long as I'm alive,

328
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,680
I won't leave you alone.

329
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,830
Sister,

330
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,460
I was poisoned by Soul Devouring Powder.

331
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,590
You are a doctor.

332
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,510
You know what that means.

333
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,310
Leave me.

334
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,510
Go.

335
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,640
Hurry!

336
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,930
Find a way to go down the mountain.

337
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,160
Sister.

338
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,790
Leave me.

339
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Go!

340
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,510
Go!

341
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,960
Go!

342
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,790
Wait for me.

343
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,090
I'll be right back.

344
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,590
Sister.

345
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,330
Where are you going?

346
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,070
Don't worry.

347
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm not leaving.

348
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,890
I'll be right back.

349
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,590
Sister.

350
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,530
Wait for me.

351
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,400
Sister!

352
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,480
Wait for me.

353
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,510
Sister Ye.

354
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,030
Sister!

355
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Wait for me.

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,030
Sister, don't go.

357
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Sister, don't go!

358
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Sister, don't go!

359
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Leave!

360
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,440
Sister, don't go!

361
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,110
What?

362
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,830
You're out so soon?

363
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,920
I thought

364
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
you'd talk more to each other

365
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,330
during your hard-earned reunion.

366
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,160
Give me the key.

367
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,240
What key?

368
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,830
The key to the lock.

369
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,210
Give it to me.

370
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,350
Chief Xue.

371
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,240
Don’t you think that demand

372
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,370
is a little too much?

373
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,570
Why should I give it to you?

374
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,110
Eye is a traitor.

375
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,830
If I do this,

376
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,070
I'd be betraying the Doctrine Leader.

377
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,600
Don't beat around the bush.

378
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
I know you want to kill the Doctrine Leader.

379
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,200
Aren’t you afraid I'd kill you

380
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,230
for spouting such nonsense?

381
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,270
You won't.

382
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,530
Because you need me.

383
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,680
Soul Devouring Powder is the best poison in the world.

384
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,200
I can't cure it at all.

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,950
I just don't want him

386
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,350
to be locked like a dog.

387
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,360
If you give me the key,

388
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll help you.

389
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Tomorrow.

390
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,030
How bold of you.

391
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,530
How confident are you?

392
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,230
I have a higher chance

393
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,310
of success

394
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,240
than you.

395
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,480
I will avenge Mingjie

396
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,970
and the Mo Family Village.

397
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,170
Give me the key.

398
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll cooperate with you.

399
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,480
Here.

400
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,680
I'll discuss it with you

401
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,920
after I come back.

402
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,550
Sister.

403
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,680
Sister?

404
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,780
What are you doing?

405
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,200
Sister.

406
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,500
What are you doing?

407
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,680
Mingjie.

408
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,550
Don't move.

409
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
I'll treat you.

410
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
It's useless!

411
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,750
Sister.

412
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,680
I've told you.

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,480
It's useless.

414
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,440
Open your eyes.

415
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,110
All done.

416
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,440
Sister...

417
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,200
Mingjie.

418
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,440
You're alright now.

419
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,480
You're alright now.

420
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,350
Sister.

421
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,480
Sister.

422
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,830
Sister.

423
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,870
The poison has been removed.

424
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,440
I'll apply some snake gallbladder ointment on your eyes.

425
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,700
You'll recover completely by tomorrow.

426
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,000
Can you see the shadow?

427
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,470
"The Soul Devouring Powder is incurable."

428
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,040
That has been proven wrong.

429
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,110
Twenty years ago,

430
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,160
Grandmaster Lin Xia

431
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,220
agonized over this poison for a month

432
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,000
and died from overexhaustion.

433
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,830
But in the end,

434
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,640
she found a cure.

435
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
The poison clings to the skin

436
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,960
and spreads rapidly.

437
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,950
But one just needs to use silver needles

438
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,270
to force the poison together in one spot

439
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,680
and let someone who practices medicine

440
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,240
force the poison out with their body as a medium.

441
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,440
Then, it can be cured.

442
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,830
We don't even need

443
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
any medicine.

444
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,680
Then you...

445
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,790
I've been suffering from a cold disease for a long time.

446
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,250
Fire poison can't hurt me.

447
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,110
It will be fine.

448
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,920
Really?

449
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,310
Sister.

450
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,590
Sister.

451
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,400
Really?

452
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,160
Mingjie.

453
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,030
I won't let you die.

454
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,600
I won't let you be like Xuehuai

455
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,160
or the whole village

456
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,550
and die in front of me.

457
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Mingjie.

458
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,850
This is the Red Fruit Jade Dew Pill.

459
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,440
You must have heard of it.

460
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,450
It'll help you feel better.

461
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,750
Mingjie.

462
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,050
Take care of yourself.

463
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,470
Don’t worry about the Doctrine Leader.

464
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,720
Your acupoints

465
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,030
will automatically be released

466
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,030
in 16 hours.

467
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,680
When your eyes

468
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,070
can see clearly,

469
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,840
you can leave on your own.

470
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,790
Mingjie.

471
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,790
Listen to me.

472
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,750
Don't kill anymore.

473
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,400
Don't worry.

474
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,480
I will be fine.

475
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,400
Sister.

476
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,400
Sister...

477
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,960
Don't go.

478
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,510
Don't go, Sister.

479
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,830
Don't go...

480
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,310
Why?

481
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,220
Why is this happening?

482
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,110
Why is this happening?

483
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,070
No!

484
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,030
I don't want it!

485
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,400
I don't want anything else!

486
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,550
I only want you!

487
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,030
I just want you to live well!

488
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,000
Sister!

489
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,640
Sister...

490
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,790
Come back!

491
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,400
Mingjie.

492
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,830
I want you to live well.

493
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,920
Mingjie.

494
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,510
You are the only family

495
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,880
I have in this world.

496
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,310
I can't let them

497
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,590
ruin you

498
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,920
like this.

499
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,480
You don't understand

500
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,000
what kind of person I am.

501
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,790
I don't deserve your help.

502
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Don't be silly.

503
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,200
You are my brother.

504
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,350
On my way to Yuan Yi Palace,

505
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,790
your men told me

506
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,880
you ordered them not to kill me.

507
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,070
You never

508
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,200
want to hurt me, right?

509
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
You've always been

510
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,160
my Brother Mingjie.

511
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,000
You have never changed.

512
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
Chief Xue.

513
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,890
It’s getting late.

514
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,110
Be quiet.

515
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
Miao Shui's words

516
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,000
can't be trusted.

517
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,960
Be good.

518
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,230
Go to sleep.

519
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,590
When you wake up,

520
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,480
everything will be fine.

521
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,679
Everything will be fine.

522
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,070
Sister...

523
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,030
Go to sleep.

524
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,510
Don't go...

525
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,510
You took too long,

526
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,150
Chief Xue,

527
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,400
Let us

528
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,590
now discuss

529
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,530
how to deal with things tomorrow.

530
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,190
Don’t worry, Doctrine Leader.

531
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,000
After Chief Xue’s treatment tomorrow,

532
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,330
you will fully recover.

533
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But after I fully recover,

534
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,030
I wonder if

535
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,590
we should

536
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
keep Miao Shui or not.

537
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,510
As far as I know,

538
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,400
on the day Eye rebelled,

539
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
Miao Shui killed

540
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
Miao Huo, who was also rebelling,

541
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,460
and protected you.

542
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,710
I think...

543
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,550
Feng.

544
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,550
You used to obey orders

545
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,240
and never asked why.

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,150
I'm just...

547
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,150
Miao Shui

548
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,320
is too smart.

549
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
We have to guard against her.

550
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,000
Do you know?

551
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,880
When Eye was subdued,

552
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,420
he ratted on Miao Shui too.

553
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,890
Although she didn't admit it,

554
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,190
we cannot be sure that her loyalty that day

555
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,590
was not made based on

556
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,600
the development of the situation.

557
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,440
I didn’t kill her that day

558
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,510
because

559
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,000
you were not by my side.

560
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,030
But after I recover,

561
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Miao Shui should be disposed of.

562
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,400
I understand.

563
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,030
During the treatment tomorrow,

564
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,480
the most important thing for you

565
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,880
is to stay by my side

566
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,210
and never leave me.

567
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,190
Feng.

568
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,550
You have always been

569
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,080
the person I trust the most.

570
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,360
I will definitely protect you.

571
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
In Yuan Yi Palace,

572
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,540
everyone is scheming against

573
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
each other.

574
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
It's my turn to make a move.

575
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,590
Last question.

576
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,640
Aren't you afraid of death?

577
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,670
Yes.

578
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,480
But there's something scarier than death.

579
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,000
Okay.

580
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,870
Act according to plan tomorrow.

581
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,840
She's not bad.

582
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,710
I seem to have gotten

583
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,480
a good partner for myself.

584
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Since the deal is over,

585
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,280
you should eat him.

586
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,550
Go.

587
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,520
Gut-rupturing herb?

588
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,920
Xue Ziye.

589
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,170
You are really something.

590
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,030
I'm spent.

591
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,680
I can't move anymore.

592
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,670
Let's take a rest here.

593
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,960
Fourth Brother.

594
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,810
Hold on a little longer.

595
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,360
Seven.

596
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,110
Listen to Four

597
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,040
and take a break.

598
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,320
Even if a person can go on,

599
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,030
the horse can't go on much further.

600
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,510
Besides, the road to the north

601
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,550
is getting colder.

602
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,750
It's hard to walk too.

603
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,960
Let's rest for tonight

604
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
to travel well tomorrow.

605
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,690
Then let's take a night off

606
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,050
and leave tomorrow.

607
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,280
Great.

608
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
Take a rest.

609
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,070
Sir,

610
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,280
how many are with you?

611
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,190
Do you need anything?

612
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,670
Seven.

613
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,550
Just

614
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,070
get us some food and drinks.

615
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,150
Okay. Have a seat.

616
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,160
Wait a moment.

617
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,750
She should have

618
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,110
received my letter.

619
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,940
I wonder if she will

620
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,030
wait for me under that plum tree.

621
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,530
Fifth Brother.

622
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,200
Why are you still up?

623
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,570
I can't sleep well.

624
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,450
I didn't see you in the room,

625
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,840
so I thought you must be

626
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,770
drinking alone.

627
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,360
Have a sip.

628
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,290
Qingran told me to drink less.

629
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Got it.

630
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,360
Seven.

631
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
Are you in such a hurry

632
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,990
because of Qingran's disciple?

633
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,760
Remember to bury a pot of Laughing at the World

634
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,890
under the plum tree.

635
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Let's drink together when I'm back.

636
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,910
I'll surely beat you.

637
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,150
I promised her.

638
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,680
When the wine has aged,

639
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,960
I'll go back and drink with her.
