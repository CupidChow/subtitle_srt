00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,130
♫How many obstacles must one overcome in life?♫

5
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,160
♫Love is the hardest obstacle of all♫

6
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,900
It would be great if this moment

7
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,780
♫We're like a lonely sail in the vast world♫

8
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,920
could last forever.

9
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,980
♫Drifting always, looking for the shore♫

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,670
♫We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountains♫

11
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,260
♫Why fear the coldness of fate?♫

12
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,410
♫If the night is lonely, I will be the lamp♫

13
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,310
What happened?

14
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,130
♫And light up the rest of our lives♫

15
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,790
Mr. Mingjie is awake.

16
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,079
But he kept saying it hurts.

17
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,510
I lit the soothing incense this morning

18
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,430
and made some medicine.

19
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,430
♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

20
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,510
But I couldn’t get him to drink it.

21
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,910
Shouldn’t we tell Chief?

22
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,250
She drank with Mr. Seven

23
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,210
till late night.

24
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,730
♫The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resolute♫

25
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,650
She must be asleep now.

26
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,250
We still need her here.

27
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,829
I’ll go find her now.

28
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,329
♫Toasts exchanged, how many nights has snow fallen?♫

29
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,090
Be hush about this.

30
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,340
We can't let Mr. Seven know that

31
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,740
Mingjie is in the valley.

♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

38
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,760
My goodness.

39
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,040
What's going on?

40
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,810
This...

41
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,680
Was I imagining things?

42
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,080
Shuang Hong.

43
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,990
You saw it too, right?

44
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,620
I’ve never seen Chief

45
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,220
sleeping so soundly before.

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,820
Before, no matter how big the fire was,

47
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
she always said it was cold

48
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,659
and couldn't sleep at night.

49
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,040
She would get up and keep

50
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,590
walking around.

51
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,090
♫Bid farewell in the first wasteland♫

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
So,

53
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,790
let her

54
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,040
sleep a little longer.

60

I’ll stay here

61
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,210
and tell her when she wakes up.

62
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,070
Go.

63
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,470
Okay.

64

What did I do?

76
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,590
I wanted to take you back to your room yesterday.

77
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,720
But I saw you asleep.

78
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,390
So I...

79
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,000
I slept soundly.

80
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,990
So you wanted me to sleep more?

81
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,550
Yes.

82
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
Since you already know,

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,830
you don't have to be angry.

84
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,750
You have no proof.

85
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,880
How can you prove it?

86
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,510
How can I prove that?

87
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,270
We were drunk last night.

88
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,370
I wanted to send you back to your room.

89
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,470
-But you…
-Stop it!

90
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,370
Didn't you ask me to tell you?

91
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,030
How could you turn against me?

92
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,909
Today, I'll show you

93
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,730
what turning against you means.

94
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
Why did you hit me?

95
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,010
Aren't I considered a patient?

96
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,410
Chief.

97
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,320
Shuang Hong.

98
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,310
You came at the right time.

99
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,150
Lock him up.

100
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,590
When the medicine is ready,

101
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,790
drive him out of the valley.

102
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,150
I…

103
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,840
Yes, Chief.

104
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,190
Chief.

105
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,870
The Autumn Garden needs you.

106
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,110
Mr. Seven.

107
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,290
It’s been a night.

108
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,820
You should go back and rest.

109
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,660
This woman

110
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,480
was as obedient as a cat last night.

111
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,200
But today, she's like a different person.

112
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,470
I don't understand her at all.

113
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,120
My legs are numb.

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,790
Mingjie.

115
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,120
Why are you squatting here?

116
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,470
You need a good rest.

117
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,480
Lie down.

118
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,570
Don't come closer.

119
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,560
I'm not Mingjie.

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,880
What do you want?

121
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,350
Mingjie.

122
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,170
You should have recovered

123
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,430
some of your memories.

124
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,410
Why are you still asking that?

125
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,710
It's all fake.

126
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,630
It's all fake.

127
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,750
It's not fake.

128
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,030
Mingjie.

129
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,030
It's me.

130
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,870
I’m back.

131
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,510
I’m Sister Ye.

132
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,430
Look.

133
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,430
What is this?

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
This hairpin

135
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,550
is yours?

136
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,750
Yes.

137
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,680
I haven't asked you yet.

138
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,070
Why was it

139
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,350
with you?

140
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,510
I found it in the snow

141
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,390
on my way to the Apothecary Valley.

142
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,620
Why did you pick it up?

143
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,410
Do you remember this hairpin?

144
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,860
I just think the sound it makes

145
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,950
is very familiar.

146
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,380
No wonder, in the past, you could tell

147
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,840
I was approaching from a long distance away.

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,720
When I asked you

149
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,270
how you knew I was here,

150
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,450
you always refused to tell me.

151
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,550
Now I understand.

152
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,220
You must have heard

153
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,830
the bells on this hairpin.

154
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,190
Right?

155
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,200
Is this

156
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,340
the reason I slept so well

157
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,750
every night?

158
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,500
Mingjie.

159
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,170
Since you picked up this hairpin,

160
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,670
it means that deep within your memories,

161
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,630
you remember me

162
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,170
and the Mo Family Village.

163
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,510
No one dares to look into my eyes!

164
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,830
Mingjie.

165
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm not afraid of your eyes.

166
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,350
You've got the wrong person!

167
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm not Mingjie.

168
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,320
Listen.

169
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,670
Give me the Dragon Blood Pearl now.

170
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,750
Or I'll kill you!

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,750
Why?

172
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,710
Why?

173
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,630
Mingjie.

174
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,270
How did you become like this?

175
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,600
You don't even believe

176
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,860
your own memories now?

177
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,470
Is this how

178
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,870
an assassin cultivated by Yuan Yi Palace's

179
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,480
Asura Field is like?

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,030
All these years,

181
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,150
what kind of torture

182
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,590
have you suffered?

183
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,750
Is she still angry at me?

184
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,350
Mr. Huo.

185
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,550
Time to eat.

186
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,310
Xiao Jing.

187
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,670
Is your chief still angry?

188
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,950
I don’t know.

189
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,680
Is she in the Summer Garden?

190
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,360
I don't know.

191
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
What's your name?

192
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,570
I don't know...

193
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,560
Xiao Jing.

194
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,190
As far as I know,

195
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,110
your chief is treating a patient,

196
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,600
right?

197
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,780
Feng Lyu told me everything.

198
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,150
Feng Lyu told you everything?

199
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,950
Of course.

200
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,190
Think about how close I am

201
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,990
to your Chief.

202
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,990
What's there to hide from me?

203
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,150
But Chief said

204
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,470
we can’t tell

205
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,710
you about this.

206
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,830
Why not?

207
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,730
Because the patient in Autumn Garden...

208
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,150
I don't know.

209
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,550
Xiao Jing.

210
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,280
The Autumn Garden

211
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,010
is suddenly housing a patient,

212
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
and she's keeping it from me?

213
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,420
Mr. Seven.

214
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,150
Is she inside?

215
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,390
The Chief is treating a patient.

216
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,310
Please wait for her

217
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,970
in the Summer Garden instead.

218
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,590
It's okay.

219
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,250
I'll just wait here.

220
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,070
Chief.

221
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,110
Chief.

222
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,090
Tie him up with a rope

223
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,670
to prevent him from hurting others.

224
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,430
Yes.

225
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,550
Chief Xue, please wait.

226
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,190
What is it?

227
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,310
I want to ask you for an explanation.

228
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,230
What explanation？

229
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,910
Chief Xue.

230
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,350
As a doctor,

231
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,370
you're not treating your patients equally.

232
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,830
You treat this one so gently,

233
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,360
careful not to disturb him.

234
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,590
But you scold and yell

235
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
at this patient,

236
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,250
even throwing a pastry at him.

237
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,430
Look, he has a new injury now.

238
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,400
Some patients

239
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,150
are polite and know their place.

240
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,150
But some patients

241
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,270
have visited the valley

242
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,110
too many times and become

243
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,570
increasingly shameless.

244
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,200
So there is really a patient

245
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,310
in Autumn Garden?

246
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,150
Yes.

247
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,530
So what?

248
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,600
An important one, too?

249
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,270
Just a rich

250
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,550
and handsome one.

251
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,070
Did you take him in

252
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,490
for the money

253
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
or his handsomeness?

254
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,030
Both.

255
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,150
Both?

256
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,590
Why do you care so much

257
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,230
about the patients in the valley?

258
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,910
How about

259
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,670
I arrange for you two to meet?

260
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,630
Okay.

261
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,320
It's just that he has psoriasis.

262
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,150
If you want to see him,

263
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,550
pack your luggage

264
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,610
and move into his room.

265
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,730
You can come out

266
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,040
when he recovers.

267
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,400
Psoriasis?

268
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,030
What?

269
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,450
Why are you asking so many questions?

270
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,490
Are you that free?

271
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,830
No.

272
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,730
I just want to know,

273
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,420
since all the herbs are here,

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,300
when can we make the medicine?

275
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,210
I'm working on it.

276
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,230
Now we just need some

277
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,290
codonopsis roots.

278
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,400
Why don't you

279
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,070
go to the back mountain with me to collect some?

280
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,630
Sure.

281
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,710
Sickle, shovel,

282
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,630
hoe, and medicine knife.

283
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,710
It's all in there.

284
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,150
Chief's hand warmer

285
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,010
is also inside.

286
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,590
Please take care of her,

287
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,200
Mr. Huo,

288
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,760
Don't worry.

289
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,800
I will take good care of her.

290
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,230
Just now, I tried to help Mingjie

291
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,720
remove the second golden needle.

292
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,230
But because

293
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,430
he was too emotional,

294
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,910
I failed to remove it fully.

295
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,260
But he is bleeding slightly

296
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,589
in the Shenting acupoint,

297
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,550
which means the needle has been loosened.

298
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,829
So within four hours,

299
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,589
we have to remove the needle.

300
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,030
What do you need us to do?

301
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,109
Please ask Granny Ning

302
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,490
to bring Mingjie to the hot spring

303
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,079
and force the golden needle out.

304
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,589
I will come back

305
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,670
in four hours.

306
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,760
Before that,

307
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,349
you have to complete the task.

308
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:22,910
Got it.

309
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,530
No wonder you're taking

310
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,589
Mr. Huo with you to collect codonopsis roots.

311
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,319
You're trying to distract him.

312
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,110
But Mr. Seven

313
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,710
always wanders around in the valley.

314
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,430
We can't keep it

315
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,430
from him forever.

316
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,910
It's not the time yet.

317
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
When the third needle is extracted,

318
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,950
I will tell him myself.

319
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,030
Ziye.

320
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,350
The second golden needle has been removed.

321
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,170
Thank you, Granny.

322
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,230
The last one.

323
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,380
Only one left.

324
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,270
The last one is left.

325
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,830
After that, Mingjie can

326
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,270
recover all his memories.

327
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,800
But the third golden needle

328
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,320
is too deep in his brain.

329
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,510
I'm not confident enough.

330
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,530
This is the first time I've heard you say that

331
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,190
you're not confident enough.

332
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,550
Twelve years ago,

333
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,860
I've lost him once.

334
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,790
I can't lose him again.

335
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,910
So,

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,450
we must be extremely cautious.

337
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,590
But now,

338
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,920
I can't guarantee that

339
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,800
he will be unscathed after I remove

340
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,240
the third golden needle

341
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,070
from his head.

342
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,510
If someone

343
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,160
can connect

344
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,030
his meridians

345
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,790
to open the acupoints

346
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,450
and slowly push the golden needle up,

347
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,790
it will help me

348
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,050
pull out the third golden needle.

349
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,470
Mr. Seven

350
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,590
is the best candidate.

351
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,370
But in Yangzhou,

352
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,590
he framed Huo Zhanbai

353
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,630
and almost killed

354
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,960
his master, Qiushui He.

355
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,390
He also killed

356
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,830
many martial artists.

357
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,110
Huo Zhanbai

358
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,230
has always been righteous

359
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,430
and hates him deeply.

360
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,190
I dare not

361
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,270
and don’t want to let him know

362
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,930
that Mingjie is in the valley.

363
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,430
I don't want to make things difficult for him.

364
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,590
Sooner or later,

365
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,670
he will find out.

366
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,510
Yes.

367
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,150
He will find out sooner or later.

368
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,090
Not just about Mingjie, too.

369
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,190
I'll go to the library with you

370
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,450
to get some medical books.

371
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,980
There might be another way.

372
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,540
[Mo Family Village]

373
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,710
Sister, run!

374
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,630
Sister, run!

375
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,540
Run!

376
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,310
Ming... Mingjie.

377
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,230
Grandpa.

378
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,870
Mingjie didn't mean to kill them.

379
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,110
Please forgive him.

380
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,990
Yes.

381
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,590
He did it to save me.

382
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,200
Punish me if you want.

383
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,420
Don't blame Mingjie.

384
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,030
Silly girl.

385
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,150
Now,

386
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,640
it's not about blaming him

387
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,360
or not.

388
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,450
What are you going to do to him?

389
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,190
Are you going to kill him?

390
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,470
From now on,

391
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,550
the Mo Family Village

392
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,570
must never mention Mingjie's matter again.

393
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,630
I will keep him

394
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,430
in the rooftop house.

395
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,920
He's not allowed to leave again.

396
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,840
Let's go.

397
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,070
Mingjie!

398
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,790
Mingjie!

399
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,710
Mingjie!

400
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,800
Sister Ye!

401
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,750
-Sister Ye!
-Mingjie!

402
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,570
Don't be afraid, Mingjie.

403
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,510
We are all here.

404
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,320
We will visit you every day.

405
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,590
Really?

406
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,590
Yes.

407
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,240
But you will leave eventually.

408
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,350
Give me your hand.

409
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,040
Mingjie, don't be afraid.

410
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,550
I won't leave you behind.

411
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,400
Let’s go.

412
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,150
Sister Ye!

413
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,530
Mingjie!

414
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,370
Sister Ye!

415
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,590
Sister Ye!

416
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:30,950
Mingjie!

417
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,910
Sister Ye!

418
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,160
Let go of her!

419
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,470
Let go of her!

420
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,590
Let go of her!

421
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,990
Let go of her!

422
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,070
Let go of her!

423
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,440
Stop looking. Let's go.

424
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,950
I remember now.

425
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,430
This is indeed my memory.

426
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,190
But Mo Family Village

427
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,790
was just like Yuan Yi Palace.

428
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,910
They both locked me

429
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,510
in this dark prison.

430
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,350
Since I have escaped

431
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,110
from that cabin,

432
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,940
I will never go back.

433
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,390
Xue Ziye.

434
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,120
Where is everyone?

435
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,630
No one is here.

436
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,670
The Lixue Sword?

437
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,990
No wonder she kept it from me.

438
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
So the patient in the valley

439
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,260
is the assassin of Yuan Yi Palace.

440
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,680
Why did you come out?

441
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,390
You're still sick.

442
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,840
Don't wander around.

443
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,860
Go back and rest.

444
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,910
Really?

445
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,260
Is it hard to cure my illness?

446
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,070
I'm still looking for a solution...

447
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,830
Where is the Dragon Blood Pearl?

448
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,430
Tell me!

449
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,510
Tell me!

450
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,390
Huo Zhanbai!

451
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,430
Huo Zhanbai, don't hurt him.

452
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,270
Mingjie!

453
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,990
Is your hand okay?

454
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,520
I didn’t mean it.

455
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,330
Don't hurt him.

456
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,410
Please don't hurt him.

457
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,590
How could you bring him

458
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,650
back to the valley?

459
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,430
He wants to control us with the Eye Magic.

460
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,390
He'll hurt you.

461
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,440
He's my younger brother, Mingjie.

462
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,490
He was the one

463
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,950
who saved me

464
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,880
in the Mo Family Village back then.

465
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,240
Mingjie!

466
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,450
-Chief!
-Mingjie.

467
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,190
Mingjie.

468
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,870
I'll take you back to the medicine hut

469
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,130
to bandage your wound.

470
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,930
Shuang Hong.

471
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,870
Take Eye to his room.

472
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,380
Okay.

473
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,600
You're good at dressing it.

474
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,430
You've bandaged me for eight years.

475
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,630
I learned

476
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,750
some skills while watching.

477
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,610
You have something to say?

478
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,430
Go ahead.

479
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,310
Did you bring him back

480
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,040
the day you saved me?

481
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,670
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,440
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

483
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,910
After I recognized him,

484
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,600
I found that his memory

485
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,630
was sealed by three golden needles.

486
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,160
During this time,

487
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,750
I've been trying to

488
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,280
pull out the golden needles.

489
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,360
I wanted to

490
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,910
tell you after I pull out all three

491
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,470
golden needle.

492
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,670
How many have you pulled out?

493
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,070
Two.

494
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,530
Since you have pulled out two,

495
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,050
and he still wants to kill you,

496
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,430
do you think he's still

497
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,630
the Mingjie you knew?

498
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,350
Back then,

499
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,410
Mingjie was only six years old.

500
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,680
He risked his life to protect me.

501
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,550
It means he's kind in nature.

502
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,950
All these years,

503
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,010
Chang Wujue has kept his memories sealed

504
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,420
with the golden needles.

505
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,280
That's why he killed without hesitation.

506
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,470
I believe that

507
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,280
as long as we pull out the third golden needle,

508
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,790
he will recover his memories

509
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,030
and turn over

510
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,430
a new leaf.

511
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,810
Even if he regains his memory now,

512
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,020
he's no longer Mingjie.

513
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,990
But he turned out like this

514
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,470
all because of me.

515
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,260
I have a vague guess.

516
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,550
If the Mo Family Village's massacre was

517
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,750
really orchestrated by Yuan Yi Palace,

518
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,160
why did Yuan Yi Palace

519
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,550
only take Mingjie away?

520
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,110
What were they planning?

521
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,710
Eye Magic?

522
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,460
He used the Eye Magic

523
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,480
to save me back then.

524
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,390
Later, I thought about it.

525
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,390
Maybe the news

526
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,370
leaked out that night.

527
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,710
That's why he got into trouble

528
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,810
and the Mo Family Village was massacred.

529
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,930
But these are just speculations.

530
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,770
Don't blame yourself.

531
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,580
That night,

532
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,840
Xuehuai and I

533
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,480
didn't have time to save him.

534
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,110
That's why he was taken away by Chang Wujue.

535
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,950
We abandoned him.

536
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,290
It was a dangerous situation.

537
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,850
What could you and Xuehuai have done?

538
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,150
Even so,

539
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,070
all these years,

540
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,340
I still feel uneasy.

541
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,670
In the end,

542
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,530
it's all Chang Wujue's fault.

543
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,830
He's just using Eye.

544
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,630
But don't forget.

545
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,440
Eye has been with Yuan Yi Palace for more than 10 years.

546
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,390
He managed to survive

547
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,080
the elimination killing of Asura Field.

548
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,110
That means he has become

549
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,830
ruthless

550
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,820
and cruel.

551
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
I understand you.

552
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,240
He's your brother.

553
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,510
You have to save him.

554
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,630
But I still need to warn you.

555
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,310
Be careful not to nourish a viper in your bosom.

556
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,190
Did I

557
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,550
speak too harshly?

558
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,730
But if Eye stays here,

559
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
how can I leave at ease?

560
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,740
What can I say?

561
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,510
After all, Mingjie

562
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,230
almost killed his master.

563
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,020
I have no right to ask for his forgiveness.

564
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:38,990
Granny,

565
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,020
I might have to stay here

566
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,220
for two or three days.

567
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,630
Please tell Shuang Hong and Feng Lyu

568
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,430
to deliver some food

569
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,500
on time.

570
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,510
Got it.

571
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,190
Ziye.

572
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,310
What is it?

573
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,470
You have to know your limits.

574
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,360
There are many things you can't force.

575
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,800
Although all the previous chiefs of the Apothecary Valley

576
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,460
were called miracle doctors,

577
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,250
even the most skilled doctor

578
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,710
is still a human, not a god.

579
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,870
It's only natural that

580
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,990
there are things you cannot accomplish.

581
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,720
Don't be like

582
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,350
Chief Tang.

583
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,870
Granny.

584
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,230
Are you afraid I'd follow

585
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,030
the old Chief Tang's footsteps?

586
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,350
Yes.

587
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,110
Back then,

588
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,360
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

589
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,670
To find the

590
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,150
antidote to the poison of Soul Devouring Powder,

591
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,410
she exhausted herself

592
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
and vomited blood

593
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,310
before dying in the library.

594
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,220
At her last moment,

595
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,310
she held the

596
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,960
"Book of Medicine" in her hand.

597
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,740
That year,

598
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,840
she was only 31 years old.

599
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,190
Granny.

600
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,950
I know

601
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,950
my own body.

602
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,980
Oh, you...

603
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,949
You should learn from Chief Liao.

604
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,730
She is very happy now.

605
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,430
I must find a way

606
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,640
to pull out the third needle.

607
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,280
♫How many obstacles must one overcome in life?♫

608
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,320
♫Love is the hardest obstacle of all♫

609
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:26,930
♫We're like a lonely sail in the vast world♫

610
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,130
♫Drifting always, looking for the shore♫

611
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,820
♫We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountains♫

612
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,410
♫Why fear the coldness of fate?♫

613
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,560
♫If the night is lonely, I will be the lamp♫

614
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,280
♫And light up the rest of our lives♫

615
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:01,580
♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

616
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,880
♫The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resolute♫

617
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,480
♫Toasts exchanged, how many nights has snow fallen?♫

618
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,170
♫The past fades with the dimming night♫

619
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,360
♫A lifetime with one person and one heart, all for a fleeting warmth♫

620
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:31,240
♫Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memories♫

621
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,300
♫Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of life♫

622
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:45,330
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

623
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:14,020
♫No regrets even when looking back♫

624
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,790
Is your chief inside?

625
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,260
I heard from Xiao Cheng that

626
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,150
she has been staying inside

627
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,210
and never came out.

628
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,400
I'll go check on her.

629
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,360
Mr. Huo.

630
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,530
At this time,

631
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,850
she won’t let you in.

632
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,910
Yes.

633
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,050
She hasn’t slept for days.

634
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,250
She barely eats the meals

635
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,270
we deliver every day,

636
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,310
let alone see you.

637
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,770
Why don’t you persuade her?

638
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,030
She’s always been stubborn.

639
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,350
Whenever she meets a difficult problem,

640
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,880
she forgets to eat or drink.

641
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,350
She's already weak.

642
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,910
How can she

643
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,440
torture herself like this?

644
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,670
Mr. Mingjie

645
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,480
is her only family left.

646
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,510
That’s why she desperately wants

647
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,430
to remove the third

648
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,630
golden needle

649
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,400
from his head

650
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,960
and restore his memory.

651
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,980
She only cares about others

652
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,910
and not herself.

653
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,880
Actually...

654
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,990
The Chief has found

655
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,410
a way to remove the golden needle

656
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,130
from Mr. Mingjie's head.

657
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,080
But in the valley right now,

658
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,970
only you can help with it.

659
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,310
Chief doesn’t want to put you in a difficult position,

660
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,910
so she gave up on this method.

661
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,620
That's why she is in the library,

662
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,220
flipping through the books.

663
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,640
If I help him remove the needle,

664
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,070
I would be helping a villain

665
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,670
who almost killed my master.

666
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,690
Even if I disregard that,

667
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,110
he's a killer who kills without hesitation.

668
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,440
Anyone in the Sword Sect

669
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,800
would kill him on sight.

670
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,330
Don't move.

671
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,850
That woman is right.

672
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,550
Maybe he's killing people

673
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,810
because Chang Wujue is

674
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,940
controlling him.

675
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,970
If I pull out the golden needle

676
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,300
and he regains his mind,

677
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,710
maybe he will

678
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,670
change his ways.

679
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,950
But if I save him

680
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,610
and he doesn't change,

681
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,490
he'll continue to

682
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,600
do evil from now on.

683
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,350
If I don't save him,

684
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,750
that woman

685
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,160
will keep tormenting herself.

686
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,030
What should I do?

687
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,030
Mr. Seven!

688
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,470
Something happened!

689
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,070
Chief... She...

690
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
Chief.

691
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,550
Chief!

692
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,030
Granny.

693
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,570
How is she?

694
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,970
Not only is her cold disease flaring up,

695
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,120
but she is also overworked,

696
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
causing her meridians to freeze up.

697
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,840
Granny.

698
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,050
Help her up.

699
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:12,890
Come on.

700
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,790
Chief.

701
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,400
Chief.

702
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,590
Chief...

703
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,350
Chief, wake up.

704
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,550
Chief.

705
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,870
Ziye!

706
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,240
Ziye!

707
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,000
Shuang Hong.

708
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,510
I’m here.

709
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,880
I’m here, Chief.

710
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,490
Granny.

711
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,990
What's wrong with me?

712
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,750
You...

713
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,960
You fainted in the library.

714
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,560
You scared us to death.

715
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,710
Ziye.

716
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,310
You promised me

717
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,630
you wouldn't overexert yourself.

718
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,560
How could you...

719
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,100
It's fine.

720
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,590
I just fell asleep while

721
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,110
reading the books.

722
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,390
You almost died,

723
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,560
yet you're still so stubborn.

724
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,790
You're here too?

725
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,990
I’m fine.

726
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,750
Chief!

727
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,200
I’ll ask the medicine hut to make medicine for you.

728
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,670
Just prescribe the one

729
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,990
I usually take.

730
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm afraid it's not enough.

731
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,630
This is a serious matter.

732
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,870
Then,

733
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,700
let's add 25 grams of aconite.

734
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,980
Aconite is extremely strong.

735
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,590
How can your weak body

736
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,760
stand it?

737
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,200
Let's remove the anemarrhena asphodeloides.

738
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,450
Instead, add 15 grams of cinnamon

739
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,110
and 30 grams of lily, okay?

740
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,860
Fine.

741
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,590
Add in the guilingji tablet

742
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,430
and it should be enough.

743
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:36,950
Yes.

744
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,110
Well,

745
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,440
Mr. Huo, please take her

746
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,930
to the medicine hut.

747
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,790
Leave it to me.

748
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,310
I'm fine.

749
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't act tough.

750
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,810
Here. Slowly.

751
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,870
I'm fine now.

752
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,110
Go back to work.

753
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:24,670
By the way.

754
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,400
Shuang Hong,

755
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,210
help me bring

756
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,610
more medical books here.

757
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,110
But Chief…

758
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:31,640
Chief...

759
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,750
Stop reading.

760
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,190
Stop...

761
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,630
Go.

762
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:40,980
No.

763
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,750
Do you need anything?

764
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,230
This is tea.

765
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,410
It's sweet.

766
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,670
The medicine is bitter.

767
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,620
Have some.

768
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,340
You really forget the pain after you recover.

769
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,190
Do you really think

770
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,270
you're immortal?

771
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,180
What else do you want?

772
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,560
You woman.

773
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,710
You're so ungrateful.

774
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,070
Go back and rest.

775
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:47,450
You...

776
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,440
Look at me.
