1
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,289
She and I reached an agreement.

2
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
When Laughing at the World is ready,

3
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,970
I'll go back to drink with her.

4
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,160
It seems you and I are alike.

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
We both have someone we love.

6
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,160
What do you plan to do

7
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
when this is over?

8
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
Why don't you go back to Guazhou Town with me

9
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,240
and be neighbors

10
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
with me and your sister-in-law?

11
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
They'll run a clinic together.

12
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
We'll farm

13
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,250
and fish together.

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
It's indeed an idyllic life.

15
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,030
But I don't know

16
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,820
if it's the life she wants.

17
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,520
She has a cold disease.

18
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,090
She can't go too far.

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,140
I'm afraid her body can't take it.

20
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,850
Then you...

21
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,560
I will return to the Apothecary Valley

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,930
and stay by her side.

23
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,840
I hope

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,960
on every year's Mid-Autumn Festival,

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
I can go to the market

26
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,360
and enjoy fireworks with her.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,710
I hope I can witness

28
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,400
every blossom of the epiphyllum with her.

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,530
Every time it snows,

30
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,400
the sun goes down, and the moon rises,

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,660
I hope I can be with her,

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
waiting for the moon,

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,410
listening to the sound of snow,

34
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,640
and drinking Laughing at the World

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,040
under the plum tree.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
That day will come.

37
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,910
It will.

38
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,280
All right.

39
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,560
Have a drink with me

40
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,480
or go back to rest early.

41
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,310
Okay.

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll go back to sleep.

43
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Remember to bury a pot of Laughing at the World

44
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,270
under the plum tree.

45
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Let's drink together when I'm back.

46
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll surely beat you.

47
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,870
Wait for me.

48
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,750
Huo Zhanbai.

49
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,510
Sorry.

50
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,130
I can't keep my promise.

51
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,430
Ziye.

52
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,240
Actually, I think of you

53
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,070
all the time.

54
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Huo Zhanbai.

55
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,630
I miss you so much.

56
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,320
Chief Xue.

57
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,870
Chief Xue.

58
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,790
Doctrine Leader ordered me

59
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,390
to invite you to his chamber.

60
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Everything is ready.

61
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,480
Let's go.

62
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,120
No offense.

63
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
I need to check all the herbs

64
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
and tools.

65
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,080
You want to check my medicine box?

66
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm just worried

67
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,630
you still have

68
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,600
something like

69
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,730
Tenacious Needles.

70
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,870
Before you arrive

71
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,030
at his bedside,

72
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,000
I need to ensure nothing will go wrong.

73
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,270
What if I refuse?

74
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,670
Then I'm sorry.

75
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
I can't believe you.

76
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,360
If I really want

77
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,390
to poison him,

78
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
I would use something like the Soul Devouring Powder.

79
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,160
Since you don't believe me,

80
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,600
please send me back

81
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
to the Apothecary Valley immediately.

82
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,030
Chief Xue,

83
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,360
please.

84
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,670
Doctrine Leader.

85
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,240
Miao Kong,

86
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,670
guard the door later.

87
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,350
If anything happens,

88
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
come in immediately.

89
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,220
Yes, Doctrine Leader.

90
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,840
You,

91
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
stay here.

92
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,240
Yes.

93
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,320
Go.

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
Chief Xue,

95
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,840
Doctrine Leader has been waiting for you.

96
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,750
Chief Xue.

97
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,960
Okay.

98
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,390
Doctrine Leader.

99
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,110
Chief Xue,

100
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,550
you're finally here.

101
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,260
Let me check your pulse first.

102
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,870
Come on.

103
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
How is it?

104
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,030
Your illness

105
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,480
stems from improper practice of cold-natured internal skills,

106
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,320
resulting in a disturbance of your inner balance.

107
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,870
It's been a month and 17 days.

108
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,790
Your internal Chi is out of control and leaking.

109
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,790
Your Triple Burner meridians are in disarray,

110
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,670
and every acupuncture point is swollen.

111
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,070
Every midnight, it feels

112
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,200
as if thousands of needles are piercing you,

113
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,660
causing unbearable pain.

114
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,320
Am I right?

115
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,690
You're indeed a miracle-working doctor.

116
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,960
Since the onset of your illness,

117
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,720
you must have tried

118
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,920
various treatments.

119
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,360
But sadly, none of them was effective,

120
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,490
and your condition has deteriorated.

121
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,670
Tell me.

122
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,400
How long will it take to cure me?

123
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,510
You should ask

124
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,120
whether you can be cured first.

125
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,910
Is that necessary?

126
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,910
You're a miracle-working doctor from the Apothecary Valley.

127
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,240
If you can't cure me,

128
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,750
I guess my death is fated.

129
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,630
Yeah.

130
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,790
You have mastered

131
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,770
your mental technique very well.

132
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,030
In this world,

133
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
there should be

134
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,480
no other method that can harm you.

135
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,320
If it weren't for the disturbance of your inner balance,

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
I guess

137
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,910
there truly is nothing

138
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,640
that could pose a threat to you.

139
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,630
Stop beating around the bush!

140
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,270
Tell me!

141
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,080
Can you cure me or not?

142
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,670
I...

143
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,150
I can.

144
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
Okay.

145
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
I knew it.

146
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,120
You won't let me down.

147
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,080
The Apothecary Valley's medical expertise is top-notch.

148
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,670
I won't be disappointed.

149
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,240
Chief Xue,

150
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,200
let's continue.

151
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,480
Then I'll use golden needles to restore the acupuncture points

152
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,750
based on the Apothecary Valley's secret book

153
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,150
to smooth the meridians all over your body.

154
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,270
Doctrine Leader, please keep your promise.

155
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,330
After you recover,

156
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
let me out of here.

157
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,600
Chief Xue, don't worry.

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll keep my promise.

159
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay.

160
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,600
This is the Zijin Meridian Powder,

161
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
which can smooth meridians.

162
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
Please take it immediately.

163
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,360
It will take effect

164
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,550
in 15 minutes.

165
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Then I can use golden needles on you.

166
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,790
Feng.

167
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,960
This is Benzoin,

168
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,910
known for its soothing and analgesic effects.

169
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,170
Please burn it in the incense burner now.

170
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,050
Doctrine Leader, please turn around.

171
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,890
Let's get started.

172
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,400
Please relax your meridians.

173
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,090
You have to stop your inner breath.

174
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,160
Scary?

175
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,310
It's not that easy

176
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,470
to obtain this position.

177
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,350
Chief Xue,

178
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,920
let's begin.

179
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,920
Doctrine Leader is receiving treatment inside.

180
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,110
Don't

181
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,240
disturb him.

182
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Everyone, leave.

183
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,590
Leave.

184
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

185
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,480
Lastly, the acupuncture points on your spine

186
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
have been smoothed.

187
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,350
All the golden needles are ready.

188
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,070
Almost done.

189
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,680
Almost done.

190
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,550
Only one step left.

191
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,440
Done.

192
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,480
So soon?

193
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Jerk!

194
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,030
This is for

195
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,920
the villagers

196
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,130
of the Mo Family Village killed by you!

197
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,920
Feng,

198
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,110
you also...

199
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,610
Doctrine Leader, please don't kill her.

200
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,110
Do you want her to kill me?

201
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,960
No.

202
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,130
Chief Xue, you…

203
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,680
Sorry.

204
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,000
You...

205
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,720
Jerk,

206
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,550
I advise you not to use your Chi.

207
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,240
Or you'll die sooner.

208
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,480
So you've conspired with each other.

209
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,440
Yes!

210
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,550
Go to hell!

211
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,350
It's really not easy

212
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,070
to kill you.

213
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,720
Xue Ziye is responsible

214
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,310
for sealing your meridians.

215
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm responsible for finding a chance

216
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
to kill you.

217
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,550
I wanted

218
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,790
to capture Miao Feng when he was

219
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,830
about to save you.

220
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,690
But the person he wanted to save

221
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,720
was not you.

222
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,680
You deserve it.

223
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,790
The children you raised with your own hands

224
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,590
will betray you sooner or later.

225
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,030
You want him to save you?

226
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,070
He can't save you.

227
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,190
You're like a devil.

228
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,850
You should have died long ago!

229
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,070
It takes the poison of the Dragon Blood Pearl

230
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,070
to kill you!

231
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,440
Why?

232
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,830
You're asking me why?

233
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,920
You're asking me why?

234
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,000
What, Doctrine Leader?

235
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,830
Have you killed so many people in this life

236
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,020
that you can't remember clearly?

237
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,270
21 years ago,

238
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,790
Sang State was destroyed overnight

239
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,270
near Luopu.

240
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,640
Have you forgotten?

241
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,910
You are not from Yuzhou.

242
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm from Sang State.

243
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
You are...

244
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,720
Princess Shan Mi.

245
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,790
Now you remember.

246
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
My father was defeated by Yuzhou that year.

247
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,310
The people of Sang State

248
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,240
had to abandon the city and escape.

249
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,720
You took money from Yuzhou Lord.

250
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
You sent assassins, who disguised as bandits,

251
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,160
to exterminate my clan.

252
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,790
I escaped alone

253
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,830
and became a slave in a foreign land.

254
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,070
But when I was 15,

255
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,510
you bought me.

256
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
It's fate, isn't it?

257
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,750
Even God wants me to kill you!

258
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,160
For this moment,

259
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,920
I've put up with you for so many years

260
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,550
and I've suffered so much

261
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,310
hardship and torment!

262
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,150
Old jerk!

263
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,350
Today,

264
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,510
I'm going to avenge

265
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,960
the people of Sang State!

266
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,270
Remember,

267
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,030
the last thing you see before you die

268
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,600
is the smiling face of a Sang State's citizen.

269
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,550
I should have... killed you.

270
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,730
You no longer have a chance.

271
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
Old jerk.

272
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
Sister.

273
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,960
Envoy Miao Feng,

274
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,160
since Doctrine Leader is dead,

275
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,240
you don't need

276
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
to stay alive either, right?

277
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,440
Miao Shui!

278
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Miao Shui!

279
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,880
You promised me

280
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,460
you wouldn't kill him.

281
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,720
Miao Shui.

282
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,310
Chief Xue,

283
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,350
I admire your courage.

284
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,000
But your stupidity

285
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,660
makes me want to laugh!

286
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,320
You don't know martial arts.

287
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,240
What do you have to make an agreement with me?

288
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,440
An agreement is upheld

289
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,310
through power.

290
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,400
Otherwise, it would just be empty talk.

291
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Understand?

292
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,000
You...

293
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,370
And I really don't understand.

294
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,680
You already know

295
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,960
Miao Feng was the reason

296
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,160
why you fell into the icy river back then, right?

297
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Why do you want to save him?

298
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,000
He's just...

299
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,000
a sword

300
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,270
used by someone.

301
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,750
Just like you and Mingjie.

302
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,920
The target

303
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,830
of the sword

304
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,790
is decided

305
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,830
by the one holding the sword.

306
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,310
Fine.

307
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,160
I admire you.

308
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,440
But even though you don't want to kill him,

309
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,400
I will take his life.

310
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,750
No.

311
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
-Stop!
-Envoy Miao Feng.

312
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,610
Don't blame me for killing you.

313
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
If I let you live,

314
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,440
I won't have a way out.

315
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,350
At this point,

316
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,980
it would be great if we can end everything

317
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
like this.

318
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,760
What exactly is on your mind?

319
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,110
After I die,

320
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,640
can you let Chief Xue go?

321
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
She's not a threat to you.

322
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,920
If you need a doctor

323
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,000
in the future...

324
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,850
I really don't understand you two.

325
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,440
You're going to die,

326
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,640
but you're still defending each other.

327
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,720
Feng,

328
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
how come I never knew

329
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,730
besides Doctrine Leader,

330
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,030
there is another person

331
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,960
in this world

332
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,310
you care about so much?

333
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Please let her go.

334
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll be grateful.

335
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,510
It depends...

336
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,000
on my mood.

337
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,510
Ya Mi!

338
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,950
What did you call him?

339
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
What did you call him?

340
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,480
Ya Mi.

341
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,680
That's his real name.

342
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,720
Miao Feng?

343
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,270
Impossible.

344
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Impossible.

345
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,830
You're not Ya Mi.

346
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,550
How could you be Ya Mi?

347
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,830
Impossible.

348
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,310
My brother is very timid.

349
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,000
He...

350
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,960
He can't even hold a sword well.

351
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
He's so timid.

352
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
How could he become

353
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,200
a killer like you?

354
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,000
You're not him.

355
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,060
You're not him.

356
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,630
I accepted the enemy as my father

357
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,840
and helped him do bad things.

358
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,960
Sister, I ignored

359
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
your suffering.

360
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
At this point,

361
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,980
why bother to reunite?

362
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,550
Yes.

363
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,590
Ya Mi did die a long time ago.

364
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,200
I lied to you.

365
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,750
Watch out!

366
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,090
Sister, watch out!

367
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,920
Ya Mi!

368
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,920
Ya Mi!

369
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,270
Ya Mi!

370
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,270
Ya Mi!

371
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,070
Ya Mi! Ya Mi!

372
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,140
My brother.

373
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,790
I didn't recognize you earlier.

374
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,480
Ya Mi!

375
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Don't move.

376
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,640
Let me see.

377
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,550
It's been more than 20 years.

378
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,310
I raised you and taught you.

379
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,440
In the end,

380
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,630
you both want me to die,

381
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,960
right?

382
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,440
Fine.

383
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,750
Kids,

384
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,200
die with me!

385
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Miao Shui.

386
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,790
Miao Shui!

387
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,680
Sister!

388
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,240
You...

389
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,400
Ya Mi.

390
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,790
Ya Mi!

391
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,960
No.

392
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,550
Chief Xue.

393
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,150
Ya Mi.

394
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,280
Don't...

395
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,690
Don't do anything stupid.

396
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,510
Ya Mi.

397
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,590
Just now,

398
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,070
you and your sister refused to reunite

399
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,560
because you were thinking for each other.

400
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,030
Now she's gone.

401
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,920
Maybe to her,

402
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,480
it's a way to break free.

403
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,110
You...

404
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,550
You should stay alive.

405
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,480
I want to go down there

406
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,610
to collect her body.

407
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,230
Leave here first.

408
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,310
Come back to collect her body

409
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,190
when the time is right.

410
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
What your sister wanted the most

411
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,710
is that you

412
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,030
can leave here safely.

413
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,280
You already know

414
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,670
I was the one who made you

415
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,200
and Xuehuai fall into the icy river back then.

416
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,190
Why did you save me?

417
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,980
I spent a lot of time

418
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,670
thinking about it.

419
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,920
If you really wanted

420
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,920
to kill that carter,

421
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,590
you wouldn't have given him

422
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,840
an ingot of silver.

423
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,110
You just knocked him out.

424
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,630
Right?

425
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Chief Xue.

426
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,890
The Soul Devouring Powder?

427
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,840
You transferred the Soul Devouring Powder

428
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,040
from Eye to yourself!

429
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,220
You've always been aware of Eye's identity?

430
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,440
He's my brother.

431
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,830
You were Chang Wujue's pawn,

432
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,190
just like Mingjie.

433
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,370
The one who should be blamed

434
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,110
is the player.

435
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,430
I told you I would protect you.

436
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,800
But I...

437
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,880
But…

438
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,670
Chief Xue!

439
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,840
I've regained

440
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,320
all my power?

441
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,030
Chief Xue.

442
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,110
The Apothecary Valley.

443
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,960
The Apothecary Valley.

444
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,560
The Apothecary Valley.

445
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,920
The Apothecary Valley.

446
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,580
I'm going to send you back now.

447
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,840
Bad news!

448
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,950
Doctrine Leader is dead!

449
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,230
Doctrine Leader is dead?

450
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,510
-Doctrine Leader is dead?
-Doctrine Leader...

451
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,370
-Miao Feng!
-Doctrine Leader...

452
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,760
Miao Kong.

453
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Doctrine Leader is dead.

454
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,630
The palace will surely be in chaos.

455
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,070
You stay and take charge of the overall situation.

456
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,930
What about you?

457
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,670
I need to send Chief Xue back

458
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,330
to the Apothecary Valley now.

459
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,210
Get out of my way!

460
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,510
Let them go.

461
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,030
It's good that you want to leave.

462
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,890
It can save trouble for both of us.

463
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,150
Chief Xue.

464
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,730
Are you feeling better?

465
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,510
Don't worry.

466
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,710
We're about to arrive at Yueya Vale soon.

467
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,510
Hang in there.

468
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,420
We can arrive at the Apothecary Valley soon!

469
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,190
Miao Kong?

470
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,560
What are you doing here?

471
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,710
I'm here to make a deal with you.

472
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,760
There's nothing

473
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,160
to talk about between us.

474
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,390
Chang Wujue is dead.

475
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,960
How did he die?

476
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,880
Miao Feng, Miao Shui,

477
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,280
and Chief Xue

478
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,810
from the Apothecary Valley

479
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,480
killed him together.

480
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,000
Chief Xue?

481
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,190
Where is she?

482
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,570
She has left the palace safely.

483
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,150
Chang Wujue is dead.

484
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,240
I will help you become the Doctrine Leader.

485
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,230
What?

486
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,230
Are you not interested in being

487
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,760
the Doctrine Leader just because

488
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,400
you failed once?

489
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,550
What is your condition?

490
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,190
Help me get rid of the Seven Swords.

491
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,920
After it's done, we'll dominate the martial world together.

492
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
I want to be

493
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,360
Sword Sect's chief.

494
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,590
Sword Sect?

495
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,320
Who on earth are you?

496
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,740
I'm Envoy Miao Kong of the Yuan Yi Palace.

497
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm also

498
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,050
the sixth disciple of Sword Sect.

499
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,810
You're the sixth disciple of Sword Sect,

500
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,480
Xu Chonghua?

501
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
I haven't heard

502
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,110
of this name for a long time.

503
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,440
Why should I trust you?

504
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,070
The Seven Swords of Sword Sect

505
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,630
are on their way here.

506
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,070
They will not let you go.

507
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,190
Collaborating with me

508
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,030
is your best choice now.

509
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
The Seven Swords?

510
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,570
Huo Zhanbai, right?

511
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,880
You hold a deep grudge against Huo Zhanbai.

512
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,590
You've always wanted to kill him, right?

513
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,760
But

514
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,480
his life

515
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,710
is mine.

516
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,360
Why do you want to kill him?

517
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,880
That is between me and him.

518
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,440
I can't tell you.

519
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,920
Anyway,

520
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,440
when the Seven Swords arrive here,

521
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,210
I need you to use your Eye Magic

522
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,070
to help me.

523
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,360
Okay.

524
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Deal.

525
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,210
There is someone ahead!

526
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,360
I think it's Five Sages from the Yuan Yi Palace.

527
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,560
It's Envoy Miao Feng!

528
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,510
Stop him!

529
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,590
The Spring Breeze mental technique.

530
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,850
Be careful, everyone!

531
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:31,800
Be careful!
