[Episode 23]

4
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,780
Trust me.

5
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,009
I can't trust you.

6
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
I only trust myself.

7
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,350
Is your chief inside?

8
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,120
Chief

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,180
is resting inside.

10
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,460
Have a good rest first.

11
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,350
Chief Xue.

12
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,000
Shuang Hong.

13
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,670
Keep an eye on the medicine for me.

14
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,070
Okay.

15
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,120
What?

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,950
What brings you here?

17
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,670
Chief Xue,

18
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,320
I've almost recovered.

19
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,290
I want to have a drink with you.

20
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,390
Now?

21
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,470
Before I leave.

22
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,550
Mo's illness can't be delayed any longer.

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,550
I should set out.

24
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,410
You just recovered.

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,620
If you leave now,

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,030
your wounds will open up.

27
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,230
Stay for observation for two more days.

28
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,070
The day after tomorrow,

29
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,670
Mo's medicine will be ready.

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,070
If you go southward as fast as you can,

31
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,150
he can take the medicine

32
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,110
within a month.

33
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,190
Unknowingly,

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,680
eight years have passed.

35
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,630
Thank you.

36
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,350
For what?

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,030
Thank you

38
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,320
for saving Mo

39
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,150
and me.

40
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,110
This is Sword Sect's token.

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,270
Take it.

42
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,510
I know it's not Eye's intention

43
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,350
to kill people or do bad things.

44
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,360
But others may not be able to accept it.

45
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,430
With this token,

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,970
at least the people of Sword Sect

47
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,430
won't give him a hard time.

48
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,290
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

49
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm not close to him.

50
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,030
I'm willing to protect him

51
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,420
just because

52
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,120
he is your younger brother.

53
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,870
Was he the one in the medicine hut

54
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,990
just now?

55
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,390
He's weak.

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,150
I was treating him.

57
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,790
I'm still wary of him.

58
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,230
After I leave,

59
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,909
you should be more cautious.

60
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,590
Mingjie.

61
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,790
Mingjie?

62
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,310
Where is

63
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,720
the Dragon Blood Pearl?

64
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,470
You actually hurt

65
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,430
your own meridians to break the blood seal

66
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,690
of the Conception and Governor vessels.

67
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll ask you one last time.

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,990
Where is

69
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,840
the Dragon Blood Pearl?

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,880
If you act like this,

71
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,810
how can I give you the Dragon Blood Pearl?

72
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,190
Let me go.

73
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,110
I'll give it to you.

74
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,070
Cut the crap!

75
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,720
I told you I don't trust you.

76
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,430
If you don't trust me,

77
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,510
you can't get the Dragon Blood Pearl.

78
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,270
Just

79
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,000
cut the crap!

80
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,630
I'll kill you.

81
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,630
If you can be happy

82
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,000
and won't return

83
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,320
to the Yuan Yi Palace after killing me,

84
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,230
just do it.

85
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

86
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,750
You can't do it?

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
Let me help you.

88
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,340
I'd like to see

89
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,910
if my Brother Mingjie

90
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,310
has the guts

91
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,240
to kill me today.

92
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,680
You're Eye, the best killer of the Yuan Yi Palace.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,920
You can't even kill

94
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,590
a defenseless woman?

95
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,670
Do it!

96
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,710
Kill me!

97
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,870
Kill me.

98
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,390
I'm right here.

99
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,260
Do it.

100
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,310
Why?

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,690
Why are you not afraid of death?

102
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,640
Death?

103
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,560
Having lived this long,

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,060
I'm no longer afraid of anything.

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,950
I hope you

106
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,430
won't live in darkness

107
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,160
and can live well.

108
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,910
Mingjie.

109
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,030
Foolish!

110
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,320
Do you know what I've been through

111
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,650
over the past few years?

112
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,910
Xuehuai.

113
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,370
In the Asura Field,

114
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,130
I was defeated and humiliated

115
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,400
again and again.

116
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,590
I tried so hard to survive,

117
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,550
but I could only kneel in front of Doctrine Leader

118
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,750
and let him humiliate me

119
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,030
by treating me like a dog with a pat on my head.

120
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,750
Why?

121
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,240
Why must

122
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,730
living people feel it all,

123
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,210
but you can rest in peace

124
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,040
here?

125
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,710
Mingjie from Mo Family Village is dead.

126
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,870
From today onwards,

127
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,310
these memories will have nothing to do with me.

128
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,080
Leaving in the middle of the night?

129
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,060
Xue Ziye.

130
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,860
Xue Ziye.

131
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,790
T-This is

132
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,120
the Dragon Blood Pearl?

133
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,240
Legend has it that

134
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,720
it can kill the Demon God.

135
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,830
With this,

136
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,040
Doctrine Leader will die for sure.

137
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,930
Since we've got it,

138
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,040
we can leave now.

139
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,870
You killed the chief?

140
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,670
No.

141
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,470
Why not?

142
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,620
This is not like you.

143
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,550
To avoid being noticed

144
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,300
by the people of the Yuan Yi Palace,

145
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
we'll split up.

146
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,030
After you go back,

147
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,360
go to Miao Shui first

148
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,750
to learn about the recent situation.

149
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
We'll meet later.

150
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay.

151
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,390
He was so cruel.

152
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,110
If the wound were any deeper,

153
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,710
it could cost Chief her life.

154
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,750
Stupid woman.

155
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,790
You go out first.

156
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,370
Help Granny keep an eye on Mo's medicine.

157
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

158
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
He lied to you.

159
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,130
Why didn't you tell me?

160
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,080
Were you worried that I would kill him?

161
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,150
Who is he?

162
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,430
The best assassin from the Asura Field

163
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,630
of the Yuan Yi Palace.

164
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,290
Do you really think past bonds matter to him?

165
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,260
If you really died,

166
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,460
you wouldn't even know how it happened.

167
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,910
With his temper,

168
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,470
he could have killed me.

169
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,070
But he didn't.

170
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,910
He didn't.

171
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,910
Because he left in a hurry

172
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,820
and his sword missed its mark.

173
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,230
He's the best assassin of the Yuan Yi Palace.

174
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,070
Killing me

175
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,750
is as easy as killing an ant

176
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,470
for him.

177
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,950
But why didn't he kill me?

178
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,200
Why don't you understand?

179
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,870
He's regained

180
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,870
all his memories,

181
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,270
but he still left.

182
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,390
That means the past

183
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,120
doesn't matter to him anymore.

184
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,910
He doesn't want to go back to being Mingjie.

185
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,910
Maybe he can't go back at all.

186
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,890
He didn't kill you.

187
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,080
That can only prove there's still

188
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
a trace of conscience in him.

189
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,630
That's all.

190
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,590
That's enough.

191
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,470
Fine.

192
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,830
Since you said so,

193
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,510
please take it easy.

194
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,280
Don't be so sad about this, okay?

195
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,470
He saved me.

196
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,160
He's my only family.

197
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,160
I can't leave him behind anymore.

198
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,470
All right.

199
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,910
Since he has left,

200
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,230
it means he has decided to go back

201
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,290
to the Yuan Yi Palace to be an assassin

202
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,120
and return to the bloody martial world

203
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,840
to continue to fight

204
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,730
instead of staying here

205
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,330
and trying to accept his past.

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
You said it yourself.

207
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,820
He chose the path.

208
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,470
You can't stop him.

209
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,650
Actually, I hid it from you

210
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,750
not just because I was worried

211
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,810
you would kill him.

212
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,760
Then what's the reason?

213
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,190
Because I betrayed your trust.

214
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,810
The Dragon Blood Pearl was taken away by Mingjie.

215
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,390
I've always failed you.

216
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,910
Go to the cold spring with me.

217
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,800
Looks like he did come here

218
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,720
before he left.

219
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,970
♫How many obstacles must one overcome in life?♫

220
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,010
♫Love is the hardest obstacle of all♫

221
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,510
Xuehuai,

222
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,620
♫We're like a lonely sail in the vast world♫

223
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,110
I failed to make Mingjie stay.

224
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,720
He went back to that horrible place again.

225
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,820
♫Drifting always, looking for the shore♫

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,510
♫We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountains♫

227
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,100
♫Why fear the coldness of fate?♫

228
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,250
♫If the night is lonely, I will be the lamp♫

229
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,970
♫And light up the rest of our lives♫

230
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,270
♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

231
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,570
♫The past is like an unbearable illusion, yet I remain resolute♫

232
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,170
♫Toasts exchanged, how many nights has snow fallen?♫

233
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,860
♫The past fades with the dimming night♫

234
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,050
♫A lifetime with one person and one heart, all for a fleeting warmth♫

235
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,930
♫Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memories♫

236
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,990
♫Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of life♫

237
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:51,030
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

238
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,510
♫Bid farewell in the first wasteland♫

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,350
♫Only with flaws can it be considered complete♫

♫Bloom or wither, the snow is like me♫

241
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,580
♫Both fearless and brilliant♫

♫Whether it's fate or calamity, entangled in destiny♫

♫Bit by bit, day by day, year by year, fragments of memories♫

248
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,350
It's already midnight.

249
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Let's go back.

250
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,680
♫Gatherings, separations, joy and sorrow, the myriad facets of life♫

251
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:08,270
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

252
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,230
Thank you.

253
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,290
It was all thanks to you this time.

254
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,030
Your body has frozen.

255
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,400
♫A branch moves, dancing with the wind♫

256
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,630
♫The moonlight shines thousands of miles to fill the wilderness♫

257
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,690
♫I've traveled all over the world to capture it in a poem♫

258
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,780
♫The brush stops, leaving a lone person leaning against a plum tree♫

259
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:32,760
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

260
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,770
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

261
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,920
When you find out

262
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,550
the prescription

263
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,470
with rare herbs

264
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,460
from eight years ago

265
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:46,780
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

266
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,950
still can't save Mo,

267
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,950
will you still

268
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,110
treat me so well?

269
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,600
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

270
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,980
In the future,

271
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,010
how should I face you?

272
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,550
Mo's medicine

273
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,550
will be ready tomorrow.

274
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,670
You've fully recovered.

275
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,750
You can leave

276
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,080
the day after tomorrow.

277
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,670
Okay.

278
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,360
Have a good rest.

279
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,680
Rejuvenate your spirit before you leave.

280
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,760
Huo Zhanbai.

281
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:43,100
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

282
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:50,110

♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

285
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,890
What's the matter?

286
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,070
You once said

287
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,420
after you got the Dragon Blood Pearl and came back,

288
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,100
I could tell you what I want.

289
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,870
Of course.

290
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,600
I want to see the aurora.

291
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,730
You owed me

292
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,120
a wish years ago.

293
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,330
Can you go with me?

294
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,470
Of course.

295
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,770
Even if you didn't ask,

296
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,300
I will go with you.

297
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,850
Have you made up your mind?

298
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,430
Are you really going to use the opportunity?

299
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,680
Yes.

300
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,190
Okay.

301
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,470
Okay.

302
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,530
Be careful.

303
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,030
We're going up the mountain soon.

304
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,760
Can you do it?

305
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,030
Yes.

306
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,010
Be careful.

307
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,570
Follow my footprints.

308
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,920
Why have you stopped suddenly?

309
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,200
Why were you laughing just now?

310
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,570
I was laughing because you

311
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,120
have unparalleled martial arts skills

312
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,100
and have always left

313
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,030
no trace

314
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,570
and been carefree.

315
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,350
But now, you're leaving

316
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,750
such clumsy footprints.

317
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,540
In life,

318
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,010
many things

319
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,850
inevitably leave traces.

320
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,390
Leaving traces

321
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,030
can help us remember.

322
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,000
Otherwise,

323
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,990
it would be like this snowy wilderness,

324
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,590
vast and blanketed in white,

325
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,860
buried

326
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,550
and hidden.

327
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,130
When the sun rises and the snow melts,

328
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,800
won't those many things

329
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,910
seem as if

330
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,110
they never occurred?

331
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,040
Time flows by swiftly,

332
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,150
but many things

333
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,710
are as transient as dew.

334
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,030
Sometimes,

335
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,630
forgetting might actually be a good thing.

336
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,530
We should hurry up.

337
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,510
The mountain path is becoming steeper.

338
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,770
I don't know when we can reach the summit.

339
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
Wait a minute.

340
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,830
Take this.

341
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,990
It'll be easier for you to walk.

342
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,110
Let's go that way.

343
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,310
That way?

344
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,510
We'll make a detour if we go that way.

345
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,790
Aren't you in a hurry?

346
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,710
I don't come out frequently.

347
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,000
So why don't I take my time and enjoy the journey?

348
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,410
Listen to me this time.

349
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,030
You have a cold disease.

350
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,630
You can't travel far.

351
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,620
I've explored this path.

352
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,110
If we go a bit further,

353
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,310
we can see the aurora.

354
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,680
It also has the shortest round-trip time.

355
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,270
It's just that

356
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,930
the path is a bit challenging.

357
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,390
It's fine.

358
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,930
I'll listen to you.

359
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,560
Let's go.

360
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,430
It started to snow suddenly.

361
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
I wonder if we

362
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,960
can see the aurora.

363
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,470
The weather in the mountain is very changeable.

364
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,430
Maybe it won't be snowing when we reach the summit.

365
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,340
We will see it.

366
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,230
Okay.

367
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,150
Hang in there.

368
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,640
The stars in the sky,

369
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,100
when connected together,

370
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,030
are like a hunter

371
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,960
drawing a bow and nocking an arrow.

372
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,110
The three stars in alignment

373
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,390
mark the location of Alnitak.

374
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,950
Are they

375
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,120
the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity?

376
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,170
Seeing those three stars aligned

377
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,730
is an auspicious sign.

378
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,810
Although we can't see the aurora,

379
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,430
we saw a starry sky.

380
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,700
I've never seen

381
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,710
such a brilliant starry sky before.

382
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,070
Why don't we

383
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,420
drink together

384
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,550
under the stars tonight?

385
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,470
What do you think?

386
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,510
You're well-prepared.

387
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,630
Of course.

388
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,760
I told you I'd take good care of you.

389
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,610
Come on.

390
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,790
I remember

391
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,590
when I first entered the valley,

392
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,510
I accidentally went to the cold spring

393
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,710
because of drinking.

394
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,520
At that time,

395
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,060
you wouldn't even

396
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,870
say a single extra word to me.

397
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,290
After I took back the Seven-Leaf Fungus,

398
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,270
I got to drink

399
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,770
Laughing at the World for the first time.

400
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,690
♫As the wind blows and the snow falls, the scent of plum blossoms sighs♫

401
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,110
It's just that...

402
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,370
It's just that you drank it on credit.

403
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,230
You had to pay your debts.

404
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,580
♫You nestle close, your whisper slow and tender♫

405
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,210
I learned a few tricks,

406
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,920
which came in handy

407
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,960
when I was in Yangzhou.

408
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:19,830
♫In the shadow, the stories of the heart remain untold♫

409
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,910
After I returned to the valley from Yangzhou,

410
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,230
we truly drank together

411
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,290
for the first time.

412
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,350
Am I right?

413
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,950
Is that so?

414
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,760
♫The bright moon in clouds reminds me of yesteryear♫

415
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,470
Of course.

416
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,870
I was lying under the plum tree in a daze.

417
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,100
♫Drifting like smoke, I journey into the long night♫

418
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,310
It seemed I heard someone saying

419
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,840
she wanted to drink with me.

420
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,310
Was that you?

421
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:38,070
♫In so deep, I'm trapped in the whirlpool of fate♫

422
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,910
I'm afraid you were drunk

423
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,770
and had a dream.

424
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,580
Then

425
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,030
who got drunk a few days ago

426
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,150
and threw pastries at me?

427
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,480
♫In this world, light takes your form♫

428
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,160
♫Following your direction, together we tread this path♫

429
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,860
It's been so many years.

430
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,110
You still remember everything.

431
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,430
♫Joy and tears blurred the line between love and hate♫

432
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,590
All these years,

433
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:01,540
♫Eyes reddened, love etched on the heart♫

434
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,590
I've kept the taste

435
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,890
of every drink in my heart.

436
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,070
Come on.

437
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,710
You haven't drunk

438
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
too much today.

439
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,000
But why do I feel you seem drunk?

440
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,810
In terms of getting drunk,

441
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,830
you won't get drunk if you don't want to.

442
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,700
But if you want yourself

443
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,670
to get drunk,

444
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,210
you'll get drunk soon.

445
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,040
What's so strange about it?

446
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,320
Then why do you want to get drunk today?

447
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,430
I got drunk from the beginning.

448
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,680
That's why I came here

449
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,360
to see the aurora with you.

450
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,670
What?

451
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,560
Do you regret it?

452
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,900
I regret coming here

453
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,900
only to miss the aurora.

454
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,230
Although we didn't see it this time,

455
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,630
there will be a next time.

456
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,770
There's plenty of time ahead.

457
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,710
Yes.

458
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,150
There will be a next time.

459
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,090
As long as you still welcome me to the valley,

460
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,630
I'll traverse mountains and rivers

461
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,270
to come back

462
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,730
to see the aurora with you.

463
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,960
You're so shameless.

464
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,410
Who needs your company?

465
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,910
The weather here is changeable at night.

466
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,350
Why don't we

467
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,280
go back early?

468
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,040
I'm worried about your health.

469
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,290
I want to wait a little longer.

470
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,030
Okay.

471
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,420
Then let's wait a little longer.

472
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,670
Let's go back.

473
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,030
What?

474
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,370
You don't want to wait?

475
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,670
No.

476
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,590
Didn't you say

477
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,210
you would see it with me next time?

478
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,660
Okay.

479
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,700
I'll keep my promise.

480
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,000
Don't move.

481
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,830
Come on.

482
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,970
It's been eight years.

483
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,870
You're finally going to find out the truth.

484
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,030
Don't you feel cold waiting for me here?

485
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,050
I'm not like you, a fool.

486
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,590
When I feel cold,

487
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,770
I would warm myself.

488
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,240
So you really are waiting for me?

489
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,030
I'm going to leave.

490
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,290
Can't you say something nice?

491
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,110
You've known me long enough.

492
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,370
This is Mo's medicine?

493
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,750
What?

494
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,770
You're reluctant to give it to me?

495
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,250
-Actually...
-Actually,

496
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,440
all these years,

497
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,190
you've been trying your best

498
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,150
to keep Mo alive.

499
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,840
You've done enough.

500
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,570
I thank you on behalf of my junior.

501
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,690
After the medicine is delivered,

502
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,770
you should settle down

503
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,330
to have a good rest.

504
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,130
The medicine is in the wooden box.

505
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,350
You must carry it with you all the time.

506
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,510
Remember,

507
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,430
you must go to Guazhou

508
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,860
through Yangzhou.

509
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,770
After you arrive in Yangzhou,

510
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,360
remember to open the box.

511
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,750
After you open it,

512
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,600
you can go back to Guazhou.

513
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,190
Okay.

514
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,390
Got it.

515
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,310
You can't open it before you arrive in Yangzhou

516
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,910
or after you leave Yangzhou.

517
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,230
Okay. Okay.

518
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,630
I promise I won't open it

519
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,630
until I arrive in Yangzhou.

520
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,510
Okay?

521
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,710
The Fate-Reversal Token...

522
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,830
-I'll return it to you
-Return it to me

523
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,760
-after Mo fully recovers.
-after Mo fully recovers.

524
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,270
Go now.

525
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Do you still remember

526
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,010
what you promised me under the plum tree?

527
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,330
What did I promise you?

528
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
After Mo fully recovers,

529
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,190
I'll come back to the Apothecary Valley to live here permanently

530
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,320
and do odds and ends.

531
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,400
I was too drunk that day.

532
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,710
I don't remember.

533
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,030
What?

534
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,510
You want to break your promise?

535
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,310
I didn't really

536
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,510
promise you that day.

537
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,550
But I've gotten used

538
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,480
to drinking Laughing at the World.

539
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,440
If I can't drink it anymore,

540
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,410
I will feel very regretful in the future.

541
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,600
Without Laughing at the World,

542
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,160
you can try new wine.

543
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,570
When you get used to it,

544
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,140
you won't

545
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,340
think of Laughing at the World anymore.

546
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:41,110
♫A cup of wine, a toast to the world, as wind and snow knock on the door♫

547
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,790
Looks like you

548
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,510
really don't welcome me

549
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,640
back to the Apothecary Valley.

550
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:48,210
♫Sigh for love and hate, leaving no trace upon the palm♫

551
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,110
Have you really taken this place

552
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,020
as an inn?

553
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,230
You think you can come and go

554
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:47,890
as you like?

555
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,110
This is not your home.

556
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:54,970
♫Life drifts like dust, when will we meet again?♫

557
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,930
Although it's not my home,

558
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,750
it's better than my home.

559
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:01,600
♫From vibrant warmth to icy cold, it's just a single turn away♫

560
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:08,820
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

561
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,430
You're so shameless.

562
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,660
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

563
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,690
I'll take that as a yes.

564
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,590
I didn't...

565
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,350
It's too late

566
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,360
to change your mind now.

567
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,800
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

568
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,430
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

569
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,730
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

570
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:42,930
♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

571
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,000
♫I give my remaining years, how could I ever break free?♫

572
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,710
Remember to bury a pot of Laughing at the World

573
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:57,220
♫Love falls like silent snow, sweeping away lost souls♫

574
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,160
under the plum tree.

575
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,990
Let's drink together when I'm back.

576
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,710
I'll surely beat you.
