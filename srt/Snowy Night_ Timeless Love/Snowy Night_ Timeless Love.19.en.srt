[Episode 19]

4
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,350
Take off your mask.

5
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,070
What a pity.

6
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,470
You're indeed ugly.

7
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,579
From now on,

8
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,550
I will be at your command.

9
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,550
I will do anything

10
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,350
for you.

11
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,700
Sixth Brother!

12
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,090
Take good care of Qiushui and Mo!

13
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,200
From now on,

14
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,300
I'll leave Qiushui and Mo

15
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,020
to you.

16
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,590
Chonghua,

17
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,490
working undercover in the Yuan Yi Palace

18
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,890
is extremely dangerous.

19
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
And all the martial artists

20
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,710
will consider you a traitor.

21
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,840
Have you really made up your mind?

22
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,470
The Yuan Yi Palace has hidden

23
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,130
in West Kunlun for many years,

24
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,070
but in recent years,

25
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,709
they have frequently appeared in the Central Plains

26
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,070
and committed many crimes.

27
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,550
They seem poised to launch a counteroffensive against the Central Plains.

28
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,390
As the leader

29
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,790
of the righteous sects,

30
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,840
Sword Sect should take the lead

31
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,510
in protecting the world.

32
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,790
It's our unshirkable responsibility.

33
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,760
But your Mo

34
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,990
was born not long ago.

35
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,450
Chief, you worry too much.

36
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,150
I know

37
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,110
what to do.

38
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,780
You must carefully weigh your choices

39
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,550
and the gains and losses they entail.

40
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,630
Compared to the warmth of family bonds

41
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,590
between husband and wife and father and son,

42
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,070
ambition and achievements

43
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,930
-are not necessarily...
-Chief,

44
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,200
I have made up my mind.

45
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,250
No need to persuade me again.

46
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,050
In this life,

47
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,950
my only goal is to help Sword Sect

48
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,150
get rid of the evil

49
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,830
and set an example for juniors and seniors.

50
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,040
I will make great achievements

51
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,710
and not be held back by personal feelings.

52
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,490
I've worked undercover for eight years.

53
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,790
Now I'm getting closer and closer to Chang Wujue.

54
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,430
I'll be able to kill him soon.

55
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,670
The position of chief

56
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,370
will also be within reach.

57
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,750
The new Miao Kong just took office

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,510
and no one is keeping watch.

59
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,510
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come out to see you.

60
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,770
Let me make this clear.

61
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,550
Even though you helped me,

62
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,840
I won't thank...

63
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,690
I'll remember your kindness.

64
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,950
I'll repay you in the future.

65
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,470
But don't try to threaten me

66
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,270
with it.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,460
I don't need your gratitude.

68
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,040
Then why did you help me?

69
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,470
Because...

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,920
we share the same thought.

71
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,230
What...

72
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,080
What did you say?

73
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,120
What do you want?

74
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,630
I'm afraid

75
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,810
you've thought

76
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,290
about what I want countless times.

77
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,530
Don't even think about dragging me into this.

78
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,840
I-I'm quite satisfied

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,650
with being Envoy Miao Huo.

80
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,630
What could I think about?

81
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:43,990
Huh?

82
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,720
You know it clearly.

83
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,230
This time,

84
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,890
if I hadn't helped you,

85
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,940
you would have been eaten

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,870
by the mastiffs.

87
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,000
You survived this time.

88
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,430
What about next time?

89
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,830
In the eyes of Doctrine Leader,

90
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,160
is there any difference

91
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,010
between us and those animals?

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,470
If we obey his orders,

93
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,470
he'll give us meat.

94
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,880
If we accomplish our missions,

95
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,190
we'll be rewarded.

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,650
If one day, we make a slight mistake

97
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,400
and go against his will,

98
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,630
we'll die tragically

99
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,190
as long as he gives the order.

100
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Even if you leave now,

101
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,400
he'll hunt you down till the end of the world.

102
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,190
You and I

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,870
will forever live

104
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,820
in the shadow of the Yuan Yi Palace,

105
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,190
filled with fear

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,920
and never basking in the sun.

107
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,909
We could die

108
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,970
anytime.

109
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,230
Even if I'll die,

110
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,200
I don't want

111
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,159
to spend my life on my knees forever

112
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,960
or live worse than pigs or dogs.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,480
Make your choice.

114
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,750
What if I disagree

115
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,990
and betray you

116
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,360
in a bid to claim credit?

117
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,680
Then next year,

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,700
no one will help you with the assessment.

119
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,000
Listen to me.

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,950
We can't just...

121
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,030
We can't just rebel

122
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,180
against him rashly.

123
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,340
Do you have a plan?

124
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,450
I'm in charge of the Asura Field.

125
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,430
I have my own plan.

126
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,590
I think

127
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,010
this matter needs further consideration.

128
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,790
F-Further consideration?

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,360
Tell me something.

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
What you just said

131
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,730
is meaningless.

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,559
You are everywhere.

133
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,750
Miao Shui.

134
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,070
When did you come?

135
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,600
Did you hear anything?

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,190
So what if I heard it?

137
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,910
And so what if I didn't?

138
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,160
Whether you heard it or not,

139
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,830
you can't leave here today.

140
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,230
You want to kill Chang Wujue.

141
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,990
Count me in.

142
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,170
How... How...

143
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,070
How could you

144
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,990
say something like that?

145
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,890
Do you want to start a rebellion?

146
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,950
Do you want to die?

147
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,340
You are not the only ones in the palace

148
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,710
who want to rebel against him.

149
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,190
But everyone is a coward.

150
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,110
Just like you.

151
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,430
We're afraid of Chang Wujue,

152
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,160
so we should rebel against him.

153
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,910
You're incompetent.

154
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,910
You're not like them.

155
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,210
You are more ambitious than them.

156
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,230
Tell us.

157
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,870
What information

158
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,950
can you offer us?

159
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,030
What Chang Wujue mainly cultivated

160
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,310
is the Iron Horse Glacier mental technique.

161
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,550
It's indeed powerful.

162
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,010
But he also has a weakness.

163
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,110
What's that?

164
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,230
Three years ago, when I went to the Central Plains

165
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,950
to carry out an important mission,

166
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,270
I learned of something

167
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,570
very powerful.

168
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,840
It can deactivate

169
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,230
Chang Wujue's Iron Horse Glacier mental technique.

170
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,910
What is it?

171
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,240
The Dragon Blood Pearl.

172
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,510
[Linglong Flower Realm]

173
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,990
Sir, enjoy your meal.

174
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,630
You've always seemed

175
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,320
uneasy during the journey.

176
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,390
So I made some white fungus soup.

177
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,200
Do you

178
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,350
feel uneasy

179
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,260
because of the Dragon Blood Pearl's whereabouts?

180
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,310
Yes.

181
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,470
And no.

182
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,030
Ms. Liu,

183
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,120
do you have news about the Dragon Blood Pearl?

184
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,690
I have honored your trust.

185
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,220
The Dragon Blood Pearl is now in Mount Qilian.

186
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,490
I'm going to Mount Qilian right away.

187
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,930
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

188
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,550
Sir.

189
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,590
Mr. Huo, your whereabouts are unpredictable.

190
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,430
I can't drink

191
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,110
this jar of wine with you.

192
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,970
Take it with you and drink it on the way.

193
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,240
Ms. Liu, I'm honored

194
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,870
to meet you.

195
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,440
After I get what I want,

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,310
I will

197
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,220
specially come to thank you.

198
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,310
Then I'm...

199
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,390
not going to walk you out.

200
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,550
Goodbye.

201
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,090
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

202
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,920
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,060
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

204
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,700
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

205
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,000
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

206
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,200
♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

207
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,270
♫I give my remaining years, how could I ever break free?♫

208
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,500
♫Love falls like silent snow, sweeping away lost souls♫

209
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:35,470
♫Gaze at the stars, question the truth of Heaven and Earth♫

210
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,990
♫We reunite in the silent night, melting the coldness♫

211
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,750
It's Lunar New Year's Eve again.

212
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,260
♫With pure and earnest hearts, how many lovers remain?♫

213
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,400
How have you been

214
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,350
in the valley?

215
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,150
♫Warm wine shared over forgotten dreams, to carry us through life♫

216
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,830
Let's go.

217
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,350
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

218
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:09,630
♫Guarding every lonely night, holding a light for you♫

219
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,780
♫I give my remaining years, how could I ever break free?♫

220
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,540
♫Love falls like silent snow, sweeping away lost souls♫

221
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,960
♫Across vast mountains and seas, I offer myself to you♫

222
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:37,270
♫Guarding through partings and reunions, holding a light for you♫

223
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,060
♫So fearless, as Heaven and Earth bear witness♫

224
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:50,480
♫As long as you can recognize us every time♫

225
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:05,100
♫As long as you can recognize us every time♫

226
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,950
Ten.

227
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,470
Nine.

228
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,720
Eight.

229
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,180
Seven.

230
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,550
Give it to me.

231
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,630
Hold it steadily.

232
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,190
Okay.

233
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,110
You...

234
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,270
What if it spills?

235
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,020
Be careful.

236
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,950
Here, Shuang Hong.

237
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,070
Is everything ready here?

238
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,910
Chief?

239
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,990
Ziye.

240
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,720
Chief.

241
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,230
Happy Lunar New Year, Chief.

242
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,560
Don't just stand there.

243
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,830
If everything is ready,

244
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,870
sit down and eat.

245
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,670
Happy Lunar New Year, Chief.

246
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,250
It smells so good.

247
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,770
Why are you looking at me?

248
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,390
Pour wine for me.

249
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,510
-I'll do it.
-I'll do it.

250
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm good at it.

251
00:15:59,390 --> 00:15:59,830
Chief.

252
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,150
I'll pour wine for her.

253
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,830
I'll pour wine for her.

254
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,190
I'm best at it.

255
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,740
I poured wine for her every year.

256
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,310
I poured wine for her every year.

257
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:05,790
No.

258
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,990
I poured wine for her!

259
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
So clumsy.

260
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,430
The wine spilt.

261
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:10,930
So I'll

262
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,710
deduct the fee from your bonuses.

263
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,710
No, Chief.

264
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,260
The money...

265
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,950
The money is enough to buy a pig's knuckle.

266
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,080
It's all your fault.

267
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,490
It's all your fault. I just...

268
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,710
I just lost the money to buy a pig's knuckle again. I...

269
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,790
I-I'll eat more meat.

270
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,350
I'll eat more meat.

271
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,230
How come you are such a big eater?

272
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,870
Chief hasn't eaten yet.

273
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,360
Come on.

274
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,150
Happy Lunar New Year.

275
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,030
-Happy Lunar New Year.
-Happy Lunar New Year.

276
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,440
[How have you been? It's cold. Take care of yourself.]

277
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,440
[I've arrived at Mount Qilian. I hope I can find the Dragon Blood Pearl and return to the valley soon.]

278
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,589
You're back so soon?

279
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,270
There's something on its claws.

280
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,150
I think the letter

281
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,030
is blank.

282
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Did Mr. Seven send the wrong letter?

283
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,510
Sometimes, saying nothing

284
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,880
beats a thousand words.

285
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,080
Long live Doctrine Leader.

286
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,760
Where is Eye?

287
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,470
Doctrine Leader,

288
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,230
Eye is out on an important mission

289
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,630
and hasn't returned yet.

290
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,350
I spent many days cultivating in seclusion.

291
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,630
I forgot about it.

292
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,950
Congratulations, Doctrine Leader.

293
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,960
Your cultivation in seclusion is over.

294
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,870
Your Iron Horse Glacier

295
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,400
has reached the next level.

296
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,010
No more congratulations.

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,070
My bad.

298
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,530
Actually, that is exactly why

299
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,340
I asked you here today.

300
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,480
To reach

301
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,840
the ninth level of the Iron Horse Glacier,

302
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,470
I need the power of solidifying water into ice.

303
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,800
As the saying goes, Yang gives rise to Yin.

304
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,950
Yang destroys while Yin conceals.

305
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,350
Cultivating a technique

306
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,990
of extreme Yin and softness requires the energy

307
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,720
of extreme Yang and toughness.

308
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,910
What a pity.

309
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,880
A body of extreme Yang

310
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,640
is like something nurtured by Heaven and Earth.

311
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,600
It's very rare in this world.

312
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,230
That kind of person's meridians contain blazing Yang energy,

313
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,760
which is rich and vigorous.

314
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,910
If I can get his Yang energy,

315
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,630
maybe

316
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,230
my power can increase significantly.

317
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,250
Doctrine Leader, I'm willing to serve you.

318
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,580
Doctrine Leader, what do you want us to do?

319
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,310
Actually,

320
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,250
I just want you to go to the Central Plains

321
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,350
and bring back all those babies

322
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,550
born at noon safely.

323
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,550
-Got it.
-Got it.

324
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,950
You may leave.

325
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,950
Feng.

326
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,110
I need to continue to cultivate in seclusion.

327
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,310
You stay in the palace

328
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,400
and protect me.

329
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,810
Got it.

330
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,230
Mother.

331
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,350
What's wrong?

332
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,270
I miss Uncle.

333
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,860
When will he come to see me?

334
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,630
Your uncle...

335
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,150
Your uncle is looking for the medicine for you.

336
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,260
Besides,

337
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,680
he's busy with Sword Sect's business.

338
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,270
He can't frequently come

339
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,230
to play with you.

340
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,870
Right?

341
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,950
Mother,

342
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,130
can Uncle stay here

343
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,190
after finding the medicine?

344
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,160
Good boy.

345
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,880
As long as you recover,

346
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,870
your uncle

347
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,880
will visit you often.

348
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,230
But...

349
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,020
Mother,

350
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,110
when exactly

351
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,630
can I recover?

352
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,000
You just need to take your medicine

353
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,870
and eat more.

354
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,950
After your uncle

355
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,510
delivers the medicine here,

356
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,110
you won't

357
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,370
feel any pain anymore.

358
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay?

359
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,030
Come on.

360
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,830
Sleep.

361
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,310
Come on.

362
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,150
Cry.

363
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,700
The louder you cry,

364
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,520
the stronger that means you are.

365
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,740
Sir.

366
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,840
Sir, do you want to rest?

367
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,300
Is your child sick?

368
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,160
It's none of your business!

369
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,430
Sir, calm down.

370
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,350
Your child is crying quite loudly.

371
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,950
I wonder if the child is sick,

372
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,670
hungry, or needs a diaper change.

373
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,930
The child is so little.

374
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,750
He can't withstand the cold weather.

375
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,550
My child hasn't been weaned yet.

376
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,870
If you need,

377
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,390
you can go inside and have a seat.

378
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,430
I'll ask my wife

379
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,510
to change his diaper

380
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,260
and feed him.

381
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,190
You have a baby too?

382
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,120
A boy?

383
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,640
Yes.

384
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,590
He's a bit older than your child.

385
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,030
Okay.

386
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:27,990
Sir,

387
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,910
it's cold.

388
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,600
Have some mutton to warm your stomach.

389
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,950
Your child must be starving.

390
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,990
He's eating heartily.

391
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,990
And he stopped crying immediately.

392
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,810
Indeed, he hasn't eaten for quite some time

393
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,090
since his mother died.

394
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,100
Sorry.

395
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,670
Sir,

396
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,030
your child

397
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,550
will definitely grow into a strong man

398
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,430
and be easier to raise.

399
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,790
Just now, he was drinking milk very heartily.

400
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,670
Was your baby

401
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,670
born at noon?

402
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,800
How did you know?

403
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,950
I heard children born at noon

404
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,310
have strong Yang energy and are sturdy.

405
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,670
I hope my child

406
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,850
can become like that

407
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,850
in the future.

408
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,510
Alright, sir.

409
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,510
Enjoy your meal first.

410
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,640
I'll go heat up a bottle of wine for you.

411
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,470
Don't worry.

412
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,510
Your wish will come true.

413
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,360
Cry.

414
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,120
You won't cry after you grow up.

415
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,440
Envoy Miao Shui.

416
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,650
You didn't find any? Not even one?

417
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,830
No.

418
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,670
I was not as lucky as you.

419
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,830
I didn't meet any baby boy

420
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,000
born at noon.

421
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,640
Look.

422
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,510
Wait.

423
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,760
Are you here to take the credit?

424
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,970
People with extreme Yang energy are very rare.

425
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,370
You actually found two?

426
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,070
Both of them are boys?

427
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,330
Were they born at noon?

428
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,990
Of course.

429
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,530
How can you prove it?

430
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,070
How can you prove it?

431
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,200
The boys I found are twins.

432
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,950
There is no doubt

433
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,950
that they were born at the same time.

434
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,110
They are not boys.

435
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,470
They are a boy and a girl.

436
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:11,930
A boy...

437
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,350
A boy... A boy and a...

438
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,070
Since you are a girl,

439
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,840
there's no need to take you to Doctrine Leader.

440
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,800
Have you taken care of them?

441
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,070
Yes.

442
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,670
If you need,

443
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,430
I can go look for more for you.

444
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,360
No need for that.

445
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,790
Originally,

446
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,530
I just wanted to give it a try

447
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,590
with those babies.

448
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,580
But it turned out to be useless.

449
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,050
Is there any other way?

450
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,870
Yes.

451
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,430
How come

452
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,730
your wound last time didn't leave a scar?

453
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,390
Doctrine Leader,

454
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,550
I used a new ointment.

455
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,690
That's why it didn't leave a scar.

456
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,040
Good.

457
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,710
Doctrine Leader!

458
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,910
Doctrine Leader!

459
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,710
What's wrong, Doctrine Leader?

460
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Doctrine Leader!

461
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,730
How could this happen?

462
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,610
I don't know anything.

463
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,870
I saw nothing.

464
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,590
You may leave.

465
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:21,990
Yes.

466
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,970
Doctrine Leader.

467
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,230
Feng,

468
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,490
those babies were not helpful

469
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,370
and disrupted my primordial energy.

470
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,550
I'll help you regulate your breath now.

471
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,110
Okay.

472
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,750
Okay.

473
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,390
Twelve Silver Wings.

474
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,440
If you're wise,

475
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,300
hand over the Dragon Blood Pearl!

476
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,460
If you are capable,

477
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,640
come and get it yourselves!

478
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,950
To get

479
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,280
the Dragon Blood Pearl,

480
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,270
Chang Wujue sent you to besiege me along the way.

481
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,330
He really put great effort into this.

482
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,270
What exactly

483
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,790
does the Yuan Yi Palace want to do?

484
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,320
This has nothing to do with the Yuan Yi Palace.

485
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,310
Seven,

486
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,830
you took

487
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,810
the Dragon Blood Pearl from Mount Qilian

488
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,210
and came all the way here.

489
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,950
I guess

490
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,910
this pearl is very important

491
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,590
to you.

492
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,350
It's none of your business.

493
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,350
But you

494
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,350
have gone against Chang Wujue's will

495
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,550
by acting on your own.

496
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,870
Aren't you worried your Doctrine Leader

497
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,670
will kill you?

498
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,480
Cut the crap!

499
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,810
I'm determined

500
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,710
to get this pearl.

501
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,670
Huo Zhanbai,

502
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,790
stop struggling.

503
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,770
Based on the length

504
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,630
of Mr. Seven's previous absences,

505
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,840
when these new Laughing at the World

506
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,590
is ready,

507
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,710
Mr. Seven should be back

508
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,470
as well.

509
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,910
Put them away.

510
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,720
Chief, are you alright?

511
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:30,830
I'm fine.

go bring Chief Xue here.

Xue Ziye,

00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,550
why haven't you... come here yet?

525
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,790
-Mr. Seven!
-Mr. Seven!

526
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,370
Chief,

527
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,670
there's no one here.

528
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,020
Snow Harrier will never take the wrong way.

529
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,510
Split up and look for him carefully.

530
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:42,910
Okay.

531
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,670
Okay.

532
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,910
Mr. Seven.

533
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,510
-Mr. Seven!
-Mr. Seven!

534
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,860

Chief.

537

Mr. Seven!

538
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,550
Chief, I found him!

539
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,280
He seems badly injured!

540
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,530
Don't touch him first.

541
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,110
His pulse is very weak.

542
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,280
His breath is faint.

543
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,890
How did he end up like this?

544
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,030
Xiao Cheng.

545
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,790
You...

546
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,110
You're finally here.

547
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,070
Don't move.

548
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,530
If you move again, you'll die.

549
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,690
With...

550
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,490
With...

551
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,590
With you here,

552
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,310

the Dragon Blood Pearl

556
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,580

and send him back now.

561
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,830
Be steady.

562
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,790
His internal organs could rupture anytime.

563
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,350

00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,470
even though you've got this pearl,

570
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,840
what's the use?

571
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:13,830
♫Looking back at the fleeting snow and wind, I have no regrets♫

572
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,630
Chief, what's wrong?

573
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,450
What's that sound?

574
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,920
Over there.

575
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,040
Be careful.

576
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,830
Chief, he's badly injured.

577
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,510
He's dying.

578
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,110
I've never seen this man before.

579
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,120
Why do I feel

580
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,310
familiar somehow?

581
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,120
Help me.

582
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,830
Help me.
