1
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's bury him here.

2
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,110
Chief Xue.

3
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,810
It’s time to go.

4
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,230
Don't burn it!

5
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
Don't burn it!

6
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,730
Stop. Don't burn it.

7
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,310
These things...

8
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,480
Mo still needs them when he wakes up.

9
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
He still plays with them.

10
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
He'll make a scene if he can't find them.

11
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,430
No, no.

12
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,310
Junior.

13
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,830
Junior.

14
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,310
Junior.

15
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,560
Mo.

16
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,310
Mo.

17
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,560
Mo.

18
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,870
Let me hug you.

19
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,750
Let her cry.

20
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,240
It's a good thing

21
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
to cry.

22
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,850
Mo, don't be afraid.

23
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,430
Mother is here.

24
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,610
Mo, don't be afraid.

25
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,870
Mo.

26
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,780
As your father, I've let you down.

27
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Huo Zhanbai.

28
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,909
What happened to the promise you made to me?

29
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,460
After all these years,

30
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,600
what did I gain?

31
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,750
To compete with you

32
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,210
for the position of chief,

33
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,720
I've lost my family and my son.

34
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,080
Chief Xue.

35
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,990
You play the flute very well.

36
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,330
Do you only know this song?

37
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,370
It's not a flute.

38
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,800
It's a reed pipe,

39
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,510
an instrument from the Western Region.

40
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,510
The person who gave me this reed pipe

41
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,390
only taught me this song.

42
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,000
The Doctrine Leader gave it to you?

43
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,510
No.

44
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,440
It was a past family member.

45
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,390
A past family member?

46
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,400
Royal Sister.

47
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,670
Why can't we travel together

48
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,600
with our father?

49
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
We travel separately

50
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,670
to avoid attention.

51
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Then, when can we

52
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,390
go home?

53
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,880
We can't go back anymore.

54
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,750
We...

55
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
We'll have a new home.

56
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,080
But I want to go back to my old home.

57
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,640
These two reed pipes

58
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,390
are made from the same wood.

59
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
Father ordered the craftsmen

60
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
to make these specially

61
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,670
for us siblings.

62
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
Roots of the same tree,

63
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,510
branches connected to each other,

64
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,640
just like you and me.

65
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
This is yours.

66
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,140
If you miss home in the future,

67
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
you can play a song with the reed pipe.

68
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,660
The homeland will hear it.

69
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,530
I'll teach you.

70
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Watch carefully.

71
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,720
Chief Xue.

72
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,010
Let's rest here.

73
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
Help!

74
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,200
Help!

75
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,390
Help!

76
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,360
Sir.

77
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,360
How are you?

78
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,520
He lost too much blood

79
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,030
and has been freezing for too long.

80
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,390
He needs to get his temperature back

81
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,450
before he wakes up.

82
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,670
Hurry.

83
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
Take him to this inn

84
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
to avoid the cold.

85
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,120
Hurry!

86
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,010
Help him!

87
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,430
What are you waiting for?

88
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,210
Let me do it.

89
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,750
Envoy Miao Feng, your palm strength was formidable.

90
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm sure you have a strong inner power.

91
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,030
May I

92
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,550
borrow your internal force?

93
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,720
I’m at your disposal.

94
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,120
Okay.

95
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,000
Help me inject internal force into him,

96
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,790
and I'll use acupuncture

97
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,290
to salvage his energy.

98
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,390
Okay.

99
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,600
Sir, you're awake.

100
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,790
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

101
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,720
Just let me know.

102
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm good.

103
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,240
I passed by here

104
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,790
and ran into a robber.

105
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,670
I thought I was dead for sure.

106
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm glad I met you two.

107
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,480
Thank you.

108
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,750
Thank you.

109
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,730
I dare not take full credit.

110
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,030
It's mainly thanks to him.

111
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,390
Thank you.

112
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,510
Thank you.

113
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,390
You are always calm.

114
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,000
I thought

115
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,560
you were a peaceful person.

116
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,070
But your body has already

117
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,900
reacted to this searing pain.

118
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,080
Why do you still

119
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
look so calm

120
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,870
and remain smiling?

121
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,380
Those who practice the Spring Breeze

122
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,030
cannot be emotional.

123
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,930
Humans are not plants.

124
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,580
What did you go through

125
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,200
to become so

126
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,500
emotionless like you?

127
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,000
I just train hard.

128
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,750
Train hard?

129
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,630
I'm afraid

130
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,050
they were some inhumane training.

131
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,240
What kind of inhumane place

132
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
is Yuan Yi Palace

133
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,550
to make normal people

134
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,970
develop such abnormal habits?

135
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,910
Mr. Huo.

136
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,630
Thank you.

137
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,790
Seventh Brother.

138
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,960
Didn't you ask me

139
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,630
to keep an eye on Yuan Yi Palace?

140
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,430
A few days ago,

141
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,120
the Sun Saintess Wuma's rebellion failed.

142
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,670
Yuan Yi Palace is heavily guarded.

143
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
I will continue to investigate.

144
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,360
Seven.

145
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,440
Senior.

146
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,200
An important task from the Sword Sect?

147
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
That's right.

148
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,680
All these years,

149
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,480
Chang Wujue has been using his power and fear

150
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,610
to restrain his men.

151
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,030
He forced the Three Saintess,

152
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,690
Five Sages,

153
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,150
and thousands of followers

154
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,240
to submit to him.

155
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,680
The Yuan Yi Palace rebellion

156
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,910
must have been caused by something.

157
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,600
Senior,

158
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
I have a request.

159
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,630
We need to gather the power of the seven disciples

160
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,360
to encircle and suppress the Yuan Yi Palace this time.

161
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,960
I wonder if Fifth Brother...

162
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,990
This concerns the safety of the people.

163
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
It depends on Fengxing.

164
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,390
If he agrees,

165
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,840
I will.

166
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,720
That's great.

167
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Thank you.

168
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,360
Mr. Huo.

169
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,170
Something happened to Madam.

170
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,240
Junior.

171
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,200
Junior!

172
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,530
What happened?

173
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,790
I don't know.

174
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,700
Go get my medicine bag.

175
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes.

176
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,369
She took poison.

177
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,770
She looks pale and sickly,

178
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,160
and her fingers are bruising.

179
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,220
She drank the Gut-Rupturing powder.

180
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,780
Fortunately, we noticed in time.

181
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,240
The poison hasn't penetrated the internal organs.

182
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
She'll be fine if

183
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,220
she can puke it out.

184
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,350
Why did you save me?

185
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,350
You shouldn't have saved me.

186
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,400
Junior.

187
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,960
Seven.

188
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
We both know that

189
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Mrs. Qiushui wants to die.

190
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,180
Even if she wakes up later,

191
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,200
she might attempt to

192
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
commit suicide again in the future.

193
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,110
Right now,

194
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,680
we have to take turns taking care of her.

195
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,030
Okay.

196
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,480
I'll multitask and also oversee

197
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,070
the matters of the Sword Sect.

198
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,470
I'll leave when Junior is

199
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,390
doing better.

200
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,650
I'll go prescribe some medicine.

201
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,240
We need to get rid of the remaining poison

202
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,550
as soon as possible.

203
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,030
When the medicine is done,

204
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,090
get her to drink it.

205
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,000
Okay.

206
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,400
Thank you.

207
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,830
Mr. Huo.

208
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Thanks for your help.

209
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Send the letter as soon as possible.

210
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,110
Yes.

211
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,090
I hope the six swords

212
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,590
can reply as soon as they receive the letter.

213
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,790
Then, we can reunite as soon as possible

214
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,210
and discuss how to destroy Yuan Yi Palace.

215
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,310
Senior.

216
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,640
Is she awake?

217
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,920
Yes.

218
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,290
I'll go check on her.

219
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,860
No need.

220
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,160
She just said she doesn't want to see anyone.

221
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,220
Give her some time.

222
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
I just persuaded her

223
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,240
to take the medicine

224
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
in the afternoon.

225
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,240
Regardless,

226
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,280
it's good that she can drink it.

227
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,750
She does need some time.

228
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,750
I hope she can come to terms with things.

229
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,510
When you settle down Mrs. Qiushui

230
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,550
and deal with the matters of the Sword Sect,

231
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,550
will you go to the Apothecary Valley

232
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,680
to find my disciple?

233
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,400
I promised her

234
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,290
to drink Laughing at the World together.

235
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,350
I asked Snow Harrier

236
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,680
to send a letter back to the valley.

237
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
It must have been delivered.

238
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,830
I wonder if that dumb bird

239
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,590
will remember to

240
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,790
ask her to reply to me.

241
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,920
Your dumb bird

242
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
is quite sensible.

243
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,610
It will understand your feelings.

244
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,720
I hope so.

245
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,110
Unfortunately, my disciple has a cold disease.

246
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,170
She can't be like me

247
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,700
and leave the valley whenever I want.

248
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,110
Senior.

249
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,510
Can her cold disease

250
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,310
be completely cured?

251
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,510
Now that the knot in her heart is gone,

252
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,030
although she cannot fully recover,

253
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,680
some good rest and recuperation

254
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,480
can improve her health greatly.

255
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,110
But...

256
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,950
She needs to recuperate for many years.

257
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,230
As long as it can be cured,

258
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
it doesn't matter how long it takes.

259
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,070
Some day,

260
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,200
I'll be able to see

261
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,690
the beauty of this world with her.

262
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Right now,

263
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
are you also looking at the moon?

264
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,520
Chief Xue.

265
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,290
Are you feeling better?

266
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,760
Chief Xue?

267
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Chief Xue!

268
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,880
Chief Xue!

269
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,550
Chief Xue.

270
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,370
You would not have guessed that

271
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,680
you're suffering from the cold disease

272
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
because of me.

273
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,410
That's enough.

274
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,030
Not enough.

275
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,570
Spring Breeze is extremely exhausting.

276
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,830
If you faint,

277
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
I can't save you.

278
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,840
I just didn't expect that

279
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,240
your body

280
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
is so weak.

281
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,070
But don't worry.

282
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,240
Moving on, I'll transfer some primordial energy

283
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,500
to you every two hours.

284
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,040
With you around,

285
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,440
I don't have to worry about myself.

286
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,240
Wait.

287
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,530
I'll get you some medicine.

288
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,480
No need.

289
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,550
The wound on my abdomen

290
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,550
is almost healed.

291
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,440
It's not for the wound.

292
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,550
It's the medicine to cure the Ice Silkworm Poison.

293
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,860
I made this pill

294
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,070
three years ago.

295
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,000
It's most effective against the Ice Silkworm Poison.

296
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,070
Take this pill.

297
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
Even if your Ice Silkworm Poison

298
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,800
acts up again,

299
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,510
it wouldn't be as unbearable

300
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,240
as it is now.

301
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,250
Although you look calm,

302
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,310
your hands are trembling.

303
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,240
The tendons in your hand are rising.

304
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,040
No matter how much you endure it,

305
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,370
you can't hide your pain from a doctor.

306
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,920
Your Ice Silkworm Poison is acting up.

307
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,170
At this moment,

308
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,350
it feels like a hundred needles are piercing you from the inside.

309
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,550
It's chilling and painful,

310
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,200
right?

311
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,530
It hasn't even been a month.

312
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,160
The Ice Silkworm Poison

313
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,020
shouldn't have acted up so early.

314
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
Because you used

315
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,110
too much primordial energy just now.

316
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,350
That's why the Ice Silkworm Poison

317
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,480
acted up in advance.

318
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Hurry.

319
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,500
Take the medicine.

320
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,680
No need.

321
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,070
Didn't you say you would

322
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,720
transfer primordial energy to me

323
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,680
every two hours?

324
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,110
How can you withstand such frequent

325
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,640
usage of your primordial energy?

326
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,240
Besides,

327
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,680
if the Ice Silkworm Poison acts up again,

328
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,440
you need to use your primordial energy to resolve it.

329
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,750
If you exhaust your primordial energy

330
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,640
to save my life,

331
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,800
how can you suppress the cold poison in your body?

332
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,440
The Ice Silkworm Poison is a mark bestowed upon me

333
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,770
by the Doctrine Leader.

334
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
It is my honor.

335
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
How can I let it go?

336
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,880
You are really crazy.

337
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,340
Doctrine Leader is a loner

338
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,040
who never trusts anyone.

339
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,510
If I weren't poisoned by the Ice Silkworm Poison

340
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,040
and relies on him for an antidote every month,

341
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,110
how could I

342
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,770
stay by his side and serve him?

343
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,610
The palace is full of vicious people.

344
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,080
I want to stay by his side.

345
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,350
So,

346
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,800
thank you for your kindness.

347
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,570
I just cannot accept it.

348
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,720
You're desperate

349
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,640
to protect someone.

350
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,600
I understand that feeling.

351
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,650
You don't have to feel bad about it.

352
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,340
If you come around one day,

353
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,890
I'll detoxify you.

354
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,400
This can temporarily

355
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,130
suppress the pain in your body.

356
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Take a rest

357
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,440
before we get going.

358
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Thank you, Chief Xue.

359
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,030
You don’t have to

360
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,230
thank me so politely.

361
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,580
I'm not your Doctrine Leader.

362
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,510
The weather is so bad

363
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,420
and his Ice Silkworm Poison is acting up.

364
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,720
If we don't hurry to Yuan Yi Palace,

365
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,590
I'm afraid I'll die on the way

366
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,510
before I can

367
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,590
see Mingjie.

368
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,590
Since the carriage has been overturned,

369
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,520
to arrive at Yuan Yi Palace in time,

370
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,510
why don't we ride the horses?

371
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,550
Okay.

372
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,790
But your health...

373
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,920
I’m fine.

374
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,720
If we're riding horses,

375
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,160
we can't bring so many things with us.

376
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,420
Let's pick the important ones and leave.

377
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,440
Okay.

378
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,110
I need to transfer energy to you regularly.

379
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,880
I’m afraid you and I

380
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,110
must ride the same horse

381
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,770
and always lean on each other.

382
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,760
If you're alright with that,

383
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,140
we’ll go like this.

384
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,770
Lean on me to rest and

385
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,400
I'll transfer you energy.

386
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,510
Transferring energy from you to me

387
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,110
is like a treatment of sorts.

388
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Doctors don't care about

389
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,110
gender considerations during treatments.

390
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,370
Let us travel this way.

391
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
It’s snowing heavily.

392
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll sit in front of you

393
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,980
to block some snow.

394
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,540
Are you still cold?

395
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,840
It's fine.

396
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,770
Focus on your journey.

397
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,790
I'll let you know

398
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,330
if I feel unwell.

399
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Thank you.

400
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,680
Look, it's Snow Harrier.

401
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,440
Snow Harrier.

402
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,700
Why are you back alone?

403
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,240
Is this from Mr. Seven, for Chief?

404
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,590
But she's out of the valley.

405
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,520
She won't come back in a long while.

406
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,880
Ziye.

407
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,790
I will be back soon.

408
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,070
Please

409
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,730
wait for me with warm wine.

410
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,680
When did Mr. Huo

411
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,790
write this?

412
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,000
Was it after meeting Chief Liao?

413
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,750
One chirp for yes,

414
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,750
two chirps for no.

415
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,350
Since he has met Chief Liao,

416
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,240
he must have known the truth.

417
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,230
According to the letter,

418
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,110
he wishes to drink with her.

419
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,090
As expected,

420
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,350
he doesn't blame Ziye.

421
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,750
Why would Mr. Seven

422
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,960
blame her at all?

423
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,830
Her prescription

424
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,790
saved Mo.

425
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,880
He should be thanking her

426
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,590
instead.

427
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,110
But Chief must have guessed that

428
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,590
Mr. Seven is craving wine.

429
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,240
So she asked Shuang Hong

430
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,830
to bury some Laughing at the World

431
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,960
under the plum tree.

432
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,590
But Chief

433
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,400
left without saying goodbye.

434
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,160
When she comes back,

435
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,560
I must nag at her about it.

436
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,800
Shuang Hong.

437
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,040
What's wrong?

438
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,320
Nothing.

439
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,160
I know.

440
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,960
What do you know?

441
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,310
You must be worried about Chief,

442
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,830
right?

443
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
I'm worried too.

444
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,240
The road to Suzhou is so far.

445
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,550
I hope that person

446
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,950
can take good care of her.

447
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,680
He will.

448
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,800
By the way,

449
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,960
let me write a letter back.

450
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,040
I have to tell Mr. Seven that

451
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,590
our Chief

452
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,750
is going to the Sword Sect.

453
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,280
Feng Lyu.

454
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,110
Go to the medicine hut

455
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,480
to check if Lan Lan's ointment

456
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,310
is ready.

457
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
Tell her to keep the flames small.

458
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,240
When the bubbles

459
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,160
turn from small to big ones,

460
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,330
she can take the pot off the flames.

461
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,070
Okay.

462
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,350
Shuang Hong.

463
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,240
You should write the reply.

464
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,590
Okay.

465
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,090
Miao Feng is currently

466
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,590
bringing a female doctor

467
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,850
back to Yuan Yi Palace.

468
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,400
You must stop him

469
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,510
on the way.

470
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,000
Don't let him bring

471
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,330
the female doctor back.

472
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,350
Remember,

473
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,660
Miao Feng can be killed...

474
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,680
But not the female doctor.

475
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,300
-Yes!
-Yes!

476
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,560
Chief Xue.

477
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,930
Can you hold on?

478
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,880
I'm fine.

479
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,200
When we arrive at the next post,

480
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
let's take a small break.

481
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Chief Xue.

482
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,170
Are you okay?

483
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,840
Don't worry.

484
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,250
If we go further,

485
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,110
we'll arrive at Yueya Vale.

486
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,710
We can find

487
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,620
a resting place

488
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,630
and horse feeds there.

489
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,840
Okay.

490
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,480
Miao Feng!

491
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,920
Who are they?

492
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,949
Eight Elites of the Asura Field.

493
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,230
The Asura Field?

494
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,420
All Eight Elites are here.

495
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,250
What a big scene.

496
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,880
You are highly skilled.

497
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,050
Naturally, we have to be all here.

498
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,320
I know Eye sent you.

499
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Don't force me to kill you one by one.

500
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Come at me at once.

501
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,590
Eye?

502
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,630
It's him.

503
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,630
The arrow is poisoned.

504
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm fine.

505
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,910
Hurry.

506
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,110
Take it.

507
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,120
It can suppress the poison.

508
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,420
You go to Yueya Vale first.

509
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll hold them back.

510
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,840
But...

511
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Run!

512
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,550
Why did Eye

513
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,590
send you all here?

514
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,730
Do you think I'm afraid?

515
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,630
Miao Feng.

516
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,130
I don't understand

517
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,800
why someone like you

518
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,470
would rather be the Doctrine Leader's dog.

519
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,510
Then why are you being

520
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,440
Eye's dog?

521
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,230
I don't think we need to understand each other.

522
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,360
As Eye's dog,

523
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,320
at least I won't live a miserable life.

524
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,590
Miao Feng.

525
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,920
I knew it.

526
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
You've been away from the Asura Field for too long.

527
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
You've even

528
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,440
forgotten your lethal strike.

529
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,730
My reed pipe!

530
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,090
One body is missing.

531
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,290
Feipian pretended to be dead.

532
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,420
You can still move?

533
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,920
It looks like

534
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,790
you can't hold on any longer.

535
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,960
I'm kind.

536
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,130
I won't let you suffer anymore.

537
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,840
Did Eye really

538
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,480
send you to kill me and Miao Feng?

539
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,120
Originally, Eye said

540
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,890
he wanted to keep you alive.

541
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,440
I think he wants to kill you himself.

542
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,230
But a weak woman

543
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,070
like you

544
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,080
doesn't need to trouble him.

545
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,920
Chief Xue.

546
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,570
Looks like you're badly injured too.

547
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,760
If you want to save this woman so badly,

548
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,150
then hurry up and

549
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,210
extend her breath.

550
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,640
If she stops breathing now,

551
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,760
she’ll be dead.

552
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,190
Chief Xue.

553
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,320
What?

554
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,510
You don't dare to be distracted?

555
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,470
You're right.

556
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,300
No one from the Asura Field

557
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,670
would simply give his opponent

558
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,870
the chance to strike.

559
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,890
Envoy Miao Feng.

560
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,640
I'll just keep you occupied

561
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,510
so you can watch her

562
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,360
die in front of you.

563
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,360
Chief Xue!

564
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,840
If I go to help her,

565
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,110
both of us

566
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,150
might die

567
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,810
right away.

568
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,330
However...

569
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,080
To think we Eight Elites managed to

570
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,840
put you in such a tight spot.

571
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,650
You're fine?

572
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,930
That was close.

573
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,770
Were you pretending to

574
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,560
faint from your injury?

575
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,800
You had

576
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,040
no defenses at all just now.

577
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,640
Don't tell me...

578
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,080
Were you really planning to risk your life to save me?

579
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,300
Fortunately, I have this.

580
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,700
The Tenacious Needle,

581
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,490
the secret weapon of the Tang Sect in Shu.

582
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,710
Since Tang Que died,

583
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,440
it has disappeared from the martial world.

584
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,770
It's actually with you.

585
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,630
Yes.

586
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,880
Someone

587
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,480
mortgaged it for my medical fee.

588
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm fine.

589
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,750
Miao Feng!

590
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,510
You've exhausted your inner energy.

591
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,000
You must be treated immediately.

592
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,060
It's not safe here.

593
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,360
Let's...

594
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,160
It’s too late.

595
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,630
Chief Xue.

596
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,540
How are you?

597
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,800
The reed pipe.

598
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Why do you have it?

599
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,430
Why did you take such a risk?

600
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
You said

601
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,630
this reed pipe

602
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,350
was given by your past family.

603
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,100
You must cherish it very much.

604
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,520
That's why you kept it close to you all the time.

605
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,190
If I didn't pick it up,

606
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,390
I'm afraid that in this vast snowfield,

607
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,630
it'd be lost forever.

608
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,800
I also once lost

609
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,100
something important.

610
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,150
Luckily,

611
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,360
it came back

612
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,230
to me.

613
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:07,800
Thank you.

614
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,710
I told you

615
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,550
not to thank me all the time.

616
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,760
Chief Xue.

617
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,800
Chief Xue!

618
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,440
Chief Xue.

619
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,360
Wake up.

620
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:29,920
Chief Xue!

621
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,000
Chief Xue!

622
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,160
This feeling...

623
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,320
Since I've learned the Spring Breeze,

624
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,880
I've never felt it.

625
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,150
What's going on?
