You've been spacing out a lot lately.

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,520
Did you not sleep well?

7
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,490
Or did I rush the treatment that day

8
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,890
and cause aftereffects?

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,010

I wonder when we can get a chance

16

to kill that old man Nangong again.

you were the only one

who put the mission first

Was that true?

Yes.

31
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,070
Ming Li made a big mistake,

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,370
but he decided to retreat

33
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,150
because he cared about my safety.

34
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,210
But what about you?

35
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,390
If the Sword Sect

37
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,330
would you have waited for me to die

38
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,659
so you could replace me?

39
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,890
I dare not.

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,430
A few days ago,

167
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,910
when I went to the orphanage,

168
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,230
I heard that a merchant

169
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,590
from Mobei came.

170
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,070
He must have a lot of

171

interesting things.

172
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,750
If you need money, go get some in the storeroom.

173
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,270
You can go.

174
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,670
Okay.

175
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,390
I'll take this with me.

176
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,360
Let me help you.

177
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,580
Let's go.

178
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,190
Go.

179

180
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,670
I don't like

crowded places anyway.

182
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,270
I'll stay in the valley

183

And you.

187
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,830
You'll go too.

188
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,500
Don't disturb me in the valley.

189
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Since Chief is weak

190
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,960
and can't leave the valley,

191
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,310
we'll buy all things in town

192
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,340
and bring them back.

193
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,620
It's not that easy.

194
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,100
Chief just learned that

195
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,780
there's more to the massacre.

196
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,700
It's a festival of reunion.

197
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,030
I bet she misses her family

198
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,960
in the Mo Family Village even more.

199
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,670
Then…

200
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,900
Ladies.

201
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,930
I have an idea.

202
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,890
How do you feel?

203
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,390
The Five Sages of Yuan Yi Palace,

204
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,950
except for Miao Feng,

205
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,590
were all once locked here.

206
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,650
What are you trying to say?

207
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,430
Nothing.

208
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,670
I'm just curious

209
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,520
whether you are a human

210
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,230
or a monster.

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,990
Any human

212
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,820
will have a mental breakdown

213
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,890
after being locked in a dog cage.

214
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,520
But if you're a monster,

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,780
things are different.

216
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,070
To me,

217
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,770
you seem very calm.

218
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,630
I know what you're thinking.

219
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,950
What do you want?

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,290
You had the guts to ask for the Asura Field,

221
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,390
so you definitely won't settle for

222
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,150
staying in a dog cage.

223
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,770
So cute.

224
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,670
Look at this.

225
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,800
This one is good too.

226
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,220
Here, I've wrapped it for you.

227
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,150
So beautiful.

228
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,140
I like it.

229
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,710
Look. This basket is very useful.

230
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,350
Chief.

231
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,730
Take a look at the lanterns.

232
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,660
There are red ones and yellow ones.

233
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,950
Chief, Chief, look.

234
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,070
Chief, this is for you.

235
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,050
Chief, look at this.

236
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,650
And this.

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,420
Chief, look how beautiful this is.

238
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,220
And these two.

239
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,290
Chief, take this.

240
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,430
And this.

241
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,870
Chief, let me put it on for you.

242
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,260
Here.

243
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,150
Chief.

244
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,430
There's a surprise later.

245
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,960
Let's go.

246
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,470
Go.

247
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,510
Candied haws!

248
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,070
Sweet and sour candied haws!

249
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,630
Look.

250
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,190
Miss,

251
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,930
can I pay my debt

252
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,190
with candied haws?

253
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,590
Yes, yes!

254
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm afraid

255
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,470
all your candied haws together

256
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,470
can just pay a tiny part of your debt.

257
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
Every little bit counts.

258
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,710
What do you think?

259
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,070
There are many other interesting things.

260
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,230
Would you like to take a look around?

261
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,870
Go, Chief.

262
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,270
Go. Go.

263
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,350
Go and take a look.

264
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,030
Go.

265
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,320
With all this hubbub in the valley,

266
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,020
I don't think I can get any sleep.

267
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,350
I'll take a look around.

268
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,620
Chief, Chief.

269
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,290
Xiao Cheng.

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,640
Hand them out for me.

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,359
Mine, they're all mine.

272
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,190
No way.

273
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,990
Mine!

274
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,869
Slow down.

275
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,790
I want one too.

276
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,430
Give me one.

277
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,030
Slow down.

278
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,829
No, no.

279
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,990
Everyone gets one.

280
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,069
-Everyone gets one.
-Don't grab it!

281
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,270
-Give it back to me!
-Don't grab it!

282
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,030
Give it to me.

283
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,750
Chief, this is for you.

284
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,589
Nice work.

285
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,790
Chief Xue.

286
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,910
Great to see you!

287
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,670
Mr. Li.

288
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,070
You came too.

289
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,630
Yeah.

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,430
Have a sweet potato.

291
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,550
It's hot

292
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,850
and can warm you up.

293
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
It's too hot.

294
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,910
Let me hold it for her.

295
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,350
Okay.

296
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,790
It smells so good.

297
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,790
Thank you, Mr. Li.

298
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,910
Take care.

299
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,750
Chief Xue, choose a sugar figure.

300
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,910
Any type will do.

301
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,750
Can you draw someone

302
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,610
that's fierce

303
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,670
and ugly?

304
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,930
Chief, who are you talking about?

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,830
Well…

306
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,710
Why are you looking at me?

307
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,830
Here.

308
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,160
There's indeed a resemblance.

309
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,550
I doubt that.

310
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,070
It's not even half as handsome as me.

311
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,470
Chief, Chief.

312
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,470
Chief, have a try.

313
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,310
Here, try it.

314
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Give it a try.

315
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,190
Come on.

316
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,710
Do it.

317
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,750
You hit it!

318
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,390
Amazing!

319
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,800
Chief, you're amazing.

320
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,110
Chief.

321
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,390
Chief.

322
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,790
Come and try this.

323
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,890
It's freshly made.

324
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,950
It's freshly made.

325
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,860
Sticky rice cakes.

326
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,630
Didn't you say

327
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,820
the freshly made ones are the best?

328
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,250
Eat as many as you want.

329
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,470
Chief.

330
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,430
The sticky rice cake is chewy with a soft filling.

331
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,430
It's hard to make.

332
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,270
The freshly made ones

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,680
are the most delicious.

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,580
Xiao Cheng.

335
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,190
How's it?

336
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,640
Does it taste the same as when you were little?

337
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm afraid it's so delicious

338
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,090
because I haven't eaten it in a long time.

339
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,400
It reminds me of the Mo Family Village.

340
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,270
During festivals,

341
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,870
many families

342
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,750
wanted me to celebrate with them.

343
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,110
I know.

344
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,000
They didn't want me to feel lonely.

345
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,390
Festivals

346
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,910
should be celebrated with family and friends.

347
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,910
It's no fun celebrating them alone.

348
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,270
If you like it,

349
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,360
I'll invite them to the Apothecary Valley

350
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,910
to celebrate this festival with you

351
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,750
every year.

352
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,630
How much money did you spend

353
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,370
to persuade the villagers

354
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,990
to move the market to the Apothecary Valley?

355
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,070
Not a dime.

356
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,710
Did you put everything

357
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,710
on the account

358
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,210
of the Apothecary Valley?

359
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,990
The villagers living nearby

360
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,790
have been grateful to you

361
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,000
for your treatment.

362
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,290
As soon as I said it,

363
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,170
they agreed without hesitation.

364
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,510
By the way,

365
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,750
why don't I remember

366
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,110
any villagers in the town

367
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,840
who can make sticky rice cakes?

368
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,910
There's none

369
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,790
in this town,

370
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,160
so I went to the villages nearby

371
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,430
to visit all the vendors

372
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,160
who can make sticky rice cakes.

373
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,190
Inviting them over

374
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,320
did cost some money.

375
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,080
But don't worry.

376
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,170
I paid them with my wine money.

377
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,960
You love wine so much.

378
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm surprised that you spent your wine money on someone else.

379
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,190
You're not someone else.

380
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm in debt to you.

381
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,230
Did you…

382
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,680
prepare that too?

383
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,350
Thank you.

384
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,230
Do you know why Kunlun roses

385
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,090
are so precious?

386
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,960
No.

387
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,310
Normal roses

388
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,670
bloom three times a year.

389
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,590
And Kunlun roses

390
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,590
only bloom once a year.

391
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,160
One second, they bloom.

392
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
The next second, they die.

393
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,310
The most dazzling moment

394
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,590
is evanescent.

395
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,630
Those people

396
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,110
were just trash.

397
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,550
Now that they can nourish

398
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,590
my flowers

399
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,590
and witness that fleeting moment

400
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,910
of splendor,

401
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,990
their lives are worth it.

402
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,790
Eye.

403
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,910
You should know

404
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,040
the rules in the Palace.

405
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,110
The capable rise.

406
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,090
The inept fall.

407
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,480
If I let you down again,

408
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
you can kill me.

409
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,790
You may leave.

410
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,750
Yes.

411
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,930
Today's rose

412
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,980
is particularly gorgeous.

413
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,670
Doctrine Leader.

414
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
You're so beautiful.

415
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,340
Let me take a closer look at you.

416
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,210
No, Doctrine Leader!

417
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,320
Envoy Miao Feng.

418
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,390
Has anyone ever told you

419
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,430
that your smile

420
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,680
is disgusting?

421
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,430
What a beautiful face.

422
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,390
Envoy Miao Shui.

423
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,750
Get out.

424
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,710
Get out!

425
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

426
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,030
The pulse is the first indication of the state of Qi and blood.

427
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,150
Qi and blood can be sufficient or deficient.

428
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,100
There can be an excess in organs.

429
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,950
When Qi and blood are both sufficient,

430
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,030
the pulse, Yin, and Yang are all strong.

431
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,510
When Qi and blood are both deficient,

432
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,570
the pulse, Yin, and Yang are all weak.

433
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,950
Chief.

434
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,350
What are you reading?

435
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,910
Treatise on Febrile Diseases Caused by Cold.

436
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,550
Febrile diseases are different from cold damage.

437
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,210
You need to…

438
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,220
Identify the six-meridian pattern for cold damage.

439
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,390
♫Who is brewing the medicine, as the fragrance slowly filters through the window?♫

440
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,510
Focus on organs for febrile diseases and internal injuries.

441
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,790
Chief, I understand.

442
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,070
♫You lower your gaze, grinding herbs, your hand gently brushing my wound♫

443
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,550
You've improved a lot.

444
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,900
♫Following your eyes, I see the flowers fall softly into my palm♫

445
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,910
Thank you, Chief.

446
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,390
Keep reading.

447
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,140
♫I wish to speak, yet my thoughts remain unspoken♫

448
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,540
♫White moonlight peers over the courtyard walls, spreading frost upon the ground♫

449
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,550
Chief.

450
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,340
♫The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauze♫

451
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,140
Chief.

452
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,330
♫The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heart♫

453
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,950
Chief.

454
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,110
You're still sick.

455
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,830
Let me do it.

456
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,740
♫As we share stories of our pasts♫

457
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,290
Xiao Cheng.

458
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,300
I haven't tested you

459
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,890
♫Beneath the starlight♫

460
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,750
in a long time.

461
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,870
Chief.

462
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,390
I've been studying hard recently.

463
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,550
Ask whatever you want.

464
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,060
Okay.

465
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,490
♫We exchange glances, like medicine simmering slowly over time♫

466
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,730
You asked for it.

467
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,670
The Angelica Blood-Supplementing Decoction

468
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,070
has angelica in its name,

469
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,160
♫In the dim light, the person in my dream remains serene♫

470
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,160
but in practice,

471
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,390
the wrong proportion of herbs

472
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,120
can greatly affect the effect.

473
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,950
Why is that?

474
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,100
♫Your dark hair cascades over your white robes♫

475
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,300
I know.

476
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,150
The Angelica Blood-Supplementing Decoction

477
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,510
has angelica in its name,

478
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,750
but actually, astragalus is the main herb.

479
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,870
♫From this moment on, the distance between us will be as long as time itself♫

480
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,790
The dosage of astragalus

481
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,230
is five times more than angelica's.

482
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,970
♫New medicine heals old wounds, aged wine cools with time♫

483
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,710
That has two reasons.

484
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,230
First,

485
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,310
heavily use astragalus to replenish the Yang energy that has been depleted from external causes.

486
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,120
♫A melody fills the air, and the one before me stands unmatched♫

487
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,990
Second, it can help create tangible blood

488
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,350
from intangible Qi.

489
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,270
You've really improved.

490
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,520
♫The evening breeze invites the sunset, and rouge gently blushes beneath the moon♫

491
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,870
Since you've studied so hard,

492
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,990
I'll tell them to make a braised pork knuckle for you tonight.

493
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,820
♫Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your face♫

494
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,750
Thank you, Chief.

495
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,350
Chief.

496
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,550
Chief.

497
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,320
Look. I picked them.

498
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,150
You need to be careful with how you pick this herb.

499
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,590
Keep only the tip

500
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,840
and remove the core.

501
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,130
Don't confuse the two.

502
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,470
Exactly what I did.

503
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,230
You're rarely so meticulous, Feng Lyu.

504
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,960
Good.

505
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,160
Chief.

506
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,110
I promise

507
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,710
I'll always be so meticulous.

508
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,820
That's great.

509
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,700
I can worry less.

510
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,510
Chief.

511
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,370
Give me the finished ones.

512
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,180
Okay.

513
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,550
Chief.

514
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,950
Chief Xue.

515
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,470
Chief Xue.

516
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,310
I want to ask you for a favor.

517
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,950
What is it?

518
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,470
I want you

519
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,950
to teach me how to identify

520
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,080
detoxifying herbs.

521
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,750
If I get bitten by snakes or insects,

522
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,750
I can save myself.

523
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,470
You just saw me

524
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,750
walking around the valley

525
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,480
and not being needed anywhere,

526
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,270
so you want to find me something to do,

527
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,790
right?

528
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,890
Chief Xue, you misunderstood me.

529
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,710
Usually, those girls

530
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,850
can't answer any of my questions,

531
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,470
but today, they did everything perfectly.

532
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,190
I'm very happy.

533
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,710
It's all because

534
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,910
you taught them well.

535
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,510
You just have way too much time on your hands.

536
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,110
How about

537
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,640
I find you something to do?

538
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,270
Chief Xue.

539
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,770
Why did you bring me here?

540
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,950
Take off these lanterns.

541
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,670
Are you asking me to do that

542
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,120
because you think I have nothing else to do?

543
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,650
I'm not as obnoxious as you.

544
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,920
You hung those lanterns up,

545
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,150
so you need to

546
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,030
take them off.

547
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,150
You know it was me?

548
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,370
I haven't thanked you for it.

549
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,310
Without

550
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,050
your lanterns guiding me,

551
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,160
I wouldn't have found my way out.

552
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,190
Glad that you did.

572
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,210
I hope you can soon find

573
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,540
the secret of life in it.

574
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,670
Master.

575
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,990
Today, I finally

576
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,230
understand your intention.

577
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,880
What's wrong?

578
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,340
Nothing.

579
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,800
Since we're here,

580
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,380
how about

581
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,350
I take you to a place?

582
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,350
It took me days

583
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,680
to finally find the best place in the valley

584
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,070
to watch the sunset.

585
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,430
So beautiful.

586
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,590
It's not far from where

587
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,050
I collect Rootless Water.

588
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,110
But I've never been here.

589
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,080
I never knew

590
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,790
there was such a view here.

591
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,920
It's not too late to know it now.

592
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,890
The mist is like a brocade.

593
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,890
How dreamy and beautiful.

594
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,800
From here,

595
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,230
the view stretches far and wide,

596
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,750
and the sky is dazzlingly beautiful.

597
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,880
Such a fine prospect

598
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,150
makes one feel more open.

599
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,030
In the past,

600
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,390
when patients came to the valley for treatment,

601
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,750
I'd treat them.

602
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,810
Without patients,

603
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,190
I'd seek the truth

604
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,670
and try to awaken Xuehuai.

605
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,850
Day after day, I became used to it.

606
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,640
I really didn't know

607
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,630
what else

608
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,830
I could do.

609
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,070
But just now,

610
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
I suddenly had an idea.

611
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,390
Maybe

612
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,750
I should live for myself.

613
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
There are many

614
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,670
poisons without antidotes

615
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,920
and incurable diseases in this world.

616
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,960
I need to improve my medical skills

617
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
and write medical books.

618
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,670
Also,

619
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,230
I always hope that Shuang Hong and the others

620
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,090
can complete their training soon

621
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,050
and treat patients in far-off places for me.

622
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,350
If possible,

623
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,990
I hope one day

624
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,490
I can cure myself

625
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,940
so I can visit different places.

626
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,950
So,

627
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,590
there are still a lot of things

628
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,870
you need to do.

629
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,030
But I believe

630
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,230
no matter what you want to do,

631
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,710
with your talent,

632
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,810
you can definitely make it in the end.

633
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,310
How about you?

634
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,550
I'll get the fifth herb

635
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,350
for Mo first, of course.

636
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,830
I mean for yourself.

637
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,490
For myself?

638
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,670
I swore when I was little

639
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,950
to uphold justice

640
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,440
and help the weak.

641
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,150
Later, roaming the martial world,

642
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,480
I joined the Sword Sect.

643
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,890
I've always been doing what I wanted to do

644
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,890
at the beginning.

645
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,950
To be honest,

646
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,350
after I met you,

647
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,430
I had a new wish.

648
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,670
What is it?

649
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,550
In the past,

650
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,110
I helped people in danger

651
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,640
but only saved their lives.

652
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,230
Later, I saw how you treated your patients.

653
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,890
You not only saved their lives

654
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,650
but also healed their hearts.

655
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,320
I wish to do the same.

656
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,350
I want to help people in need

657
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,970
and bring peace to this world.

658
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,830
I want to get rid of all the bad guys

659
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,030
in the martial world.

660
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,630
I'll do my best

661
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,930
to make people in the world

662
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,470
suffer less

663
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,350
and have more joy.

664
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,390
In that case,

665
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,030
it's because of me

666
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,510
that you have that wish.

667
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,850
Shouldn't you pay me for that?

668
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,640
Is the beautiful view before your eyes

669
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,070
payment enough?

670
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:51,950
You owe me.
