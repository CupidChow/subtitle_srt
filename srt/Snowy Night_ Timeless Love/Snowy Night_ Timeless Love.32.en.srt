1
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
Is Chief Xue back?

2
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,630
Is Chief Xue back?

3
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,590
Did you send her back?

4
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,079
Is Chief Xue hurt?

5
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,370
Where is Chief Xue?

6
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,870
Is your chief injured?

7
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,030
Where is she?

8
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,600
Xiao Cheng!

9
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,490
Say something!

10
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Huo.

11
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,120
Ziye...

12
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,030
has passed.

13
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
-Mr. Seven!
-Mr. Seven!

14
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,200
Mr. Huo!

15
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,750
You're awake.

16
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,800
She committed suicide

17
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,280
with the golden needle.

18
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,650
How could this happen?

19
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,510
Do you know that Soul Devouring Powder,

20
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,760
the king of all poisons,

21
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,720
is incurable?

22
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,430
The only cure

23
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,730
is to trade a life for another.

24
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,230
In order to save her brother,

25
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
she absorbed

26
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,310
the poison in Eye.

27
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,230
Soul Devouring Powder is immensely cruel.

28
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,040
It not only corrodes the body

29
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
bit by bit

30
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,290
and completely disfigure you,

31
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,870
but it'll also eat away at your mind.

32
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,870
Ziye must've wanted to leave

33
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,560
before she loses all discernment.

34
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,360
You know

35
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,090
she didn't have many friends.

36
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,470
She didn't want to forget us.

37
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,030
She promised me

38
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,720
we'd drink together.

39
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,890
The last time she was passing out,

40
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,210
she still talked about returning to Apothecary Valley.

41
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,760
I guess it's because

42
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,130
she wanted to see you one last time.

43
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,000
But with the poison acting up

44
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,710
on top of her cold disease...

45
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,630
She must've endured it to the breaking point.

46
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,630
That's why she...

47
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,750
On my way back,

48
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,770
I asked myself countless times...

49
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,910
What if I had met her

50
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,890
a little sooner?

51
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,630
When I met her,

52
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,960
if she were still alive,

53
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,120
would I save her again

54
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
like before?

55
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm very grateful to the heavens

56
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,600
for sparing me

57
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,560
from making such a cruel decision.

58
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
Because I couldn't do it.

59
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,390
But Ziye did it.

60
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,840
She chose to sacrifice her life

61
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,790
to save others.

62
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,750
As her master,

63
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,290
I'm more timid than her.

64
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
As a doctor,

65
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,700
she's much more selfless than me.

66
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,960
Did she go

67
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,720
in peace?

68
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,630
Yes.

69
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,270
And with dignity.

70
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,100
It was what she'd have wanted.

71
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,150
I...

72
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,510
I just...

73
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,870
I missed it by one day.

74
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,390
Just one day!

75
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,270
Why?

76
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Why?

77
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Why couldn't you wait for me?

78
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Ziye had been waiting for you

79
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,850
to drink together.

80
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,270
When she left the valley,

81
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,240
she specifically told me

82
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,270
that if you come one day,

83
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I've to tell you

84
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,630
the wine has been buried under the plum tree.

85
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,000
This letter...

86
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,440
Ziye missed it.

87
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,640
If...

88
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,290
If Chief were still alive,

89
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,030
they should be

90
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,750
getting together under the plum tree,

91
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,000
catching up and joking around.

92
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Maybe they've already

93
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,030
reunited.

94
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,400
Her soul would've sensed it.

95
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,640
She should know

96
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,880
Mr. Seven is back.

97
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,060
Greetings, Chief.

98
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,610
You've changed.

99
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,590
You've really changed.

100
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,490
You look to be in good spirits.

101
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,840
You haven't changed at all.

102
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,830
Me?

103
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm old.

104
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,480
When the Seven Swords besieged Yuan Yi Palace,

105
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,880
I wanted to join,

106
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,720
but I was too weak to.

107
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,350
I didn’t expect such a weak

108
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,400
and sickly

109
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
woman like Chief Xue

110
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,030
to successfully

111
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
break into the tiger's den alone

112
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,350
to kill Chang Wujue.

113
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,270
You know everything?

114
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,680
Come.

115
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,110
Sit down.

116
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,620
Chonghua's infiltration

117
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,680
of Yuan Yi Palace as a spy

118
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,960
was top secret.

119
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,160
No one else knew

120
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,310
except me.

121
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,000
If I hadn't made

122
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,750
the undercover decision,

123
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,110
Both of you would

124
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,960
still be high-spirited brothers

125
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,590
standing united against the same enemy.

126
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,880
Things came to this because of me.

127
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,030
It's all my fault.

128
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,100
There's no right or wrong.

129
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,570
But in a blink of an eye,

130
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,240
you couldn't have expected

131
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,270
this outcome.

132
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,480
What about you?

133
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,920
Do you blame me

134
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,880
for not telling you

135
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,350
the truth back then?

136
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,830
Chief.

137
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,400
It's all in the past.

138
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,960
I've let it go.

139
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
Whether you'd

140
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,010
told me the truth or not,

141
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,650
without Sixth Brother around,

142
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,830
I'd still take good care of

143
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,890
his wife and child.

144
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,610
It's good that you've let it go.

145
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,920
With Chang Wujue dead

146
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,620
and the Five Sages destroyed,

147
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,990
Yuan Yi Palace has suffered a huge blow.

148
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,510
It won't be easy for them

149
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,070
to make a comeback.

150
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,310
The Central Plains

151
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,070
will be in peace for

152
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,510
at least a few good years.

153
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,540
It's time for an old man like me

154
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,510
to give way to the more capable.

155
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,510
I summoned you back

156
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
because of this.

157
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,030
Your expression

158
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,880
is exactly

159
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
the same as that eight years ago.

160
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,480
Chief.

161
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,920
Thank you

162
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,270
for your years of recognition

163
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,270
and cultivation.

164
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,880
In the past eight years,

165
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,720
I've gained some insights about

166
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,350
the martial world

167
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,210
and about responsibility.

168
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
Like you said,

169
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,790
a sickly woman

170
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,920
like Chief Xue

171
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,550
breaking into the tiger's den alone

172
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,720
to confront Chang Wujue

173
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,650
was such a brave and righteous act.

174
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,640
As a brawny man,

175
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
safeguarding world peace

176
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
and preventing tragedies

177
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
like the Mo Family Village massacre

178
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,550
is the meaning of my life from now on.

179
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,550
So,

180
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,350
rather than becoming chief,

181
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,350
I'd prefer to be in the martial world

182
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,830
to punish evil and promote good.

183
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
I'll never regret it.

184
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,030
In the future,

185
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,830
if Sword Sect's new chief

186
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,880
needs my help,

187
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,400
I'll give my all to help.

188
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
Fine.

189
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Since you've made up your mind,

190
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,510
I won't force you

191
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,110
to be chief.

192
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,400
But remember,

193
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,960
no matter where you go in the future,

194
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,350
as long as

195
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,350
you do what you want,

196
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,880
I'll be happy for you.

197
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,240
I won't let you down.

198
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,070
Be careful.

199
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,070
Careful, sir.

200
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,160
Thank you.

201
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Careful.

202
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,440
Xiao Jing!

203
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,200
Xiao Jing!

204
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,660
Coming!

205
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,200
Here.

206
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,510
Coming.

207
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,720
Give this medicine to Mr. Wang.

208
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,250
Hurry up.

209
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay.

210
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,510
Since the new chief revoked

211
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,510
the Fate-Reversal Tokens,

212
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,370
our valley's gotten much busier.

213
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,070
Indeed.

214
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,150
It's more lively too.

215
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,520
Thank you.

216
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,110
Thank you.

217
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,960
Careful, it's hot.

218
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,310
Okay.

219
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,590
Is this my medicine?

220
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,270
Yes.

221
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,620
Xiao Cheng.

222
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,410
Astragalus.

223
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:34,960
Here.

224
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,770
Follow this prescription.

225
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Thank you, Chief.

226
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,200
She buried

227
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,060
this wine under the plum tree.

228
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,680
Drink with me.

229
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,200
I never asked you...

230
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,700
why you studied medicine.

231
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,080
Because Ziye saved you too?

232
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,610
I was poisoned by the Ice Silkworm.

233
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,440
I experienced

234
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,880
a fate worse than death.

235
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't want

236
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,000
anyone else to go through that.

237
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,640
Besides,

238
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,350
I was once a patient.

239
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,110
Chief Xue cured me

240
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,290
and revitalized me.

241
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,770
So I stayed in the valley

242
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,510
to do my best

243
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,220
to repay her kindness.

244
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,920
She'll be so glad

245
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,430
to know this.

246
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
I owe it to the medical book

247
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,370
she left behind.

248
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
It contains the treatment methods

249
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,580
for all kinds of illnesses, major and minor.

250
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,110
Many of them

251
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,550
are rare prescriptions.

252
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,180
Every time I encounter a tricky illness,

253
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,830
I'd get inspired

254
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,970
just flipping through it.

255
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,960
This book

256
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,800
is her lifelong work.

257
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,880
She wrote a book

258
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,010
to save more people.

259
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Yes.

260
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,590
She did it.

261
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,940
Have you ever hated me?

262
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,750
Actually her biggest wish

263
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,550
was to save her brother

264
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,270
from the devil's cave.

265
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,550
Eye.

266
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,880
Sister Ye.

267
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,130
I’m here to see you.

268
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,880
Can I have a drink too?

269
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,720
Actually,

270
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,570
I could tell that she liked you very much.

271
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
It's all my fault.

272
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,620
Because she wanted to save me,

273
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,240
you couldn't be with her.

274
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,680
She'd have saved you either way.

275
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,760
A pot of new wine with green film

276
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,190
and a warm red-clay stove.

277
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,760
When it's about to snow in the evening,

278
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,710
can we

279
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,630
have a drink?

280
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,110
Tonight...

281
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,040
the song's complete,

282
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,710
and the people's dispersed.

283
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,630
Ziye.

284
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,190
Sister Ye.

285
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,590
Chief Xue.

286
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,920
Sister Ye.

287
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,500
I'm renouncing the world from now on.

288
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,800
I wonder if it will

289
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,190
wash away my sins.

290
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,480
I hope it's not too late.

291
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,760
Over the past decades,

292
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,080
I've been drinking with you every year.

293
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,710
Now I can drink

294
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,280
as well as you.

295
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,840
Come on.

296
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,550
As usual.

297
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,760
Three!

298
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,110
Five!

299
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,590
Six!

300
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,230
You lost!

301
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,500
I'll drink for you.

302
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,630
Come on.

303
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,480
Again.

304
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,110
Three!

305
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,710
Eight!

306
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,230
Six!

307
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,690
I'll drink. I'll drink.

308
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,230
In the past,

309
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
I could never beat you.

310
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,280
Now,

311
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,510
you can't beat me.
