[Episode 3]

4
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,870
Chief Xue.

5
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,560
Where is Madam Qiushui?

6
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,630
Mo woke up crying and making a fuss.

7
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,180
She is comforting him right now.

8
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,510
She should be here soon.

9
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,390
Chief Xue.

10
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,920
You summoned us here this time,

11
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,800
is it related to Mo's illness?

12
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,470
When Madam Qiushui arrives,

13
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,530
I will let you know.

14
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,390
Chief Xue,

15
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,079
before Yin arrives,

16
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,360
please speak your mind.

17
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,320
She has been exhausted lately.

18
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,720
She can't take any more shocks.

19
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,430
Mo’s illness

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,450
can't be cured.

21
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,270
Impossible.

22
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,570
Mo's condition

23
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,530
has improved in the past two days.

24
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,890
It must be curable.

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,480
What you see as his recovery now

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,950
is only because I previously

27
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,079
sealed several of his vital acupoints

28
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,310
to temporarily suppress the illness.

29
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,170
But this method

30
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,829
can only temporarily preserve his

31
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,630
life for now.

32
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,820
In the future, at an unknown time,

33
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,790
the illness will flare up and kill him.

34
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,590
And every day he lives from now on

35
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,530
will be in pain and suffering.

36
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,290
How can this be?

37
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,329
Why is this happening?

38
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,010
There is no why.

39
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,990
Mo's illness

40
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,030
has been incurable from the beginning.

41
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,160
That's not true.

42
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,070
When we entered the valley,

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,270
you said it yourself.

44
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,110
After three days,

45
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,430
Mo's condition would improve.

46
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,630
You said it yourself.

47
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,950
When I offered to help,

48
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,830
I was only trying my best.

49
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,970
If you were just trying your best,

50
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,620
how could you have been so confident

51
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,230
that it would only take three days?

52
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,190
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

53
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,190
a doctor will always try their best.

54
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,660
If I hadn't said that,

55
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,190
I'm afraid Mo

56
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,050
wouldn't have lived until today.

57
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,390
Chief Xue,

58
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,760
yesterday in the medicine hut,

59
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,680
you asked the attendant

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
if they had given Mo water.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
Yin's expression was strange at that time.

62
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,950
Is it because of this

63
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,860
that Mo's chance of survival is cut off?

64
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,800
Regardless of any changes in between,

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,480
Mo's illness

66
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,830
has no chance of survival.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,230
I shouldn't have given you

68
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,360
false hope.

69
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,710
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,040
Since Mo can't be cured here,

71
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,370
in this vast world,

72
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,880
there must be other miraculous doctors

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,810
who can cure him.

74
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,080
I'll go back and pack right away

75
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,470
to take Mo to seek other famous doctors.

76
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,650
If you can think like that,

77
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,670
it's good too.

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,670
Chief Xue,

79
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,290
please don't tell Yin about

80
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,220
Mo's situation.

81
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,800
Leave her a glimmer of hope.

82
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,310
Sometimes,

83
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,550
guilt and self-blame

84
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,490
hurt more than a blade.

85
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,510
It's a fact that I cannot cure his sickness.

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,180
It's my lack of medical skills.

87
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,780
I admit it.

88
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,590
I will instruct Shuang Hong

89
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,720
to return all 100,000 in medical fees.

90
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,910
Let's part ways here.

91
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,750
Thank you for taking care of Mo.

92
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,110
One last piece of advice for you.

93
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,030
Know when to let go.

94
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,430
Don't waste anymore effort.

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,470
I've sworn

96
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,270
to take good care of both of them.

97
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,000
As long as Mo is still alive,

98
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,360
as long as there is a ray of hope,

99
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,540
I will never give up.

100
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,110
I will do everything in my power

101
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,040
to cure Mo.

102
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,440
As long as there is a ray of hope,

103
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,610
I will never give up.

104
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,200
People always believe there's a way to force things,

105
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,680
because other than believing,

106
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,440
there's nothing else they can do.

107
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,230
Madam, you're back.

108
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,590
Your mother's back.

109
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,470
Madam, what's wrong?

110
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,350
Your complexion looks so poor.

111
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,910
Huan,

112
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,220
go find me some thick clothes.

113
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,040
Madam,

114
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,080
the thick clothes are all here.

115
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,050
Go look again.

116
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,980
Yes.

117
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,790
Mo,

118
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,230
I've let you down.

119
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,670
I've let you down.

120
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,100
I failed to

121
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,270
bring you into this world

122
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,630
in a healthy state.

123
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,390
It's all my fault.

124
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,080
In the next life,

125
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,850
in the next life...

126
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,210
Junior.

127
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,630
Mr. Seven.

128
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,630
Miss Huan.

129
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,710
Why isn't Yin here?

130
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,540
Madam was here just now.

131
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,830
She asked me to go to the carriage

132
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,270
to get some thick clothes.

133
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,870
But

134
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,170
the thick clothes are all in the room.

135
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,270
This jade ring

136
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,650
was given to Junior by Master's wife.

137
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,310
She would never part with it.

138
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,960
Miss Xiao Cheng,

139
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
have you seen Yin?

140
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,390
I saw Madam Qiushui

141
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,390
heading towards the back mountain.

142
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,250
It's time for Mo to take his medicine.

143
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,510
Why has everyone left?

144
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,070
Chief.

145
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,850
Madam Qiushui

146
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,970
left Mo in the room

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,070
and disappeared.

148
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,470
Mr. Seven went to search the back mountain.

149
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,870
Junior!

150
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,250
Don't come any closer.

151
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,430
Junior.

152
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,160
What are you doing here?

153
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,830
Senior.

154
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,430
Look.

155
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,680
Looking from here,

156
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,990
doesn't it look like the back mountain of the Celestial Alp Sect?

157
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,910
Back when we were in the Celestial Alp Sect,

158
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,310
you always took me to the back mountain.

159
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,070
We'd use our lightness skills to fly to the spruce tree

160
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,200
at the mountain peak to watch the snow.

161
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,270
I wonder if that tree is still there.

162
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,150
It is.

163
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,290
It must still be there.

164
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,990
Let's go back to the Celestial Alp Sect now.

165
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,450
Mo hasn't been to the Celestial Alp Sect yet.

166
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,270
We can't go back anymore.

167
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,290
Since I married into the Xu family,

168
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,550
we can't go back anymore.

169
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,140
Senior.

170
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,850
Regarding the words I said to you

171
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,710
at Chonghua's funeral,

172
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,960
please forget them.

173
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,110
Senior.

174
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,070
I truly wish

175
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,750
I had never known you.

176
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,630
You've ruined my entire life.

177
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,430
Perhaps

178
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,390
we should both let go now.

179
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,750
Junior.

180
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,990
It's dangerous at the edge of this cliff.

181
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,920
Come back first.

182
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,590
We can talk things through.

183
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,120
Mo is still waiting for you.

184
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,580
Don't come any closer!

185
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,050
Stop trying to fool me.

186
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
I heard what Chief Xue

187
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,080
said to you.

188
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,310
Mo has no hope left.

189
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,230
Every moment he lives

190
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,070
comes with more suffering for him.

191
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,950
How can that be?

Perhaps it's because of what happened over half a year ago.

379
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,500
Over half a year ago?

380
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,570
Over half a year ago...

381
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,310
It was heard that the sixth disciple of the Sword Sect,

382
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,670
Xu Chonghua, was on his way to Yuan Yi Palace

383
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,270
when he was killed at the cliff of Starfall Sea.

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,780
Was it Huo Zhanbai who killed him?

385
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,510
Xu Chonghua was my husband,

386
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,150
Mo's father.

387
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,690
Half a year ago,

388
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,590
Chonghua severely injured many

389
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,990
elders of the Sword Sect.

390
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,060
He betrayed the Central Plains and fled to Western Kunlun.

391
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,790
Senior was ordered by Chief Nangong

392
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,860
to pursue Chonghua.

393
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,790
Before he left, he promised me

394
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,380
that he would bring Chonghua back safely.

395
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,320
But in the end, what he brought back

396
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,780
was the news of Chonghua's death.

397
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,510
Xu Chonghua severely injured many elders.

398
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,990
Huo Zhanbai killed the traitor.

399
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,430
It's understandable.

400
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,960
Still,

401
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,230
Chonghua and he were sworn brothers.

402
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,570
He and I are senior and junior disciples.

403
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,700
We grew up together.

404
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,350
Regardless of whose feelings he considered,

405
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,040
he shouldn't have killed him so mercilessly.

406
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,070
Moreover, the chief originally

407
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,930
only ordered Chonghua's capture.

408
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,870
Chonghua's punishment

409
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,920
should have been decided by the sect.

410
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,790
But he directly took

411
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,790
Chonghua's life.

412
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,530
Mo was born

413
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,790
without a father.

414
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,430
You lost your husband too.

415
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,310
I can see

416
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,200
that you resent him.

417
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,870
After he came back,

418
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,710
he was carefree and unrestrained

419
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,040
just like he was before.

420
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,350
Seeing him like that,

421
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,400
I thought he didn't care

422
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,890
about Chonghua's matter.

423
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,870
If he really didn't care,

425
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,220

426

432
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,450
Moreover, he risked his life

Even those close to him

437
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,170
cannot fathom his inner turmoil.

438
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,830

439

So what if he killed him?

For the sake of a promise,

You said you'd take care of my wife and child.

564
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,030
You promised me!

565
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,590
You can't save anyone.

566
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,320
What are you still waiting for?

567
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,930
You can't save anyone.

568
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,950
You promised me!

569
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,270
You can't save anyone!

570
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,630
You can't save anyone...

571
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,310
You promised me.

572
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,110
You can't save anyone!

573
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,040
You promised me!

574
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,450
Senior!

575
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,790
Junior!

576
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,200
Huo Zhanbai,

577
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,730
I've found an ancient prescription

578
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,190
that can cure Mo's illness.

579
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,830
Only if you wake up can you save him.

580
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,760
Wake up quickly.

581
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,790
Wake up!

582
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,160
Huo Zhanbai?

583
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,070
It's you.

584
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,590
You just said

585
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,030
you've found

586
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,790
a way to cure Mo.

587
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,550
Is it true?

588
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,510
I found

589
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,190
a prescription in an ancient book

590
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,250
that exactly matches Mo's symptoms.

591
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,920
That's great!

592
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,430
How long have I been lying here?

593
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,030
It's been over three months.

594
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,940
Where's my junior?

595
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,260
She's outside.

596
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,560
I'll call her in.

597
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,670
He...

598
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,870
How is he?

599
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,790
He's awake.

600
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,330
Thank you, Chief Xue.

601
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,660
Senior!

602
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,310
Senior.

603
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,190
You... you're finally awake.

604
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,470
Junior.

605
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,060
Senior.

606
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,910
It's all my fault for being so reckless.

607
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,670
I shouldn't have jumped off the cliff.

608
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,190
I almost got you killed.

609
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,920
It's all in the past now.

610
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,550
You're right.

611
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,720
As long as one is alive,

612
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,030
there is hope.

613
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,560
Mo finally has a chance to be saved.

614
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,270
Thanks to the Doctrine Leader's mercy,

615
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,530
we managed to survive.

616
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Doctrine Leader.

617
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,820
We've brought them here.

618
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,860
What are you waiting for?

619
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,120
Come quickly and pay your respects to the Doctrine Leader.

620
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,520
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

621
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,840
Why aren't you kneeling before the Doctrine Leader?

622
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,550
It's fine.

623
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
For you two to have survived

624
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,190
and escaped from the Asura Field,

625
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,250
it's no small feat.

626
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,720
However, only the most elite fighters

627
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,790
are fit to stay by my side.

628
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,270
You two

629
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,630
are different from those useless goons.

630
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,870
One of you has the agility of a fleeing rabbit.

631
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,130
The other has moves as fierce as an eagle.

632
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,750
I cannot bear to watch

633
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,190
any of you die.

634
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,630
How about this?

635
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,840
Tonight, I'll let you two choose.

636
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,330
The one who survives till morning

637
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,110
will become Yuan Yi Palace's

638
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,030
top assassin.

639
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,910
However,

640
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,550
if you're both alive

641
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,990
by tomorrow morning,

642
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,170
I'll let you both go back.

643
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,550
Thank you for your mercy, Doctrine Leader.

644
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,150
You may go.

645
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,350
Doctrine Leader,

646
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,190
will you really let those two

647
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,320
leave the mountain?

648
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,990
Do you think such a sacred place

649
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,870
should have such filthy things?

650
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,390
I'm sorry, Doctrine Leader.

651
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:03,830
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,760
I'll clean it up for you right away.

653
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm just teasing you.

654
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,110
Look.

655
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,800
The moon is about to set.

656
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,910
Dawn is approaching.

657
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
If we can just make it till daybreak,

658
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,920
we can leave this place.

659
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,120
After we go down the mountain,

660
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,870
we'll go our separate ways

661
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,280
and never meet again.

662
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,920
Treat everything that happened here

663
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,240
as a nightmare

664
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,230
and forget it all.

665
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,850
However...

666
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,690
No one can be trusted.

667
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,560
Naive people

668
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,950
deserve to die.
