What are you doing in Yangzhou?

00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,829
Carrying out an important mission.

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,250
An important mission?

14
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,230
The mission is complete.

Fourth Brother,

29
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,770
you've been looking at this letter for a while.

30
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,270
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

31
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,110
This letter

32
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,880
is indeed in Seven's handwriting.

33
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,030
It's true that it's in Seventh Brother's handwriting.

34
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,470
But Seventh Brother isn't stupid.

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,130
If he really intended to kill,

36
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,030
why would he leave a letter

37
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,630
and bring trouble upon himself?

38
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,420
Even if this letter

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,829
was left by Seventh Brother,

40
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,950
at most, it only proves

41
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,280
that he has the Azure Phoenix Flower.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,990
It doesn't prove

43
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,050
that he killed him.

44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,670
But what does he need the Azure Phoenix Flower for?

45
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,400
For this Azure Phoenix Flower,

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,900
he even deliberately led us away.

47
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,790
Fourth Brother, are you saying

48
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,720
that you suspect Seventh Brother?

49
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,270
When did I say that?

50
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,670
Don't jump to conclusions on my behalf.

51
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,510
I just don't understand.

52
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,240
Fourth Brother,

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,310
we've worked together at the Sword Sect for many years.

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,390
You and I know Seventh Brother's character

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,520
better than anyone.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,710
There's no way he could have done this.

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,030
I know that.

58
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,150

60
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,790
It was definitely not caused by Dark Soul Sword.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,390
Then what are we waiting for?

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,190
Let's go explain this

63
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,450
to Chief Lin right now.

64
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,470
I just heard

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,870
that the people from White Cloud Palace have already

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,470
tracked down Seventh Brother's whereabouts

67
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,070
and are about to go after him.

68
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,010
You really are thick-headed.

69
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,709
Right before Mr. Qin died,

70
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,490
he made it clear

71
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,950
that the killer was Seven.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Chief Lin is convinced it was Seven.

73
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,050
With just this bit of evidence,

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,800
how do you expect him to listen to your explanation?

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,060
Then what should we do?

76
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,000
You set off immediately to catch up with them.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,730

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,990
try to hold back Chief Lin temporarily

79
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,990
to prevent him from confronting Seven directly.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,990
I'll stay here for now

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,180
to investigate this matter further.

82
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,320
Well, Fourth Brother,

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,190
where do you plan to start your investigation?

84
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,190
Don't say so much.

85
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,070

86
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,510

Who is it?

89
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,290
The ancestral pulse case states that

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,670
there was no cure for this condition at the time,

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,400
and we could only prescribe medication to alleviate the pain.

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,470
However, a patient with the same condition

93
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,870
that I treated last month

94
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,840
has recovered using both acupuncture and medicine.

95
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,450
Therefore, similar difficult cases

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,680
can also be cured with this approach.

00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,670
I accidentally knocked over the cup.

99
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,730
Did you get burned?

100
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm fine.

Is it a letter from Sister Jing?

105
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,950
Yes.

was stolen in the fourth year of Huijia era.

112
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,510
I have sent people to look for

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,430
how dangerous it was

141
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
to obtain the Azure Phoenix Flower?

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,670
I originally thought that when I arrived in Yangzhou,

143
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,420
it would take at least half a month

144
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,909
to get news about the Azure Phoenix Flower.

145
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,770
I didn't expect

146
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,310
that as soon as I inquired, I found out

147
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,590
that the Azure Phoenix Flower was right in Linglong Flower Realm.

148
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,190
What kind of place is Linglong Flower Realm?

149
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,950
It's a place where men go for entertainment.

As a man of integrity,

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,430
how could I go to such a place?

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,900
Where's the Azure Phoenix Flower?

I...

155
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,510
I still have many stories

156
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,510
to share with you.

Chief Xue,

160
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,070
after I safely deliver the flower,

161
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,270
I'll take a short rest

162
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,110
before heading out to find the next herb.

163
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,210
You took the Azure Phoenix Flower from White Cloud Palace.

164
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,210
Do you think they will just let it go?

165
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,350
I will definitely find another opportunity

166
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,670
to personally go to White Cloud Palace and apologize.

167
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,790
Chief, bad news!

168
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,640
Some people came to break into the valley!

169
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,720
It's probably trouble you caused.

170
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,950
I can handle this myself.

171
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,030
Wait.

172
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,510
Later,

173
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,390
you and the people from White Cloud Palace

174
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,520
will inevitably have a fierce battle.

175
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,230
If you unfortunately die…

176
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,760
Don't worry.

177
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,270
After all, we have experienced

178
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,630
a near-death night together.

179
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,350
I will handle your remains

180
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,150
and won't let you become a wandering ghost.

181
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,630
It's just that

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,650
who is going to pay back the debts

183
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,290
you owe me?

184
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,480
I will try not to trouble you

185
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,570
and will pay the debts myself.

186
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,830
I originally had no intention to get involved.

187
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,650
But you're going to start a conflict

188
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,790
at the entrance of our Apothecary Valley.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,650
Won't that damage my reputation?

190
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,320
Well, Chief Xue, what do you mean?

191
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,690
Xiao Cheng,

192
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,080
open the valley gate

193
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,230
and treat them with courtesy.

194
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,670
Yes!

195
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,150
Chief Lin.

196
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,950
I presume

197
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,810
you are Chief Lin of White Cloud Palace, right?

198
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,160
I am Lin Tianbao.

199
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,550
I apologize for the disturbance caused by

200
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,880
my coming to the Apothecary Valley today.

201
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,530
Greetings, Chief Lin.

202
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,070
Is your grand presence here with so many people

203
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,930
for the Azure Phoenix Flower?

204
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,950
Chief Xue, since you are being so straightforward,

205
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,550
I won't beat around the bush.

206
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,670
Huo Zhanbai snatched the Azure Phoenix Flower

207
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,870
and brought it to the Apothecary Valley.

208
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,630
Chief Xue,

209
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,930
do you know the reason?

210
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,840
If the Apothecary Valley is involved,

211
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,630
I will hold you accountable as well.

212
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,230
Chief Lin.

213
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,590
Chief Lin,

214
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,960
it was indeed my fault for privately taking

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,950
the Azure Phoenix Flower from your sect.

216
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,830
But it has nothing to do with Chief Xue.

217
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,930
Please don't make things difficult for her.

218
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,870
Can a mere "it was indeed my fault"

219
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,820
absolve you of the crime of murder?

220
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,990
Murder?

221
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,990
You killed and took the flower.

222
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,980
I'll make you pay with your life.

223
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,730
I admit to taking the flower.

224
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,590
But why do you accuse me of murder?

225
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
Are you saying...

226
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,920
that Qin Tiancheng is dead?

227
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,000
You're still playing innocent here?

228
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,530
You killed Tiancheng.

229
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
The entire White Cloud Palace

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
will never let you go.

231
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,110
No wonder there's such a big commotion.

232
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,590
Chief Lin,

233
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,910
I did take the Azure Phoenix Flower.

234
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,500
But I have never killed anyone.

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,150
Is there perhaps

236
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,310
some misunderstanding?

237
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,440
Misunderstanding?

238
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,470
What misunderstanding could there be?

239
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,580
If Tiancheng was still alive

240
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,990
after you took the flower,

241
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,540
why would anyone else want to kill him?

242
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,470
If it wasn't you,

243
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,270
then who else could it be?

244
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Seventh Brother,

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,310
what exactly happened

246
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,710
when you took the flower?

247
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,470
At that time, I saw Qin Tiancheng

248
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,670
about to give the Azure Phoenix Flower

249
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,600
to Envoy Miao Huo of Yuan Yi Palace.

250
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,350
After

251
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,300
I got the flower,

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,160
I left Linglong Flower Realm.

253
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,030
Are there any witnesses?

254
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,630
Besides the people from Yuan Yi Palace,

255
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,000
there are no witnesses.

256
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,950
No witnesses?

257
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,630
Are you telling me that just because of

258
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,070
your reputation in the martial world,

259
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,740
I should believe

260
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,000
your one-sided story?

261
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,290
Everything I said is true.

262
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,020
There are no falsehoods.

263
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,750
Those are just empty words.

264
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,950
Who would believe you?

265
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,750
I believe you.

266
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,670
I know you are not someone

267
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,930
who indiscriminately kills innocents.

268
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,110
However, the Apothecary Valley

269
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,050
never gets involved in the affairs of the martial world.

270
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,710
This matter

271
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,090
needs to be resolved by yourself.

272
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,830
Seventh Brother.

273
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,790
I believe you too.

274
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,110
Mr. Lin,

275
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,350
since you are so certain that I killed him,

276
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,440
then let me ask you:

277
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,910
why did I leave a note to Xingzhi,

278
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,030
telling him that I took the Azure Phoenix Flower?

279
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,990
Wouldn't that be inviting trouble upon myself?

280
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,390
These were all your tricks to obscure the truth.

281
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,870
Fine.

282
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,910
The people from Yuan Yi Palace also wanted to take the flower.

283
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,570
Everyone present knows this.

284
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,800
Why do you not suspect

285
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,840
that they were the ones who killed him

286
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,370
and are so certain it was me?

287
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't try to divert attention.

288
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,550
Before Tiancheng passed away,

289
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,310
he personally identified you as the murderer.

290
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,970
The evidence is irrefutable.

291
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,670
He personally identified me?

292
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,110
Yes.

293
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,910
At that time, Xia Qianyu

294
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,470
and Zhou Xingzhi were both present

295
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,950
and witnessed it with their own eyes.

296
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,680
How can you argue against that?

297
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,760
Apart from the deceased's testimony,

298
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,400
is there any other evidence

299
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,630
that proves it was me?

300
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,790
Aren't these considered evidence?

301
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,270
Yes.

302
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,470
But these are still not enough.

303
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,110
Can you confirm the location, shape,

304
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,110
and size of the wound on the deceased?

305
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,710
Were there any signs of poisoning?

306
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,010
Was the fatal blow dealt by a sword or something else?

307
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,800
Was the wound

308
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,950
caused by my sword?

309
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,590
Chief Lin, can you confirm all of these?

310
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,730
Tiancheng's wound is under his ribs.

311
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,950
The sword wound is indeed not fatal.

312
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,750
He died from excessive blood loss.

313
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,950
This is the key point.

314
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,070
Mr. Lin,

315
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,930
please think about it.

316
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,580
If I had intended to kill him,

317
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,320
I certainly wouldn't have left any evidence

318
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,980
that could lead you back to me.

319
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,650
And I wouldn't have left any opportunity

320
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,510
for Qin Tiancheng to identify me.

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,630
Furthermore, my Fourth Brother

322
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,960
has examined the wound.

323
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,550
He said it was not caused by Dark Soul Sword.

324
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,630
Given this,

325
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,750
we need to consider this matter further.

326
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,220
Consider further?

327
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Tiancheng has already been buried.

328
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,570
Are you suggesting I open the coffin for an autopsy?

329
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,750
Chief Xue,

330
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,590
I have always respected the Apothecary Valley.

331
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,280
I know

332
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,970
you have been deceived by him,

333
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,710
so I won't hold you accountable.

334
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,430
But I must ask that the Apothecary Valley

335
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,160
refrain from interfering in the affairs of our White Cloud Palace.

336
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,750
So what if you want

337
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,600
to hold me accountable?

338
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,630
I'm offering friendly advice.

339
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,880
If you don't listen,

340
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,330
don't blame me for turning hostile.

341
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,710
You see,

342
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,960
I am the type who is easily provoked.

343
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,620
The more you try to stop me from doing something,

344
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,490
the more I will insist on doing it.

345
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
So, are you saying

346
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,970
that for Huo Zhanbai,

347
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,340
you will make an exception and interfere

348
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,150
in the affairs of the martial world?

349
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,950
That's right.

350
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,270
Today, I insist on protecting this person.

351
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,710
What can you do about it?

352
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,590
Today, I'll see who dares

353
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,750
to act recklessly in the Apothecary Valley!

354
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,150
You...

355
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,790
Chief Xue,

356
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,830
there are rumors in the martial world

357
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,290
that you like pretty boys.

358
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,470
Could it be that you have a crush on him,

359
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,070
which is why you are so protective of him?

360
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,310
Chief Lin, please focus on the matter at hand

361
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,970
and do not be rude to Chief Xue.

362
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,360
Since the whole story has been explained,

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,270
why not leave this matter

364
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,030
to our Sword Sect?

365
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,890
Leave it to you?

366
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,750
Who knows if the people from the Sword Sect

367
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,990
will collude with each other?

368
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,470
Shut up!

369
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,030
How dare you slander the Sword Sect so casually?

370
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,430
You...

371
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,830
Chief Nangong

372
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,430
is a close friend of mine for many years.

373
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,690
I trust his character.

374
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,350
However, Huo Zhanbai first

375
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,950
deliberately lured me away,

376
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
then snatched the Azure Phoenix Flower

377
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,940
and killed Tiancheng.

378
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,150
Today,

379
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,480
I will not let you go.

380
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
Seventh Brother!

381
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,069
Chief Lin,

382
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,640
this matter is not yet settled.

383
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,260
How can you act so ruthlessly?

384
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,060
He wants to prove his innocence.

385
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,390
Do not act rashly.

386
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Why didn't you dodge?

387
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
I didn't kill him.

388
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,410
Why should I dodge?

389
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,270
Chief Lin,

390
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,480
do you want to continue?

391
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,360
What's going on?

392
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,470
Why are there two Huo Zhanbais?

393
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,680
Something's wrong.

394
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,370
Chief Lin.

395
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,150
Who are you?

396
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,280
Fourth Brother?

397
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,220
Why are there two Huo Zhanbais?

398
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,430
It's me.

399
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,310
Chief Lin.

400
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,030
Disguise technique?

401
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,190
After we parted that day,

402
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,590
I returned to Linglong Flower Realm.

403
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,160
Who is it?

404
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,740
Miss Liu?

405
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,020
Did you come here

406
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,150
about Mr. Huo?

407
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,950
The murderer is not Mr. Huo.

408
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,390
I saw Mr. Huo twice today.

409
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,310
The first time was at 6 pm.

410
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,200
I remember it very clearly.

411
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,710
I was playing music.

412
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,520
When he walked in and saw me,

413
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,790
he nodded to me politely

414
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,910
and then

415
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,590
went upstairs.

416
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,910
The second time was at 7 pm,

417
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,950
but he was completely different,

418
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,210
very cold and distant.

419
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,870
I found it strange at the time

420
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,710
that his demeanor had changed so suddenly.

421
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,510
Now it seems

422
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,470
the person I saw the second time

423
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,950
was not Mr. Huo at all.

424
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,390
So

425
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,310
where did you find these?

426
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,000
After the murder occurred,

427
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,240
I felt something was off,

428
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,310
so I started looking for clues.

429
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,480
I found these in the back alley.

430
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,780
It seems

431
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,990
someone framed him.

432
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,450
Unfortunately, I am just a weak woman

433
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,310
and could only find these clues.

434
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,590
I don't know

435
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,190
if they can help Mr. Huo.

436
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,070
Miss Liu, you're being too modest.

437
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,550
This is a great help.

438
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,720
Fourth Brother,

439
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,070
thank you.

440
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,790
You don't need to thank me.

441
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,630
Just take care of your injuries.

442
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,370
I don't want Sword Sect

443
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,640
to be disgraced because of you.

444
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,570
Fourth Brother.

445
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,670
For now,

446
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,100
I'll trust you.

447
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,390
But that doesn't mean

448
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,870
you're not the murderer.

449
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,910
I will investigate this thoroughly.

450
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,630
If I find out

451
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,310
you've been hiding anything from me,

452
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,240
I will not let you

453
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,270
off the hook, no matter where you go.

454
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,830
Sir.

455
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,350
I have one more favor to ask of you.

456
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,210
I'm listening.

457
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,400
I took the Azure Phoenix Flower

458
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,830
not for myself,

459
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,610
but for my Sixth Brother's child.

460
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,480
My Sixth Brother's child is seriously ill

461
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,490
and needs the Azure Phoenix Flower to save his life.

462
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,950
Chief Lin, could you please

463
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,810
give me the Azure Phoenix Flower?

464
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,310
In the future, if your White Cloud Palace

465
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
needs my help,

466
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,710
I, Seven,

467
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,430
will not hesitate

468
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,750
to go through fire and water for you.

469
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Your Sixth Brother?

470
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,600
Xu Chonghua?

471
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,760
Exactly.

472
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,230
Chief Lin,

473
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,450
now, do you understand

474
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,400
why Seven hurried back to the Apothecary Valley

475
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,130
right after he took the flower?

476
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,070
For a deceased friend's child,

477
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,590
he was willing to risk his life to seize the flower.

478
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,790
He can be considered a chivalrous person.

479
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,250
You took the Azure Phoenix Flower

480
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,410
to save that child,

481
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
which was indeed a noble act.

482
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,690
It's much better than it falling into

483
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,040
the hands of those with ill intentions

484
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,700
and aiding their wrongdoing.

485
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,850
Thank you, Sir.

486
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,590
I know that this matter arose because of me.

487
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,630
After I finish gathering the medicine,

488
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,760
I will surely find out

489
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,090
the murderer of Mr. Qin,

490
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,040
restoring justice to the White Cloud Palace.

491
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,830
This matter involves Yuan Yi Palace,

492
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,360
so it may not be that simple.

493
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,710
Chief Lin,

494
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,910
why don't you come back to the Sword Sect with me

495
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,040
to discuss this matter with our chief?

496
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,710
Very well.

497
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,630
Chief Xue,

498
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,790
people in the martial world

499
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,310
all say you have an eccentric personality.

500
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,430
But upon meeting you this time,

501
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,230
I found that you are actually a courageous and righteous person.

502
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,030
I admire that.

503
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,000
Sorry for offending you during our visit

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,750
to the Apothecary Valley this time.

505
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,350
Farewell.

506
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,770
You got injured after all.

507
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
Fortunately, it's not serious.

508
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,710
Let's go to the medicine hut.

509
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,640
Fourth Brother,

510
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,320
let's go.

511
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,870
Eight,

512
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,570
you go back first

513
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,470
and tell the chief

514
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,290
that I'll stay here

515
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,610
for a few more days.

516
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,500
Do you think you can enter the Apothecary Valley

517
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,390
as you please?

518
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,510
You must have the Fate-Reversal Token

519
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,910
and pay a fee of 100,000 coins for the consultation.

520
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,330
Although I don't have the Fate-Reversal Token,

521
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,450
I have money.

522
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,070
I'll cover Seven's

523
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,490
medical expenses.

524
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,800
Shuang Hong, I've left it here.

525
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,680
You owe me another debt for the treatment now.

526
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,250
Just put it on my tab.

527
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,110
You drank this without even asking

528
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,750
what it is?

529
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,750
Chief Xue, if you wanted to harm me,

530
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,150
I would've died long ago.

531
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,350
Thank you.

532
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,690
♫Who is brewing the medicine, as the fragrance slowly filters through the window?♫

533
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,370
♫You lower your gaze, grinding herbs, your hand gently brushing my wound♫

534
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,200
♫Following your eyes, I see the flowers fall softly into my palm♫

535
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,450
♫I wish to speak, yet my thoughts remain unspoken♫

536

537

Shuang Hong.

♫The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauze♫

539
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,200
Chief.

540
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,320
He's lost too much blood.

541
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,870
Go and make a bowl of Eight Treasures Soup.

542
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,630
♫The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heart♫

543
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,660
Yes.

544
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,040
♫As we share stories of our pasts♫

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,510
Hell.

552

♫New medicine heals old wounds, aged wine cools with time♫

553

♫The evening breeze invites the sunset, and rouge gently blushes beneath the moon♫

556

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,710
otherwise, many parts of my body

♫Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your face♫

559
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,170
would've been useless by now.

560
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,470
Shut up.

561
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,610
Stay still.

562
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,510
The effect of the anesthetic powder has just worn off.

563
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,910
You might feel some pain.

564
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
Try to bear with it.

565
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,650
Don't move.

566
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,200
♫White moonlight peers over the courtyard walls, spreading frost upon the ground♫

567
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,310
Don't move.

568
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,910
Endure the itch.

569
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,940
♫The night is long, and you adorn yourself behind the gauze♫

570
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,660
♫The swaying shadows of the trees stir my heart♫

571
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,600
♫As we share stories of our pasts♫

572
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,840
♫Beneath the starlight♫

573
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,160
♫We exchange glances, like medicine simmering slowly over time♫

574
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,820
♫In the dim light, the person in my dream remains serene♫

575
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,730
♫Your dark hair cascades over your white robes♫

576
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,590
♫From this moment on, the distance between us will be as long as time itself♫

577
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,360
♫New medicine heals old wounds, aged wine cools with time♫

578
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,900
♫A melody fills the air, and the one before me stands unmatched♫

579
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:40,040
♫The evening breeze invites the sunset, and rouge gently blushes beneath the moon♫

580
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,190
Stop looking.

581
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:46,570
♫Though fate is uncertain, I shall always remember your face♫

582
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,970
What's the matter?

583
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,590
Nothing.

584
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,270
I just want to ask,

585
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,630
when will my injury heal?

586
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,990
This time,

587
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,040
your shoulder bone is injured.

588
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,920
This hole

589
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,480
will need at least three months of rest

590
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,600
here in the valley.

591
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,230
Three months?

592
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,830
Is there any way to heal faster?

593
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,670
It's...

594
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,010
What are you doing?

595
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,790
How about letting Ms. Shuang Hong

596
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,550
treat me?

597
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,720
Chief Xue, don't you need

598
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,030
the Fate-Reversal Token and the consultation fee

599
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,360
to treat me personally?

600
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,900
I've already seen your whole body.

601
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,880
Why are you

602
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,370
suddenly feeling shy now?

603
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,430
Don't worry.

604
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,870
In my eyes,

605
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,320
you're no different from a bronze statue.

606
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,990
What?

607
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,520
Even a bronze statue can feel pain?

608
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,130
You were too rough in treating me.

609
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,640
Someone was too harsh with you.

610
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,550
Someone deliberately set you up.

611
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,150
You should really reflect on

612
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,830
why you have so many enemies.

613
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,230
Perhaps

614
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,670
I'm not the target in this matter.

615
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,600
What do you mean?

616
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,430
Logically,

617
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,840
since Qin Tiancheng has allied with Yuan Yi Palace,

618
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,760
Yuan Yi Palace

619
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,270
certainly wouldn't have killed him.

620
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,110
But it's possible

621
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,630
they might have done the opposite

622
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,710
to deliberately distance themselves.

623
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,830
After all, with Qin Tiancheng dead,

624
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,990
the Seven-Star Sword Formation

625
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,320
of the White Cloud Palace would be broken.

626
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,850
But why did that person

627
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,450
disguise themselves as you?

628
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,150
I don't know.

629
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,600
After all, besides the people of the Apothecary Valley,

630
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,120
no one knew about my plan

631
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,230
to obtain the Azure Phoenix Flower.

632
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,960
You just barely escaped death,

633
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,640
and yet you actually have the energy

634
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,900
to talk nonsense here?

635
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,090
Lie down.

636
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,190
Ladies,

637
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,510
it's been quite a while.

638
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,950
How's my Seventh Brother doing?

639
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,020
The chief hasn't come out yet.

640
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,390
We don't know either.

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,890
You said you'd pay Mr. Huo's treatment fee.

642
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,690
Have you paid?

643
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,310
As long as my Seventh Brother is fine,

644
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,110
I'll gladly pay the fee right away.

645
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,390
As long as you pay the fee,

646
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,320
we can guarantee Mr. Huo's safety.

647
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
Miss,

648
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,930
you really are quick-witted.

649
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,130
It seems that in the Apothecary Valley,

650
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,460
it's not just Chief Xue,

651
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,850
but everyone here is quite interesting.

652
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,800
Feng Lyu,

653
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,880
since he's a friend of Mr. Seven,

654
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
stop teasing him.

655
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,180
Mr. Seven is currently fine.

656
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,170
He just needs some time

657
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,010
to recover.

658
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,500
There is one more thing

659
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,770
I'd like to ask you.

660
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,920
Please go ahead.

661
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,110
Just now, Seven said

662
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,190
he took the Azure Phoenix Flower

663
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,670
for Xu Chonghua's child.

664
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,510
Is that true?

665
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,390
Yes.

666
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,130
For the past few years, Mr. Seven

667
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,630
has been searching for medicine for Mo.

668
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,830
When was the first time he entered the valley?

669
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,160
Was it around New Year's Eve two years ago?

670
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,270
Yes.

671
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,190
So,

672
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,930
he started from that time.

673
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,190
Back then, the chief

674
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,910
gave a prescription that required five ingredients.

675
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,530
Including the Seven-Leaf Fungus and the Azure Phoenix Flower,

676
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,490
Mr. Huo has already obtained

677
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,170
two of them.

678
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,880
The Seven-Leaf Fungus and Azure Phoenix Flower

679
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,270
are already extremely rare medicinal ingredients,

680
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,270
yet they are only two of the ones in the prescription?

681
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,310
There's also the Dragon's Tongue

682
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
from the sheer cliffs of Mount Jun in Dongting,

683
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,990
the Snow Poppy from Qingling Snow Mountain,

684
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,510
and the Millennial Cold Dragon Blood Pearl.

685
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,840
These five ingredients

686
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,150
are all rare

687
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,410
and scattered across different places.

688
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,670
To gather them,

689
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,710
one must risk their life.

690
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,390
I had no idea

691
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,590
he's been doing this.

692
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,470
Aren't both of you

693
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,790
one of the seven disciples of the Sword Sect?

694
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,650
How could you not know about this?

695
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,550
Seven.

696
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,070
Seven!

697
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:29,920
Seven.

698
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,510
Seven.

699
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,390
I'm sorry.

700
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,960
Seven,

701
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,910
you've been risking your life

702
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,270
searching for medicinal ingredients for Mo.

703
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

704
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,830
If I hadn't come

705
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,700
to the Apothecary Valley today,

706
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,090
I still wouldn't know.

707
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,310
I thought

708
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,470
you didn't care about the matter of Chonghua at all.

709
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,010
I even treated you coldly.

710
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,730
I really...

711
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,840
Fourth Brother,

712
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,880
what good would it do to tell you?

713
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,560
Sixth Brother wouldn't come back to life.

714
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,910
I can only do my best

715
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,950
to keep Mo alive.

716
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,050
After all, Sixth Brother died by my hand.

717
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,580
I'd rather you hate me.

718
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,720
My good brother.

719
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,820
With your shoulder bone injured

720
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,680
and your right arm affected,

721
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,190
you shouldn't move too much.

722
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,270
You need someone to take good care of you.

723
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,830
Shuang Hong.

724
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,430
I'll do it!

725
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
I'll take care of him.

726
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,830
Fourth Brother, you just came to the Apothecary Valley.

727
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,790
Why don't we let Ms. Shuang Hong and her companions

728
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,190
do it?

729
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,590
There's no need to trouble the girls in the valley.

730
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,190
Seven,

731
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,740
trust me. I can do this.

732
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,890
Can you handle it?

733
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,530
I can.

734
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
Alright then.

735
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,560
Chief Xue, please wait.

736
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,430
I haven't had the chance to introduce myself yet.

737
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,100
I am Xia Qianyu, the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect

738
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,030
and the only son of the Huashan Sect leader.

739
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,420
In the martial world, I'm known by the name

740
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,920
White Feather Sword.

741
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,270
I have long heard of you.

742
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,830
It is truly a fateful encounter

743
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,670
to meet you today.

744
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,190
Drink the medicine

745
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,050
while it's hot.

746
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:29,710
Here.

747
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,110
Drink your medicine.

748
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,429
Let me feed you. Here.

749
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,020
I can do it myself.

750
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,350
I can do it myself!

751
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,150
It's alright.

752
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,360
I'll treat you to a drink tonight.

753
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,090
Sounds good.

754
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,270
Here.

755
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,870
Come on.

756
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,440
Fourth Brother.

757
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,190
this time you should raise your glass with me, right?

758
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,790
Of course.

759
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,900
Here.

760
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,270
Let me.

761
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,590
You're injured.

762
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,430
By the way, Fourth Brother,

763
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,160
there's another thing I want to discuss with you.

764
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,400
Ever since the Yuan Yi Palace was expelled

765
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
from the Central Plains by the Sword Sect,

766
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,990
the martial world has been peaceful

767
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,850
for many years.

768
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,430
But this incident with the White Cloud Palace

769
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,760
doesn't seem so simple.

770
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,830
I have the same feeling.

771
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,830
Over these years,

772
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,270
the eight disciples have gradually separated.

773
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,790
Eldest Brother hasn't recovered from his old injuries

774
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,990
and has been resting.

775
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,270
Second Brother is engrossed in martial arts,

776
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,270
studying sword techniques day and night.

777
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,020
Third Brother has started a family.

778
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,790
Five left without a word.

779
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,270
And Six…

780
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,370
And you have been searching for medicine for Mo.

781
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,250
Among us brothers,

782
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,430
only I and Eight

783
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,030
can be dispatched at any time

784
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,630
to go out and handle matters.

785
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,030
The chief

786
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,320
has been quite worried about this.

787
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,240
Fourth Brother,

788
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,210
it was my...

789
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,750
I'm saying this

790
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,740
not to make you

791
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,320
put on a look

792
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,720
of guilt and self-blame.

793
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,550
First,

794
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,310
your search for medicine for Mo

795
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,510
is an act of chivalry,

796
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,950
which deserves respect.

797
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,500
Second,

798
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,840
what difference does it make

799
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,430
if there's one more person in the Sword Sect?

800
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,070
You're not an immortal.

801
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,350
You can't handle

802
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,590
every issue at once.

803
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,070
Third,

804
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,620
I know you too well.

805
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,560
If you were to encounter

806
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,450
any injustice,

807
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,690
with your temperament,

808
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,790
you would be the first to rush out

809
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,050
and fight for justice.

810
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,030
So,

811
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,150
just focus on finding medicine for Mo.

812
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,870
Leave the affairs in the Sword Sect

813
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,630
to us.

814
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,630
I've never seen you

815
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,830
so serious before.

816
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,710
Come on, Fourth Brother,

817
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,070
a toast to you.

818
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,770
Cheers.

819
00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,990
Cool!

820
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,510
Let me.

821
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,950
We just agreed on this. Let me.

822
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,590
It's fine.

823
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,430
It's fine. This time, you must let me pour the wine.

824
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,470
But you're injured.

825
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,150
It's fine.

826
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,630
Chief, you truly guessed right.

827
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,160
Mr. Huo is indeed drinking.

828
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,110
And he's even drinking openly

829
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,570
outside the medicine hut.

830
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,350
Let him drink.

831
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,910
Over these years,

832
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,830
he's been traveling all over the world.

833
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,550
It's not easy for him to sit down with his brother

834
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,680
and have a good chat.

835
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,090
[Yuan Yi Palace]

836
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,280
Long live the Doctrine Leader.

837
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,670
With Qin Tiancheng dead,

838
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,030
the Seven Star Sword Formation of the White Cloud Palace

839
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,560
is missing a key component.

840
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,190
As a result,

841
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,970
the White Cloud Palace

842
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,320
is like a trapped beast.

843
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,010
Its complete destruction

844
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,290
is only a matter of time.

845
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,730
Congratulations, Doctrine Leader.

846
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,750
I sent you there for two reasons.

847
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,980
First, to kill Qin Tiancheng.

848
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,030
Second,

849
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,440
to frame the Sword Sect

850
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,710
for the murder,

851
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,310
inciting conflict between the Sword Sect

852
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,790
and White Cloud Palace

853
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,270
and disturbing the balance of the martial world in the Central Plains.

854
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,470
You've accomplished

855
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,440
these two important tasks.

856
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,910
Well done.

857
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,510
However,

858
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,960
it seems the process of completing the mission

859
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,210
didn't go so smoothly, did it?

860
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,710
Making contact with Qin Tiancheng

861
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,120
and then taking the chance to kill him—

862
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
these tasks

863
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,910
were supposed to be handled by you, Miao Huo, weren't they?

864
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,830
So why did Eye handle them?

865
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,150
What's the story here?

866
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Doctrine Leader,

867
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,810
it was all that fake father Huo Zhanbai's

868
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,630
interference.

869
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,430
Otherwise, I—

870
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,910
your humble servant—

871
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,590
would have killed him long ago.

872
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,110
There would be no need for him at all.

873
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,670
Miao Huo,

874
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,840
Miao Huo, what do you mean by this?

875
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,390
Killing him.

876
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,110
I thought you were going to tell me

877
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,760
that you were provoked by Huo Zhanbai,

878
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,270
which is why you chased after him

879
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,350
and ultimately forgot the important mission.

880
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,900
I was wrong.

881
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,250
please spare me, Doctrine Leader.

882
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,150
Miao Huo,

883
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,470
you

884
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,120
really should be thanking Eye.

885
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,550
If it weren't for him,

886
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,330
you wouldn't even

887
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,370
be here today.

888
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,830
Yes.

889
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,170
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

890
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,190
Eye.

891
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,790
In the matter in Yangzhou,

892
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,050
you acted decisively.

893
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,670
Well done.

894
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:52,830
Come.

895
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,550
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

896
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,350
I had foreseen

897
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,570
that Miao Huo, being reckless,

898
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,170
would easily make mistakes.

899
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,920
That's why I sent you.

900
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,680
As expected,

901
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,330
you didn't disappoint me.

902
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,840
It's all thanks to your trust and guidance.

903
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,550
Tell me.

904
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,760
What reward do you want?

905
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,320
I have no other desires.

906
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,030
In that case,

907
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,850
according to the rules of our palace,

908
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,190
go to the Celestial Paradise

909
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,430
and enjoy yourself.

910
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,890
You may do as you please

911
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,990
with anyone inside.

912
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,470
Don't think I'll thank you

913
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,110
just because you didn't snitch.

914
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,750
I'm telling you.

915
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,550
Even if the Doctrine Leader hadn't sent you to Yangzhou,

916
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,430
I could have completed the mission myself.

917
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,750
The reward you received today

918
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,010
should have been mine!

919
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,810
I've already told you,

920
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,910
I just find you unnecessary.

921
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:15,830
What?

922
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,630
You're dispensable,

923
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,390
not worth my effort.

924
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,750
Let go.

925
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,110
I find your clothes dirty.

926
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,560
You brat,

927
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,710
I'm at least

928
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,640
a person, right?

929
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,350
You've barely learned to walk

930
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,660
and you dare bark at me?

931
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,230
Why are you two arguing?

932
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,920
Why are you everywhere?

933
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,990
Eye,

934
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,630
our Envoy Miao Huo

935
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,990
has a bad temper.

936
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,320
Please be patient with him.

937
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,200
Where are you going?

938
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,230
The Doctrine Leader has told me

939
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,360
to take you to the Celestial Paradise.

940
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,710
Do you know what kind of place

941
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,280
the Celestial Paradise is?

942
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,280
I don't know,

943
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,440
and I don't want to know.

944
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,770
Why act so high and mighty?

945
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,310
Aren't you even

946
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,310
a little curious?

947
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,670
This is the most indulgent and decadent place

948
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,390
in the world.

949
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,800
Everyone who has been here

950
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,030
becomes captivated and never wants to leave.

951
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,750
You've done a great service today,

952
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,430
and the Doctrine Leader is rewarding you

953
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,490
with a chance to enjoy yourself here.

954
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,990
You'd better be careful

955
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,150
and not let your soul

956
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,390
be taken away by what's inside.
