Chief.

5
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Beautiful.

6
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,010
Really beautiful.

7
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,790
What's beautiful about her?

8
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,840
Chief Xue is graceful and elegant.

9
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,510
You don't know how to appreciate beauty,

10
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,110
but I do.

11
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,940
She's a woman worth pursuing.

12
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,340
I absolutely cannot let her down.

13
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,350
What's wrong?

14
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,760
What are you doing? Hey.

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
I still have things to do.

16
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,470
What are you doing?

17
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,650
Look at you.

18
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,230
You want to repeat your old mistakes again?

19
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,120
Those people who you promised

20
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,150
to never let down

21
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,310

28
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,290
I'm still young and handsome.

29
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:46,990
Fine.

30
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,950
I wonder who it was

31
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,190
who was obsessed with

32
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,630
Miss Liu Feifei, the top courtesan in Yangzhou, just a few months ago,

33

Let me warn you.

00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,930
Don't mess with Chief Xue.

37
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,150
If you offend her,

38
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,750
you'll be in trouble.

39
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,550
What if I insist on pursuing her?

40
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,250
Your tricks won't work on her.

41
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,570
She's cold-hearted,

42
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,170
you know?

43
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,870

44
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,750

always keeping people at arm's length,

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,910
but in fact,

47
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,680
they're warm on the inside.

in her daily life?

55
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,680

Well, as for Chief Xue,

she collects Rootless Water every day.

61

When there are patients coming in for treatment,

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,350
she treats them.

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,680
When she's free,

64
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,750
she takes Ms. Shuang Hong and the others

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,030
to practice acupuncture,

66
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,360
or reads medical books.

67
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,830
Oh, right.

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,550
They also go to the Winter Hall

69

for your taste, Chief Xue.

117

The craftsmanship of this gold floral hairpin is remarkable.

118

Was it made by

119

Master Su, the goldsmith from Jiangnan?

120
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,310
It's said that any piece

121

made by Master Su

122
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,150
can sell for tens of thousands of taels of gold.

I heard from Feng Lyu

147

that on the day you entered the valley, you said

148
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,430
you would pay the medical fees for your seventh brother.

149
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,270
Is that true?

150
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,990
It is.

A virtuous person should acquire wealth in an upright and just way.

152
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,410
I can't just accept

153
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,350
so many gifts

154
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,100

[Apothecary Valley, Clinic Record]

156

Here's the debt your seventh brother

157
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,550
has incurred in Apothecary Valley over the years.

158
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,750
The money you spent

159
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,010
will be regarded as paying off your seventh brother's debt.

160
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,300
But that's not why I...

161
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,480
But that's why

162
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,470
I allowed you

163
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,130
to stay in Apothecary Valley.

164

165

and praised it...

166
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,960
I simply meant

167
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,630
the jade pendant at your waist

168
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,760
was of good quality.

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,700
I see.

173
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,390
a total of 200,000 in consultation fees,

Are the money and the gold hairpin not enough?

179
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,410
Right. Not enough.

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,590
You're drinking alone, yet you've opened so many jars of wine.

193
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,920
Can you finish them all?

194
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,510
I can't.

195
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,630
Why don't you, Chief Xue,

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,690
join me for a drink?

197
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,940
You opened the wine,

198
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,630
so you should deal with it yourself.

199
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,230
Then I'll have to take away what I can't finish.

200
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,250
Your plotting

201
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,740
is quite clever, isn't it?

202
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,430
That depends on who you're comparing it with.

203
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,110
Chief Xue.

204
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,740
You've come at the right time.

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,200
Taste this wine yourself.

206
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,030
Why does it taste bitter?

207
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,060
Could it be that since I haven't paid for the wine,

208
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,890
your Apothecary Valley

209
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,550
stopped serving me good wine?

210
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,830
So you know

211
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,310
you haven't paid, Mr. Huo?

212
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,070
You should be grateful to have any wine at all.

213
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,730
Yet you're still being picky.

214
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,430
That gold floral hairpin doesn't suit you.

215
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,070
Is that so?

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,850
But I think

217
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,140
it suits me quite well.

218
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,560
Gold material is gaudy.

219
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,120
You deserve better.

220
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,750
Then, Mr. Huo, do tell me

221
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,120
what kind of hairpin

222
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,140
would suit me.

223
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,550
A white jade hairpin.

224
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
As white as snow, as bright as clouds, and as lustrous as the moon.

225
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Natural yet not vulgar.

226
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,920
Preferably in the shape of a plum blossom.

227
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,350
Blooming in the cold,

228
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,840
with its own integrity.

229
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,930
The jade hairpin is polished,

230
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,830
while the winter plum endures wind and snow.

231
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,760
Both are elegant and noble things.

232
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,520
Don't move.

233
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Now it's fitting.

234
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,470
Seven.

235
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,710
Chief Xue.

236
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,030
You've opened so many jars of wine.

237
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,190
Can you finish them all?

238
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,590
I happen to be in the mood for some, too.

239
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,520
Fourth Brother.

240
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,730
It's getting late.

241
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,190
You should go back and rest early.

242
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,230
I'm not sleepy. If you want to leave, you go.

243
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,690
I've never had a drink with Chief Xue before.

244
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,110
Chief Xue!

245
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,590
You want to drink, right?

246
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's go, I'll drink with you.

247
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,570
Never mind.

248
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,670
Let's go back and sleep.

249
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,470
Weren't you not sleepy earlier?

250
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,340
That was then.

251
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,560
Chief Xue was still here earlier.

252
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,090
How can it be the same as now?

253
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,390
Look at you.

254
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,990
There's good wine, but you don't want to drink it,

255
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,990
insisting on drinking tea instead.

256
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
As for tea,

257
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,510
the more you drink, the more awake you become.

258
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,910
But when it comes to wine,

259
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,480
the more you drink, the more confused you get.

260
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,270
By the way,

261
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,260
you know

262
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,670
the rules of Apothecary Valley.

263
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,870
Except for patients,

264
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,870
no one is allowed to stay overnight.

265
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,750
You've been in the valley

266
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,710
for a while now.

267
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,190
When do you plan to leave?

268
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,910
Chief Xue hasn't asked me to leave yet.

269
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,370
Why are you in such a hurry?

270
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,230
I...

271
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,680
But now that you mention it,

272
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,860
Chief Xue

273
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
has broken

274
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,520
the valley's rules for me, hasn't she?

275
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,950
What do you think?

276
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,350
I think she has.

277
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,290
I've had enough.

278
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,670
If I drink too much,

279
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
I won't be able to sleep at night.

280
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,510
As for me,

281
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,010
I can sleep no matter what I drink.

282
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,520
Chief Xue.

283
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,540
Chief Xue.

284
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,350
Chief Xue.

285
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,150
Chief Xue.

286
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,790
You're so beautiful.

287
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,730
Seven.

288
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,150
How did I fall down?

289
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,200
Fourth Brother.

290
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,750
How did you get down there?

291
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,670
I don't know.

292
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,819
You must have had a nightmare.

293
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,230
A nightmare?

294
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,630
That can't be.

295
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,819
I was dreaming about Chief Xue.

296
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,350
Three catties and two taels.

297
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,030
Chief.

298
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,950
All this gold added together

299
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,030
isn't enough for the 200,000 medical fee.

300
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,190
Less than 200,000.

301
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,590
Our Apothecary Valley's

302
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,250
daily expenses for everyone,

303
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,200
plus the expenses of us sending medicine and doing check-ups

304
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,630
for the villagers nearby on  the first and fifteenth of each month

305
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,910
and every solar term,

306
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,470
as well as the costs of running the orphanage,

307
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,270
and the expenses of sending those

308
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,070
grown children

309
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,800
to school for their education.

310
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,270
When you add it all up, it's not nearly enough.

311
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,070
I knew the amount wasn't enough.

312
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,230
Chief.

313
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,470
This is said to be very valuable.

314
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,310
Perhaps

315
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,350
its value is comparable to that of

316
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,350
the jade pendant on Mr. Xia's waist.

317
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,670
Does Mr. Xia already know

318
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,850
that all this gold has been used

319
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,380
to pay off Mr. Seven's debt?

320
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,270
I've already told him.

321
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,680
Who's that?

322
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,170
It's me.

323
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,390
Good evening.

324
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,350
Sorry to disturb you ladies.

325
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,600
You've come at the right time.

326
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,550
Your Fourth Brother has

327
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,010
paid off part of your debt.

328
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,070
From now on,

329
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,880
you'll have two creditors.

330
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,910
Great.

331
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,410
That's wonderful.

332
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,840
Why are you smiling?

333
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,390
You're not...

334
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,030
Not what?

335
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,030
You're not

336
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,370
thinking about smashing the pot since it's already cracked,

337
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,630
are you? Giving yourself up completely?

338
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,770
Indeed I am.

339
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,730
Chief Xue, you're truly perceptive.

340
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,350
I see the moon is bright and the breeze is cool.

341
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,990
If we could drink under the moonlight,

342
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
that would be even more delightful.

343
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,990
Today's wine

344
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,470
tastes right.

345
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,190
Your alcohol tolerance

346
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,670
is not what it used to be.

347
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,230
You've only had a few sips,

348
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,890
and you're already like this.

349
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,680
This wine

350
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,690
is clearly the same as before.

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,350
Today's wine

352
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,320
is especially delicious.

353
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,840
Chief Xue.

354
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,390
I've never asked you before.

355
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,350
Why do you particularly love this Laughing at the World?

356
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,350
When I was 14, I fell into an icy river

357
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,730
and caught a chill.

358
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,950
That's why my lungs have never been in good condition.

359
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,150
The wine of Apothecary Valley

360
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,710
is made with the finest medicinal ingredients,

361
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,840
carefully crafted.

362
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,010
Master had me drink a bottle daily

363
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,630
to invigorate the blood, clear the meridians,

364
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,630
warm the lungs, and dispel the cold.

365
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,370
But that young man under the ice

366
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,390
fell into the icy river with you.

367
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,950
You probably rarely leave the valley, right?

368
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,090
Given the chance, let me take you to the Central Plains

369
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,550
to broaden your horizons,

370
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,230
so you won't doubt

371
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,760
my reputation as Mr. Seven.

372
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,690
I originally came from the Central Plains.

373
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,070
So there are also

374
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,110
heroic figures like you in the Central Plains,

375
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,030
Chief Xue.

376
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,350
What?

377
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,270
Trying to get information out of me?

378
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,790
No.

379
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,490
I just wanted to see

380
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,510
if there's anything I can do to help you.

381
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,430
Is it to repay the favor I did you

382
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,890
in the White Cloud Palace?

383
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,750
Do you think everyone in the world

384
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,790
is like you,

385
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,950
loving to have everything

386
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,150
calculated clearly?

387
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,270
I don't like owing others,

388
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,520
nor do I like others owing me.

389
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,950
You don't need to help me with anything.

390
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,030
Just pay off the rest of

391
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,190
the medical fees you owe Apothecary Valley

392
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,310
in full.

393
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,690
In Apothecary Valley,

394
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,870
there are many people waiting to be fed.

395
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,330
This...

396
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,650
Since you're so greedy for money,

397
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,230
why do you only treat

398
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,360
ten patients a year?

399
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,700
My body can't handle more.

400
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,990
Besides,

401
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,990
I don't like those people of the martial world.

402
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,350
Those who waste their lives

403
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,680
on meaningless battles

404
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,190
are not worth saving.

405
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,630
I'd rather

406
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,430
spend this time

407
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,990
treating people with colds and fevers

408
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,780
in nearby villages.

409
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,680
Then,

410
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,950
why did you save me?

411
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,330
Well...

412
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,990
Of course it was because your face

413
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,050
still has some redeeming qualities.

414
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,430
There are so many women in the valley.

415
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,030
It's quite boring, isn't it?

416
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,750
You and I have

417
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,190
been through life and death together, haven't we?

418
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,430
We haven't shared a drink yet.

419
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:42,700
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

420
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,830
Here.

421
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,400
I prefer to drink alone.

422
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,390
♫Plum blossoms are about to fall; I'll see you here♫

423
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,230
♫Why are you late and why is it about to snow again?♫

424
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,460
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

425
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,560
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

426
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,780
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

427
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,630
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

428
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,460
Huo Zhanbai.

429
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,320
Huo Zhanbai?

430
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,140
♫Warm stovetops and green film in wine, like an eternal farewell♫

431
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,250
♫Don't stop drinking; keep lingering and enjoy the long night♫

432
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,460
♫After all these years, my yearning for you is still as clear as the bright moon♫

433
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,890
♫Looking into the distance, speechless and sleepless♫

434
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:26,640
♫Longing etched in my heart, but I don't wish for your acknowledgement of my love♫

435
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:34,100
♫Asking the stars about our fate, as fireworks appearing in my dream♫

436
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,510
♫I've fulfilled my wish, having traveled this far with you♫

437
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,590
Why is Mr. Seven

438
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,590
lying here?

439
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,770
Don't tell me

440
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,170
he slept here last night.

441
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,830
[Sword Sect]

442
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,380
Years ago, all the major martial sects of the Central Plains

443
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,580
joined forces to attack Yuan Yi Palace.

444
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,350
The Seven Star Sword Formation led by Tiancheng

445
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,410
played a crucial role in that battle.

446
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,590
Now, Yuan Yi Palace has been hiding in

447
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,510
West Kunlun for many years.

448
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,230
How could Tiancheng

449
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,030
be so foolish

450
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,150
as to go to such an evil place?

451
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,670
If it weren't for Yuan Yi Palace's coercion and enticement,

452
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,130
Tiancheng wouldn't have ended up like this.

453
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,770
I have come here this time,

454
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,790
hoping that you

455
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,070
can lend me a hand

456
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,910
to thoroughly investigate this matter

457
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,630
and find the real culprit, Chief.

458
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,560
Actually, regarding this matter,

459
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,400
I already have some clues.

460
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,090
What clues do you have?

461
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,030
Xingzhi.

462
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,630
Chief Lin.

463
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,650
Take a look at this.

464
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,510
The Wuji Sect also got ambushed?

465
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,510
The victim was also

466
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,310
an important figure in the sect.

467
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,070
Although Chief Leng of Wuji Sect

468
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,710
escaped death,

469
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,690
he was seriously injured.

470
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,190
Judging from this,

471
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,790
there must be someone behind the scenes

472
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,710
systematically harming

473
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,790
the martial artists of the Central Plains.

474
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,990
Senior Qin Tiancheng

475
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,670
was definitely not killed by Seventh Brother.

476
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,390
I was rash

477
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,030
in this matter.

478
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,960
Regarding the matter of Zhanbai,

479
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,160
Chief Lin, you needn't take it to heart.

480
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,190
He took your sect's sacred Azure Phoenix Flower without asking for your permission,

481
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,030
so he deserves to suffer a bit.

482
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,040
However, regarding Tiancheng's murder,

483
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,510
in my opinion,

484
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,910
it may be

485
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,420
related to Yuan Yi Palace.

486
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,010
According to reliable information,

487
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,350
Chang Wujue seemed to have only

488
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,590
sent out Miao Huo,

489
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,920
but in fact, there was another person.

490
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,620
The Asura Field in Yuan Yi Palace

491
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,150
is where Chang Wujue

492
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,530
trains assassins.

493
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,590
The Five Sages by his side

494
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,960
all come from there.

495
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,870
A few years ago, there appeared

496
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,750
a so-called once-in-a-century

497
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,950
top assassin, named Eye.

498
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,710
If Zhanbai had already lured Miao Huo

499
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,510
to a secluded alley at that time,

500
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,970
then the real culprit who impersonated Zhanbai

501
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,280
and murdered Tiancheng

502
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,270
is very likely to be Eye.

503
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,270
You're right, Chief.

504
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,670
The Seven Star Sword Formation

505
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,130
is the foundation of our White Cloud Palace.

506
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,750
With Tiancheng dead,

507
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,960
the Seven Star Sword Formation...

508
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,950
Those scoundrels from Yuan Yi Palace

509
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,950
are truly cunning and treacherous.

510
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,270
I must storm West Kunlun

511
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,770
and grind their bones to dust.

512
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,190
Chief Lin, please be patient.

513
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,830
This is merely my speculation.

514
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,270
For so many years,

515
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,870
Yuan Yi Palace has never invaded the Central Plains.

516
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,070
If this was truly done by Yuan Yi Palace,

517
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,810
then they must have planned it meticulously

518
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,630
to make sure it was impeccable.

519
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,630
Therefore, we must not act rashly.

520
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,450
We need to carefully consider our next move.

521
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,790
What you said is absolutely right, Chief.

522
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,340
Chief.

523
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,430
Do you have any good plans?

524
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,470
This requires all the righteous martial sects

525
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,630
to work together

526
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,070
and unite as one.

527
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,190
Chief Qiushui of the Celestial Alp Sect

528
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,320
is highly respected

529
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,170
and has great prestige in the martial world.

530
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,990
Xingzhi.

531
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,360
When Qianyu is back,

532
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,030
you two make a quick run

533
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,590
to the Celestial Alp Sect

534
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,730
and invite Chief Qiushui to come here and discuss

535
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,990
our countermeasures.

536
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,960
Yes.

537
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,890
The martial world

538
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,050
has been peaceful for many years.

539
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm afraid

540
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,470
another bloodshed

541
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,140
is about to take place.

542
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,990
Doctrine Leader.

543
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
Doctrine Leader.

544
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,270
Doctrine Leader.

545
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,190
You're back.

546
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,310
I failed to keep you safe, Doctrine Leader.

547
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,310
Please punish me, Doctrine Leader.

548
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,880
This is not your fault.

549
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,750
I was too eager

550
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,160
and practiced on my own.

551
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,710
If you hadn't returned in time,

552
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,230
I might have gone berserk.

553
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,690
It seems that to break through the ninth level

554
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,910
of the Iron Horse Glacier mental technique,

555
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,750
your Spring Breeze technique

556
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,870
is indispensable.

557
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,910
I'm willing to always be by your side, Doctrine Leader.

558
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,150
I'm at your disposal.

559
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,910
Mr. Seven.

560
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,480
Do you feel any discomfort?

561
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,110
I feel very good.

562
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,030
I'm ready to set out

563
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,290
and find the next herb.

564
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,430
Hold it.

565
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,940
If you can hold it

566
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,030
for 30 minutes,

567
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,010
I'll let you leave the valley.

568
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,810
No problem.

569
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,150
Right hand.

570
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,510
I'll just

571
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,690
take medicine for a few more days.

572
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,130
It's not a problem.

573
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,440
Shuang Hong.

574
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,990
Give him a few more doses of medicine

575
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,850
according to this prescription.

576
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,310
Chief!

577
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,750
Chief!

578
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,230
Go to the Winter Hall and have a look.

579
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,760
Mr. Xia made a huge mistake.

580
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,590
These peonies are medicinal herbs.

581
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,190
Why did you pull them all out?

582
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,110
Miss Feng Lyu.

583
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,750
I didn't know they were used for medicine.

584
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,230
I just thought they looked pretty, so I picked them.

585
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,930
How much are they worth?

586
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,510
I'll pay.

587
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,470
We were going to decoct medicine with the peonies.

588
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,530
Can money be used to decoct medicine?

589
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,270
This is indeed my fault.

590
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll make amends, alright?

591
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,310
Chief Xue.

592
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,070
Chief.

593
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,950
Since you want to make amends,

594
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,280
don't just stand there.

595
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,320
Whatever you order, Chief Xue.

596
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,270
Since Mr. Xia has caused trouble,

597
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,270
you two brothers,

598
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,830
go and pick some herbs

599
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,100
to make up for it.

600
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,110
It was Fourth Brother's fault.

601
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,770
What does it have to do with me?

602
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,670
Have you forgotten

603
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,530
how much you owe for medical fees?

604
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,530
I'm still injured.

605
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,710
Your shoulder is injured,

606
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,800
but your legs are fine.

607
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,530
Walking more

608
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,890
will help you recover.

609
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,020
Don't come back to the valley

610
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,220
until you fill your baskets with herbs.

611
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,950
Seven.

612
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,140
Are you sure this is the right path?

613
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,400
Can we find herbs here?

614
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,190
There's a grove up ahead.

615
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,470
Let's go check there.

616
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,510
I just thought I'd pick a bouquet of flowers

617
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,430
to give to Chief Xue

618
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,860
as soon as she came out of her room.

619
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,730
I didn't expect

620
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,100
to cause such trouble.

621
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,600
On this land of ice and snow,

622
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,920
where can I possibly find flowers?

623
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,960
Fourth Brother.

624
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,150
Even if you picked flowers,

625
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,810
Chief Xue wouldn't like them.

626
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,230
So I advise you

627
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,990
to stop this matter right here.

628
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,840
What matter do you mean?

629
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,920
Trying to please Chief Xue.

630
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,350
Why?

631
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,330
You don't know her.

632
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,150
That woman

633
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,080
has her own principles.

634
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,710
Her likes and dislikes are unpredictable, and her temper is odd.

635
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,230
It's very hard to please her.

636
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,830
Moreover,

637
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,270
she doesn't always say what she means.

638
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,590
She often says one thing

639
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,750
but does another.

640
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,130
Most importantly,

641
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,380
she's too willful and arbitrary.

642
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,840
She's not suitable for you, Fourth Brother.

643
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,430
All these years,

644
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,310
you should've spent most of your time

645
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,230
traveling outside to find herbs, right?

646
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,710
Why do you seem

647
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,540
to know Chief Xue so well?

648
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,210
We haven't spent much time together,

649
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,470
but we've been through some life-and-death situations.

650
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,330
Naturally, I've gained some understanding of her.

651
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,760
But the Chief Xue in your eyes

652
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,110
is very different from

653
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,070
the one I know.

654
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,670
Just this time,

655
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,350
when White Cloud Palace chased us to Apothecary Valley,

656
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,500
what Chief Xue did

657
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,150
shows that she is someone

658
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,040
who values reason and loyalty.

659
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,840
Fourth Brother.

660
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,890
Why can't you listen to my advice?

661
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,070
What a fool.

662
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,530
Who are you calling a fool?

663
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,150
Seven.

664
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,630
Do you know

665
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,130
when the iron tree blooms?

666
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,110
The iron tree?

667
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,710
During my years of traveling in the martial world,

668
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,830
I've indeed seen

669
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,110
many iron trees.

670
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,630
Some bloom in summer,

671
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,350
while others bloom in autumn.

672
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,150
Depending on their location,

673
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,010
they bloom in different seasons.

674
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,400
You're really a blockhead in romance.

675
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,750
In that case,

676
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,110
I'll return to the Sword Sect tomorrow.

677
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
You... You're giving up so quickly?

678
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,350
You've been trying to persuade me for such a long time.

679
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,480
If I still don't take your advice,

680
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
wouldn't that be insensitive of me?

681
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,660
I'll go over there to look for herbs

682
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,790
and take another good look at the scenery in this valley.

683
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,300
A blockhead in romance...

684
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,010
Was that an insult?

685
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,230
Xiao Jing.

686
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,470
Come here.

687
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,190
Chief.

688
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,910
The tea from the snowy mountain

689
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,630
is indeed more crisp and refreshing.

690
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,190
Is it?

691
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,400
I didn't taste any difference.

692
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,890
It seems you ladies are in a good mood.

693
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,630
Mr. Huo.

694
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,150
Chief Xue, please take a good look.

695
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,470
Is this basket of medicinal herbs

696
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,930
enough to pay off the debt?

697
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,390
The quantity is sufficient,

698
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,590
but it still depends on quality.

699
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,360
Miss Xiao Cheng.

700
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,000
Please give me a cup of hot tea.

701
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,750
Chief?

702
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,690
Five taels.

703
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:33,850
Five taels.

704
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,280
No.

705
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,270
Ten taels.

706
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,470
Ten taels.

707
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,360
Ten taels it is then.

708
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,810
Put it on my tab.

709
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,360
Three taels?

710
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,510
I, the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect,

711
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,950
the only son of the Huashan Sect Leader,

712
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,970
known in the martial world as

713
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,510
White Feather Sword, Xia Qianyu,

714
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,070
worked so hard

715
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,310
gathering herbs for four hours,

716
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,590
and they're only worth three taels?

717
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,390
Indeed.

718
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,670
Who would have thought

719
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,100
that the fourth disciple of the Sword Sect,

720
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,490
the only son of the Huashan Sect Leader,

721
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,430
known in the martial world as

722
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,880
White Feather Sword, Xia Qianyu,

723
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Young Master Xia,

724
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,550
worked hard for four hours

725
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,490
and gathered only useless weeds?

726
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,670
Only a few are actually useful,

727
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,800
and it takes my discerning eyes

728
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,130
to pick them out for you.

729
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,240
Three taels is actually generous.

730
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,200
Three taels?

731
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,320
When I drink outside,

732
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,270
I casually give the servants tips

733
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,530
more than this amount.

734
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,360
Chief, dinner is ready.

735
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,190
Time to eat.

736
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,320
Tomorrow, I'll send a letter

737
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,990
to my father,

738
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,120
asking him to send a cart of herbs here.

739
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,000
Seven.

740
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,190
Stop eating.

741
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,550
Come on, let's go back to our room.

742
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,580
The sweet potatoes are freshly baked.

743
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,150
They're still hot.

744
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,990
And they're free.

745
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,070
I have something important to talk to you.

746
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,600
Let's go.

747
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,030
I'll get one for you.

748
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,960
I don't want any.

749
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,820
Sit down. Sit down.

750
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,230
What's so urgent?

751
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,310
You seem to be in such a hurry.

752
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,470
No, thanks.

753
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,910
After we parted ways,

754
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,390
do you know where I went?

755
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,920
I went to the back of the mountain.

756
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,590
At the back of the mountain,

757
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,990
there are many cenotaphs standing.

758
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,990
Did you know that?

759
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:14,910
In this desolate mountain,

760
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,640
it's normal to have cenotaphs.

761
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,550
But what if the cenotaphs are

762
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,010
for over a hundred people?

763
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,510
Besides, the person who set those cenotaphs up

764
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,470
was Chief Xue.

765
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,910
On New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia,

766
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,350
over a hundred villagers

767
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,150
all died on the same day.

768
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,270
There must be something fishy about this.

769
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,030
I think

770
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,760
you should go and check.

771
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,710
Maybe we

772
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,770
can be of some help.

773
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,430
127 villagers

774
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,110
of Mo Family Village

775
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,550
died on New Year's Eve of the fourth year of Huijia.

776
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,440
Respectfully set up by Xue Ziye

777
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,320
in mid-spring of the fifth year of Huijia.

778
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,850
Mo Family Village?

779
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,710
Is this the village where Chief Xue

780
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,230
used to live?

781
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,950
[Mo Family Village]

782
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,150
Such an atrocious crime.

783
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,550
Who could have committed it?
