00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,660
[Episode 6]

4
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,030
In the evening,

5
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,600
after Mr. Seven took his medicine,

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,650
he sweated a little,

7
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,950
but he's still unconscious.

8
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,810
After taking some more medicine,

9
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,150
I think he'll wake up at this time tomorrow.

10
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,480
Let's go and have a look.

11
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,560
Mr. Seven

12
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,720
was deeply poisoned

13
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,350
and went through all those matters,

14
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,880
yet he woke up this quickly?

15
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,840
He's truly crude and tough.

16
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,470
Chief Xue.

17
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,120
Ms. Shuang Hong.

18
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,150
Chief Xue,

19
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,980
we are not close,

20
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,630
but you still tried your best to save me.

21
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,150
I'm really grateful.

22
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,760
If you need me in the future,

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,270
I'll be at your disposal.

24
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,150
Don't flatter yourself.

25
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,280
I saved you because it was convenient.

26
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,310
If you say so,

27
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,070
I feel much better.

28
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,600
Although it was offhanded,

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,990
I still saved you.

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,960
You have to pay the medical fee.

31
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,790
You drank two cups of poison,

32
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,870
so it was two lives.

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,590
The medical fee is 200,000 gold.

34
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:22,990
Two—

35
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,829
Is my life that valuable?

36
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,950
Your life isn't,

37
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,610
but my medical skills are.

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,280
Your chief is really humorous.

39
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,110
Fine.

40
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,150
But I can't come up with so much money

41
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,350
in such a short time.

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,390
How about I pay you back slowly

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,430
after Mo heals?

44
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,579
What do you think?

45
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,150
Sweet words are useless.

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,360
I want tangible money.

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,000
You…

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,750
Chief Xue,

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,950
have you not been to the Central Plains?

50
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,910
Don't you know that Mr. Seven

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,840
of the Sword Sect

52
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,390
is not only handsome

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,830
and good at swordsmanship,

54
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,190
but also known

55
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,470
to be credible?

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,310
Could it be that the poison was too great

57
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,640
and you hurt your brain?

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,850
Shuang Hong.

59
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,310
Got it, Chief.

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,200
Shuang Hong?

61
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,480
What did she get?

62
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,920
Chief Xue,

63
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,270
your medical skills are really valuable.

64
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,230
But there is a reason why it's valuable.

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,909
It's because your medical skills

66
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,840
are indeed good.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,060
I know you want a high price

68
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,320
because you need to feed the people in the valley.

69
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,110
The attendants in the valley

70
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,470
must be orphans too.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,750
I also know

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,290
you charge 100,000 in fees

73
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,630
for the rich in the martial world,

74
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,390
but usually,

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,230
you also

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,350
give medicine and treat the surrounding villagers

77
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,110
for free.

78
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,510
Am I right?

79
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,150
Where did you

80
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,750
hear all this nonsense from?

81
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,070
When I

82
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,950
left the Apothecary Valley last time,

83
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,280
I saw it with my own eyes.

84
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,910
I know you are

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,770
mean and greedy,

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
but actually, you are...

87
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,300
Actually, I'm just how I seem.

88
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,150
I'm mean and greedy.

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,790
Don't think I'll charge less money

90
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,520
just because you flattered me.

91
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,630
Chief.

92
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,710
Drink some wine to warm yourself up.

93
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,520
Ms. Shuang Hong,

94
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,430
the wine

95
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,030
doesn't smell like the kind from before.

96
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,430
It smells more fragrant.

97
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,630
Is it...

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,800
This wine is called Laughing at the World.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,630
It's the best wine exclusive to

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,870
the Apothecary Valley.

101
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,130
It can't be compared with ordinary wine.

102
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,270
In that case,

103
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,160
I'd like a cup too.

104
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
Put it on the bill.

105
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,350
Chief,

106
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,090
I’ll prepare some snacks.

107
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,750
This wine

108
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,740
can't be drunk by ordinary people.

109
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,270
I'm not an ordinary person.

110
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,310
Plus,

111
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,630
I won't drink it.

112
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,070
I'll just take a sip.

113
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,370
This wine contains ginseng,

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,670
seahorse and velvet antler.

115
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,710
They're all rich in the heat element.

116
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,870
You were just poisoned by fire

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,130
and are still injured.

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,190
I advise you

119
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,920
to not put your life at risk.

120
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,710
Chief Xue,

121
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,510
you don’t know me well enough.

122
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,110
I always

123
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,270
drink wine to nourish my health.

124
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,190
With just a sip,

125
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,910
I'll be more than half recovered.

126
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,040
If I drink a few jars,

127
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,580
I'll be fully recovered.

128
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,110
Some tenacious diseases can't be cured fully.

129
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,170
Besides, wine is bad for your health.

130
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,390
I'm afraid...

131
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,040
What are you afraid of?

132
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,520
I’m afraid you'll become sterile.

133
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,310
Chief Xue,

134
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
I just recovered.

135
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,670
There's no need to joke with me like this.

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,470
Besides,

137
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,240
for me now,

138
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,030
drinking happily is the most important thing.

139
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,750
I plan to leave to search for the next medicine

140
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,210
after drinking this wine.

141
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,670
You're leaving as soon as you woke up?

142
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,470
That's right.

143
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,909
My body is fine now.

144
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,190
The sooner I get the medicine,

145
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,720
the sooner Mo will recover.

146
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,150
I'm afraid you'll die

147
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,350
from the poisoning even before you arrive

148
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,010
at where the next medicine is.

149
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,040
What do you mean?

150
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,950
You feel fine,

151
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,030
but remnants of poison are still in your body.

152
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,590
If you don't get rid of them well,

153
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,310
the poison will flare again halfway there.

154
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,390
Then, how many days

155
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,690
do you think I'll need?

156
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,130
Three days?

157
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,590
Or five days?

158
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,720
Shouldn't you first ask

159
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,560
how much

160
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,190
it'll cost to cure you?

161
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,050
As you know,

162
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,950
I'm penniless now.

163
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,030
The jade pendant on your waist

164
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,120
seems to be of good quality.

165
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,350
You wear it all day.

166
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,750
It must be valuable.

167
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:40,870
This jade pendant

168
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,200
is very important to me.

169
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,590
I can't remove it

170
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,280
or use it to pay the debt.

171
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,910
Then

172
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,760
you can pay me back in another way.

173
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,270
What is it?

174
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,350
So pale.

175
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,910
He's even paler than a girl.

176
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,240
He's wearing so little.

177
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,550
Chief.

178
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,630
The chief is here.

179
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,070
Scram.

180
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,760
Stand straight.

181
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,780
You're here to pay your debt.

182
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,030
There are 409 acupoints

183
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,660
on a person's body.

184
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,230
Among these 409

185
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,150
acupoints,

186
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,670
there are 108 vital acupoints.

187
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,190
Among these 108

188
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,230
vital acupoints,

189
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,260
there are 36 fatal acupoints,

190
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,070
known commonly as the death acupoints.

191
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,910
These 36 death acupoints

192
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,710
are soft numbness,

193
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,750
dizziness,

194
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,560
lightness, and heaviness.

195
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,590
Usually,

196
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,460
I have you all do acupuncture

197
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,520
on bronze figures,

198
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,070
but they're dead objects, after all,

199
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,910
and too rigid.

200
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,950
Fortunately, we have Mr. Seven,

201
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,150
a live person, today.

202
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,910
You can see the real deal.

203
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,950
If it hurts or itches

204
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,300
and you can't handle it,

205
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,520
just shout out loud.

206
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,670
I'll be gentler.

207
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,110
As a martial artist,

208
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,470
what can't I handle?

209
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,190
This is the Jianjing acupoint.

210
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,510
If the patient is weak,

211
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,230
they will feel itchy pain

212
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,350
when the needle is applied here.

213
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,950
Mr. Huo,

214
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,410
how do you feel?

215
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,230
It's a little itchy.

216
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,220
It's just ticklish.

217
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,480
Okay.

218
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,270
Then I'll start explaining

219
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,470
the second acupoint.

220
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,990
The second acupoint

221
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,760
is the Xuanji acupoint.

222
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,270
This is the Xuanji acupoint.

223
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,630
If the patient

224
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,070
has chest pain and shortness of breath,

225
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,640
they will feel sore and limp

226
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,990
when the needle is applied here.

227
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,170
He's about to fall!

228
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,070
Mr. Huo, are you okay?

229
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,670
Just now, the soles of my feet were itchy.

230
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,620
I don't feel anything else.

231
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,990
That's troublesome.

232
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,640
If you don't feel anything,

233
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,350
it is a sign of going crazy.

234
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,030
Going crazy?

235
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,910
Chief said he's going crazy.

236
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,910
Is he going crazy?

237
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,550
Crazy!

238
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,990
The third acupoint

239
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,570
is the Huantiao acupoint.

240
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,910
I’m afraid

241
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,840
I'll have to trouble Mr. Seven now,

242
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,750
because this Huantiao acupoint

243
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,230
is located on the hip bone.

244
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,750
I want to see it.

245
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,790
Mr. Huo, are you willing?

246
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,190
Chief Xue, are you taking advantage of me

247
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,520
in the name of teaching?

248
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,390
I never accept credit in the Apothecary Valley.

249
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,450
Repaying like this

250
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,950
is already a steal for you.

251
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,140
You're using your power for personal gain

252
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,400
and personal revenge.

253
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,470
If I

254
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,170
really wanted to take revenge on Mr. Huo,

255
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,970
I wouldn't be so merciful.

256
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,550
Forget it.

257
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,390
Since you don't want to,

258
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,690
I'll change to another acupoint.

259
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,440
What do you want?

260
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,550
This is the Bizhong acupoint.

261
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,480
Applying a needle to the Bizhong acupoint

262
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,830
and the previous two acupoints

263
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,750
together

264
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,510
not only can immobilize someone

265
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,720
but also make them mute.

266
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,120
It can cure those who move and talk too much.

267
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,290
Chief says he's a chatterbox.

268
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,510
What?

269
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,680
Mr. Huo, do you want to talk?

270
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,790
Don't worry.

271
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,140
Two hours later,

272
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,830
the acupoints will be unlocked automatically.

273
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,750
Do you all understand?

274
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,870
Yes.

275
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,480
Then, hurry and go practice.

276
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,710
Yes, Chief.

277
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,110
Let's go.

278
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,750
Move.

279
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,350
Hurry up.

280
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
He's not talking.

281
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,310
Go!

282
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,740
Go.

283
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,030
You said I was using my power

284
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,410
for personal revenge.

285
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,560
Now, this

286
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,590
is true revenge.

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,190
I've learned

288
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,360
those three acupoints from earlier.

289
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Thank you, Chief Xue.

290
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,710
Fortunately, I have strong internal force

291
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,550
and broke through the acupoints earlier.

292
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,750
Is the debt between us

293
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,550
wiped now?

294
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Why are you quiet?

295
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,300
Chief Xue, you are really generous.

296
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,900
By the way,

297
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,390
how long did you say

298
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,190
these acupoints will take before being unlocked?

299
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,350
Two hours?

300
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,070
You are so weak

301
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,030
and you look pale.

302
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,010
You should get some sun.

303
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,710
I just recovered from the poison

304
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,670
and I'm weak.

305
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,300
I'll keep you company.

306
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,880
It's so comfortable.

307
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,430
You need more sun in the future,

308
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,230
Chief Xue.

309
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,510
Your mission failed.

310
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,630
The Doctrine Leader punished you

311
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,290
to observe the sun for six hours before leaving.

312
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,250
Miao Feng prevented you from completing your mission.

313
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,300
Why is that?

314
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,310
Will you hate him?

315
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,800
Do you feel discomfort?

316
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,540
You deserve it.

317
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,190
I know

318
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,120
you have strong energy inside you,

319
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,080
but if you don't control it,

320
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,510
it will control you.

321
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,290
So, before you walk out

322
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,490
of the Asura Field,

323
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,720
I'll teach you

324
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,340
how to control the Eye Magic.

325
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,990
Close your eyes.

326
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,230
Stay calm.

327
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,550
What can you recall?

328
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,109
I can't remember anything.

329
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,630
Eye,

330
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,230
for your own good,

331
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,230
I erased the portion

332
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,990
of your memory that pains you.

333
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,230
Remember.

334
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,750
You are a child

335
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,120
abandoned by everyone.

336
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,790
This memory

337
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,470
means nothing to you.

338
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,000
It's better to forget it.

339
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,710
No.

340
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,270
No.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
I wasn't abandoned.

342
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,230
You were.

343
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,070
I wasn't!

344
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
Then why are you locked

345
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,350
in this dark prison?

346
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,070
Remember.

347
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,900
Remember this anger.

348
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,750
You must learn to control

349
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,750
this hatred.

350
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,540
Use your eyes

351
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,230
to kill everyone who abandoned you.

352
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Doctrine Leader, you are more skilled than I.

353
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,960
I admit defeat.

354
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,950
Feng.

355
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,710
All these years,

356
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,040
you've always been playing chess with me,

357
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,060
but you haven't improved at all.

358
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm unintelligent.

359
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,520
If you were unintelligent,

360
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,690
you wouldn't have played against me for a dozen rounds.

361
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,550
But if you were smart,

362
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,190
why would you

363
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,950
always make mistakes in the last few steps?

364
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,070
Unless...

365
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,710
Do you also purposely lose

366
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,440
when playing against Xue Ziye,

367
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,270
chief of the Apothecary Valley?

368
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,370
Please do not be angry.

369
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,610
I'm not angry.

370
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm just disappointed.

371
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,130
You are my most trusted child,

372
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,750
yet I heard from others

373
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,210
about what you did after leaving the palace.

374
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,910
It seems

375
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,630
you and I are not as close as before.

376
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,110
I dare not.

377
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,350
I accept any punishment.

378
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,190
Then I'll cancel this month's

379
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,250
antidote to the Ice Silkworm Poison.

380
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,070
Maybe only in this way

381
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,110
will you know

382
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,860
who is the most important person to you.

383
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,290
Thank you, Doctrine Leader.

384
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,210
[Young Miao Feng]

385
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,610
Are you from the royal family of Sang?

386
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,390
Save me.

387
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,140
Poor child.

388
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,190
[Chang Wujue, Doctrine Leader of Yuan Yi Palace]

389
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,870
You want me to save your life?

390
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,910
Will you come with me?

391
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,510
If you are willing

392
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,170
to give your everything to me,

393
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,790
I will also give you everything.

394
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,180
I will teach you martial arts.

395
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,630
This trick is called Spring Breeze.

396
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,090
Together with my Iron Horse Glacier,

397
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,440
it's known as Yin and Yang.

398
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,670
It's the strongest martial arts

399
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,630
recorded in the ancient books of Kunlun.

400
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,670
The Iron Horse Glacier has the effect of making one

401
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,270
impenetrable and immortal.

402
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Meanwhile, Spring Breeze

403
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,550
can dispel all coldness in the world

404
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,060
and increase one's power.

405
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,670
It can help me with my Iron Horse Glacier

406
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,790
and also help you complete

407
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,190
the strongest secret technique.

408
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,520
What I can't bear is that

409
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,110
those who practice this technique

410
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,110
must be warm and peaceful.

411
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,710
They can't have any emotional fluctuations.

412
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,290
If you want to transform yourself,

413
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,940
you must suffer the heart-gnawing pain

414
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,280
of the Ice Silkworm Poison each month.

415
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,030
Emissary Miao Feng,

416
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,190
how are you?

417
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm concerned for you,

418
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,550
so I came to visit.

419
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,160
The Ice Silkworm Poison

420
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,350
feels like thousands of ants gnawing at your heart.

421
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,390
It's so painful,

422
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,160
yet you still have a smile on your face.

423
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,350
Amazing.

424
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,410
But Emissary Miao Feng,

425
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm really curious.

426
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,270
Have you never

427
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,850
had any

428
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,350
emotional fluctuations?

429
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,550
Tell me.

430
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,390
If your chess friend,

431
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,960
that healer, Xue Ziye,

432
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,710
knew you've killed so many people

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
and are such a person,

434
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,570
would she still play with you?

435
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,500
Calm down, Emissary Miao Feng.

436
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
As far as I know,

437
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,070
those who practice the Spring Breeze

438
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,110
must be as calm

439
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,470
as the dead.

440
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,670
Even a slight fluctuation

441
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,540
will break the spell.

442
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,090
You must be careful,

443
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,220
Emissary Miao Feng.

444
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,100
You can't lose the Spring Breeze

445
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,990
just like this.

446
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,390
But I'm really looking forward

447
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,230
to when there is

448
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
no smile on your face.

449
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,430
Chief,

450
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,920
where are you going so late?

451
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,870
My silver bell hairpin is missing.

452
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,870
How is it missing?

453
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,800
Maybe I

454
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,790
accidentally lost it this morning

455
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,650
when getting the Rootless Water.

456
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,760
That hairpin

457
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,610
was given to me by Xuehuai.

458
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,540
All these years,

459
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,990
it has never left my body.

460
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,750
I'll send someone to look for it.

461
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,210
No need.

462
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,070
I can go by myself.

463
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,150
I’ll go with you.

464
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,230
Chief Xue,

465
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,360
I’m here to say goodbye.

466
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,070
I'm going to look for the medicine tomorrow.

467
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,110
Is she really angry?

468
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,830
Chief,

469
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,510
let me.

470
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,430
Chief,

471
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,230
the candle is about to burn out.

472
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,630
Why don't we go back today

473
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,800
and continue searching tomorrow?

474
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,260
Oh no.

475
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,670
I came out in a hurry.

476
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,510
I didn't bring any spare candles.

477
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,510
What should we do?

478
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,950
Okay.

479
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,680
Let's go back first.

480
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,470
We'll search again tomorrow.

481
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,910
Okay.

482
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,430
Let's follow the moonlight back.

483
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,280
Alright.

484
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,260
Chief, no need.

485
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,120
It’s warmer this way.

486
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,100
Okay.

487
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,180
Chief, look.

488
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,990
Great.

489
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,750
Now we can see the way.

490
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,810
But...

491
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,430
who placed the lanterns

492
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,390
here?

493
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,070
Let's hurry back.

494
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:47,910
Okay.

495
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,190
This trip to the Apothecary Valley

496
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,720
made us lose the sacred object.

497
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,110
Even the most powerful arsenopyrite of our sect

498
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,310
was destroyed by you.

499
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,550
But losing to you,

500
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,670
I accept it.

501
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,670
When you go back,

502
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,980
will you begin to develop new poison?

503
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,910
Of course.

504
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,190
One day,

505
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,480
-I will win it back.
-I will win it back.

506
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,230
You don't have to see me down the mountain.

507
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,830
Let's just say goodbye here.

508
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,510
Jing,

509
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,960
I do have something important to do.

510
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,020
I can't see you off.

511
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,750
But

512
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,310
I'll ask Mr. Huo

513
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,030
to see you off.

514
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,950
You're willing to let Mr. Seven

515
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,870
see me off?

516
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,150
Why wouldn't I?

517
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,000
Mr. Huo lived and ate in my valley

518
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,910
for free.

519
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,270
He should do some work to repay the debt.

520
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,910
Besides,

521
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,470
he's also leaving the mountain,

522
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,510
just like you.

523
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,030
Why do I hear

524
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,430
someone badmouthing me?

525
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,190
I'll repay you

526
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,990
in the future.

527
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,670
Without your order,

528
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,220
I'd have sent her off too.

529
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,910
Chief Jing, I still have to thank you

530
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,970
for giving me the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

531
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,710
I'll accept your offer then.

532
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:24,990
You must

533
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,250
take care of yourself.

534
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,440
And don't forget

535
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,550
what I told you.

536
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,110
Oh, right.

537
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,500
You must remember

538
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,190
what you promised me.

539
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,230
Of course.

540
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,910
Chief Jing.

541
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,150
I haven't

542
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,210
apologized to you.

543
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,140
I was rude last time.

544
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,210
I'm indebted to you again.

545
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,930
If the Moon Sect

546
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,150
ever needs my help,

547
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,910
I'll do my best to help.

548
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,320
You're too kind.

549
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,590
By the way,

550
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,790
there is

551
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,390
one more thing I haven't told you.

552
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,670
I wasn't the only one

553
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,930
who broke into Holy Lake that day.

554
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,590
There was someone else.

555
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,870
He's highly skilled.

556
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,210
I can't tell which sect he is from.

557
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,630
We were evenly matched.

558
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,150
It's not surprising.

559
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,270
Many covet

560
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,600
the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

561
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,990
After I stole the fungus,

562
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,710
he was still after me.

563
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,920
He seemed determined to get it.

564
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,200
Then he suddenly disappeared.

565
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,960
If it weren't for

566
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,030
Apothecary Valley's impenetrable Hail Formation,

567
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,950
I'd be worried that after we leave,

568
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,050
he'd barge into the valley

569
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,980
to steal it.

570
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,460
The fungus has been used.

571
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,830
Even if he comes now,

572
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,080
it's pointless.

573
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,250
Wait, the fungus has been used?

574
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,790
Yes.

575
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,470
Who was it used on?

576
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,270
Such a precious herb

577
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,990
was obviously

578
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,950
used on someone Ziye loves.

579
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,290
Someone she loves?

580
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,440
Hasn't

581
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,590
Mr. Seven left?

582
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,060
Why did he go to the cold spring?

583
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:58,870
Oh no.

584
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,680
Did she use

585
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,790
the Seven-Leaf Fungus

586
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,450
to save this man under the ice?

587
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,730
What are you doing?

588
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,990
I made it clear that

589
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,110
this is the valley's forbidden area.

590
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,570
Why did you still break in?

591
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,670
Chief Xue.

592
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,550
Where's the Seven-Leaf Fungus

593
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,240
I got?

594
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,920
Please leave immediately.

595
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,790
I just want you to take me

596
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,450
to see the Seven-Leaf Fungus.

597
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,310
Everything will be solved then.

598
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,470
Mr. Seven, you broke into the forbidden area,

599
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,000
which means you suspect me.

600
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,370
In that case,

601
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,110
what else is there to say?

602
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,110
Tomorrow,

603
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,300
return the Fate-Reversal Token.

604
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,630
I won't treat the child.

605
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,630
Why won't you tell me

606
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,830
where the fungus is?

607
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,270
Did you use it to

608
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,070
save this dead person?

609
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,000
What did you say?

610
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,389
I mean...

611
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,219
Shut up!

612
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,389
Get out!

613
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,270
Okay.

614
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,060
I'll go out.

615
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,230
But answer my question first...

616
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,260
Get out now!

617
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,270
Didn't you leave?

618
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,790
This is the forbidden cold spring.

619
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,990
How dare you break in?

620
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,150
Chief.

621
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,860
Chief.

622
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,110
What’s wrong?

623
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,510
Chief.

624
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,070
Chief.

625
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,750
I’m fine.

626
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,830
I just want you to

627
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,560
return the Seven-Leaf Fungus,

628
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,240
even if it's just a portion.

629
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,310
Please tell me

630
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,430
where the fungus is.

631
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,690
I fed it to the dogs.

632
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,600
Send this man

633
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,720
out of the valley right away.

634
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,080
Yes.

635
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,830
You...

636
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,710
You thought we used

637
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,670
the fungus?

638
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,750
I got the fungus

639
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,550
to save Mo.

640
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,270
But you used it

641
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,870
on the dead man in the ice.

642
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,930
How can I stay calm?

643
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,440
What did you say?

644
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,670
I said...

645
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,640
Chief asked you

646
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,670
to leave the valley right away!

647
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,860
Chief.

648
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,550
What else do you want?

649
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,590
You're really ungrateful.

650
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,910
Ms. Feng Lyu.

651
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,480
What do you mean?

652
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,790
You only have

653
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,450
one Fate-Reversal Token.

654
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,110
This token

655
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,440
is to cure Mo's disease.

656
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,930
You were poisoned from getting

657
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,590
the fungus.

658
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,830
Our chief didn’t...

659
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,750
Don’t stop me.

660
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,640
Our chief

661
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,670
treated you for free

662
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,580
without demanding the token

663
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,910
and 100,000 gold taels.

664
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,350
But you repaid her like this.

665
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,290
Feng Lyu, enough.

666
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,330
Why?

667
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,110
Why didn't Chief let him know

668
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,510
what the fungus was used for?

669
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,870
We didn't steal or rob.

670
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,790
He didn't know

671
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,470
and was suspicious of others.

672
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,310
I won't let Chief

673
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,030
be wronged!

674
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,910
But the Seven-Leaf Fungus...

675
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,390
Shut up.

676
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,960
Come with me.

677
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,760
Feng Lyu.

678
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,270
The environment here's special

679
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,050
with moisturizing snow.

680
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,450
It keeps the herbs alive.

681
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,550
Chief specially asked us

682
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,830
to put the fungus here.

683
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,830
Mo’s medicine requires more herbs.

684
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,080
It can't be made yet.

685
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,510
One leaf is missing.

686
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,470
Who used it?

687
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,990
Didn’t you hear Chief say

688
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,320
she fed the dogs with it?

689
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,070
You were poisoned by arsenopyrite.

690
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,330
Your life was at stake.

691
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,850
You owe it to our chief.

692
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,950
It’s too late.

693
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,200
Shuang Hong.

694
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,770
Only the fungus

695
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,150
can detoxify him.

696
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,190
Go get a leaf

697
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,230
of the fungus now.

698
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,550
Add ginseng to fortify it

699
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,430
and brew it into a soup.

700
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,070
But Chief…

701
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:16,990
Go.

702
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,750
Chief didn't tell you

703
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,870
probably because

704
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,590
she didn't want you

705
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,520
to feel guilty for using Mo's herb.

706
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,430
I was too reckless.

707
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,990
I even spoke to her in that tone.

708
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,870
Not only that,

709
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,490
you kept reminding Chief

710
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,970
that Mr. Xuehuai is dead.

711
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,190
You were rubbing salt in her wound!

712
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,810
But sealed under the ice,

713
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,570
he must be...

714
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,510
Yes,

715
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,050
that man is dead.

716
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,780
But must you tell her that?

717
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,570
-Granny.
-Granny.

718
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,710
I've long heard there's a granny in the valley

719
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,350
who has been with

720
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,580
three generations of the valley's chiefs.

721
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,670
That must be you.

722
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,460
I'm Seven of Sword Sect.

723
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,590
Greetings, Granny.

724
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,470
Do you think

725
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,210
people around Ziye

726
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,070
don't know about this?

727
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,310
But have you ever thought

728
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,340
why no one dared

729
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,550
to say he's dead

730
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,290
in front of her?

731
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,550
Back then,

732
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Ziye started

733
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,790
learning medicine

734
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,090
to revive Mr. Xuehuai.

735
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,150
She thinks

736
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,480
if her medical skills are good enough,

737
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,990
she can revive Xuehuai.

738
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,390
All these years,

739
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,960
she tried all kinds of methods.

740
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,460
You can imagine

741
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,150
how dangerous it was.

742
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,830
Why are you doing this?

743
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,550
Master.

744
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,760
You're replicating Xuehuai's condition

745
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,990
on your body

746
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,190
to test the medicine for him?

747
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,090
I doubt this method...

748
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,190
would work, yeah?

749
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,800
I'll go to the library

750
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
to research more.

751
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,300
No need.

752
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,130
Are you here to dissuade me again?

753
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,140
I told you...

754
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,950
I've discovered

755
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,110
how to cure Xuehuai.

756
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,510
What?

757
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,790
Many years ago,

758
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,010
there was a divine tree on Mount Kunlun.

759
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,340
This is the only withered branch left.

760
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,270
Its buds

761
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,840
are the active ingredient to cure Xuehuai.

762
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,590
But

763
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,470
you need to collect

764
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,850
Rootless Water every day

765
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,980
to water it

766
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,620
and make it sprout.

767
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,610
Thank you, Master.

768
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,070
I hope you discover

769
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,130
a new lease of life.

770
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,910
That's why she

771
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,910
collects Rootless Water every day.

772
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,860
So even the best doctor in the world

773
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,350
has someone

774
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,270
she can't save.

775
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
Ziye should know

776
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,230
Xuehuai can't be revived.

777
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,750
But

778
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,150
she doesn't want to face it.

779
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,470
So she doesn't need others pointing it out to her.

780
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,920
I’ll go

781
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,230
apologize to Chief Xue.

782
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,190
Mr. Seven.

783
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,280
I think you'd better leave.

784
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,390
Granny.

785
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,390
I misunderstood her.

786
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,660
I should apologize to her.

787
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,910
What's the use of apologizing?

788
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,030
You’d better leave now

789
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,630
so our valley can be in peace.

790
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,430
Yeah.

791
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,470
Mr. Seven.

792
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,800
Go find the second herb.

793
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,070
When you come back,

794
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,250
Chief should've calmed down.

795
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,930
Yes.

796
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,510
She’s fuming now.

797
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,670
If you go to her,

798
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,220
you're asking for trouble.

799
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,630
Don't show your face

800
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,550
to provoke her again.

801
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,270
Feng Lyu.

802
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,670
She has the cold disease.

803
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,150
In order to save

804
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,680
someone who can't be saved,

805
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,080
she's willing to suffer in the freezing cold.

806
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,960
To others,

807
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,090
this persistence and waiting

808
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,960
may be a kind of torture.

809
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,230
Holding onto the hope

810
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,890
that Xuehuai would wake up...

811
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,110
might be the inner hope and faith

812
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,950
of humans.

813
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,630
Granny.

814
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,350
Granny.

815
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,470
Is Chief Xue

816
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,090
looking for something?

817
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,480
What else do you want?

818
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,600
If I can't apologize in person,

819
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,630
I could do something for her

820
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,060
as an apology.
