00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,680
[Episode 13]

4
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,670
Master.

5
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,150
Why did I fall asleep?

6
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,310
Zhanbai,

7
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,630
didn't you leave?

8
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,270
Why are you back?

9
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,990
You fainted

10
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,190
due to your weakness

11
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,520
and the effects of the soothing incense.

12
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,030
Since you are unwell,

13
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,880
I had someone

14
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,190
call Mr. Huo back.

15
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,810
Mrs. Qiushui is taking care of Mo.

16
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,600
Given your current condition,

17
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,060
it's better to have someone by your side to look after you.

18
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,470
Zhanbai's injury has just healed.

19
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,760
This is a good opportunity for him

20
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
to rest and recover in the valley.

21
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,070
You are too impatient.

22
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,680
Without a healthy body,

23
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,820
how will you obtain those hard-to-get medicinal ingredients?

24
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,880
I'll listen to you.

25
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,710
Ziye.

26
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,990
Did you give Mr. Huo a day

27
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,940
to ask Qiushui He?

28
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,950
Mr. Huo

29
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,680
is someone who understands right from wrong.

30
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,310
Since he offered to ask,

31
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,579
it shows that he bears no bias

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,430
and only wants to find out the truth.

33
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,320
If what happened back then

34
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,050
is truly related to Qiushui He,

35
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,550
it's better for him to find out personally

36
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,590
than to hear it

37
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,630
from others later.

38
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,310
Ziye,

39
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,820
you sent Mr. Huo away

40
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,190
because you didn't want to make things difficult for him.

41
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,870
I hope

42
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,010
he understands your intentions.

43
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,150
There are things

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,750
that must be faced when the time comes.

45
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,550
Perhaps

46
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,310
this is fate.

47
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,580
I just wonder

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,560
how Qiushui He will respond.

49
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,150
Master,

50
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,910
hasn't your old back injury

51
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,630
healed yet?

52
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,790
It's nothing.

53
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,570
It's just an old issue.

54
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,230
Let me give you a massage.

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,700
No need.

56
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
No need.

57
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,990
It only aches a little

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
in this damp weather

59
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,110
sometimes.

60
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,030
It's nothing serious.

61
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,290
It's nothing serious.

62
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,190
If I hadn't been so naughty back then

63
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,670
and fallen off the cliff,

64
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,790
you wouldn't have been injured

65
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,950
because of me.

66
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,230
It's all in the past.

67
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,030
Forget it.

68
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,630
Zhanbai,

69
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,810
coming to see me at this late hour,

70
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,490
do you have something urgent?

71
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,030
No,

72
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,880
I just wanted to spend some more time with you.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,070
Yes.

74
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,790
Ever since you went to the Sword Sect,

75
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,870
we, as master and disciple,

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,150
have had fewer chances

77
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,950
to meet.

78
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,790
Master,

79
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,480
over these years,

80
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,310
as I traveled the martial world,

81
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,510
I have always adhered to your teachings

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,600
and met many

83
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,890
like-minded friends.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,470
Do you mean

85
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,430
your brothers from the Sword Sect?

86
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,870
Aside from them,

87
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,430
there are also fellow disciples from the Huashan Sect

88
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,820
and Wuji Sect.

89
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,030
And a girl.

90
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,110
That's

91
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,960
something you haven't mentioned before.

92
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,880
It's Chief Jing from the Moon Sect.

93
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,470
Chief Jing?

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,390
Yes.

95
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,890
In Mo's prescription,

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,600
there's an ingredient called Seven-Leaf Fungus,

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,730
which is a sacred item of the Moon Sect.

98
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,420
So I came to know Chief Jing

99
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,350
through a fight.

100
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,500
Chief Jing has a straightforward personality,

101
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,100
no less capable than any man.

102
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,240
If there's a chance,

103
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,590
I'll introduce Chief Jing

104
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,590
to you.

105
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,040
No need.

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,350
I have met Chief Jing

107
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,430
once before.

108
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,710
Master, you know Chief Jing too?

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,110
Back then, during the Moon Sect's ceremony

110
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,510
for the new chief,

111
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,990
I went there with Chief Nangong

112
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,070
and Chief Lin.

113
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,070
At that time, Chief Jing

114
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,470
had just taken on the role.

115
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,550
As you said,

116
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,190
despite her youth,

117
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,630
her decisiveness and efficiency

118
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,110
left a lasting impression.

119
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,920
At that time, Chief Jing was furious

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
when she found out

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,940
I had taken

122
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,470
their sect's sacred item.

123
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,070
She brought out two cups of poisoned wine

124
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,070
and made Chief Xue and me drink them.

125
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,230
Fortunately, the poison in the cups

126
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,350
was ordinary

127
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,410
and not the arsenopyrite from the Moon Sect.

128
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,110
In a way, she spared my life.

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
I'll make sure

130
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,110
to visit their sect another day

131
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,920
to thank Chief Jing for showing mercy

132
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,390
and giving the Seven-Leaf Fungus

133
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,800
to Mo for treatment.

134
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaking of Chief Jing,

135
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,440
the year she took on the role

136
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,440
was the fourth year of the Huijia era, I think.

137
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,990
Indeed, it was the fourth year of the Huijia era.

138
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,789
What's wrong?

139
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,330
The incident in Mo Family Village

140
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,429
also happened in the fourth year of the Huijia era.

141
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,070
Regarding that old case,

142
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,510
has the Sword Sect found any clues?

143
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,150
Just as you said,

144
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,310
it has been so many years,

145
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,720
and we haven't found any clues.

146
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,980
I remember your jade pendant

147
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,720
was also lost in the fourth year of the Huijia era.

148
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,320
Was it lost at the Moon Sect?

149
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,230
Who told you

150
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,160
that my jade pendant was lost

151
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,190
in the fourth year of the Huijia era?

152
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,760
Did I remember it wrong?

153
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,560
In the sixth year of the Huijia era,

154
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,430
I visited my wife's grave.

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,310
When I came back,

156
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,410
I found the jade pendant was missing.

157
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,770
It might have been lost in the back mountain.

158
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,230
But the back mountain is so vast,

159
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,550
it would be hard to find it.

160
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,070
Master,

161
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,550
the...

162
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,520
What's going on with you tonight?

163
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,730
You've been asking me all these questions.

164
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,670
You don't seem like

165
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,000
you're here to catch up,

166
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,350
more like you're interrogating me.

167
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,350
I dare not.

168
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,070
Enough.

169
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,090
It's getting late.

170
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,910
I'm tired.

171
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,640
Go back to sleep.

172
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,110
Well, rest early, Master.

173
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,010
Chief Qiushui, you haven't gone to rest yet?

174
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,150
Chief Xue.

175
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,730
Chief Qiushui, why are you here

176
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,150
so late at night?

177
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,350
Chief,

178
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,830
you seem to have something on your mind.

179
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,790
Coincidentally,

180
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,330
I have something I need to discuss with you.

181
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
You are

182
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,590
highly esteemed in the martial world

183
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,790
and a respected figure.

184
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,430
Tomorrow,

185
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,470
may I ask you to be my witness?

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,830
A witness for what?

187
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,750
Do you know

188
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,440
who the patient in the medicine hut is?

189
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,630
Who is it?

190
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,810
A guard from the Moon Sect.

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,330
Why would a guard from the Moon Sect

192
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,220
be here?

193
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,630
Mr. Huo

194
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,710
had previously asked you

195
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,670
to investigate the incident in Mo Family Village.

196
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Do you remember that?

197
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,720
Yes, I remember.

198
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,910
Could the incident in Mo Family Village

199
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,110
be related to you?

200
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm just investigating it.

201
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,440
When Mo Family Village was destroyed,

202
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,650
the culprit used arsenopyrite,

203
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,470
a poison unique to the Moon Sect.

204
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,520
However, after my investigation,

205
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,590
I found that the arsenopyrite the culprit used

206
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,990
was actually stolen

207
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,970
from the Moon Sect back then.

208
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,230
I have saved the guard who was watching over

209
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,360
the Moon Sect's pharmacy at that time.

210
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,230
She has fought against the culprit.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,890
If she wakes up,

212
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,790
she'll be able to

213
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,050
identify that person.

214
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,710
With this,

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,250
we can uncover the truth of what happened back then.

216
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,640
Chief Qiushui,

217
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,400
please be my witness tomorrow.

218
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,070
No matter who the culprit is,

219
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,110
I will seek justice

220
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,970
in front of the world.

221
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,990
Upholding justice

222
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,430
is my duty.

223
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,280
Unfortunately,

224
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,830
something happened in my sect,

225
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,760
and it's urgent.

226
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,590
I must

227
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,200
set out early tomorrow.

228
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,710
I want to help,

229
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,110
but I'm unable to.

230
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,470
In such a hurry?

231
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,230
Yes.

232
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,230
In that case,

233
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,010
I shouldn't keep you anymore.

234
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,550
Chief,

235
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,390
please take care on the road.

236
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,270
Chief Xue,

237
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,230
goodbye.

238
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,510
Senior?

239
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,670
It's so late.

240
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,870
What's so urgent that you need to see me?

241
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,670
Junior,

242
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,470
do you recognize this jade pendant?

243
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,030
Isn't this the jade pendant

244
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,490
Father gave you back then?

245
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,110
You both had one,

246
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,140
exactly the same.

247
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,230
Yes.

248
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,400
But Master told me

249
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,960
that his jade pendant was lost.

250
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,600
Do you know

251
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,090
when and where it was lost?

252
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,070
If I remember correctly,

253
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,570
it should have been in the fourth year of the Huijia era.

254
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,310
Are you sure it was the fourth year of the Huijia era?

255
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,970
You didn't remember it wrong?

256
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,150
I'm certain.

257
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,830
Because...

258
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,630
the fourth year of the Huijia era

259
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,150
was the year I came of age.

260
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,390
At that time, I begged Father

261
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,070
to give me the jade pendant

262
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,630
as a coming-of-age gift,

263
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
but he said

264
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,950
he had lost it.

265
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,680
After that,

266
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,310
it was just left unresolved.

267
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,990
Senior.

268
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,430
Senior?

269
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,510
What's wrong?

270
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,990
Why did you suddenly bring up the jade pendant?

271
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,550
Nothing.

272
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,550
Rest early.

273
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,250
Chief Qiushui,

274
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,230
are you going to kill to silence her again?

275
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,230
This is

276
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,200
all a trap you set?

277
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,670
You were the one who stole the arsenopyrite

278
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,530
and massacred Mo Family Village,

279
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,440
weren't you, Chief Qiushui?

280
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,550
I only mentioned the guard from the Moon Sect to test you.

281
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,410
She didn't see your face clearly.

282
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,070
If you weren't guilty,

283
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,840
why would you expose yourself so quickly?

284
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,230
Chief Xue, what connection do you have

285
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,510
with the incident in Mo Family Village?

286
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,830
I am the only survivor

287
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,470
of the massacre

288
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,670
in Mo Family Village.

289
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,590
You?

290
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,230
You were

291
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,430
the survivor back then?

292
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,790
Yes.

293
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,830
Good.

294
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,320
Good.

295
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,510
I cannot

296
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,790
escape from it anyway.

297
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,540
Cannot escape?

298
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,190
Chief Qiushui, do you mean

299
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,220
you are admitting to the crimes from back then?

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,660
It was

301
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,910
indeed my doing.

302
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,710
I don't want to be tormented

303
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,280
by what happened in the past any longer.

304
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,030
At that time,

305
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,720
due to a moment of poor judgment,

306
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,950
I did something wrong

307
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,000
and took the innocent lives

308
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,550
of those in Mo Family Village.

309
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,589
Back then,

310
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,910
what exactly happened?

311
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,450
In the fourth year of the Huijia era,

312
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
I led a team to Mo Family Village

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,829
just to find a child.

314
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,750
I heard that this child

315
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
had a unique body

316
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,290
and extraordinary abilities

317
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,200
that could greatly enhance our sect's strength.

318
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,790
I never intended to hurt them.

319
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,680
But unexpectedly,

320
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,990
an accident suddenly occurred.

321
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,950
Didn't I say no one was allowed to kill?

322
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,460
Who did it on their own?

323
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,200
It wasn't us.

324
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,200
We didn't do it.

325
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,110
Hurry up and clean up.

326
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,750
Don't alert the villagers.

327
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,240
Yes.

328
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,390
Chief,

329
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,960
we didn't kill him either.

330
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,390
Chief!

331
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,830
It was them!

332
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,750
It was them!

333
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,590
Chief!

334
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,830
Who are you?

335
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,230
Why did you kill him?

336
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,160
Hold on.

337
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,430
Everyone,

338
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,790
there may be some misunderstandings between us.

339
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,240
We didn't intend to kill him.

340
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,220
What misunderstandings?

341
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,470
He was killed by you!

342
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,710
Chief, look.

343
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,520
The body of Fugui is right there.

344
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,310
Chief,

345
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,900
shall we fight our way out?

346
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,420
No.

347
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,480
We have a purpose for this trip.

348
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
We cannot harm anyone again.

349
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,200
Let's go.

350
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,680
You can't leave!

351
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,610
Don't let them go!

352
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,570
You can't leave!

353
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,720
You can't leave!

354
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,470
Look!

355
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,830
There's a fire!

356
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,490
Fire!

357
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,330
Fire!

358
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,060
You killed him

359
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,860
and now set the village on fire.

360
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,510
They are trying

361
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,770
to push us to a dead end!

362
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,990
The flowers on their swords are snow lotuses!

363
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,590
Are you...

364
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,750
Are you from the Celestial Alp Sect?

365
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,670
I heard that the Celestial Alp Sect is a prestigious and righteous sect.

366
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,390
Why did you kill people at will

367
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,140
in our little village?

368
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,510
Yes!

369
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,720
Yes!

370
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,200
We must go to the Sword Sect

371
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,670
to seek justice!

372
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,750
Yes, seek justice!

373
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,230
Chief,

374
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
what should we do?

375
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,800
If this gets out,

376
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,790
our Celestial Alp Sect

377
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,510
won't be able to stand in the martial world anymore.

378
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,690
Killing people at will

379
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,580
is just unacceptable!

380
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,510
Is there no law?

381
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,530
You call yourselves a prestigious and righteous sect?

382
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:27,910
Yes!

383
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,350
Yes!

384
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,070
Yes!

385
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,270
Let's go, Chief.

386
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,900
Let's go.

387
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,310
Go!

388
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,550
Originally, we stole the arsenopyrite

389
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,150
as a precaution for emergencies.

390
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,150
But at that moment,

391
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,160
to protect the Celestial Alp Sect,

392
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,670
I had no choice but to order

393
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,080
the use of the arsenopyrite to kill and silence them.

394
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,670
One misstep

395
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,200
led to another,

396
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,710
ultimately resulting in that grave mistake.

397
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,860
Even if what you said about that day is true,

398
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,820
killing

399
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,280
was not the only solution.

400
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,710
In the end,

401
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,870
you prioritized your reputation in the martial world,

402
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,550
which led to that decision.

403
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,510
In Mo Family Village,

404
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,270
127 innocent lives

405
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,550
were lost.

406
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,580
They sought no conflict

407
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,440
and should have lived

408
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,000
peaceful, carefree lives,

409
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,930
yet because of your selfishness,

410
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,890
they were tragically massacred.

411
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,430
Chief Xue,

412
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,890
you took my pulse earlier.

413
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,120
You must have noticed

414
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,310
that I have something on my mind.

415
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,200
All these years,

416
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,210
I have not had a moment

417
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,370
without regretting that decision.

418
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,670
It was precisely because of this

419
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,350
that I have developed

420
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,610
this blood stasis condition.

421
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,190
No matter how much you blame yourself and repent,

422
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,320
what good does it do?

423
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,590
Those innocent lives

424
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,990
are gone.

425
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,150
I know

426
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,710
it's of no use.

427
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,670
Today, I saw you,

428
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,700
and the past was revealed.

429
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,160
Perhaps this is heaven

430
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,550
giving me a chance for atonement.

431
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
I only wish

432
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,110
to atone for the sins of the past.

433
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,360
Chief Xue,

434
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,420
I sincerely repent to you

435
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
and will not evade responsibility.

436
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,510
You don't need to repent to me.

437
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,750
I want you to kneel

438
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,090
before the spiritual tablets of the 127 villagers

439
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,610
from Mo Family Village,

440
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,990
repenting and apologizing to them.

441
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,240
Okay.

442
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,070
I also want you

443
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,150
to publicly confess your crimes

444
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,540
and express your regrets.

445
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,160
No!

446
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,230
Why not?

447
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,430
I deserve my punishment.

448
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,180
It's up to you to decide my fate.

449
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,410
However, if you want me

450
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,340
to apologize in front of the world,

451
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,230
that would ruin the reputation

452
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,690
of the Celestial Alp Sect.

453
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,660
I absolutely cannot agree to that.

454
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,910
I hope, Chief Xue,

455
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
that you won't get the Celestial Alp Sect involved.

456
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
Is it the reputation

457
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,550
of the Celestial Alp Sect

458
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,630
or your own reputation?

459
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,390
Chief Xue.

460
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,630
How to confess

461
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,430
is not for you to decide!

462
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,240
Chief Xue,

463
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,670
I know

464
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,580
I am deeply guilty.

465
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,730
Just take

466
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,670
my life,

467
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,070
but I beg you

468
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,240
not to ruin the Celestial Alp Sect's reputation.

469
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,350
Do you think I wouldn't dare to kill you?

470
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,950
If you die,

471
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,090
it will be over for you.

472
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,350
But the 127 wronged souls

473
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,230
of Mo Family Village

474
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,210
will still remain silent, without justice.

475
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,360
I won't kill you.

476
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,790
I want you to confess publicly.

477
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,790
So,

478
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,320
I have no choice

479
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,440
but to confess publicly?

480
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,950
You have no other choice.

481
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,100
You are forcing me into this.

482
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,590
I'll have to

483
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,900
make another mistake.

484
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,030
Zhanbai?

485
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,820
Master,

486
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,830
don't make another mistake.

487
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,240
Did he hurt you?

488
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,670
I'm fine.

489
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,290
What about you?

490
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,470
I'm fine too.

491
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,750
Master!

492
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,340
Master!

493
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,330
It's karma.

494
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,510
Master.

495
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,110
Master!

496
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,000
Master!

497
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,350
Master.

498
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,950
Master.

499
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,680
Master.

500
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,510
Master!

501
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,750
Master.

502
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,470
Master! Master!

503
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,520
He temporarily stopped breathing,

504
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,350
but there is

505
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,030
still a faint trace of life in his pulse.

506
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,160
He is not truly dead.

507
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,360
Carry him into the valley.

508
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,130
[Yuan Yi Palace, Eye's residence]

509
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,470
I...

510
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,820
His life has been saved.

511
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,110
Thank you.

512
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,260
Senior,

513
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,700
I heard that Father fainted.

514
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,900
Is it because his blood stasis condition flared up again?

515
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,140
How could he be so seriously injured?

516
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,390
What happened?

517
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,230
Impossible!

518
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,350
Senior,

519
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,870
could there be

520
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,330
some misunderstandings?

521
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:39,750
I...

522
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,430
You know what kind of person

523
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,340
Father is.

524
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,350
-He would never...
-At first, I didn't believe it either.

525
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,430
It wasn't until I heard Master

526
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,760
confess with my own ears

527
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,670
and witnessed him

528
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,870
attack Chief Xue

529
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,180
that I had to accept the truth.

530
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,110
Junior,

531
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,240
I'll report this to the Sword Sect.

532
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,750
No.

533
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,430
Senior,

534
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,440
as you know,

535
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,450
Father plans to retire from the martial world

536
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,910
this time when he returns.

537
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,200
If the Sword Sect finds out about this,

538
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,470
Father's lifetime reputation

539
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,790
will be completely ruined.

540
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,590
That would be

541
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,410
more painful than killing him.

542
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:13,910
But people must

543
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,710
pay the price for their actions.

544
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,110
I am not one of the victims

545
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,440
from Mo Family Village.

546
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,010
I have no right to decide for those who have died

547
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,290
or for Chief Xue.

548
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,180
Then I will plead with Chief Xue for mercy.

549
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,950
Don't go.

550
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,770
Junior Sister,

551
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,090
you must not go.

552
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,790
It was already a great act of mercy for Chief Xue

553
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,160
to agree to save Master.

554
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,190
Don't make it harder for her.

555
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,450
How could this happen?

556
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,850
How could this happen?

557
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:28,530
♫Longing etched in my heart, but all it brings is parting♫

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:54,870
Chief asked me

575
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,200
to bring you a jar of Laughing at the World.

576
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,280
Granny Ning.

577
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,080
Mr. Huo?

578
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,480
Ziye is not here.

579
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,950
I came here for you.

580
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,500
Me?

581
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,850
Granny Ning, you live here in seclusion

582
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,580
but are always well-informed.

583
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,190
I'm sure

584
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,470
you already know about

585
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,280
what happened recently in the valley.

586
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,630
This is a mistake of your elders.

587
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,670
It must be really hard for you.

588
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,350
Chief Xue did not allow me

589
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,080
to get involved in this matter.

590
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,230
It's not hard for me.

591
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,490
Now that you know the truth,

592
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,070
with your temperament,

593
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,770
you must be feeling upset.

594
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,430
That's why

595
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,780
Ziye sought me out multiple times,

596
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,040
desperately trying to find a way to send you away.

597
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,360
Chief Xue

598
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,760
really considered a lot for me.

599
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,130
That's because she is just like you.

600
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,590
If the situation

601
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,950
were reversed,

602
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,970
you would consider it the same way she did.

603
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,030
Unfortunately,

604
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,750
I cannot be in her shoes,

605
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,030
nor can I share her pain.

606
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,100
Don't blame yourself.

607
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,480
Although she told me

608
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,620
to let the past go,

609
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,950
I know that it was because

610
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,950
she valued

611
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,840
our friendship

612
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,480
and feared that I would carry a burden in my heart.

613
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,870
But I'm sure

614
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,790
she is suffering.

615
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,330
Saving an enemy with her own hands,

616
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,230
no one can escape

617
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,360
the torment within.

618
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,190
I just hope she

619
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,870
doesn't bottle

620
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,070
everything up inside

621
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,950
and suffer alone.

622
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,150
Since you know,

623
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,150
why did you come to me

624
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,530
instead of comforting her in person?

625
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,170
After all,

626
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,750
I am the disciple of the person who massacred her village.

627
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,550
This doesn't seem appropriate.

628
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,870
That's why I came

629
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,310
to invite you

630
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,170
to help me comfort Chief Xue.

631
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,670
You're so thoughtful.

632
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,670
Comforting Ziye

633
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,750
is my duty.

634
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,410
Then thank you.

635
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,080
It's already late at night.

636
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,250
Why did you come over, Granny?

637
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,790
These days,

638
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,070
so much has happened.

639
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,480
I came to check on you.

640
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,470
I'm fine.

641
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,270
Don't worry, Granny.

642
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,510
Ziye,

643
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,430
you took charge

644
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,370
of the Apothecary Valley at 18.

645
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,760
To the outside world,

646
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,730
you're a miraculous healer

647
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,310
and a calm leader.

648
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,550
I know that's because

649
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,510
you've been

650
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,090
relying on yourself

651
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,250
in everything you've experienced

652
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,490
since childhood.

653
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,910
But Ziye,

654
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,150
you have me.

655
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,590
You can talk to me.

656
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,670
Don't keep

657
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,090
everything to yourself

658
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,950
and bear it all alone.

659
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,330
You're feeling upset

660
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,730
about saving Qiushui He

661
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,470
because you feel guilty toward

662
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,730
the lost villagers of Mo Family Village.

663
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Good child.

664
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,750
I understand.

665
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,590
The fact that you could make up your mind

666
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,670
to save Qiushui He

667
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
was enough to show

668
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,830
that you remembered Chief Liao's teaching

669
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,490
of the healer's benevolence.

670
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,030
You are first and foremost a healer,

671
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,710
and only secondarily Xue Ziye.

672
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,990
Your kindness

673
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,190
will surely be understood

674
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,570
by the villagers in heaven.

675
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,990
Thank you, Granny.

676
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,430
In this world,

677
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,800
many things

678
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,070
hinge on a single thought,

679
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,430
regardless of good and evil.

680
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,510
I believe

681
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,710
that good will be rewarded with good,

682
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,710
and evil will be punished with evil.

683
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,990
It all depends on the choices one makes.

684
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,030
In fact,

685
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,830
I came here tonight

686
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,670
at the request of Mr. Huo.

687
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,310
He knows

688
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,340
that there are some things on your mind

689
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,870
that you find inconvenient to share with him.

690
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,580
I truly don't know

691
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,740
how to face him.

692
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,990
It's a good thing

693
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,820
that you both can think of each other.

694
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,430
Chief Xue.

695
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,570
Mrs. Qiushui, what are you doing?

696
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,160
Get up.

697
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,790
Chief Xue.

698
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,910
Get up first.

699
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,680
We can talk after you get up.

700
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,140
You must accept my kneeling.

701
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,110
My father

702
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,940
made such a grave mistake before

703
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,080
and hurt you deeply.

704
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,090
Yet you were noble enough

705
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,140
to save his life.

706
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,060
He has wronged you deeply

707
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,030
but is also greatly indebted to you.

708
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,960
As his daughter,

709
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,650
I should atone for his sins

710
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,130
and repay your kindness on his behalf.

711
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,280
Get up first.

712
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,150
Get up.

713
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,270
Mrs. Qiushui, you don't need to apologize.

714
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,230
One must take responsibility for their actions.

715
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,030
You can't atone for your father.

716
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,390
Chief Qiushui is no longer in serious condition.

717
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,590
Take good care of him.

718
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,960
It seems Chief Xue

719
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,650
still cannot forgive Father.

720
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,190
We owe her.

721
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,870
Mr. Huo.

722
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,110
Mr. Xia and Mr. Zhou are here.

723
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,830
They went to the Winter Hall.

724
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,080
No one expected

725
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,630
that Chief Qiushui, who is usually chivalrous

726
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,830
and highly esteemed,

727
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,550
would commit

728
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,450
such an evil deed in secret.

729
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,550
Fortunately,

730
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,200
his life has been saved.

731
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Seventh Brother,

732
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,110
I know you're feeling upset.

733
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,830
Although Chief Qiushui

734
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,150
didn't intend to do that,

735
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,750
over 100 lives

736
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,810
from Mo Family Village

737
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,140
cannot be brought back.

738
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,070
Eight,

739
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,230
if you don't know how to offer comfort,

740
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,150
just say less.

741
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,950
Seven,

742
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,950
in your letter,

743
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,910
you mentioned that Chief Qiushui

744
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,730
is unwilling to confess publicly.

745
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,820
Let's take him back

746
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,630
and let Chief make the decision.
