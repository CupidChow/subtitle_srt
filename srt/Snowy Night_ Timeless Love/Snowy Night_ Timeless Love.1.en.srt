In my opinion,

you can still go on as chief

194
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,310

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,670
Chief!

197
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,350
What's wrong?

198
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,470
Why are you so flustered?

199
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,390
Mo...

200
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,710
Mo is not well.

201
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,750
Doctor!

202
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,670
Doctor!

203
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,190
Doctor, don't go!

204
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,110
Doctor!

205
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,990
Doctor, don't go!

206
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,470
Can you figure something out?

207
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,260
I'm begging you.

208
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,750
[Xu Chonghua's wife: Qiushui Yin]

209
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,750
If you leave,

210
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,390
Mo will really die.

211
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,910
It's not that I don't want to save him.

212
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,910
It's beyond my means.

213
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,690
Madam.

214
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,990
You'd better find someone else.

215
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,230
What do you mean?

216
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,350
Junior.

217
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,750
Get up first.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,860
Don't touch me!

219
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,790
Ms. Qiushui.

220
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,470
Chief!

221
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,470
Chief.

222
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm begging you.

223
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,350
Please ask the doctor

224
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,170
to save Mo, okay?

225
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,190
Ms. Qiushui, don't be anxious.

226
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,260
Get up first.

227
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,970
Come on.

228
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,110
Madam.

229
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,820
Doctors are benevolent.

230
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,550
If I can save him,

231
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,420
why'd I refuse it?

232
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,870
I don't even know

233
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,190
the cause of his illness,

234
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,590
let alone cure him.

235
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,550
Madam.

236
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,870
-It's best to prepare...
-Huan.

237
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,240
See the doctor off.

238
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:22,870
Yes.

239
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,370
Doctor, please.

240
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,710
Is there really

241
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,670
no other way?

242
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
As a mother,

243
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,070
do I really have to

244
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,670
see my child die?

245
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,590
There might be

246
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,230
someone who could cure him.

247
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,940
Who is it?

248
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,750
Apothecary Valley's

249
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,750
Xue Ziye?

250
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,110
That's right.

251
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,510
Chief.

252
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,350
Where is Apothecary Valley?

253
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,700
I'll bring Mo there now.

254
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,430
Ms. Qiushui, don't be too anxious.

255
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,710
Apothecary Valley

256
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,110
has its rules.

257
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,590
I heard that if you want

258
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,870
Chief Xue's treatment,

259
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,100
you must have the Fate-Reversal Token

260
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,500
and 100,000 gold taels.

261
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,480
I can prepare

262
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,440
the medical fee.

263
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,250
But this Fate-Reversal Token...

264
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,230
What about it?

265
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,440
Countless martial artists

266
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,790
fight for this death-defying token.

267
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,230
It's not easy to get it.

268
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,030
Leave it to me.

269
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,730
I'll figure it out.

270
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,030
But the year is coming to an end.

271
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,710
The Fate-Reversal Token

272
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,710
will be voided after New Year's Eve.

273
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,950
I wonder if

274
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,630
we can make it in time.

275
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,710
Junior.

276
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,780
Set off for

277
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,480
Apothecary Valley with Mo.

278
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,150
I'll find a way to get the Fate-Reversal Token.

279
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,750
By then,

280
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,050
we'll meet at Apothecary Valley.

281
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,190
You must remember

282
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,430
to arrive

283
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,710
before New Year's Eve.

284
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,130
[Apothecary Valley entrance]

285
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,339
Didn't our boss send us a message

286
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,329
that he's recovered and leaving the valley today?

287
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,480
Why is he still

288
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,660
not out?

289
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,890
Although our boss

290
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,069
is famous for his gambling skills,

291
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,950
he is

292
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,190
also very handsome.

293
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,520
Right?

294
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,369
I heard that Apothecary Valley's chief

295
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,520
fancies beautiful people.

296
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,910
Maybe she can't bear to say goodbye

297
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,630
and made him...

298
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,630
That makes sense.

299
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,310
Boss!

300
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,790
Boss.

301
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,270
What happened?

302
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,870
This Xue Ziye is such a devil!

303
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,890
Where are your clothes?

304
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,440
Hurry up!

As the Gambling King

309
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,870
and an upright man,

310
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,760
how can you be humiliated like this?

311
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,290
[Xuanyuan Sanguang]

312
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,590
It was so humiliating!

313

Boss.

314
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,350
Should I go in

315
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,280
and kill Xue Ziye?

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,890
I'll go too.

317
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,890
We'll avenge you.

318
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,210
Preposterous!

319
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Who wants to resort to violence in Apothecary Valley?

320
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,370
It's fine that

321
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,670
you're bad at gambling,

322
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,170
but you’re even dishonest.

323
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,480
You owe my chief

324
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,370
3,108,600 taels

325
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,490
in gambling debt.

326
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,790
Including the valuable clothes you mortgaged,

327
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,520
you're still short of 97 taels.

328
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,470
Chief said

329
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,950
you can only leave after your debt's clear.

330
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,950
So you lost in gambling?

331
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,070
Screw you!

332
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,190
Do I look like I have

333
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,740
even a penny on me now?

334
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,990
Of course you don’t.

335
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,110
Our chief predicted that

336
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,460
people will pick you up.

337
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,890
That's why I came out to collect the debt.

338
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,790
Hurry up.

339
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,810
It's freezing.

340
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,630
This is the Apothecary Valley.

341
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,630
The world's best healer, Xue Ziye,

342
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,630
is our chief.

343
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,490
In today's martial world, good and evil stand opposed.

344
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,170
Only our Apothecary Valley in the north

345
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,900
doesn't belong to either faction.

346
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,030
We stand aloof from the martial world.

347
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,430
Because of our rejuvenation techniques,

348
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,890
we're respected by all in the martial world.

349
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,830
Our Apothecary Valley

350
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,760
is located in the far north of Mohe,

351
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,880
but for millenia,

352
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,550
the valley's underground fire has formed hot springs.

353
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,240
Therefore,

354
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,970
we have four distinct seasons.

355
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,130
We have four halls:

356
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,890
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter Halls.

357
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,390
We live here.

358
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,320

is even worse.

that our chief is greedy and lustful.

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,670
what Sword Sect is like.

576
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,410
I won't be so rude.

577
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,470
But...

578
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,080
It's the New Year's.

579
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,830
It's bustling with reunions everywhere.

580
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
The two of us

581
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,570
are alone on a snowy night.

582
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,170
It’s also fate to meet each other.

583
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,250
May I invite you

584
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,120
to enjoy the snow with me?

585
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,990
Chief Xue!

586
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,950
Are you going to

587
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,880
just let him die?

588
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,630
He's not here.

589
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,230
Why is it my fault?

590
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,410
It's my rule to

591
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,750
observe a time limit.

592
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,110
It's his fate

593
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,870
that he can't be treated.

594
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,330
When there's a will, there's a way!

595
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,680
I'd like to see

596
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,310
if you have enough human will

597
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,270
to cause fate to change.

598
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,430
I will make you

599
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,250
take in Mo.

600
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,850
How dare he break into Apothecary Valley?

601
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,230
Even the huge valley gate

602
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,330
couldn't stop him.

603
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,470
Activate the Snow Hail Formation.

604
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,910
Yes.

605
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,390
This formation has many traps.

606
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,280
No one has ever overcome it.

607
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,750
He's really full of himself.

608
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,150
Anesthetic powder?

609
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,630
How could he overcome

610
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,480
the Snow Hail Formation so easily?

611
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,670
Apothecary Valley has been established for nearly a century.

612
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,460
We've seen many impressive martial artists.

613
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,660
But he's the first one

614
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,190
to overcome the formation.

615
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,590
If he takes a step closer,

616
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,090
we'll have to end his life.

617
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,050
He overcame the Snow Hail Formation.

618
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,150
Why isn't he breaking into this gate?

619
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,080
He just wanted to prove to me that

620
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,220
human will can surpass fate.

621
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,070
If he wants to come in,

622
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,590
no one can stop him.

623
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,360
He is so reckless.

624
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,940
Let's teach him a lesson.

625
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,150
He is determined.

626
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,800
It's pointless to stop him.

627
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,040
I challenged the formation

628
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,000
because I'm desperate.

629
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,950
Please forgive me

630
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,150
if I've offended you.

631
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,590
I just hope

632
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,370
you'll treat the patient.

633
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,520
I'll be eternally grateful

634
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,990
and indebted to you.

635
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,070
In the future,

636
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,150
I'll be at your disposal.

637
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,230
Chief Xue.

638
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,550
You've asked me for treatment repeatedly.

639
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,950
But the patient is still

640
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,710
not here.

641
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,450
You risked your life for him for nothing.

642
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,390
He's here.

643
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,150
That is the person you'd sacrifice your life

644
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,280
to save?

645
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,910
If possible,

646
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm willing to pay with my life.

647
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,460
What pointless words.

648
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,550
If you can

649
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,630
really trade your life

650
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,240
for another person's life,

651
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,630
there wouldn't be so many

652
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,950
in agony and despair.

653
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,230
Besides,

654
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,390
you're attempting the impossible.

655
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,350
Is it really worth it?

656
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,740
Has anyone ever overcome

657
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,910
the Snow Hail Formation?

658
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,390
No.

659
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,990
You won't know

660
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,110
before you try.

661
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,590
Junior.

662
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,760
Chief Xue is at the door.

663
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,990
Chief Xue.

664
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,190
I’m Qiushui Yin, the daughter

665
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,350
of Celestial Alp Sect's chief Qiushui He.

666
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,630
Please save my child.

667
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,350
If my child survives,

668
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,810
Celestial Alp Sect will thank you properly.

669
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,290
No wonder you worked so hard just now.

670
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,750
You're a good father.

671
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,210
Mo is not my son,

672
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,540
but he's akin to one.

673
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,850
Please, Chief Xue.

674
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,470
Please, Chief Xue.

675
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,670
Please save my child.

676
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,790
Chief Xue,

677
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,440
please treat the child.

678
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,670
Chief Xue!

679
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,350
Chief Xue!

680
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,120
This is the first Fate-Reversal Token

681
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,270
of the year.
