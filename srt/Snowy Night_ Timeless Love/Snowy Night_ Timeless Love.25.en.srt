[Episode 25]

4
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,310
It's cold these days.

5
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,810
Don't let Bao catch a cold.

6
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,310
Always heat up your food

7
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,710
and dress warmly outside.

8
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,550
If anything goes wrong,

9
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,480
I won't let you off when I come back.

10
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,620
Don't worry. You too.

11
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,000
You'll be out alone.

12
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,790
Dress warmly

13
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,710
so you don't catch a cold.

14
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,829
Speak for yourself.

15
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,610
Your cold will be gone

16
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,910
after a few more doses of medicine.

17
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,370
Don't forget to take them.

18
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,460
Okay.

19
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,910
Fengxing.

20
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,430
I don't know when I'll return.

21
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,910
It depends on Mo’s condition.

22
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,040
It could be a few days

23
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,200
or one or two months.

24
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,440
You'll be alone at home.

25
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,130
You must be extra careful.

26
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
I'll wait for you.

27
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,120
If I find out

28
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,470
you're fooling around,

29
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,430
I'll break your legs.

30
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,990
I'll bring you back

31
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,920
your favorite plum blossom cakes.

32
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,970
Come back soon.

33
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,310
The so-called perfect couple

34
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,440
is no big deal, I see.

35
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,529
Fifth Brother.

36
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,630
Stop dawdling.

37
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,480
Let Senior Liao go.

38
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,280
Bye, Fifth Brother.

39
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,350
Take care of your sister-in-law!

40
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,080
Don’t worry!

41
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,750
Chief.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,240
Come in.

43
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,190
Is he awake?

44
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,050
You saved Envoy Miao Feng.

45
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,230
When he wakes up,

46
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,430
are you really

47
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,030
leaving the valley with him?

48
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,390
Silly girl.

49
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,670
I saved him

50
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,360
only on account

51
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,920
that we were chess mates.

52
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,360
When he wakes up,

53
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,480
I'll make him leave the valley.

54
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,310
I was worried

55
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,510
you'd go with him

56
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,670
because you're concerned of Mr. Mingjie

57
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,130
who went to Yuan Yi Palace.

58
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,630
If I thought so,

59
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,040
I'd have agreed in the first place.

60
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,950
You can

61
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,090
hide it from Shuang Hong...

62
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,390
but not me.

63
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,070
Since you've guessed it,

64
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,680
I'll be honest with you.

65
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,670
Yes.

66
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,470
I've decided.

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,710
When he wakes up,

68
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,570
I'll go to Yuan Yi Palace with him.

69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,390
Ziye.

70
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,390
Think it over.

71
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,230
Yuan Yi Palace

72
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,190
is a dangerous place.

73
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,310
You are so weak.

74
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,490
How can you take the risk alone?

75
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,110
I know that, of course.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,640
But Granny,

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,630
you know me best.

78
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,910
This time,

79
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,430
I must go.

80
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,560
I understand.

81
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,950
You always

82
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,659
put others first.

83
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,550
What about yourself?

84
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,030
What about Mr. Huo?

85
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,659
The Laughing at the World wine under the plum tree

86
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,940
is almost ready.

87
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,510
He hopes to come back

88
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,930
to drink with you.

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
Can you really bear to

90
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,880
leave him a lone soul in the moonlight?

91
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,210
If he finds out the prescription is fake,

92
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,310
will he still drink with me?

93
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,580
Silly girl.

94
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,900
You know he will.

95
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,750
If he

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,120
finds out

97
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,430
your decision today,

98
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,350
he'll be

99
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,230
a million times more heartbroken than us.

100
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,350
I'd love to want for his return

101
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,080
and drink with him under the plum tree.

102
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,680
Even if I apologize to him face to face,

103
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,590
But I must go

104
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,030
to Yuan Yi Palace too.

105
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,390
Chief.

106
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,230
Granny, Shuang Hong.

107
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,030
I've made up my mind.

108
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,500
I hope

109
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,690
you'll keep this secret for me

110
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,040
so only the three of us know.

111
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,940
Before I leave,

112
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,220
you mustn't tell the others.

113
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,160
After I leave,

114
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,860
just tell them

115
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,670
I went to Sword Sect to treat the injured,

116
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,310
lest they

117
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,630
worry like you two.

118
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,590
Promise me.

119
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,549
You two will have to bear this burden alone.

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,110
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,710
Don't worry.

122
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,360
While I'm gone,

123
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,100
please

124
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,070
take care of the valley

125
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,470
and wait for me.

126
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,310
Silly girl.

127
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,290
Why are you crying?

128
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,770
It's not like I'm not coming back.

129
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,370
Don't move.

130
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,150
The wound on your abdomen is deep.

131
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,480
You can’t get out of bed.

132
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,190
Chief Xue.

133
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,050
You recovered so quickly.

134
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,110
I knew it.

135
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,070
You deliberately avoided

136
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,730
cutting your blood meridian,

137
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,820
betting I won't watch you die.

138
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,150
I can kill myself now

139
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,830
to calm your anger.

140
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,310
But before that,

141
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,990
please head to

142
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,450
Kunlun as soon as possible

143
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,980
before my leader's condition worsens.

144
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,010
He poisoned you with Ice Silkworm Poison when you were little,

145
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,060
yet you are willing to die for him?

146
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,230
I'm indebted

147
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,230
to my leader.

148
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,560
I don’t understand.

149
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,210
You don't know that

150
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,550
I'm originally from the Sang royal family.

151
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,140
Later, the state was in decline

152
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,800
and we were forced into exile.

153
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,360
We encountered bandits on the way.

154
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,950
I survived till now

155
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,000
thanks to him.

156
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,880
So I'll devote my lifetime

157
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,150
to serve him

158
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,070
at any cost.

159
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,650
So it seems

160
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,850
he'd done something good before.

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I've heard of the sect's Five Sages.

162
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,790
I wonder if they're all

163
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,420
under his tutelage

164
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,870
because he saved

165
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,030
their lives.

166
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,150
Please lend a helping hand.

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,900
Before you invited me out of the valley

168
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,360
as Yuan Yi Palace's envoy,

169
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
you cut ties

170
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,410
as a chess mate.

171
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,590
Since you

172
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,240
didn't use our ties to threaten me,

173
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,970
you're still a gentleman.

174
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,710
I promise you.

175
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,760
I'll go to Kunlun with you

176
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
to treat your leader.

177
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,790
But

178
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,350
I have one condition.

179
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,710
Anything you want.

180
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,680
Is it up to you?

181
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,590
Yes, it is.

182
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,640
The leader stated that

183
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,950
as long as you agree to treat him,

184
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,710
I can agree to

185
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,070
any request.

186
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,480
Looks like

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
your leader is

188
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,730
really sick this time.

189
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,710
My condition is simple.

190
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,990
After I leave the valley,

191
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,850
the valley's safety must be guaranteed.

192
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,350
Of course.

193
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,110
Okay.

194
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,990
A day later,

195
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,860
I'll go with you

196
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,790
to Kunlun.

197
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,030
Thank you.

198
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,550
But can we leave tomorrow morning?

199
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,350
I can.

200
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,190
But you can't.

201
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,150
You'd better lie down and rest.

202
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,430
The sooner you recover,

203
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,760
the sooner we can leave.

204
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,360
Okay.

205
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,950
Seven.

206
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,290
Actually, I have to thank you.

207
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,950
If it weren't for you,

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,150
my silly disciple

209
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,360
wouldn't have let go of her obsession.

210
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,000
She has been working too hard these years.

211
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,430
Now that she can let it go,

212
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
she can start over.

213
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,670
Chief Liao.

214
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Your disciple's quite the drinker.

215
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,050
I'm looking forward to going back

216
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,710
to the valley

217
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,590
to compete with her.

218
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,430
You can never beat her.

219
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,690
She learned

220
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,420
drinking

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,130
and the finger-guessing game from me.

222
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,550
Do you know?

223
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,390
Your fifth brother Wei Fengxing

224
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,250
became mine

225
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,480
because he lost to me.

226
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,710
If you go back,

227
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,120
you might end up in the same plight.

228
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,120
That's nice too.

229
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,850
I wonder what you're doing now.

230
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:15,220
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

231
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,060
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

232
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,250
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

233
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,910
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

234
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,600
♫Several times my sleeve brushed by, wanting to pause my hand♫

235
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:57,470
♫Feelings are hard to describe, yet they long to pierce my heart and soul♫

236
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,020
♫I gaze at the mountains and rivers, seeking a place to return♫

237
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:11,530
♫Yet my true home lies in the deepest part of your gaze♫

238
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:21,080
♫I have a pot of new wine and a warm stove♫

239
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,050
♫When the sky is about to snow, I can have a drink♫

240
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,030
Ziye.

241
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,740
I will return soon.

242
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:35,340
♫My hesitations left too many regrets♫

243
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,820
Please wait with the warm wine.

244
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,330
♫Will you spend your time with me?♫

245
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,430
Actually,

246
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,230
I've long devoted myself to you.

247
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,810
I miss you so much.

248
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,710
Ziye's been busy all day.

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,910
She's getting ready for bed.

250
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,710
Let's wait until she wakes up.

251
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,190
Granny, don't stop us.

252
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,740
Please let us in.

253
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,230
Granny.

254
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,920
Yes.

255
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,030
Let them in.

256
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,180
-Chief!
-Let us in.

257
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,590
Go in.

258
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,230
Ask Chief.

259
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,030
Chief!

260
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,790
What is it you have to ask?

261
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,990
Chief.

262
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,830
The villagers said

263
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,830
you're going on a long trip.

264
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,620
Is that true?

265
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,980
I couldn't hide it from you after all.

266
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,900
Chief, you're too weak

267
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,990
to leave the valley!

268
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,680
Yes, Chief.

269
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,630
Don’t go, okay?

270
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,390
Chief, you can’t take it.

271
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,230
Don’t worry.

272
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,390
I'm going

273
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,830
to treat the old chief

274
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,910
of Sword Sect.

275
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,390
I'll be heading south.

276
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,050
It's good for my cold disease.

277
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,030
Besides,

278
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,150
the man from Sword Sect said

279
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,200
he knows the Spring Breeze technique.

280
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,550
His internal force is strong.

281
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,080
He can expel the cold for me.

282
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,710
With him escorting me,

283
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,230
you don't have to worry.

284
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,550
But we still...

285
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,150
Didn't you hear what Ziye said?

286
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,230
Spring Breeze

287
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,790
will keep Ziye safe.

288
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,590
I studied medicine.

289
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,590
I can confirm.

290
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,870
Don’t worry.

291
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,750
Even Granny Ning agrees.

292
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,710
Can you

293
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,230
finally rest assured?

294
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,790
Chief.

295
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,710
In that case,

296
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,470
why don't you take me with you?

297
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,829
I can

298
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,310
take care of you on the way.

299
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,230
Yes, Chief.

300
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,770
You'll take care of me?

301
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,710
You're so reckless.

302
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,230
Won't I end up

303
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,869
taking care of you instead?

304
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,790
Chief! Chief!

305
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,670
I’m not reckless.

306
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,470
Let me go with you.

307
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,130
We can take care of each other.

308
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,890
You'd better

309
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,300
stay in the valley

310
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,600
and study medicine.

311
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,350
I'll test you when I come back

312
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,750
to see if you’ve improved.

313
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,630
Chief,

314
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,680
take me then.

315
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,490
I'm strong.

316
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,470
I'll do all

317
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,470
the manual labor.

318
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,030
I think you're just

319
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,230
eyeing Jiangnan food

320
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,230
and want to eat all along the way.

321
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,590
If there's time to spare,

322
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,030
we can do that.

323
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh, buzz off.

324
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,390
Chief.

325
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,340
Take me with you.

326
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,550
Look at them.

327
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,550
One wants to eat,

328
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,750
and the other can’t learn anything.

329
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,470
I can find good food

330
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,150
for Chief.

331
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,430
Why are you fighting with me?

332
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,540
I'm the best choice.

333
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm the best.

334
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,910
Why don't we go together?

335
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,030
-Sounds good!
-Sounds good!

336
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,790
What's good?

337
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,870
Your medical skills are so poor.

338
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,200
How can I take you there?

339
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,710
Stay put in the valley

340
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,350
and improve your medical skills.

341
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,150
Go back now.

342
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,150
Alright.

343
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,950
Let... Let Chief rest.

344
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,800
Let’s pack her luggage for her.

345
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,310
-Fine.
-Fine.

346
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,470
Chief.

347
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,110
We’ll go

348
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,110
pack your things.

349
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,290
Granny, you should rest early too.

350
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,830
Xuehuai.

351
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
I know you won't

352
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,950
wake up again.

353
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,550
You've been alone

354
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
in this ice

355
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,230
for so many years,

356
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,870
sleeping for so long.

357
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,360
You must be freezing

358
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,230
and very lonely.

359
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,230
Master is right.

360
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,400
I shouldn't

361
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,690
force you to stay here.

362
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,150
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,630
Xuehuai.

364
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
It's time to send you home.

365
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,110
Chief Xue.

366
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,570
It’s cold at night.

367
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,560
For your health,

368
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,850
you should go back and rest early.

369
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,140
Before we leave tomorrow,

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,630
take the man in the ice

371
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,990
in the cold spring too.

372
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,590
Okay.

373
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,150
See you at the valley entrance

374
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,150
at dawn tomorrow.

375
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,880
Chief.

376
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,720
It’s so late.

377
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,850
Why are you still up?

378
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,710
Why are you still up?

379
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,590
We’re preparing

380
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,790
your luggage for you.

381
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,480
But I'm more and less prepared.

382
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,240
It’s a long journey.

383
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,430
What you prepared

384
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,290
aren't enough.

385
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,720
How much do you think

386
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,680
I've to prepare?

387
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,790
Do you think

388
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,650
I'm going to open a grocery store?

389
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,430
What do I need five hand warmers for?

390
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,230
Silly girls.

391
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,910
Why don't I just pack

392
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,640
the entire Apothecary Valley?

393
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,750
We also said you don't need so much stuff.

394
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,910
We don't care what illness

395
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,990
that Chief Nangong has got,

396
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,640
but with you treating him,

397
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,480
it'll take

398
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,410
at most a month.

399
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,850
Plus the journey back and forth,

400
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,990
it'll take at most three months.

401
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,840
It was Shuang Hong

402
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,310
who was worried about this and that.

403
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,790
See?

404
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,150
You got scolded by the chief.

405
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,830
I’m not scared of some scolding.

406
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,830
It’s better than

407
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,630
Chief not having what she needs.

408
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,600
Sword Sect

409
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,350
isn't some remote place.

410
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,870
If Chief needs anything,

411
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,990
she can buy a new one.

412
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,040
New ones aren't

413
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,230
as handy as old ones.

414
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,830
Shuang Hong was thoughtful.

415
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,200
It's really too much.

416
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,550
It's too heavy.

417
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,170
I don't need this much.

418
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,490
Take them back.

419
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,960
It's not like I won't come back.

420
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,120
Shuang Hong.

421
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,550
Are there coffins left in the valley?

422
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,880
Why do you need a coffin?

423
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,280
I want to send Xuehuai home.

424
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,750
Um...

425
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,070
Why?

426
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,430
Chief.

427
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,440
Why do you suddenly want to

428
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,110
get Mr. Xuehuai out of the ice?

429
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,120
Why do I feel like

430
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,630
something's off?

431
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,910
This means Ziye

432
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,570
has really let it go.

433
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,480
Isn't this a good thing?

434
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,070
Yes.

435
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,110
We should be happy for Chief.

436
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,150
During my absence,

437
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,710
you must listen

438
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,590
to Granny Ning.

439
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,480
Help each other

440
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,440
and compromise.

441
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,030
If there is a dispute,

442
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,690
Granny Ning has the final say.

443
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
Don’t make her angry.

444
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,890
-Yes, Chief.
-Yes, Chief.

445
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,510
Also,

446
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,950
after I leave,

447
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,400
you must cultivate for two hours

448
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
every morning.

449
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,670
Read at the library for four hours.

450
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,230
Get up early every day.

451
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,030
Recognize

452
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,910
and taste the herbs.

453
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,640
Learn the nature of every herb.

454
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,480
Then practice suturing

455
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,390
on tofu.

456
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,840
Okay! Chief, I...

457
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,190
Chief.

458
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,070
That's too packed a schedule.

459
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,950
How about we just

460
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,150
practice suturing every day?

461
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,080
Learning the herbs and whatnot...

462
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,230
You must improve

463
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,630
your medical expertise.

464
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,790
I've written some medical cases

465
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,810
on the prescriptions.

466
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,150
If you have any questions,

467
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,610
you can have a look at them.

468
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,860
When I come back,

469
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,680
I will test you one by one.

470
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,630
If you fail,

471
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,000
you'll be punished.

472
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,070
Don’t punish us.

473
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,050
Chief, don’t punish us.

474
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,180
Then practice hard.

475
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,510
Alright.

476
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,930
It’s late.

477
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,230
Let Chief rest early.

478
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,670
Chief.

479
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,640
When are you leaving tomorrow?

480
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,440
Around 8 a.m.

481
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,460
Let’s send Chief off together.

482
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,260
-Okay!
-Okay!

483
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,630
Rest early.

484
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,550
Shuang Hong.

485
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,070
Remember

486
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,430
what I told you.

487
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,270
♫How many obstacles must one overcome in life?♫

488
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,310
♫Love is the hardest obstacle of all♫

489
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,070

♫We're like a lonely sail in the vast world♫

491
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,990
Better safe than sorry.

492

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,120
♫Drifting always, looking for the shore♫

494
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,510
Is this enough for Chief?

495
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,380
Chief will be back soon.

496
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,110
It's enough.

497
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,510
Yes.

498
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,970
Granny.

499

♫We've crossed hundreds of rivers and scaled thousands of mountains♫

500

What's wrong?

501

Nothing.

502
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,190

♫Why fear the coldness of fate?♫

504
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,390

Let's prepare it tomorrow morning.

506
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,560
Isn't she leaving at 8 a.m.?

507
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,150

Listen to Granny.

511
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,070
You can go and rest.
