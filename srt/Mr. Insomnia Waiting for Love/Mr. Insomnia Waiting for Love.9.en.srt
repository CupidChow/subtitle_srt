16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,960
So the number you put as harassment

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,200
is your dad?

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
You already know. So why ask?

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,800
Fine,

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,800
I won't ask.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,200
But,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
you don't speak of him much.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
I don't have the best memories with him.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
There's no point in talking about them.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Does your hand still hurt?

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,400
No,

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
I heal really quickly.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,560
I've had worse injuries
when I was younger.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,600
It'll be fine in two days.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
What are you doing?

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Making a wish.

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
Dear gods,

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
someone

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
lost all of their happiness.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
I wish that he can find them back soon.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Please, please, please.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
Please make my wish come true.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,560
You're so childish.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,960
You smiled.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,960
See!

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,760
I told you I could help
you find your happiness back.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Smile again.

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,800
Smile.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
I guess your hand doesn't hurt anymore.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
It's fine.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640
Stop.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Mansu,

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,000
why are you here?

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
I miss you.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
I better go make you some coffee.

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,320
I just want to talk to you.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,960
Speak.

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,440
What do you want to talk about?

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Chi Zuo.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
You're

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,560
good looking and talented.

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
You're also the shareholder of Kerwin.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
You can get any girl you want.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,920
Why are you so fixated on Lu Entong?

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Isn't there a saying.

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
Love sparks out of nowhere
and lasts for eternity.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,360
I feel in love with her

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,640
the second I laid my eyes on her.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,200
Until now,

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,120
I know her better than anyone else.

66
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,280
I know what she likes,
what she's afraid of,

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
and what she wants.

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
But she like Yanxu.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Are you all right with that?

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,920
You where the first to know her.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,360
What can I do even if I'm
not okay with that?

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
I thought she was young and

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
I could take my time,

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,560
but now

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't catch up to her.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
I don't have a heart like yours.

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,200
My family and Song's are old friends.

78
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,640
I believe Uncle Song will take my side

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,200
and let Yanxu know

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
who is the right person for him.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
Talking to the parents

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,360
seems like a good idea.

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,560
You're back.

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
I was at a meeting

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,360
when you called yesterday.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,440
Sit.

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,800
I don't care what's going
on between you and Mansu,

88
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
but you have to handle relationships
within the company well.

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I got this.

90
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,400
The Xu family is the second
biggest shareholder of the company.

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,200
Your smooth sailing
in the company these years

92
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,440
has a lot to do with the
Xu family's support.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,720
You need their support

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
to hold your power.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,760
I didn't come back
to talk about this today.

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Do you remember what day today is?

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,160
Of course,

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,520
how would you remember my
mother's death anniversary?

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,360
I said to

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,040
not talk about this again.

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
Why do you keep avoiding this?

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
What are you afraid of facing?

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
Get out.

104
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,160
When my mother died,

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,840
you wouldn't even let me
keep a single photo of her.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She is nothing in your eyes.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
Yanxu,

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,800
what are you doing?

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm drawing.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,080

111
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480

This is you.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
And this is mom.

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,480
We're rowing a boat in the river.

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Dad, look.

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Does this look like mom?

117
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,720
Never draw these kinds of picture again!

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
You hear me?

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
Take it away.

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
Don't go.

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,240
What are you doing?

122
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Give it back.

I'm afraid of him knowing
about that thing.

All right.

155

158
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm making a scarf for Xiao Xu.

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
When I was your age,

174
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
you're already old enough
to be running around.

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Mom,

176
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
if you want to say it like this,

177
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
there weren't even smart phones

178
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
when you were my age.

179
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
The times are different now.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,960
Many people
don't get married till much later.

181
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,040
You

182
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
shouldn't be like those other people.

183
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,760
Your mother is just concerned about you.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
You're no longer a child,

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,960
it's about time you found a partner.

186
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,800
Exactly.

187
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,400
Lu,

188
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,400
what kind of partner

189
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
do you think suits her?

190
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,080
Someone bright,

191
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,240
gentle,

192
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,760
and considerate

193
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,600
would be fine.

194
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,600
Our Tongtong

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,520
loves to eat.

196
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,800
She should find someone
who knows how to cook.

197
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
Now I'm hungry.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Waiter.

199
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Please serve our dishes.

200
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,800
All right.

201
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,800
Abundance of wealth.

202
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
Sweet like honey.

203
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,760
Good fortune.

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Love deeper than the ocean.

205
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,720
Happy couple.

206
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Growing family.

207
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
Cherry on top.

208
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Bumper harvest.

209
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,040
Your food is all here.

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
This is so much.

211
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
It tastes so good.

212
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,560
Who made this?

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Our dearest guest,

214
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,720
this table of food

215
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
was made today

216
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,640
by our special chef.

217
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,920
Would you

218
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,240
like to meet him?

219
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,480
Of course!

220
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Let's meet him.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Uncle.

222
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,080
Auntie.

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,640
Xiao Tong.

224
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,760
Hello.

225
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,640
Chi Zuo.

226
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Mr. Song,

227
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,840
aren't you on leave today?

228
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Why are you at the office?

229
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,640
I had some
urgent issues to take care of.

230
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,160
Uncle, auntie,

231
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,160
let me pour some for you.

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
Thank you.

233
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,280
Okay.

234
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,880
Here.

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
Thank you for your hard work.

236
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
It's nothing.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
You're welcome.

238
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,240
Here.

239
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,680
Uncle.

240
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,400
Good.

241
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,880
Thank you.

242
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,560
Xiao Tong,

243
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,840
have some too.

244
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,480
Uncle, auntie.

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,680
I prepared this meal

246
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,400
specially for you guys.

247
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,960
Come on and have a taste

248
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,640
and see if it's to your liking.

249
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Of course it is.

250
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,280
Here.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,320
Here.

252
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,920
Uncle, auntie,

253
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,080
I'll toast to you.

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
Please sit.

255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
You shouldn't stand, I'll stand.

256
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,040
Here.

257
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,040
Xiao Tong,

258
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
let's drink one together.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,160
Drink what?

260
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,960
We…

261
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,800
Just have a drink.

262
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,960
He did so much.

263
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
Come on.

264
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,040
This child,

265
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,040
is so careless.

266
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,320
Chu Zuo.

267
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
It's fine.

268
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Your pants are all dirty.

269
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't worry about it.

270
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,560
Come outside with me.

271
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,920
Uncle, auntie.

272
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,240
We're going to get cleaned up.

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,560
I'll take him to get this cleaned up.

274
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,320
Come,

275
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,400
follow me.

276
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Move.

277
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Why is Jiang Yu sending me a message.

278
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,200
I saw Lu Entong being rather

279
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,720
intimate with a guy at Tianhe Street.

280
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,840
Guess who it is?

281
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
Who is it?

282
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Mr. Chi.

283
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Let me see.

284
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I…

285
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,040
Speak.

286
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,200
Did you collude with my parents?

287
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,840
Xiao Tong,

288
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
I was just trying
to get to know them better.

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Chi Zuo,

290
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,960
you need to stop
being used by my parents.

291
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,920
Besides.

292
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
I have someone that I like.

293
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
I know

294
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,000
you like Yanxu.

295
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Since you know,

296
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
then stop being like this.

297
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Xiao Tong,

298
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,120
I like you.

299
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I've liked you since we were kids.

300
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,800
I wanted to tell you about this

301
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,000
when we got older,

302
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,000
but I suddenly felt a sense of urgency

303
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
when Yanxu took you away yesterday.

304
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,440
I know you may already
have feelings for him,

305
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,800
but I still want to take the initiative.

306
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Xiao Tong,

307
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,760
will you give me the chance?

308
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Chi Zuo.

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Lu Entong!

310
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
We're already together,

311
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,200
you don't have the chance.

312
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Let's go.

313
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,000
I…

314
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
Let go of me.

315
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
Song Yanxu, what are you doing?

316
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
Why are you with Chi Zuo?

317
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,800
We were just having a meal.

318
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
A meal with your parents?

319
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,400
He made plans with them.

320
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
My parents just called
to have dinner with me.

321
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,560
I didn't know that he would be here.

322
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Then,

323
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,000
why were you so close to him?

324
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Song Yanxu.

325
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,560
You've been mean to me twice today.

326
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,720
I guess

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,160
my parents were right.

328
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,760
What?

329
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
They said that

330
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,600
I should look for a gentle
and considerate boyfriend.

331
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
Tongtong,

332
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,240
I didn't mean it.

333
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
Besides,

334
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,600
you should give me a chance to
apologise and explain my self.

335
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Not..

336
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Not what?

337
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,040
And not

338
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,560
bring some insignificant person
to meet your parents.

339
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,440
Well that

340
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,400
insignificant person

341
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,600
is a good cook

342
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
and quite likable.

343
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
He's just showing off!

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Anyone can do those things!

345
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
The most important thing is

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
that insignificant person is
both gentle and considerate.

347
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,680
It's hard to come by

349
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,600
It's just being gentle and considerate.

350
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,560
Who doesn't know how to be like that?

351

I think it's best not to.

If he gets drunk and breaks things,
