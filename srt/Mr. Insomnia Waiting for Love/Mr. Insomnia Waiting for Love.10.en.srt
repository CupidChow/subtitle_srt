Say something, Ms. Lu!

46

Do you know that
trespassing on private property

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
is against the law?

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Stop taking pictures.

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
Try my new product

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
and see if it tastes food.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,360
There's an orangey taste.

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,880
Yes.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
It's so interesting.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,680
There is this burnt taste

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
when you first sip it.

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
When the bitter taste goes away,

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
then you taste the orange.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
That's because I added
some dried orange peels.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,120
It's really good.

60

Too bitter.

64

Yes.

149

Here's the latest reports
on both of you.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
You both have now transitioned from

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
phenyl exposure sleep

152
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
to exposure sleep.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
What does that mean?

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
It means that

155
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,440
you are both showing

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
obvious signs of lethargy.

157
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
Especially yesterday,

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
[Insomnia Mode]
your melatonin levels

159
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
have reached the highest so far.

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
So what you mean is that

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
our insomnia has changed to

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,280
lethargy?

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Exactly.

164
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,240
If this trend continues,

165
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,880
one of you will fall into endless sleep

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
and never wake up.

167
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Judging from the data,

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,520
it would be

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Entong.

170
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
Don't tell her about this yet.

Dr. Li,

to deal with this problem?

and we currently
have no countermeasures.

175
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
And your status curves

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
are constantly changing.

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm afraid if the more you two
are exposed to each other,

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,760
you both will show
signs of unconsciousness.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,560
The best thing to do right
now is to reduce exposure

180
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,800
and come up with a countermeasure
as soon as possible.

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,560
It's getting late. Let's get some rest.

182
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Tonight,

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
you sleep in the master bedroom

184
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
and I'll sleep in the guest room.

185
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Why?

186
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
How can we sleep if we are separated?

187
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,480
Okay.

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,680
Go sleep.

189
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Okay.

190
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
The best thing to do right
now is to reduce exposure

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,560
and come up with a countermeasure
as soon as possible.

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
What can I do

193
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
to protect you?

194
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,560
Breakfast is on the table.

195
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,920
Have some when you're awake.

196
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
There's a lot going on at the company

197
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
and I will be working overtime.

198
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,200
Don't wait up.

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Looks like the trending issue

200
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
has impacted the company greatly.

201
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Lu Entong,

202
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,880
learn the lesson

203
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
and stop dragging him down.

204
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
Ms. Xu,

205
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,560
here is all the information

206
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
you wanted on that girl.

207
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
Keep looking.

208
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,840
Let me know

209
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,000
as soon as you have anything new.

210
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
No problem.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,960
Boss,

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,560
I found out who it was.

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
It was Jiang Yu.

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
That day when you
and Lu Entong got drunk,

215
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,040
she secretly follow us
back to the villa.

216
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,720
The picture was also taken

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
outside of the villa.

218
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Her again.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Seems like she didn't learn her lesson.

220
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Contact our lawyers
immediately to sue her.

221
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Yanxu.

222
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,840
Yanxu,

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
I want to talk to you.

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
You were behind the photo issue, right?

225
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you mean?

226
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
The picture on trending topic
was taken by Jiang Yu.

227
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Are you saying that this
had nothing to do with you?

228
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Song Yanxu.

229
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,160
How can you think of me like that?

230
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes,

231
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
I hate Lu Entong.

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,800
But I would never gamble the company's

233
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,680
reputation and yours.

234
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,480
It hurts my feelings when you say that.

235
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Xu Mansu.

236
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,120
I let the issue at the competition slide

237
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,640
last time because of
your father, Uncle Xu.

238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
If I find out that this has
something to do with you,

239
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,760
don't blame me for making you look bad.

240
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
I'm telling you

241
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,360
Lu Entong is not as simple as she seems.

242
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
I will let you know

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,080
just how terrible you were to me today.

244
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,720
And how ridiculous it is

245
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
that you are protecting her.

246
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Why?

247
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,920
What's so good about Lu Entong?

248
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
Why would you go to
such lengths to protect her?

249
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,920
Isn't this little Yanxu?

250
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,560
Ms. Xu.

251
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,200
What?

252
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,680
Are you sure that the little girl

253
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,520
from the photo is Lu Entong?

254
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,920
Yes.

255
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
I found this photo of younger her

256
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,080
at the music academy.

257
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
Music academy?

258
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,040
Yes.

259
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,960
How did they know each other as kids?

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,840
Tongtong,

261
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,760
are you okay?

262
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,080
People don't know
what they are talking about.

263
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,600
Don't take it to heart.

264
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm fine.

265
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
I've got a heart stronger than iron.

266
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,200
Besides,

267
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,320
these comments

268
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
don't affect me.

269
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,200
Heart stronger than iron?

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,360
This ironed heart was still

271
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
melted by Song Yanxu.

272
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,160
What are you talking about?

273
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,500
[I'm working overtime at the company]

You can't be serious.

You miss him already

278
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,960
Says who.

279
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,720
Let's go.

280
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,400
I'll treat you to afternoon tea.

281
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,280
Okay.

282
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,880
Mansu,

283
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,360
why are you here?

284
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,600
I have something to ask you.

285
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,760
It's about Yanxu, right?

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Mansu.

287
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,840
No one can change Yanxu's mind

288
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,000
when he's decided on it.

289
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,120
And I've seen his

290
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
attitude towards you.

291
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,800
Stop making things
difficult for yourself.

292
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,760
Where am I not good enough?

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,560
It's not because of you.

294
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
You're great

295
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
and many people like you.

296
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,880
I only like Yanxu.

297
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm here to ask if

298
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Yanxu and Lu Entong knew each
other when they were young.

299
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,520
No.

300
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,600
What?

301
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
Look at this.

302
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,120
This is Yanxu when he was younger,

303
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,760
but

304
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,400
who is this little girl?

305
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,280
Where did you get this picture from?

306
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
You grew up with Yanxu, and

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
you've never seen her before?

308
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,960
No.

309
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
You're saying that

310
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,960
this little girl is Lu Entong?

311
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm not so sure,

312
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160
so I wanted to ask you.

313
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,040
That's impossible.

314
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,000
Yanxu and I were
inseparable since we were kids.

315
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,360
If he knew someone,

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,960
then I would know them too.

317
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,160
Are you sure?

318
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes.

319
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,880
Yanxu and Lu Entong

320
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
met at Kerwin's insomnia
habilitation program.

321
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
They've only known each other

322
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,480
for a few months.

323
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Then it's fine.

324
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,760
Mansu,

325
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,040
stop caring about

326
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,160
Yanxu's issues.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
As long as it has to do with Yanxu,

328
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560
then I won't not care.

Let me make you some coffee.

332
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,760
There's something off
about Song Chen's attitude.

333
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,920
It's like

334
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,360
he's avoiding my questions.

335
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
Is it because it's been too
long and he doesn't remember,

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,240
or that he's hiding something from me?

337
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,360
Be careful.

338

I'll make you some coffee.

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,480
I haven't had enough rest.

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Chi Zuo,

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,160
let me show you something.

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,560
Isn't that little Yanxu?

348
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,400
Who's the girl beside him?

349
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,600
Lu Entong.

350
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,000
Do you know something?

351
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
That's not possible.

352
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
How did they know each other
when they were younger?

353
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm leaving.

354
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,920
It's been three days.

355
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Why isn't Song Yanxu back yet?

356
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,400
Xiao Cheche,

357
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,120
is Yanxu still busy?

358
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,800
You've been so busy.

359
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,440
What can I do for you?

360
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,000
Click.

361
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,560
Click.

362
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's have a wide angle shot.

363
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,400
Are we done?

364
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes.

365
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
Mr. Song

366
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,160
I've been your personal night
photographer for three days.

367
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
If you want to see her than go home.

368
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,760
Why do you keep
torturing my single soul?

369
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,320
Li Che,

370
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,760
I didn't realise that
you're so talkative.

371
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,440
Fine.

372
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm done.

373
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
Chi Zuo, you just got off work?

374
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,760
It's been kind of busy lately.

375
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,600
Why did you come?

376
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Yanxu has been working overtime.

377
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm worried about him,

378
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
and made him some food.

379
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,040
Look at you.

380
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
You know how to cook now.

381
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,080
Of course.

382
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,040
People have to

383
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,120
learn to grow.

384
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
He should be in his office right now.

385
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,160
Go ahead.

386
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,320
Before the food gets good.

387
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,200
I'm leaving.

388
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,200
Bye.

389
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,000
Bye.

390
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,000
Mr. Song

391
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,480
Can I go home?

392
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
I've been working overtime
for three days.

393
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,480
If this goes on,

394
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,520
I would finish next season's
work already.

395
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,480
Why so many companies?

396
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,440
I'll double your year-end bonus.

397
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,400
But Mr. Song,

398
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,280
what's up with you.

399
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,520
You used to head straight home
right after work.

400
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
You're tired of her.

401
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,080
Mr. Song, you're also an average man.

402
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
Love always fades away

403
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
as time goes on.

404
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,680
Who puts meal boxes here in
the middle of the night?

405
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,000
This is bad.

406
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,600
What's bad?

407
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,560
It smells like it went bad.

408
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Tongtong.

409
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Tongtong.

410
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,080
Song Yanxu.

411
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,400
I was thinking of you everyday.

412
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,520
Wondering if you ate well

413
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
and slept well.

414
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
Whether if the work as exhausting.

415
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,600
But look at you.

416
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,160
Just tell me straight on
if you don't like me.

417
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?

418
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,320
Please stop crying.

419
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

420
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,520
I didn't mean to give
you the silent treatment.

421
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
It's all because

422
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,560
Dr. Li said that

423
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,280
we've encountered some difficulties
in our treatment.

424
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,120
So I had no other choice.

425
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,240
All right.

426
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,920
Stop crying.

427
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Don't touch me!

428
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,200
Bear with it.

429
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
You're saying that

430
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,400
you were avoiding me

431
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
because of what Dr. Li said?

432
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
Are you dumb?

433
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,000
Insomnia sucks

434
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and lethargy does too.

435
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,560
If I had to pick,

436
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,280
then I would've chosen to be with you.

437
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,600
Also,

438
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
why did you make the decision for me?

439
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,040
And you avoided me on purpose.

440
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,560
I wasn't avoiding you.

441
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,360
We need to shorten your lethargy cycle

442
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
by reducing exposure to each other.

443
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,200
This will give Dr. Li more time

444
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,280
to deal with the problem.

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
I should've told you.

447
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,440
I know

448
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,800
you didn't want to make
me anxious about this.

449
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
But we are together,

450
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,360
so stop talking about yours and mine.

451
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
We should deal with problems together.

452
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,080
Don't worry.

453
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,400
I will cooperate with Dr. Li

454
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,960
to avoid lethargy.

455
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,080
We will get better.

456
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,480
Tongtong,

457
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,720
I have another thing to tell you.

458
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,360
What?

459
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Your durian pork soup was delicious.

460
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,120
Don't make it again.

461
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,240
You…

462
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,800
What happened to your hand?

463
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
Well,

464
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,480
I wanted to make soup for someone.

465
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
But I'm lacking some cooking skills

466
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,360
and burned myself.

467
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
And was avoided by someone.

468
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,520
Here.

469
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,160
Be good.

470
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,480
Tongtong.

471
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,120
Now that I'm with you,

472
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
I will never

473
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,680
let you get hurt again.

474
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,160
No!

475
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,160
So..

476
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,280
Sorry.

477
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,160
[Kerwin Group]
So Ye Zi and I asked her

478
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,120
what did she think was
the most romantic thing.

479
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,800
And when she was responding,

480
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,320
I took out my phone

481
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,080
and hit record.

482
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
We agreed that

483
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,160
to be safe,

484
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,760
we will keep our distance
when we meet everyday.

485
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,160
We must limit out interactions,

486
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,720
and only hold hands on Sundays.

487
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,720
It's you…

488
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,440
That was smart.

489
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Hello, Mr. Song.

490
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,760
Come with me.

491
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's go.

492
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,240
Li Che,

493
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,720
what is the usual process for marriage?

494
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,400
Usually you would need the
household registration booklet…

495
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,440
Marriage?

496
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,320
You don't know?

497
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,360
Usually,

498
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,320
people would first propose.

499
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,840
First

500
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,160
meet the parents.

501
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Propose.

502
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,160
Meet parents.

503
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,160
Dr. Li,

504
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
is there an alternative

505
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,280
for Yanxu's treatment plan.

506
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,760
Don't rush it.

507
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm in the customizing a new
treatment plan with the lab.

508
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,560
Although their current situation
was not what we expected,

509
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,280
but it's still controllable.

510
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,480
I believe I can cure them.

511
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm asking

512
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
if there was a way

513
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
to only treat Yanxu.

514
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,440
Only him?

515
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,680
They are more suited to
have treatment together.

516
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
It takes some time to figure out
the cause of their insomnia.

517
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,120
That's good.

518
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,280
Why?

519
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,680
Nothing.

520
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,680
Our Song family

521
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,120
only has Yanxu.

522
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
His mother passed away early

523
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,160
and he doesn't have a good
relationship with his father.

524
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
If I don't care for him,

525
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,480
who will?

526
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,160
Tongtong.

527
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,360
It's time

528
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,760
to have our parents meet each other.

529
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
We've been together

530
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,160
for quite some time.

531
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,280
I think it's time to formally
meet your parents.

532
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,720
I also want to

533
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,400
formally introduce you to my father.

534
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,720
What?

535
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Are you afraid
your parents won't like me?

536
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,440
No,

537
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,600
they definitely will.

538
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm more worried about your father.

539
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Is it too sudden

540
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,200
to let him know like this?

541
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't worry.

542
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,080
Aside from the fact that

543
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
his future daughter-in-law is amazing,

544
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,560
and he should be glad.

545
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,680
Even if he has some ideas about you,

546
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
that's just him.

547
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,320
I like you

548
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
and that will never change.

549
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,600
What future daughter-in-law?

550
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,800

I'm going to find my parents.

552

553

why are you here?

573

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,040
yesterday to arrange

590
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,880
