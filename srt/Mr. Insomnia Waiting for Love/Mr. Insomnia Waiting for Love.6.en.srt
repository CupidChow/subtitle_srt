don't you think

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, we should study it carefully.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
So, let's begin.

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,240
This report...

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,080
What are you doing?

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
What's wrong

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,200
with the report?

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,440
This is

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,400
the monitoring report
that Dr. Li sent to me earlier.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,560
The report indicates that

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,720
after abnormal data
reflected in our bodies,

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,880
we fell into a sleep state.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,080
So,

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
we need to verify
Dr. Li's hypothesis today.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,000
Well...

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,600
What did Dr. Li say?

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,400
I just accessed the backstage

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
and changed
the settings in your wristbands.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
If your excitement for each other

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
reaches a certain value,

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
the wristband
will light up with a pink signal.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,400
In other words,

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,800
if the pink signal light is on,

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,080
and you touch
each other, you will fall asleep.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,800
Then it means

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,040
my hypothesis is correct.

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,960
The doctor speculated that

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
we fall asleep
as soon as we touch each other

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,080
due to the
magnetic resonance between us

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,720
causing abnormal brainwaves.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
And this leads to
an imbalance in the body's pH level.

61

Nothing.

Let's talk about something serious.

This case and the

are pretty similar.

I know why you approached Song Yanxu.

257
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,800
You're simply attracted

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,560
to his identity
as the CEO of Kerwin Group.

259
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,840
You want to use
him to treat your illness, right?

260
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,360
I've checked.

261

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,520
you suffered from severe insomnia.

Two months ago,

264
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,880
you signed up as a volunteer

265
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,120
for Kerwin Group's
sleep disorder program.

266
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,520
It seems like
it didn't yield any results.

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,160
So you've been trying to

268
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,320
get close to the CEO of Kerwin Group

269
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
and use him at
any cost to treat your illness.

270
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,760
Am I right?

271
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Director Xu, thanks
for thinking so cleverly

272
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,480
and so resourceful of me.

273
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Now, tell me,

274
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,040
how do you plan to convince me

275
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,200
to leave him?

276
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,440
I heard that you cancelled
all your appointments this afternoon

277
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,120

278
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,160

Don't worry.

284

As long as you leave Yanxu,

285
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,920
you can go find the best
doctor to treat your insomnia.

286
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,760
I'll cover all the expenses for you.

287
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
You really surprise me that

288
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,640
you're so considerate
to your employees in private.

289
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,800
No, Yanxu.

290
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,200
She herself said

291
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,560
that she approached you
for the treatment of her insomnia.

292
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,360
So I...

293
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,680
That's right.

294
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
She did approach me
for the treatment of her insomnia.

295
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,160
But I'm willing to

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,760

305
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,600
You don't think

306
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,680
Why does this car still smell sour?

308
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,800
Is that all you can sense?

309
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
What?

310
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
Could it be

311
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,680
that you actually like me?

312
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Nothing.

313
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,800
I was just joking.

314
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,480
I was just joking...

315
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,280
You're right.

316
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,560

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,920
Lu Entong.

318
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,800
I want to finish
what I didn't say last night.

319
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,520
Last night, I said that

320
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,000
I might have developed feelings for you.

321
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,520
But I was wrong.

322
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
I like you.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,200
I really like you.

324
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,120
I like you a lot.

325
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,520
I like it when you get angry.

326
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,080
I like it when you're mad.

327
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,720
I like it when you smile.

328
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,280
I also like it when
you play your instrument passionately.

329
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,800
I don't know what's happening to me.

330
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,280
I just want to see you every day.

331
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
When I think of you with Chi Zuo,

332
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
I feel jealous.

333
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
I feel envious.

334
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,920
I...

335
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,480
I can smell it.

336
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Didn't you want to know what it was?

337
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,480
Dr. Li said that

338
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,760
we fall asleep
because we have feelings for each other.

339
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
This bracelet

340
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,160
monitors the data inside us.

341
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,200
Once we develop feelings for each other,

342
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,840
it lights up.

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
And from the moment I put it on,

344
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
whenever I think of you,

345
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,600
it keeps glowing.

346
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,440
So...

347
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
What about you?

348
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,200
Do you really
have no feelings for me at all?

349
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,560
Are you talking about this?

350
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,040
This...

351
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
Actually, this morning...

352
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
This Song Yanxu...

353
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,320
He usually looks weird and strange,

354
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,160
but...

355
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,360
he's still quite cute, isn't he?

356
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,280
Your coffee.

357
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,200
Thanks.

358
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,160
Entong.

359
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
Your bracelet is glowing.

360
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,600
This...

361
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,880
Why is it glowing?

362
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Is it a signal?

363
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Entong.

364
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,200
I didn't mean it.

366
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,000
It's okay.

367
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
It's my fault
for not holding it properly.

368
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,600
That's how it was.

369
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,560
If you don't believe me...

370
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,560
Look.

371
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,200
Today at the movies,

372
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,120
because of you,

373
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I couldn't focus on a single word.

374
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,200
Here is it.

375
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,440
Take it.

376
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,520
What should I do?

377
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720
My heart is about to drop out.

378
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,440
Lu Entong...

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
You must stay calm.

380
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,960
Stay calm.

381
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,640
So...

382
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
Did your experiment today

383
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,200
succeed?

384
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,760
It's missing the final step.

385
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,320
Here.

387
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,920
Hello.

388
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I'll have a whiskey.

389
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,680
Sure.

Mansu.

391
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
Aren't you going to find Yanxu?

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,800
Thank you.

393
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,720
Drink lesser.

394
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,560
Another cup, please.

395
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,520
Okay.

396
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,000
By the way,

397
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,000
I have something for you.

398
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,520
I'll be right time.

399

She did approach me
for the treatment of her insomnia.

400
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,080
But I'm willing.

401

Mr. Song,

411

this is the information
we found on Professor Zhang.

412

Please take a look.

please make sure
to inform me promptly, okay?

Don't worry.

424
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,960
Professor Zheng, listen to me.

425
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,920
How many times do I have to say it?

426
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,200
I will not go.

427

I can't keep up with you young people.

Just listen to
our collaboration proposal.

You can still refuse later.

you have an idea?

436
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,920
I don't.

437
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,120
I've been standing here for too long.

438
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm hungry.

439
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,600
I'll order some takeout first.

440

What do you want to eat?

441
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,360
I don't want to eat any more.

Why did you invite me here?

511

Why are your eyes red?

512

It's nothing.

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
Why would you
put eucalyptus oil on your eyes?

517
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:24,960
I...

518
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,920
It's to prevent
myself from falling asleep.

519
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,400
If you want to stay awake.

520
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
You can also apply it on your temples.

521
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,360
So, you are also...

522
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Look.

523
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,040
Before, I couldn't
sleep even if I wanted to.

524
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,640
But now, it's different.

525
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
I can't stay awake even if I want to.

526
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,240
Song Yanxu.

527
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,800
Have you ever wondered

528
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,760
why out of all the people in the world

529
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,120
the two of us can cure insomnia

530
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,840
only when we're staying together?

531
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,080
Tong.

532
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,640
Do you believe in fate?

533
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,880
Before I met you,

534
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,120
I didn't believe in it.

535
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,920
But after meeting you,

536
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,200
I started to believe.

537
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
I used to hate insomnia.

538
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,840
I felt like

539
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
it took away a lot from me.

540
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,920
But now, I'm grateful for it.

541
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,600
Because it led me to you.

542
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Let us be each other's remedy.

543
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,640
What time is it?

544
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,440
It's still early.

545
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,280
It's only half past ten.

546
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
That's a coincidence.

547
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,240
We made an appointment with
Professor Zheng at half past ten too.

548
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Oh no.
