Doctor.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
It really worked.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,480
You asked me last time.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,320
How to avoid entering a sleep state

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
when you two contact.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Based on your data,

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
I found the
corresponding research report.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,080
A low-temperature
environment is the key.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
It means that as long as
the temperature is low enough,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,240
even if there is
contact, we will not fall asleep.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,720
That's right.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680

Uncle Song,
do you want to eat something?

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll get you something to eat.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
No hurry.

You must be Lu Entong, right?

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,120
I knew it as soon as you arrived.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm sorry, Uncle Song.

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,040
I was afraid you wouldn't accept me,

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
so that's why I...

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Do you think
I will accept you just like that?

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,040
I remember
the last time I taught chess to someone.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
It was when Yanxu was still a kid.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,600
I taught him,

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
but he wasn't as patient as you.

45
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
He cried when he lost the game.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,240
He gave up.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
And now I'm old.

Yanxu is actually
very worried about you.

52

He's really sad when you're sick.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
And he regrets it.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
He often tells me

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
that he shouldn't have argued with you.

56

And when I got back,

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
I felt like I had turned
into a bow-legged person when walking.

I feel relieved.

112
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No need to worry.

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,520
It's a common ailment of old age.

How dare you show up here?

If your daughter hadn't
taken our son to row the boat,

would my wife have lost her life?

she took Yanxu onto the boat.

372

And the boat overturned.

My sister-in-law
drowned while trying to save them.

374

It's all her fault.

You were running
a fever for several days.

395

When you woke up,
you didn't remember anything.

396
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,040
The doctor called it selective amnesia.

397
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
Which means forgetting the past.

I didn't want
to see you get hurt any more,
