Come in.

345
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,500
Mr. Song, these are
the flowers that Ms. Xu sent you.

346
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,900
Next time, when I'm not around,

347
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,420
don't accept anything from
other people on my behalf.

348
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,980
Including Xu Mansu.

349
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,940
Yes, Mr. Song.

350
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,860
But, Mr. Song,

351
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,820
the Xu family

352
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,140
is a major shareholder of the group.

353
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,860
Are you a little too
aloof with Director Xu?

354
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,980
Inform the scientific research
department and the medical advisors

355
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,020
to have a meeting in an hour.

356
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,220
Yes, Mr. Song.

357
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,500
Take the flowers away.

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,340
Is Mr. Song

359
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,900
having any new ideas?

360

Mr. Song suddenly called a meeting.

Is there something wrong with Banana 3?

363
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,420
Don't worry.

364
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,780
Mr. Song

365
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,500
is coming soon.

366
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,620
Once he arrives,

367
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
we will know what's going on.

Mr. Song.

Everyone here

and knowledgeable elites.

372
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,060
I invite everyone to come today

373

to ask a question in
your field of expertise.

374
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,020
Medically, is there such a possibility

375
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,660
where two conscious people,

376
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,580
regardless of the location,

Are you planning to get into
the entertainment industry

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
and write fantasy novels?

383

Just tell me.

Is there such a possibility?

No, Mr. Song.

386
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,900
I've been in the sleep medicine
industry for a long time.

387
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,020
I never heard of such a thing.

388
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,140
There's no scientific basis either.

too busy with work lately?

394

That's why you're a little tired.

Then why did I fall asleep after
touching her all four times?

396
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,540
Did I encounter something
that science can't explain?

From now on, you don't have
to find experts for me anymore.

During the meeting today, you asked

425
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,380
why do two people fall asleep
whenever they're together?

515
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
We can't let you in.

516
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,180
Hey, Mr. Li!

517
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,860
[Kerwin Group]

518
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
Stop right there.

519
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,780
Stop!

520
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,540
There's no one here.

521
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,100
Let's talk here.

522
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,540
Why did you block my number?

523
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,500
Tell me.

524
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,380
How much should I pay you so
you can stop pestering me?

525
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,540
CNY100,000?

526
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,540
I'm not...

527
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,140
CNY200,000?

528
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,900
Let's make it CNY500,000.

529
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,060
Stop.

530
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,460
Put away your cheque.

531
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,060
I'm not coming for money.

532
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,620
Do you hate money?

533
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,580
No.

534
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,700
It's just that

535
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,380
I have something more
important than money.

536
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,420
What do you want?

537
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,780
I came to ask you...

538
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,380
Do you have a girlfriend?

539
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,580
Don't get me wrong.
I don't want to date you.

540
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,860
I just...

541
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,620
I just want to sleep.

542
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,420
You are aware that

543
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,380
we have some sort of

544
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
magic between us.

545
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,420
Since God make me meet
you again and again,

546
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,820
then God must be expecting
you to cure my insomnia.

547
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,820
Therefore,

548
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,100
I think we should follow God's will.

549
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,500
I think

550
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,620
I should give you the money.

551
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,860
So you can see a doctor
and eat the right medicine.

552
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,460
You are my medicine.

553
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,380
You took the initiative
to find me and tried it.

554
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,660
Why don't you believe it?

555
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,220
Because what you said is unscientific.

556
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,580
What's wrong with being unscientific?

557
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,860
I only believe in science.

558
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,180
Please help me.

559
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,780
Yesterday, I had insomnia
all night again.

560
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,220
All this time,

561
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,900
except for the two days
with you being next to me,

562
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,380
I never had a good night's sleep.

563
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,380
I really need your help.

564
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,100
Please help me.

565
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
Since you believe in science,

566
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,820
please help me break the superstition.

567
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,460
If it doesn't work,

568
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,220
I won't bother you anymore.

569
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Walk the talk.

570
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Let's start.

571
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Are you done?

572
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,300
Why can't it work?

573
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,420
You should walk the talk.

574
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,660
You...

575
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,540
That's enough.

576
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,340
Don't push your luck.

577
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,100
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,620
I was thinking about

579
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,220
trying as many
possibilities as possible.

580
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,420
In my opinion,

581
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,860
have you ever thought that your illness

582
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
may not be insomnia alone.

583
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,220
I suggest you check your brain as well.

584
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Why don't we try it again?

585
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,420
One more time, please.

586
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,020
You have tried it once.

587
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,780
I hope you keep your promise.

588
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,100
Stop bothering me anymore.

589
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,780
I almost believed a lunatic.

590
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,380
I must have been infected by her.

591
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,820
What went wrong?

592
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,900
Why is it not working?
