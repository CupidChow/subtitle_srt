00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
It doesn't seem appropriate
for a back-door position.

178
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Then...

179
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,360
Recruit an assistant for him...

180
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
based on my characteristics.

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,320
I'll go for the interview.

182
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,200
Sure.

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,640
Your...

184
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,520
characteristics?

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,160
Yes.

186
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm the only fit candidate in the end.

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,360
That will be done.

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,920
No problem.

189
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
Leave it to me.

190
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,980
[Kerwin]

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,440
A big company is certainly different.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There're so many interviewees.

193
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,360
But sorry, girls.

194
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
Only I can pass this interview.

195
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,240
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Oh no!

197
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
My clothes are dirty.

198
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
What should I do for the interview?

199
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
I have tissue.

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,960
Wipe it will do.

201
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,840
I've been particularly unlucky lately.

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,840
My boyfriend broke up with me.

203
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,760
I had no money to pay my rental.

204
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,440
I failed all previous interviews.

205
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I won't know...

206
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,840
what to do if I fail again today.

207
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Here.

208
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Put on my jacket.

209
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Cover it.

210
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Cover it like this.

211
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
It's fine now.

212
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
You also come for the interview.

213
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,920
I can't wear your jacket.

214
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm fine.

215
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,960
See?

216
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,760
I can just go with this inner shirt.

217
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,000
Wear it first.

218
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,840
Thank you.

219
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
Not bad.

220
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Here, Mr. Chen.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Is everything ready?

[Yi Hui]

Li Che.

227
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,400
Why do you get...

228
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,120
all beautiful girls?

229
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
Lu Entong's characteristics...

230
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,400
are fair skin, pretty face, long legs...

231
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
and hair, right?

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I disseminate all characteristics...

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
as recruitment conditions.

234
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
All are...

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,840
beautiful girls then.

236
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,080
This is bad.

237
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,220
[Kerwin]

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,560
Is this about recruiting an assistant
or a beauty contest?

239
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you take here as a night club?

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Disqualify her.

241
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,560
Miss.

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
You've been disqualified.

243
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,000
Please go out.

244
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
Why?

245
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
I haven't done making up.

246
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,800
Please.

247
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,280
What is the big deal?

248
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,720
She is the executive director
of Kerwin, Xu Mansu.

249
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
She is so scary.

250
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
I hear that she and the CEO
are a couple.

251
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,160
Mansu.

252
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,400
Today...

253
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,160
is an interview for Yanxu's assistant.

254
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,320

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,680
and I can handle it.

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,240
I should see...

257
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,160
the candidates for Yanxu in person.

258
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Aren't you going to sit?

259
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
I... I'll bring a chair.

260
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,400
Let's begin with two candidates...

261
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,320
in a team.

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,960
[Kerwin]
Please.

267
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,080
Hello.

268
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,280
I'm glad to come to Kerwin Group
for an interview.

269
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,160
Do you dress up like this...

270
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760
to apply for the CEO's assistant?

271
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,560
Is there a problem?

272
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,720
Don't you even know
the basic dressing etiquette?

273
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,880
The blouse...

274
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
is the only decent piece on you...

275
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,480
but the blouse should be
the style of several years ago.

276
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,840
Even a hotel waitress...

277
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
has to learn the basic etiquette.

278
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
Didn't you do your homework
before applying for...

279
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,080
such an important position?

280
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Kerwin is a big company.

281
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,960
If you dress up like this
as the CEO's assistant,

282
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,760
others...

283
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,880
will think that Kerwin...

284
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,720
hires only beggars.

285
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,040
And you.

286
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,000
Your jacket...

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,520
does look like a genuine product.

288
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,560
But you shouldn't buy
a counterfeit blindly.

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
The jacket is limited
to 50 pieces worldwide.

290
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,600
I have the one and only piece...

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,760
in the country.

292
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,480
As one who often has to make appearances
beside the CEO,

293
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,400
you shouldn't be...

294
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,120
photographed with a counterfeit.

295
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you want to ruin
Kerwin Group's reputation?

296
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,440

298
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,400
Hello, interviewers.

I'm 168cm tall...

301
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
and I weigh 45kg.

302
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
I come from the beautiful Hainan.

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
Next team.

305
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Next team.

306
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,480
She was too over.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
What happened to them?

308
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm so nervous.

309
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
It should be fine.

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Take it easy.

311
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,440
It'll be fine.

312
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
What happened in the room?

313
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,320
Next team.

314
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
Next team.

315
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
None of them can be hired.

316
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,520
Put effort in your work.

317
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,560
My goodness!

318
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
What a crap company.

319
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
This is too much.

320
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,040
Mr. Song.

321
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,320
What do they do?

322
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,680
They came for an interview.

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,280
What interview?

324
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
It's so scary.

325
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
Your assistant.

326
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,360
My assistant?

327
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,920
Ms. Xu.

328
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,160
You've eliminated
all of them previously.

329
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
There're only two people left.

330
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,680
We have to keep one.

331
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Let's talk.

332
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,640
You first.

333
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,200
Hi, I'm Ye Zi.

334
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm honoured to come
for your respective company's interview.

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,560
How...

336
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,360
is your drinking capacity?

337
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm not a good drinker.

338
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
I graduated from...

339
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,240
Jiang Yu.

340
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,800
Bring it in.

341
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,360
This is...

342
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,720
White liquor.

343
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,360
Finish it.

344
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,840
I can't.

345
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm allergic to alcohol.

346
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,720
I won't be fine...

347
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
if I drink so much of white liquor.

348
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,440
Don't you want to be
the CEO's assistant?

349
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,400
Why?

Why must you force her?

You're trying to give her a hard time.

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,480
will throw...

525
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,760
a ball towards him at once.

526
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
He'll find it strange.

527
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,520
When he slowly walks over to check,

528
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,040
I who is already in ambush...

529
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,360
will silently approach...

530
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,280
then pop up...

531
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,480
to scare him.

532
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,520
We'll surely fall asleep
in such situation.

533
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,480
It's done.

534
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,920
How do you think...

535
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
about my plan?

536
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
If Mr. Song knows about this plan,

537
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll be banished to catch mosquitos...

538
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,000
in Africa.

539
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,760
You'll suffer worse
than that if others...

540
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,120
know about Mr. Song's insomnia.

541
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,760
We should still...

542
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,920
treat the insomnia.

543
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
I'll take the blame
if something happens.

544
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,440
All right.

545
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
This is more like it.

546
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,320
Action.

547
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,480
Go.

548
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,320
Come on.

549
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Why are you spacing out?

550
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Enter the code.

551
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,160
Shall we...

552
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,640
Shall we just forget about it?

553
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Hurry.

554
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,200
Incorrect code.

555
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,720
What is the matter?

556
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
You know the code, right?

557
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
This is what I remember.

558
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,320
Relax.

559
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,800
That was the code for the garage.

560
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,880
Incorrect code.

561
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,480
You still have one chance left.

562
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Can you handle it?

563
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,800
Let me.

564
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
When is his birthday?

565
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
Mr. Song is a smart person.

566
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,320
He won't use his birthdate as the code.

567
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
September 8.

568
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,280
Correct code.

569
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,560
Welcome home.

570
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
What did I say?

571
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,320
I guess it right.

572
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,440
Yes.

573
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,640
However,

574
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,040
the door won't open itself...

575
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,800
after entering the correct code.

576
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,080
What a coincidence.

577
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,960
Mr. Song.

578
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,280
Don't get angry.

579
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
Ms. Lu said...

580
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,080
Say it, Mr. Chen.

581
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She said she has a way.

582
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
What is it?

583
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,080
I have a way to treat you.

584
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
Treat me?

585
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,960
You should find someone
to treat you instead.

586
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,640
I...

587
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,120
Ms. Lu.

588
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,360
Can you do me a favour?

589
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,200
Sure.

590
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,000
What is it?

591
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
Close the door for me...

592
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
from outside.

593
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Let's go.

594
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,920
Did you just let her enter my house?

595
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,560
What did she offer to you?

596
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,120
Why do you wink at each other?

597
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,480
Yanxu.

598
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,720
She has learned about your insomnia.

599
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,320
Therefore,

600
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,680
if you don't want to be exposed,

601
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,200
you have to adopt her away.

602
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,360
What is it?

603
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Well...

604
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,320
Let her stay by your side.

605
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,240
Do...

606
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
a sleep recovery experiment.

607
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,920
She'll leave voluntarily...

608
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
if she fails.

609
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,600
Yes.

610
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,240
Impossible.

611
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,160
What do you two take me fore?

612
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,680
A lab rat?

613
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
There is no way around it.

614
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Two senior executives of Kerwin...

615
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,480
have fallen under the control of a girl.

616
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,720
Then what should we do?

617
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,800
Three days.

618
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,680
It can't be more than that.

619
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,680
Three days?

620
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,400
Even a cold takes five days to cure.

621
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
Be content,

622
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Ms. Lu.

623
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
Mr. Song is a busy man.

624
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,840
It's a little inconvenient...

625
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,960
to have you around.

626
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,040
Hurry up and say yes...

627
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,360
before he backs out.

628
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,080
Three days then.
