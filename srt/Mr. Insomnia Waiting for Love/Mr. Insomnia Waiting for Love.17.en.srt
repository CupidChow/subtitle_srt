You're not picking up my calls,

Did you have to go that far?

55

if I can't fall asleep

his fiancé falls asleep.

Okay.

Remember the drowning incident

last time Yanxu and I were hypnotized?

92

Of course.

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,400
But the hypnosis failed halfway
through the treatment.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
That's true.

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
But I had another dream last night.

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,040
I was able to see

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,960
things a lot clearer this time.

98
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
And

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
it felt so real,

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
like it really happened.

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,360
In this case, there are generally
two possibilities.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,240
One possibility is that it's been too
long so the memory is forgotten.

103
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
Simply put,

104
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,960
most of us

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,560
don't remember what our
kindergarten teachers look like.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,280
And the other possibility

107
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
is that something happened

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
which caused both of you
to forget the incident.

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,960
And this memory is being pulled
back into your increased conscious mind

110
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
with time and your reunion
with each other.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,560
It seems that

112
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,760
our insomnia

113
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,160
has a lot to do with this memory.

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
That's right.

115
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560
If we can fully recall this memory,

116
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,600
then your insomnia can be cured.

117

Tongtong, come down to eat.

338
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,560
Coming.

339
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
You didn't sleep again last night?

340
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,480
This tastes pretty good.

341
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
No, I was talking about…

342
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,400
What?

343
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,040
No.

344
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,960
Nothing.

345
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
Eat well.

346
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,200
Eat more.

347
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,960
Okay.

348
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,500
[Kerwin]

349
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,200
What's with this change in style?

350
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,560
Mix and match?

351
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
I know about you and Lu Entong.

352
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Don't be too sad.

353
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,560
Let's work hard

354
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
to develop Banana 3,

355
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
and then cure your insomnia.

356
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,680
What style?

357
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,840
I guess you

358
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,360
didn't hear a single thing I said.

359
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,760
Tongtong.

360
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,680
It's only been a few days

361
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,800
and you've lost so much weight.

362
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm fine.

363
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,280
I'll gain it all back through eating.

364
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
That's true.

365
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,560
How about this?

366
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,200
After we finish the movie

367
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,240
let's go have a big meal.

368
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,680
I'll go get the tickets.

369
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,440
Then, I'll get the snacks.

370
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
Okay.

371
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,480
I want a bucket of
popcorn and two cokes.

372
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,280
Okay.

373
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,560
Chi Zuo.

374
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,720
Tongtong's all good.

375
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,880
Don't worry.

376
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Tongtong,

377
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,800
is this enough?

378
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
Shall I give you more?

379
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,880
Yanxu

380
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
why are you selling popcorn?

381
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
And you're so skilled at it.

382
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
Tongtong.

383
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,680
Tongtong.

384
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Tongtong!

385
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,760
What's wrong?

386
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,160
Nothing.

387
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
We have everything now.

388
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,000
Let's go watch the movie.

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,800
