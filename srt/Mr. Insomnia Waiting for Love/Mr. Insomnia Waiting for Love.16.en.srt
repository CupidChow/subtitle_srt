This day would come sooner or later.

31

That year, I was ten years old,

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,280
Tong doesn't know that, right?

172
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
Uncle, please calm down.

173
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,760
Tong doesn't know yet,

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
so I wanted to ask you first.

175
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,160
What happened by the lake

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,960
when Tong was five years old?

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
That year...

178
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Brother.

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Actually,

180
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm really worried about Yanxu.

181
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
He must be feeling terrible right now.

182
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,040
It's better to endure short-term
pain than prolonged suffering.

183
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,960
Knowing the truth
after developing deep feelings

184
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,560
will only cause more pain.

185
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,560
But Yanxu's insomnia is still severe.

186
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,840
Brother.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
I will find a way to help him recover.

188
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
You comfort Yanxu,

189
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,600
and I'll find
a solution for his illness.

190
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Understood.

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
So, you're saying

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
Yanxu's mother
sacrificed herself to save Yanxu

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
and Tong, so the accident happened.

195
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,880
Then why does

196
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Uncle Song have
such a big grudge against Tong?

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,080
Because at that time, Song's mother

198
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,080
couldn't survive.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,640
She passed away.

200
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
And the two children
who fell into the water

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
remained unconscious.

202
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
An older child

203
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,960
insisted that

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,600
it was Tong who
insisted on rowing the boat,

205
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,880
resulting in the situation.

206
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,240
But Tong was
very obedient and well-behaved.

207
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,360
She couldn't
have asked to go rowing in the lake.

208
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
But at that time,

209
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
no matter how hard I asked her,

210
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
she couldn't speak a word.

211
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
Later, I found out that

212
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,840
after she woke up with a fever,

213
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,640
she developed amnesia.

214
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
What happened later?

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Later,

216
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,640
we brought Tong back home.

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,240
In the following two years or so,

218
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,960
Tong's emotions were always unstable.

219
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
She couldn't sleep through the night,

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
having nightmares
whenever she closed her eyes.

221
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Tong.

222
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Tong.

223
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
What's wrong, Tong?

224
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,680
Mommy is here.

225
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
Don't cry, sweetheart.

226
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,600
Mommy is here, don't cry.

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,400
Mommy is here.

228
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,240
Her mother and I

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,840
took her

230
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,760
to undergo this
psychological therapy for a long time.

231
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
Finally,

232
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
she recovered.

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,040
Chi,

234
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,200
promise uncle one thing.

235
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,160
Never tell this to Tong.

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
Her mom and I never want

237
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
anything bad to happen to her again.

238
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,680
But this matter...

239
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,800
Tong will know sooner or later.

240
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Okay.

241
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,440
I promise you, Uncle,

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,760
I will not tell Tong.

243
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,960
The scarf you knitted looks so nice.

244
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,960
Can you teach me?

245
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
Of course.

246
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Come, sit here.

247
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,760
Mommy will teach you.

248
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
First, we loop this
thread around your hand.

249
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
Then, we take this needle

250
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,680
like this,

251
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,920
pass it through from the inside

252
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,600
and then from the front.

253
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,480
You're so talented.

254
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,560
Xu already knows
how to knit a scarf, right?

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,080
Yes.

256
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,160
Auntie.

257
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Auntie.

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
Please have a seat first.

259
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
The house is a bit messy.

261
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Regarding your mom's matter,

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,840
your father has already told you, right?

263
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
Song,

264
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,440
you and Tong

265
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,680
should break up.

266
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,200
Tong.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
You're back.

268
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,040
Chizuo.

269
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
Why are you here?

270
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,720
I heard

271
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
Uncle is not feeling well.

272
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I came to check on him.

273
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,080
Thank you.

274
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
My dad is much better now.

275
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Chizuo.

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
Yanxu still isn't answering calls.

277
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,200
He might be busy with something urgent.

278
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,080
That's not it.

279
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,760
Yesterday, when our parents met,

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,200
everyone's reaction was strange.

281
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,440
We left without eating.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,280
And now, we can't find him anywhere.

283
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,620
[Yanxu]

284
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,360
Hello.

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
Chizuo.

286
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,040
I want to break up with Lu Entong.

287
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,840
What?

288
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,760
Can you take care of her for me?

289
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Be right back.

290
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,760
Tong, I'm hungry.

291
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
How about eating something together?

292
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay.

293
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Let's go.

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,680
Let's go.

295
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,280
Regarding your mom's matter,

296
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
your father has already told you, right?

297
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,160
Song,

298
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,840
you and Tong

299
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,200
should break up.

300
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,960
Are you going
to let Uncle Song tell Yanxu

301
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,880
that his mother was killed by someone?

302
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,960
Auntie,

303
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,960
I don't want to break up with Tong.

304
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
When you know the truth that year,

305
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,200
don't you hold
any blame against Tong in your heart?

306
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,720
I can understand you.

307
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,200
But the incident

308
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,400
that year,

309
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,880
no matter how much
her dad and I trust Tong,

310
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,240
we don't have
any evidence to defend her.

311
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm not coming here to

312
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,960
plead for Tong.

313
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Since you know the truth of the matter

314
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
and considering your father's attitude,

315
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,160
we can't bear to see our daughter

316
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
falling into this situation.

317
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,160
So while Tong still doesn't know it

318
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,360
let's choose to break up.

319
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,480
It's for the good of both of you.

320
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,280
Auntie,

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,560
I just need some time to process this.

322
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
After that incident back then,

323
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,280
the doctor asked us
to monitor and record Tong's condition.

324
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
Please forgive Auntie's selfishness.

325
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,200
My Entong

326
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
can no longer bear this pain.

327
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,680
If you truly love her,

328
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,560
let her go.

329
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Tong,

330
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,880
Hi.

332
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,520
Hi.

Please give us two set meals, thank you.

And two glasses of water.

335
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
What's wrong?

344
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
This Song Yanxu...

345
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,640
I'll go find him.

346
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
No need to go.

347
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,520
Why?

348
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,000
Aren't you angry?

349
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
Actually

350
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,720
I knew it a long time ago.

351
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,080
You already knew?

352
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,640
Actually, I had guessed it.

353
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Uncle Song

354
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
must take that my family
background doesn't match Yanxu's,

355
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,720
That's why

356
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,880
he tried to embarrass us.

357
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,560
Last time when our parents met,

358
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
they wanted to
show dominance over our family.

359
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,400
And when they returned home,

360
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
they definitely
forced Yanxu to break up with me.

361
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Yanxu had no choice

362
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
so he staged this act.

363
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,360
Acting?

364
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,160
Look at this photo.

365
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,600
The expression on Yanxu's face
as he wipes the woman's mouth.

366
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,560
He's smiling more
stiffly than a dinosaur fossil.

367
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,240
And what about
this photo of them in a hotel room?

368
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
Look at this photo.

369
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,840
He's still wearing
our couple ring on his hand.

370
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,800
It seems that Uncle Song

371
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,160
must have said some harsh words to him.

372
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
Otherwise,

373
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,640
he wouldn't have
been forced into this state.

374
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,360
I believe him

375
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,440
So

376
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,720
give him some time.

377
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,600
He will come and explain to me.

378
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,700
[You have an unread message]

379
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,700
[You have an unread message]

380
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
What are you doing?

381
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
What's going on with the trending?

382
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,040
Did it startle you?

383
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,360
Don't worry,
I wouldn't be misunderstood.

384
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
Are you all right?

385
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,160
Did uncle cause any trouble for you?

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,800
I miss you.

387
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,440
Goodnight.

388
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,200
You Song Yanxu,

389
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,960
not even sending a single message.

390
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,360
You're not afraid
of me getting angry, are you?

391
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,760
Luckily, it's me.

392
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
If it were someone else,

393
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,840
they would have broken up
with you eight hundred times already.

394
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
Just wait and see, you'll cry.

395
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
Yanxu.

396
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,200
Yanxu.

397
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,520
Yanxu.

398
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,360
Mom!

399
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,560
Brother, I'm so tired.

400
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,800
I can't stand any more, brother.

401
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,600
That little boy,

402
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,840
why does he look so familiar?

403
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,600
Yanxu.

404
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,480
What are you doing here?

405
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
Did I do something wrong?

406
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
Or

407
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
is there a misunderstanding between us?
