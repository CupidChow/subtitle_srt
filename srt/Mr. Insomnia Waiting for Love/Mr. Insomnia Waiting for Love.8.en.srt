167
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,080
Few days ago,

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
experiment report showed...

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,800
that you fell asleep
only when you're moved.

170
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,200
But...

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
when we met in the beginning,

172
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
we weren't moved by each other.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,480
How did we fall asleep?

174
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,920
This happens to be another explanation
I want to talk about today.

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,240
Sense of security.

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
Sense of security?

177
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
When did you have insomnia?

178
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,880
I had it one year ago.

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
Me too.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,120
I remember...

181
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,320
watching...

182
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,320
a news about a shipwreck.

183
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
I had a nightmare on the same night.

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,880
I had insomnia since then.

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,840
Okay.

186
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,520
I don't remember why in my case.

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,160
But...

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I also had nightmares.

189
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,280
And whenever I woke up,

190
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,320
I felt very tired and scared.

191
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,840
Having nightmares is a normal reaction
to severe insomnia.

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Think about it.

193
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,720
It could be something
you encounter inadvertently...

194
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,240
that has triggered something
in your subconscious mind.

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Something in my subconscious mind?

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,080
Ye Zi.

197
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,240
Sign off these documents.

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Okay.

199
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Ye Zi.

200
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
You're here.

201
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
What has happened to you?

202
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Have you caught a cold?

203
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
Minor cold. I'm fine.

204
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Assistant getting close to the boss.

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,640
Passionate and sweet interaction.

206
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
It isn't strange to catch a cold.

207
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
Do you practise sarcasm?

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
You sound sarcastic.

209
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Hand over these documents to Mr. Song
before end of the day.

210
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
Ignore her, Entong.

211
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,440
She is arrogant...

212
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
with the support of Ms. Xu.

213
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm fine.

214
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
I won't take her into account.

215
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Tongtong.

216
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,000
You're getting better nowadays.

217
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I was so fascinated.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm flattered.

219
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
What brings you here, Chi Zuo?

220
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
I come to give you a surprise.

221
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,960
Wow!

222
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
It's a ticket to Anne's Music Festival.

223
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,320
I heard that she is the judge
of the audition

224
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,240
you want to go.

225
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
I deliberately asked
for two tickets from my friend.

226
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I'll take you there tonight.

227
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,240
You're so nice, Chi Zuo.

228
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,720
It's hard to buy this ticket.

229
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
I just couldn't buy it.

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,400
I'll wait you there tonight.

231
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,560
See you later.

232
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,040
Okay.

233
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes!

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
I can see Anne again.

235
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,520
Wow!

236
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
It's crowded.

237
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Come with me.

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Huh?

239
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,800
Tongtong.

240
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,580
[Annie concert ticket]
Wow!

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,120
I went to pick you up
at the rehearsal room.

242
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,040
They said you come to
Anne's Music Festival.

243
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,840
Oh no!

244
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I forgot to tell him.

245
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
He won't blame me, right?

246
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,840
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,080
I was so excited
that I forgot to tell you.

248
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Yanxu.

249
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,400
Xiaotong is just your assistant...

250
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
and it's after working hours.

251
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,400
She doesn't have to inform you
about everything she does, right?

252
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,520
[Annie concert ticket]
How should I explain to Chi Zuo?

253
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,800
I take you to meet Anne.

254
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,400
I made an appointment with her.

255
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,880
There is still time
before the performance.

256
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,400
We can greet her first.

257
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Go now.

258
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,280
Go.

259
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,920
Come on.

260
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
Madam Anne.

261
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,200
Entong, Yanxu.

262
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,400
We meet again.

263
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Hello, Anne.

264
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm really pleased to meet you today.

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
I hope your performance goes well.

266
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,960
Thank you.

267
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm too busy today.

268
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
No problem.

269
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,640
Well.

270
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Could I have an autographed photo

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
of you after the performance?

272
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,280
No problem.

273
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,080
Thank you, Madam Anne.

274
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm more determined with my goal

275
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
after meeting Madam Anne.

276
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,480
What goal?

277
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,280
I...

278
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
want to be an outstanding cellist.

279
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,040
But you're outstanding already.

280
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,160
No.

281
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
It's hard practising cello
when I was young.

282
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,600
I always wanted to give up.

283
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Fortunately,

284
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,200
my mentoring teacher gave me
a lot of encouragement at that time.

285
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had
this achievement today.

286
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
She must be...

287
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,960
proud of you now.

288
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,200
But I lost contact with her
when I was still young.

289
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Yanxu.

290
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,400
Will you watch me...

291
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
below the stage on the competition day?

292
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
Of course.

293
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,280
I'll watch you...

294
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
shine on the stage you love the most.

295
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a deal then.

296
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,880
Okay.

297
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,600
You should practise well.

298
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,600
Of course.

299
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Next, I announce...

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,640
the start of the audition...

of the Asian Symphony Orchestra.

Let's welcome the first candidate
to the stage.

303

Don't get nervous.

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,720

305

All the best.

Don't worry, I'll do my best.

307
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
The competition starts.

308
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,240
Candidates in the waiting area
shall get ready.

309
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,520
I have to put my phone away.

310
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Contact you afterwards.

311
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,000
You're also here, Yanxu.

312
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you have a friend competing?

313
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Yes.

Now?

320
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
What is it?

321
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
Go to find out.

322
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
Okay.

Where is Madam Anne?

326
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Let me out.

Anyone?

333
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,320
Let me out.

Open the door.

339
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
Anyone?

340
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
I want to compete.

341
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
The chance matters a lot to me.

342
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,240
It's my last chance.

343
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,400
Let me out.

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
Anyone hears me?

345
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,280
Let's welcome the next candidate,

346
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
Lu Entong to the stage.

347
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Welcome.

348
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,080
Anyone?

349
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,280
Anyone?

350
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Will someone let me out?

351
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,400
Sorry.

352
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,440
I've just received news that the
candidate has withdrawn herself.

353
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Let's welcome the next candidate
to the stage.

354
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,520
Something must have happened to her.

355
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Split up to find her.

356
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,880
Tongtong.

357
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
Xiaotong.

358
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
Tongtong.

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Tongtong.

360
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,600
Xiaotong.

361
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,880
Xiaotong.

362
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,000
How about the following footage?

363
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,280
No CCTV from here.

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Have you found out about this person?

365
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,840
She isn't a staff of the competition.

366
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,520
Where does it lead to?

367
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
Storeroom.

368
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,240
It's particularly cold.

369
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,200
Call the police.

370
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm going to look for her.

371
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,720
Tongtong.

372
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,400
Tongtong.

373
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,720
Tongtong, are you okay?

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,800
How are you?

375
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Wake up now.

376
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
Tongtong.

377
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
Who are you looking for?

378
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,080
Where is the patient in this ward?

379
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Do you mean Ms. Lu Entong?

380
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
She was discharged this morning.

381
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,480
Thank you.

382
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,200
The number you have dialled
is temporarily busy.

383
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Please try again later.

384
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,100
[Inpatient department]

385
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Tongtong.

386
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
I didn't protect you well.

387
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,640
When you feel better,

388
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
we'll join another competition.

389
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
You'll make it.

390
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,880
I thought...

391
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,200
I could work hard...

392
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,600
to make my dream come true.

393
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,320
But the God...

394
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,880
didn't give me a chance at all.

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Tongtong.

396
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,280
Stop being sad over something
in the past.

397
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm your boyfriend.

398
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Trust me.

399
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,800
I'll protect you well.

400
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,800
Mr. Song.

401
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,600
We have a clue on the person
who screwed up the competition.

402
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,720
After she locked Lu Entong in the room,

403
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,800
she texted another person
using her phone.

404
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,120
I let the technical department
zoom in the phone screen...

405
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,880
and found...

406
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
What did you find?

407
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,880
The profile picture
of her contact person...

408
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,800
is exactly the one of Jiang Yu,
Ms. Xu's assistant.

409
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,760
It...

410
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,520
shouldn't be a coincidence.

411
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,000
I only let you hold her back.

412
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
I didn't ask you to lock her in a room.

413
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,280
Now...

414
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,080
You've got her hospitalised.

415
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,480
How can you solve it?

416
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,600
Fine.

417
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,880
Stop talking.

418
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Take care of yourself.

419
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,200
Stop calling me.

420
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,360
Yanxu.

421
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Why are you here?

422
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
Why did you hurt Lu Entong?

423
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
What do you mean?

424
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

425
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
I thought you're just a spoiled
young lady.

426
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,200
I didn't expect you to be
so evil-minded.

427
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:07,960
I...

428
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Xu Mansu.

429
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm warning you.

430
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,880
Stop approaching...

431
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
and hurting Lu Entong.

432
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm not sure what I would do otherwise.

433
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,480
Song Yanxu.

434
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,800
How could you say I'm evil-minded?

435
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
How can you say this about me?

436
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,000
Is our relation over the years...

437
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
incomparable to Lu Entong?

438
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,920
If I knew you would hurt her like that,

439
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,920
I would rather never have known you.

440
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,400
Stop crying, my dear daughter.

441
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,560
Your eyes are swollen with tears.

442
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,440
My goodness!

443
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,400
Tell me who bullied you.

444
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll take it out on him.

445
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,040
Father.

446
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,800
Yanxu has changed.

447
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,600
I knew it was him.

448
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,480
He likes someone else.

449
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,920
He even threatened me for her.

450
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,200
He even threatened you?

451
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,480
He went too far.

452
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,080
Father.

453
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,400
Yanxu won't get married with me now.

454
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
What should I do?

455
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Susu.

456
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,680
You're betrothed to him since childhood.

457
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,320
He can't change the fact
even if he is fascinated...

458
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,640
by another woman for now.

459
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
Don't worry, you have me.

460
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
I'll stand up for you later.

461
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,600
I dare him to act against me.

462
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Ms. Xu.

463
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,040
Why do I receive a dismissal email
from the group?

464
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Jiang Yu.

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,640
How could you come to question me?

466
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,640
You did things clumsily.

467
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,040
I was also taught a lesson by Yanxu
because of you.

468
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
A dismissal is good enough
to save your pride.

469
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,720
You should be glad that you aren't...

470
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,000
put on trial for intentional injury.

471
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,800
Leave.

472
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,640
Fine.

473
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,720
You just wait.

474
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,560
I'll make you all pay.

475
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,200
Remember to close the door.

476
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,400
Song.

477
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
Your riding skills have improved much
from the last time we met.

478
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,920
Because I had nothing to do.

479
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,520
I have plenty of time to practise.

480
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Yanxu saves you a lot of trouble...

481
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,080
by managing the group for you.

482
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Yanxu can have current achievement...

483
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,480
only with your support
in the board of directors.

484
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,600
Don't talk like a stranger.

485
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,120
I haven't seen Mansu some while.

486
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
Don't you take her with you?

487
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,160
Don't mention it.

488
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,240
She isn't in a good mood lately.

489
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
She even cried in front of me just now.

490
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,120
Mansu isn't a petulant girl.

491
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,840
Who bullied her again?

492
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,640
What else...

493
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,320
other than love relationship?

494
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,880
She cares too much about Yanxu.

495
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,320
She always worries about losing him.

496
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,480
She said...

497
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,600
Yanxu falls for someone else lately.
She was worried.

498
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,800
Is there such a thing?

499
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,800
I'll call to teach Yanxu a lesson.

500
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,320
Song.

501
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,720
It's normal for young people...

502
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
to argue or fight.

503
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Don't get angry.

504
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,080
Whatever it is,

505
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
Yanxu shouldn't make Mansu cry.

506
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,240
Yes, father.

507
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Did you bully Mansu?

508
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,280
Listen.

509
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,080
Mansu is my designated daughter-in-law.

510
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,520
You...

511
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,920
Bad kid.

512
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
He said he was in a meeting.

513
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
I'll scold him later.

514
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,800
Who was it?

515
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,480
Why did you hang up the call?

516
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,280
A harassment call.

517
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,320
Do you call him father?

518
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,280
Don't ask when you know.

519
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
Fine. I won't ask.

520
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
However,

521
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
I seldom hear you mention him.

522
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Mother.

523
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,640
Are you doing well...

524
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,920
in heaven?

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
I behave every day.

526
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,800
Yanxu, what are you doing?

527
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm drawing.

528
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,880
Look.

529
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,440
This is me.

530
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,800
This is mother.

531
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,040
The three of us are rowing a boat
on the river.

532
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,840
Look. Does this look alike mother?

533
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,920
You mustn't draw this kind of painting
again, do you hear me?

534
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,080
Take it away.

535
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,200
Don't go.

536
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,200
Yanxu.

537
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
Give it back.

538
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,120
I hate you.

539
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
I hate you.

540
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,720
It's all bad memories.

541
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,120
No need to mention it.
