16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,480
Song Yanxu, are you crazy?

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
You mean

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,000
in the beginning, you both came
together to cure sickness?

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,080
So you two can fall asleep only

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
when you're both in contact.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,920
I know.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,400
This may be hard for you to believe.

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
But it's all true.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Tong, what are you doing?

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,640
Em...nothing.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm experimenting.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,720
Chi Zuo.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
I found a way to treat my insomnia.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
You don't have to find
professionals for me anymore.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
I believe you.

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Although it's hard for me to
accept such an absurd thing,

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
But I believe you.

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,800
I believe Tong too.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,440
Chi Zuo.

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
I want to ask for your help.

36
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,520
Tongtong,

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
it's in the middle of the night.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,760
What are you doing here not sleeping?

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,440
I...

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm thirsty.

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,120
I came down to drink something.
I'll go sleep now...

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,960
This child...

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,440
Lu.

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,440
Wake up...

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
Wake up and let's go
buy some groceries.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,600
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
I've been thinking these days.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
Tongtong's condition
doesn't seem right.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
What's wrong?

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
I think she's normal.

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,360
You men are insensitive.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,560
You can't even realise
Tongtong's obvious response.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,240
These few nights when I went
for the toilet, I saw that

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,600
either she's having the
lights on in her room

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,640
or drinking alone.

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,040
This is too weird.

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,520
What's weird about it?

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
Young people.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
Isn't it normal for
them to stay up late?

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Go ahead and sleep.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Don't think too much.

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,600
Do you think something is going on

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,240
between her and Song?

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,480
Don't speak the name Song every day.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,400
I'll get angry whenever
I hear his name.

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,280
He's got a lot to catch up to Chi Zuo.

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,640
Cure what sickness...

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,040
If Tongtong's sick,

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,280
it has got to be his problem.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm telling you,

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800
we can't be soft this time.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,960
Let's sleep.

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,080
Don't you think your daughter is
getting weird?

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Must be possessed.

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
Don't go.

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
Look at her condition.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,560
What's going on?

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,840
She must've faked it.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
Don't talk nonsense.

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,360
How is the thing I
told you to look into?

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,720
No rushing. I'm still looking into it.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
It has been for some time.
Still nothing?

83
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,400
I guess we'll have to
terminate our collaboration.

84
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Don't be anxious, Director Xu.

85
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,720
Give me two more days.

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,640
According to my years of experience,

87
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,400
the two must be hiding something.

88
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
Uncle, auntie. Sorry to

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
bother you at the weekend.

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,960
No, it's fine.

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
You kid.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
You're being too polite.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
Chi Zuo.

94
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Why did you come?

95
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
Didn't we have a promise last week that

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,520
we're going out for a picnic today?

97
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,720
I got the things prepared.

98
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,560
When are we going?

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Camping?

100
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Oh.

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
That's right...

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,800
We had a promise last week.

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
How can I forget about that?

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
I'll go get my things.

105
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,360
Hang on.

106
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
Just the two of you?

107
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,040
No one else?

108
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,200
Don't worry, uncle. It's just us.

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Why are you asking so much?

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
Hurry up get your things.
Don't make Chi Zuo wait.

111
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Okay.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Chi Zuo.

113
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Don't go somewhere else.

114
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Remember, before the sky gets dark,

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,680
you have to bring Tongtong back.

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,240
Okay.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
Tongtong

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,640
is having insomnia lately.

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
Just the right time for
you to bring her out

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
to relax.

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,720
She's getting insomnia again?

122
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,320
What do you mean by
getting insomnia again?

123
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,320
Uncle, auntie.
Both of you may not know.

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Tong suffers from serious insomnia.

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,760
It has been over a year.

126
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,240
She couldn't get to sleep every night.

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,920
What?

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Why didn't she tell us?

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,400
She doesn't want you to worry.

130
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,360
I have taken her to hospitals,

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
to see doctors

132
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,480
and got some prescriptions.

133
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
But she's not getting any better.

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,800
But I thought she must've
gotten better recently.

135
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,920
Because I rarely hear her
mentioning her insomnia.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,960
Both of us have serious insomnia.

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,400
We found out by chance that

138
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
we can fall asleep together
just by a touch.

139
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Why did you bring me here?

140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Look behind you.

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,320
Do you want to sleep here right away

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
when we just met?

143
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,840
In just a few days,
you have become thinner.

144
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm good.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How are uncle and auntie?

146
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
Are they still mad?

147
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
Much better.

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,200
But they don't believe
the truth I told them.

149
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
I also don't know what to do.

150
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
Two of you there,

151
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,240
how long are you going to talk?

152
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
Have you forgotten I'm here?

153
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
You asked Chi Zuo to come for me?

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
Yes.

155
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,160
I told him about us.

156
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Chi Zuo.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Thank you.

158
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,040
If it weren't for you...

159
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,920
Okay.

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,760
I'll come to fetch you at nine.

161
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,760
I already promised uncle and auntie.

162
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,040
Don't get me exposed.

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,280
Let's go.

164
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Lu.

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
The chicken soup is done.
Hurry go drink it.

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
Since you're so worried,

167
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,080
why did you let Chi Zuo take her out?

168
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,960
You know Tongtong.

169
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
She'll definitely ask Chi Zuo

Don't you think I don't know?

But I'm more worried about
Tongtong's health.

172
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,920
If Chi Zuo was right about it,

173
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,480
then things Tongtong has said

174
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,720
may be true.

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,720
Right.

Should we

179
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160

180
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Talk about what?

181
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not happy with the lousy agreement

What is it all about?

184
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,880
Our Tongtong is mature.

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,400
She wouldn't be thoughtless
to have done such a thing.

186
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
Should we

187

try to learn more about this Song?

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Let me think about it.

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,800
Hey, where are you going?

190
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,320
Who is it?

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
It's me, Tongtong.

192
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,000

Quick, get changed into this.

198

And get into the blanket.

199
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
If my father comes in,
I'll say you're Tang Rao.

200

Can this work?

201
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
Maybe I should go out and tell uncle...

202
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Open the door, Tongtong.
What are you doing?

203
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,400
Coming, dad.

204

Ah...

210
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
I made a call with Chi Zuo.

211
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
He said you're feeling unwell.

212
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
And you went home.

213
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Your mother was worried about you.

214
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,960
She made this chicken soup and

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
told me to send it to you.

It's Tang Rao.

We were having milk.

I told her to rest first.

Don't you worry.

Yes.

Tang, I'm your Uncle Lu.

232

You can't drink milk
when you have a cold.

233
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
You must have some chicken soup.

234
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
Your aunt made some chicken soup,

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
just right for you.

236

I'll be fine after some rest.

It must be serious for Tang.

she used to address me.

admit my mistake.

It certainly is my problem
for that agreement.

Tongtong and I will
prove it to you later.

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,760
Uncle, it's true that when
the agreement was first made,

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,400
it was an excuse to get a hold

262

of Tongtong to cure my insomnia.

263

But I swear.

Uncle.

270

It's my fault for
making this agreement.

271

But.

272
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,680
Because Tongtong has inherited all
the goodness from you and auntie.

She's too gorgeous.

I can make a new agreement.

No, uncle. I didn't mean that.

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,800
It's nothing.

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,080
Your coffee.

340
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,120
Thank you.

341
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
I prepared something dessert for you.

342
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay.

343
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,320
Is it good?

344
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
Not bad.

345
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Boss, what happened to your hand?

346
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,320
His hand was burned.

347
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,880
I applied some toothpaste to him.

348
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
It may get better soon.

349
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,400
Boss, you should wash it away.
Toothpaste doesn't work on burns.

350
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,920
It'll cause infection too.

351
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
Really?

352
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,480
Yes.

353
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,400
Okay, got it.

354
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
Alright.

355
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,400
It's fine.

357
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
I almost make it more serious.

358
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,560
It's a big deal.

359
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,320
Moreover,

360
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
it's my first time feeling your care

361
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,520
aside from being an independent
career woman.

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,480
It's more of a touching feeling
than an infection.

363
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,200
Oh, shut up.

364
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,520
Chi Zuo.

365
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,400
Yes?

366
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Have you ever seen this photo?

367
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,360
Song Yanxu's mother

368
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,280
is Lu Entong's childhood cello teacher.

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,480
This can't be coincidental.

370
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,080
Mansu.

371
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,120
Actually they...

372
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,880
Even if they knew each other
when they were kids,

373
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,200
so what?

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,000
What's the meaning of doing all this?

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,520
Of course, it's meaningful.

376
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,080
I must let Yanxu know

377
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,280
the purpose of Lu Entong
getting close to him.

378
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,080
No.

379
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,360
I will definitely find it out.

380
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,360
Tongtong.

381
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,360
Tongtong.

382
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
Yes.

383
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,760
Where's my father?

384
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,520
He must have gone.

385
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,360
How did you get this?

386
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,480
It seems like what they said were real.

387
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,520
But brat,

388
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,600
today,

389
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll believe you for once reluctantly.

390
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:31,840
Okay?

391
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,280
If you ever wrong Tongtong from now on,

392
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,880
I won't forgive you.

393
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,680
Do you think uncle believed it?

394
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,000
He must have believed it.

395
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,120
Or with that temper of my father,

396
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,520
he must have given you a good scold
after the moment we woke up.

397
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,480
Why did Professor Li call
so many times?

398
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,560
Song Yanxu.

399
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
Why are you two sleeping?

400
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,800
Didn't I say no to getting close to each
other during the drowsiness period?

401
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Why can't you even stand this?

402
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,400
Two of you should come to see me now.

403
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,680
Why are we so unlucky recently?

404
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,160
We're apologizing wherever we go.

405
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,720
Bad luck.

406
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,360
We are doing practical
examination this afternoon.

407
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,960
Problems science can't explain.

408
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,600
Actually...

409
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,280
That's enough.

410
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,760
Stop talking nonsense.

411
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,120
Let's get to the point.

412
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,120
Recently, I found that both of your

413
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,280
data have experienced
huge abnormalities.

414
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,880
By combining the case my
senior gave me previously,

415
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm going to make a new treatment
programs for you two.

416
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Professor Li.

417
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,320
Since our case is similar to Zheng's,

418
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,680
why don't use the same method?

419
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,720
That's because

420
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,000
the two observation objects
of that case studies

421
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
suicided afterwards.

422
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,200
So,

423
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,720
every treatment can only act as
reference, we can't follow them all.

424
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,240
Ready?

425
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,440
I'm nervous.

426
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,080
This is my first time being hypnotized.

427
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,120
You'll be alright, Tongtong.

428
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,520
I'm here with you.

429
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,760
Okay.

430
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Let's get started.

431
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,640
Ke.

432
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm here.

433
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,320
Activate the hypnosis mode.

434
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,000
First, close your eyes and relax.

435
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,320
Pay attention to your breathing.

436
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,720
Relax your body.

437
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Now,

438
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm going to take you two
into a brand new world.

439
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,200
Come here quickly.

440
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,760
Wait for me.

441
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,260
[Dangerous Deep Water, Keep Away]

442
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,880
Tongtong.

443
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Are you okay?

444
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,640
My head hurts.

445
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,680
You're just awake. Don't be anxious.
Take some rest.

446
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
Professor.

447
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Is something wrong?

448
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,800
Because both your bodies have resisted,

449
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,200
so we're stopping the
hypnosis this time.

450
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
In the process,

451
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,720
you have mentioned by
the water at the same time.

452
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,120
Perhaps you two have experienced

453
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,040
something related to water or drowning.

454
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,840
Think carefully about it.

455
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,400
Any sort of similar experience?

456
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,600
The bad dream I just had,

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,640
I've had it before.

458
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,720
Only this time,

459
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
it's more real.

460
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
I'm thinking that

461
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,000
we can work it out this time.
