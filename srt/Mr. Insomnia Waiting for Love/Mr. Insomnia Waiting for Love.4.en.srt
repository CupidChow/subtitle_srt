What do you think?

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
Last time, we fell asleep whenever
we touched each other.

How come it doesn't work now?

184
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
I told you already.

185
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,400
You must believe in science
and not superstition.

186
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
Believe in science.

187
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,280
But science can't explain

188
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
why we slept together

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
for four times.

190

Why can't you drink alcohol?

200
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Because I can't drink.

201
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
How can a man say he
can't do something?

202

How long does it take
to walk to the town?

Hop on.

How do you know I drank last night?

You called me to pick you up last night.

must not be disclosed to a third person.

There's already a third
person who knows.

Do you have a loose lips?

The third person I'm
talking about is Ms. Lu.

He called me Little Che last night.

388
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,160
Today, he called me a loose lip.

Please help us, senior.

Xu's condition is getting worse.

You must help him.

The company's business

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
is getting better.

397
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,240
However,

398
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,400
the board members are plotting
against him all the time.

399
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm worried that

400
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,880
if they knew about Yanxu's insomnia,

401
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,280
they'll make a big fuss
over this matter.

402
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,960
Before I figured out Xu's condition,

403
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,560
I will not simply report
it to the board.

how precious is our Mr. Chi's time?

Don't you have a better
relationship with him than me?

Why don't you ask him?

Is your relationship with Yanxu

not progressing well?

433
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,480
As usual, he's cold to me.

He seems to care about somebody else.

435

Does Yanxu have a girlfriend now?

Who's that?

It's not important.

I've heard cases like Yanxu's before.

450
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,040
But as for why the two of them fell
asleep when they touched each other,

451
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,840
there is no authoritative
explanation at the scientific level.

we don't have many details.

really exist,

456
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,120

let's forget it.

518
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,680
No.

519
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,360

you can get free treatment for insomnia.

524
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,360

I'll sign it now.

526
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,960

I have something to do tomorrow.

535

Do I need to report to you on that?
