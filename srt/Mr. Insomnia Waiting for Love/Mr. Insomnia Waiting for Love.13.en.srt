16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
The hypnosis needs to be suspended

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,920
because your body resists.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
During this process

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I noticed that both of you
mentioned waterside.

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Perhaps you have had similar
experiences

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,960
or drowning-related experiences before.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,800
Think about it carefully.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,240
Have you had any similar experiences?

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Drowning.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,120
I don't recall having any experiences
of drowning when I was young.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,760
How about you, Tongtong?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
I don't have either.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
When I was young,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,040
I spent most of my time in
the rehearsal studio.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
I had no time to play at all.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,120
It's hard to explain

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
why both of you had memories of drowning

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
after the hypnosis session.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,160
Let's not dwell on it for now.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's stop here for now.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,520
Your nerves are

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
highly tense,

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
which is not conducive
to the treatment.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,120
How about

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,640
taking some time to go out for a walk

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
and relax in a natural environment?

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
It will help relieve your emotions

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,120
and contribute to the
next stage of treatment.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,320
Once your condition improves a bit,

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
we can proceed with the
second hypnosis session.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Is that okay?

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,920
Alright.

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,280
How about

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,760
we go for a walk by the water?

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Maybe it will

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
help us remember something.

53
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
There's actually a place I've been
wanting to take you to.

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,120
Great!

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,320
But hold on.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
No.

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Ouch!

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
Dad!

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,160
I'm not your dad,

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
you're my dad.

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
I've consulted with the doctor.

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
Your condition is very serious
right now.

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,640
If you go out to play,

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
and something happens, do you know

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,800
how worried and anxious your mom
and I would be?

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Yanxu is also here.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
He will protect me.

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,440
What can he do to protect you?

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,640
He is in a worse condition than you,

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,760
and besides, he is a patient himself.

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
You, as a young girl,

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
shouldn't be hanging out

73
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
with a boy.

74
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
It's absolutely not acceptable.

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,160
Mom.

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,000
Tongtong,

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,720
you go ahead.

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,040
I'll take care of your dad.

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,640
Thank you, Mom.

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,000
I knew you're the best.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
What's wrong with you?

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Didn't we agree to stand together?

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you, Dad.

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Director Xu, what do you want
to see me about?

85
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
No, there's nothing.

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
I was busy during the past period,

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,440
didn't have time to come and see you.

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680
But as soon as I finished,
I came over right away.

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,960
You're being too polite,
Director Xu.

90
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
It's what I should do.

91
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,200
By the way,

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,840
how is the progress of the investigation

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,920
that the headquarters sent you here for?

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Is everything going smoothly?

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,120
Thank you for your concern, Director Xu.

96
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,000
Everything is going smoothly.

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Dr. Li,

98
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
there's a problem with the data
from Zheng's office.

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
They want you to go over there.

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Alright, I'll come right away.

101
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll go there first.

102
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
When you're free,
let's have a meal together.

103
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Sure, let's do that.

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Tongtong.

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
What's wrong?

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
My parents

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,320
agreed so easily for us
to go out and play.

108
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,720
I have a feeling that
something isn't right.

109
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,120
Don't overthink it.

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,960
We finally got the chance to go out
so let's enjoy ourselves.

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,040
No,

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,200
I still can't shake off my worries.

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Let me test it out.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Dad.

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,440
What's wrong?

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,960
I just woke up.

117
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,960
Oh,

118
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
did I disturb you?

119
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,160
It's nothing. What's up?

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Nothing.

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,240
I just wanted to let you know that
we're about to leave, look!

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,920
Alright.

123
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
Got it.

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,960
Be safe on the road.

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

126
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll hang up now.

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay.

128
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,440
Maybe I really am overthinking it.

129
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,560
Alright, let's stop thinking and
get in the car.

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Wife, you understand
our daughter the best.

131
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
You knew she would
check everything in advance.

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,720
That's why you prepared
all these things.

133
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,360
Yes,

134
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
otherwise we would have been exposed.

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,840
Trying to challenging me?

136
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
You're still too young
to compete with me.

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,520
Catch up with them.

138
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
No problem.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360
Just by holding hands,

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,280
we almost got into an accident.

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
It was so scary.

142
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,120
I should have known better than
to sit in the passenger seat.

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
I told you not to come.

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Mom, Dad, why are you here?

145
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
In your pajamas, too.

146
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,760
You don't need to worry about that.

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,800
If we hadn't come,

148
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,560
who knows what kind of trouble
you would have gotten into.

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
Tongtong, do you realize how
dangerous that was?

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Your dad and I were following
behind you just now.

151
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,640
I was almost scared to death

152
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,400
when seeing your car suddenly
lose control.

153
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
It's okay.

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,360
This isn't okay.

155
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,600
Song,

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
make a call quickly.

157
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,040
Ask a mechanic to tow your car away

158
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
then send me the address.

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,440
Both of you, get in our car.

160
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,760
We'll take you there.

161
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,720
Yan Xu,

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
you sit in the passenger seat.

163
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,920
Okay.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
Mansu, you're looking for me?

165
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,840
Yeah.

166
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,920
I asked a friend to bring you
a burn ointment.

167
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
It works quickly and won't leave scars.

168
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Here you go.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
I apologize for last time.

170
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
I didn't expect you to
remember the injury on my hand.

171
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,320
Thank you.

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
Mansu,

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
I advise you not to investigate
Yanxu's matter anymore.

174
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Sometimes letting go is a
form of relief,

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
and it's better for both you and him.

176
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
Compared to the two of us,

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,880
I think I have a better mindset.

178
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,160
At least I don't have
self-harm tendencies.

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Just leave me alone, okay?

180
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
I'll handle it myself.

181
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,360
Hello?

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,400
Let's meet, okay?

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Hello, Mr. Song.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
We have already processed your
reservation

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,360
for the deluxe double suite.

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Please follow me upstairs.

187
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
You're quite clever

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,320
to choose a double room.

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
I forgot to add your room.

190
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
Manager,

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
could you please add another room
next to the room?

192
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Mr. Song,

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,560
I apologize for the inconvenience.

194
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,960
It's currently the peak tourist season,

195
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
and our hotel is fully booked.

196
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,920
This kid tends to spend
money recklessly.

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,800
Having two rooms should be sufficient.

198
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,280
I stay with Tongtong,

199
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
and you can stay with your uncle.

200
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
Please rest assured.

201
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Mr. Song has booked

202
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,760
our hotel's highest-standard
double suite.

203
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Not to mention four people,

204
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,600
even if there are eight people,
it's not a problem.

205
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,360
I've prepared the meals and drinks.

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
If you have any requests,
please let me know.

207
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,440
No. Please show us the way.

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,760
This way, please.

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,160
Will Uncle be upset with me?

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
No, he won't.

211
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
Besides, my dad sleeps quietly,
so there's no problem. Let's go.

212
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,640
Tongtong.

213
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,160
Such a serious matter like insomnia,

214
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
you didn't even inform the family.

215
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
Do you know how upset I felt

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,720
after your dad talked to me that day?

217
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Mom,

218
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
I keep it from you and dad

219
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
because I didn't want to worry you.

220
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,960
Oh, you silly child.

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
As your parents,

222
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
who else should we worry about
if not our own child?

223
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Mom,

224
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
do you and dad still not believe
what I said?

225
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
Initially, yes,

226
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,120
we did find it hard to believe.

227
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,560
But upon careful consideration,

228
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,720
there are indeed

229
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,400
many unexplainable things in this world.

230
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Instead of making baseless guesses,

231
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
we choose to believe you.

232
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,920
We hope that both of you
can support each other

233
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
and recover from it as soon as possible.

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,560
Mom,

235
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
actually, I know that

236
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,960
even though Dad may seem stern,

237
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
he really loves me, right?

238
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,720
Your dad

239
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
is tough in words but soft in actions.

240
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
Remember when you were born,

241
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
he would hold you in his arms,

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,320
treating you like a
delicate porcelain doll,

243
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,960
afraid of dropping or hurting you.

244
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,920
Whenever he snored in his sleep,

245
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,760
you would cry non-stop,

246
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,240
with your little face turning red.

247
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,240
It broke his heart.

248
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
He didn't dare to sleep
in the same room afterward

249
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,560
and would go to the sofa alone.

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh, my goodness,

251
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,520
I can't believe this!

252
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
How did I not know about it?

253
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Wait a minute,

254
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
does Dad still snore now?

255
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
Is his snoring bothering you?

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Song Yanxu,

257
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,160
What's wrong?

258
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,400
What are you staring like that?

259
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,760
Tongtong,

260
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,400
Fortunately, nothing happened today.

262
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,600
Otherwise, I'd never forgive myself
for the rest of my life.

263
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Don't take all the blame upon yourself.

264
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
It seems Dr. Li was right.

265
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,520
Our time of contact and sleep
has been getting shorter.

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,400
We need to be more careful
in the future.

267
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,960
I just hate that I can't
protect you well.

268
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,960
Every time, I put you in danger.

269
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
This time, we had Uncle and Aunt here,

270
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
but what about next time?

271
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Next time...

272
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
Yanxu.

273
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,320
Whenever I have a problem,

274
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,800
you're always the first one to appear.

275
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
You knew I wanted to join the
symphony orchestra,

276
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,920
so you found a way to help me enroll.

277
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
You knew my parents misunderstood you,

278
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,800
and you patiently explained
everything to them.

279
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
I feel safe with you,

280
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,240
and I'm not afraid of anything.

281
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,520
Now, it's not just me in danger;

282
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,240
it's both of us.

283
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,520
So, what we need to do is

284
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,400
face it together.

285
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Tongtong,

286
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,000
This time when we go back, let's clear
up the misunderstandings with my dad.

287
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,760
Dad, why can't we open this door?

288
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Mom and I

289
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,520
haven't been on a trip together
for a long time.

290
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,760
Today, we want to have some alone time.

291
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
As for you two,

292
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
go out and enjoy yourselves.

293
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,520
What do you mean?

294
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,040
It means you two shouldn't disturb us.

295
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
Go and have fun on your own.

296
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,400
Son,

297
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
behave well.

298
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,400
Otherwise, you won't be able
to be my son-in-law.

299
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
Don't worry, Uncle.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
I will take good care of Tongtong.

301
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,200
Be safe when you go out to play.

302
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
Don't drive, just take a taxi.

303
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, don't worry.

304
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,040
Goodbye.

305
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,760
Where should we go?

306
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
I know there's a wishing tree.

307
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Do you want to go there?

308
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,640
Yes.

309
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,720
To make a wish to
help us get better soon.

310
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,840
Let's go then.

311
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
Wow, this wishing tree is so beautiful.

312
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,720
How did you know about this place?

313
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Xiaoxu, look!

314
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,920
This is the wishing tree.

315
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,640
You just have to think
about your wish in your heart

316
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,160
and if you can throw it
onto the tree at once,

317
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,840
your wish will come true.

318
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,560
Really?

319
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,480
Then I definitely have to
throw it up there.

320
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Alright.

321
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,760
I want to be with my mom forever.

322
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,800
Xiaoxu, you don't need to
make that wish.

323
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,320
Mom will always be with you.

324
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,960
Yanxu,

325
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,920
what are you thinking?

326
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,440
Nothing.

327
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,160
Earlier, you said if I throw it up
onto the tree at once,

328
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,840
my wish will come true.

329
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,200
Is that true?

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Maybe.

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,920
Then I'll give it a try.

332
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,400
What wish did you make?

333
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
I can't say it out loud.

334
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,440
If I do, it won't come true.

335
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,840
I threw it.

336
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,520
Did I throw it up there?

337
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,040
It seems like you didn't.

338
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,440
Then what about my wish?

339
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
How about you give me another one?

340
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,800
I don't have any more.

341
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
Oh.

342
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,160
Alright then.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,280
Let's go explore somewhere else.

344
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,760
Okay.

345
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,840
Take a boat.

346
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
Would you both like to take
a boat ride together?

347
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
Couples get a discount on boat rides.

348
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,880
No, thanks.

349
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,120
Ah.

350
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Alright then.

351
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
It's fine.

352
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,560
No need to make such a loud noise.

353
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,640
You don't like boat rides either,
do you?

354
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,520
I didn't like it since I was a child

355
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
I feel uncomfortable
once I get on a boat.

356
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Me too.

357
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,280
During middle school, we had a school
excursion that included rowing boats.

358
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
I vomited as soon as
I got on the boat.

359
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,840
It seems like

360
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,240
we both have motion sickness.

361
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,120
The water by the shore feels
quite chilly, doesn't it?

362
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,960
Why are you laughing so happily?

363
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Come with me.

364
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,520
What's going on?

365
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,400
I thought we were going to do
something else,

366
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,040
turns out that is camping.

367
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,040
Where is him?

368
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,040
It's so remote out here
in the wilderness,

369
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
and it's so dark around.

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
Tongtong,

385
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
I don't want to be in a romantic
relationship with you anymore.

386
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,920
What do you mean by this?

387
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Well,

388
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,840
I believe that in the right time,
you will definitely

389
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
meet the right person.

390
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,840
This world

391
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,720
is full of chaos

392
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,560
and dazzle.

393
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,000
As for me,

394
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,320
I want to explore the
magnificent landscapes and scenery

395
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,360
together with you, hand in hand.

396
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,120
The journey of love is full of destiny,

397
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
and every step is sweet like honey.

398
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,840
Song Yanxu,

399
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,000
Where did you find these cheesy words?

400
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
Lu Entong,

401
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
We won't date anymore.

402
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,200
Let's

403
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,560
get married.

404
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
You seem cold.

405
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Why are you trembling like that?

406
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
Tongtong,

407
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,320
That day on the rooftop of the company,

408
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
you entered my world in such a way.

409
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,600
Every day with you,

410
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,640
I feel an unparalleled happiness.

411
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,560
In my lifetime,

412
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
I have two wishes.

413
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,360
One is to successfully develop Banana 3,

414
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,560
and the other, the most
important one, is to marry you.

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,160
I want to stand by your side
with legitimacy,

416
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,640
and accompany you
throughout our lives.

417
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,920
So,

418
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,520
will you marry me?

419
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,800
I hate you.

420
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Tongtong,

421
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,640
where did I say something wrong
just now?

422
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,440
I've never said these things
to a girl before.

423
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,160
I was just

424
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,800
afraid that I wouldn't say them well.

425
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,600
That's why I hesitated at the beginning.

426
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,840
It's not because of these words.

427
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,960
You should let me prepare properly too,

428
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
since you want to propose.

429
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,040
I haven't prepared anything.

430
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,320
I really hate you right now.

431
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Tongtong,

432
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
You are always the best

433
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
in my heart.

434
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,520
So,

435
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,040
will you marry me?

436
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,640
I...

437
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,160
Yes, I will.

438
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,960
