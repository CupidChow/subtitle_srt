Hello, Lu Entong.

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Let's get straight to the point then.

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
Regarding the fact that you fall asleep

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
whenever you
come into contact with Yanxu,

99
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,280
Dr. Li and I have discussed it too.

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
We unanimously believe that

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
this matter is credible.

102
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,200
So we sincerely invite you

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
to join our treatment plan.

104
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
I accept.

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,440
As long as it can
treat insomnia, I accept anything.

106
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
That's great.

107
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
But,

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
there is one thing.

109
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
We hope you could

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
keep this confidential.

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,000
Understood.

112
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
We can't let the public know

113
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,960
he's suffering from insomnia.

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Is that correct?

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,960
Exactly.

116
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,360
To the public,

117
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,920
We will claim that
you are Yanxu's personal assistant.

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
Regarding the expenses,

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,320
Ms. Lu, don't worry about it.

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
As long as we can cure Yanxu's insomnia,

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
we will definitely
reward you generously.

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,240
It's okay.

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,920
800 thousands
US dollars is quite a sum.

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
800 thousands?

125
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,920
Dr. Li,

126
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,520
is there anything specific
that we need to cooperate with?

127
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
This is a
physiological monitoring wristband.

The first stage of treatment is simple.

129

I need to collect
various data changes in your bodies

131

Just wear this wristband.

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,680
No problem.

133

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Yes.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Thanks.

154
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
Chi Zuo,

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,200
I didn't even know you
were a shareholder of Kerwin Group.

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
You didn't ask me either.

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,800
Then why did you tell me that
the first start-up is very difficult?

158
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,800
The coffee shop
was indeed my first start-up.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
There were hardly any customers.

160
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
Didn't you see that?

161
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,400
I even thought of making
money to invest in you in the future.

162
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Entong.

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,480
Mr. Song finished the meeting.

164
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,760
He asked you to go to his office.

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,320
All right.

166
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Does it look good?

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It looks pretty good.

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,800
Isn't it?

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
Quite sexy, right?

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Go take a shower.

171
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

172
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
We should rest early.

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,240
Take a shower?

174
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
Hello, Chi Zuo?

175
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,840
Tong,

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
are you hungry?

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
Am I...

178
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
Hungry?

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
Let's go for supper.

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,200
I'll pick you up.

181
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,320
It's okay.

182
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm not home right now.

183
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Then,

184
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,240
where are you?

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
Let me pick you up.

186
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm...

187
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Go shower.

188
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,760
Taking shower.

189
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
Taking shower?

190
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,840
Hold on.

191
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm at a spa.

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,920
Let's save the supper for another day.

193
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,440
Talk to you later.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Hey...

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,320
Why are you staring at me?

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Aren't you hot?

197
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,280
I can't sleep, you know.

198
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,200
My immune system is weak.

199
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm afraid of the cold.

200
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm warning you.

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Be well-behaved when sleeping at night.

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,560
Don't steal the blanket.

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,400
Don't snore.

204
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
You're the one snoring, aren't you?

205
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:23,960
Hand.

206
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Dr. Li said

207
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,240
we should hold hands.

208
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Xiao Ke.

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm here.

210
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:39,960
Turn off the lights.

211
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Okay.

212
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,560
Are you asleep?

213
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Song Yanxu.

214
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
Song Yanxu.

215
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
He's asleep.

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
According to
Article 135 of the Employment Agreement,

217
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Party B, Lu Entong,

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
must hold Party A, Song Yanxu's hand

219
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
every night and not let go

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,720
until Party A falls asleep.

221
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
Otherwise, extra
compensation will be imposed.

222
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,120
Understood.

224
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,760
Song Yanxu.

225
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
Did you hear that?

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Hear hat?

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,240
Something is making noise.

228
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
It sounds like there's something.

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,600
Are you serious?

230
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,600
Is your house haunted?

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
No.

232
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
Why don't you go and check?

233
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Hurry.

234
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,280
Xiao Ke.

235
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm here.

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,080
Turn on the lights.

237
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,480
Okay.

238
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,760
Song Yanxu.

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
What's wrong?

240
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,040
There's...

241
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,960
There's a snake.

242
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,960
Song Yanxu.

243
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Why do you have
such a scary thing in your house?

244
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
This is my pet.

245
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,160
Its name is Sweety.

246
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Sweety?

247
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,400
What a disgusting name.

248
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
I like it.

249
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,560
What should I do?

250
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
I'm super afraid of snakes.

251
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,640
Then I'll have Li Che
take it away tomorrow.

252
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,600
He'll help me feed it.

253
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Go back to the room.

254
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,240
And sleep.

255
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,240
No way.

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,640
Then you stay here with Sweety.

257
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
How many times have I said it?

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,720
You guys should keep trying.

259
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Hold your hands.

260
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
Do you know what Dr. Li told me?

261
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,560
He said based on the wristband data,

262
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,880
you didn't sleep at all last night.

263
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,080
Do you know how worried I am?

264
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,760
Anyway,

265
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
both of you must...

266
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,080
Mr. Chi.

267
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
Why did you come?

268
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm looking for...

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Yanxu.

270
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,160
Then...

271
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,000
We'll save this matter

272
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,120
for another day.

273
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:24,880
Then,

274
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,160
I'll leave first.

275
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,600
How about discussing it at my office?

276
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,480
No need.

277
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,840
Here will do.

278
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
There is a cocktail party tonight.

279
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
[Invitation Card]
I would like you to join me.

280
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,400
[Invitation Card]
And I'll introduce you some friends.

281
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,220
[Invitation List]

282
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,080
Sure.

283
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,320
See you.

284
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,760
Hey, rascal.

285
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,560
You usually

286
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,720
avoid cocktail party.

287
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,040
How come

288
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
you suddenly agreed today?

289
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,560
Entong.

290
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
Haven't you finished work yet?

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
This Mr. Song

292
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
suddenly assigned me some documents.

293
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
Then I'll leave first.

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,120
Bye.

295
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,960
Bye.

296
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,800
Entong.

297
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
Come with me.

298
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,720
What's the matter?

299
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,360
Mr. Song is attending
a cocktail party tonight.

300
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,560
He wants you to go along with him.

301
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
What cocktail party is that?

302
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
Why do I have to go?

303
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't know either.

304
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,160
Mr. Song just said so.

305
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,280
You must go.

306
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
What a strange request.

307
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm not going.

308
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Stop talking.

309
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,480
Close your eyes.

310
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,440
Mansu's birthday is coming soon.

311
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
She will accept

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
this gift right?

313
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:23,850
Mansu.

314
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,610
You're here.

315
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,410
Why was
Lu Entong recruited into the company?

316
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,850
Yanxu...

317
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,450
His business is quite busy,

318
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,330
and we need a helper like her.

319
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,210
Need a helper?

320
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,930
But why Lu Entong?

321
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,410
Are you hiding something from me?

322
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,810
How could that be?

323
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,650
Why would I hide anything from you?

324
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,160
Yanxu and I
are a perfect couple in Kerwin.

325
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
We are meant for each other.

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,720
We'll talk about the details later.

327
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,400
Okay.

328
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,760
Yanxu.

329
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,280
My dad is waiting for you.

330
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Go ahead.

331
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm going to meet a friend.

332
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Yanxu is here.

333
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,760
Uncle.

334
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,640
Mr. Xu.

335
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,200
And this is?

336
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,320
Kerwin Group's CEO.

337
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,680
Song Yanxu.

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,360
Hello.

339
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Mr. Song, you're
truly accomplished at such a young age.

340
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,240
You both look like a perfect couple.

341
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,400
A truly fitting match.

342
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,640
Mr. Xu.

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,240
You two talk first.

344
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,320
I'll wait over there for you.

345
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,120
Okay.

346
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,240
Yanxu.

347
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,720
Mansu has been
praising you a lot lately.

348
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Uncle.

349
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,600
Mansu is also outstanding.

350
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760
The two of you...

351
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,560
The two of you are becoming

352
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
more and more compatible.

353
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,720
When you're free,

354
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
come over our house.

355
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,050
Uncle.

356
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,490
Mansu and I are just...

357
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,250
Dad.

358
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,130
Lately,

359
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,370
the company is in
a crucial stage of product development.

360
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,690
There's no rush for
the matter between Yanxu and me.

361
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,250
Okay.

362
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,490
I'll listen to you.

363
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,570
No rush.

364
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,290
No rush, indeed.

365
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,930
You two chat first.

366
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:19,930
I'll go over there.

367
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,810
Yanxu.

368
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,930
Don't you feel like

369
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,970
it's been a long time

370
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,210
since we had a
good conversation like this?

371
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,290
We're meeting at the company every day,

372
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,690
we can talk anytime.

373
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,450
It's not the same.

374
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,250
I still prefer spending time with you

375
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,250
outside of work.

Why did you arrive so late?

382
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,340
Why must you make me come here?

383
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,680
And this agreement doesn't
mention drinking along, right?

Yanxu.

399
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,440
This is Annie.

400
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,560
She's one of the judges of the audition.

401
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,080
This is the friend
I mentioned to you before.

402
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
I know her.

403
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Ms. Annie.

404
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
You've always been my idol.

405
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Nice to meet you.

406
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,040
Lu Entong.

407
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,720
Ms. Annie.

408
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,120
You actually know my name?

409
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,960
Of course.

410
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,880
You're beautiful
and your name sounds nice.

411
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,400
I heard from Yanxu that
you're preparing for the competition

412
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,000
to join the Asian Symphony Orchestra.

413
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,200
It has always been my dream.

414
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,360
I've been working hard for it.

415
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,160
That's great.

416
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,170
Another day,

417
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,770
let Yanxu take you to my studio,

418
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,850
and we can exchange skills together.

419
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,890
Really?

420
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,930
Thank you, Ms. Annie.

421
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,210
I'm so happy.

422
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,810
You two chat.

423
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,050
I'll excuse myself for a moment.

424
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,730
Song Yanxu.

425
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,890
I didn't expect you
to know Annie, the teacher.

426
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,010
Is it strange?

427
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,290
I'm just really happy.

428
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,690
Childish.

429
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,930
What's wrong?

430
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,850
Song Yanxu,

431
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,050
what are you doing?

432
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,250
Why are you
treating other women like this

433
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,450
in front of me?

434
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,690
What I am doing with others

435
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,290
has nothing to do with you.

436
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,850
Then let me ask you,

437
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,130
do you like her?

438
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,850
Stop making a scene, okay?

439
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,290
I'm asking you, do you like her?

440
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,410
Can you stop it?

441
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,090
What are you doing?

442
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,210
What makes her better than me?

443
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,770
Why are you treating me like this?

444
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,650
Why?

445
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,330
Xu Mansu,

446
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,650
It's enough!

447
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,650
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,690
I'm fine.

449
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,650
Anyway,

450
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,050
this dress was paid by you, right?

451
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
If I had foreseen the situation,

452
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
I wouldn't have let you come.

453
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,560
You wanted to help me, right?

454
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,800
I get you.

455
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,440
Xu Mansu and I grew up together.

456
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,480
She was spoiled and overindulged

457
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,200
since childhood.

458
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,720
Actually,

459
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,080
she just likes you too much.

460
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,920
Excessive love can turn into madness.

461
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
It's the same with my passion for music.

462
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
I don't really mean to cling to you.

463
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
I just want to cure my insomnia.

464
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,880
I want to

465
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,640
stand on the stage again.

466
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,400
To me, the stage

467
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,120
is the hope of my life.

468
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
I'll be right back.

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
This is for you.

470
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Keep pursuing your dreams.

471
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Everywhere is a stage.

472
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,520
Song Yanxu.

473
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm asking you, do you like her?

474
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,840
Lu Entong.

475
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,720
I...

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
I think I've really fallen for you.

477
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
Lad.

478
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,120
Lad.

479
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,200
You're all right, are you?

480
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,960
You young folks go on a date and sleep.

481
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
Find another place
instead of staying here.

482
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,800
You've been sitting there motionless.

483
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,440
I thought you were
having a joint suicide or something.

484
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,320
Go home and get some sleep immediately.

485
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,400
All right.

486
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,720
Thank you, auntie.

487
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,640
Well...

488
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,640
Just now...

489
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,640
Just now,

490
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,880
the wind was really strong, wasn't it?

491
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,200
I...

492
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,880
Hey, Doctor Li.

493
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,280
Yanxu.

494
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
Did you just fall asleep?

495
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,840
True.

496
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
How did you know?

497
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
The wristband I
gave you wasn't just for show.

498
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,720
Did you discover anything?

499
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Just before you entered the sleep state,

500
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,120
the data showed

501
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,320
a significant anomaly in the levels of

502
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,960
phenethylamine in your bodies.

503
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,440
Phenethylamine

504
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,120
Phenethylamine is a neurotransmitter

505
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,240
that only increases when
ambiguity and excitement occur.

506
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,040
Therefore,

507
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,520
were you two...

508
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,640
It was an excitement.

509
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,880
Could it be

510
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,280
because of the kiss?

511
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,280
No way.

512
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,520
Tong.

513
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,680
What is your
relationship with Song Yanxu?

514
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,280
Is it too aggressive?

515
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,760
It will definitely scare her.

516
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,920
What is your
relationship with Song Yanxu?

517
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,720
That's not the way either.

518
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,120
Tong,

519
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,000
I saw you walking with Yanxu yesterday.

520
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,560
You two are
actually dating, aren't you?

521
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,880
What are you doing?

522
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,200
Nothing.

523
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
You like Lu Entong?

524
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,280
I've already seen
the new data from Banana 3.

525
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,080
There were a vast of
sleep-aid technology factors in it.

526
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,600
They impose significant
side effects on the human body.

527
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Does the R&D
department provide any new solutions?

528
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
The R&D department suggests

529
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,240
adding nutrients

530
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,480
without reducing
the sleep-aid technology factors

531
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,400
to neutralise
their harm to the human body.

532
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,240
That sounds work.

533
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,800
But...

534
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,200
The only professor

535
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,880
who has fused two factors together,
Professor Zheng, has already retired.

536
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,320
The company has
tried to invite him several times,

537
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,480
but he has rejected all the offers.

538
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,600
The possibility
of collaboration is slim.

539
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,680
But...

540
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,440
Yes?

541
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
The board of directors said that

542
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,840
they will terminate Banana 3

543
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,880
if Professor Zheng

544
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,120
doesn't participate.

545
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,000
These people know only these means.

546
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Send me Professor Zheng's detailed
information before you leave work.

547
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,040
I will invite him on myself.

548
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,400
All right.

549
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Come to the terrace.

550
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,400
I need to talk to you.

551
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,800
You asked for see me?

552
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,080
You're here.

553
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,600
Why is your face blushing?

554
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,520
Because...

555
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,760
Because of the wind, I guess.

556
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,840
The wind is indeed strong.

557
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,920
Yes.

558
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,080
What's the matter?

559
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,040
Well...

560
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,520
We fell asleep

561
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,960
together yesterday.

562
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,040
True.

563
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,040
So...

564
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
Regarding falling asleep,

565
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,680
don't you think
we should study it carefully?

566
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,320
Yes, we should study it carefully.

567
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,200
So, let's begin.

568
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,840
