00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
and the rate of melatonin secretion
begins to increase gradually.

174
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
Starting yesterday,

175
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,720
the data starts to show
crossover changes.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,720
It starts...

177
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,440
converting phenylethylamine-contact
to contact sleep.

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
If this goes on...

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
If this goes on,

180
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,920
not only the two people
can easily fall asleep,

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
the length of sleep will also increase.

182
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,440
That is right.

183
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
That also means...

184
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
hypersomnia.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,960
How did it go?

186
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Did you meet Mr. Zheng?

187
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
Yes.

188
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,560
We met.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Did Mr. Zheng say yes
to the cooperation?

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,640
He said...

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,920
he would say yes after Yanxu...

192
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,280
wins a competition.

193
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,280
A competition?

194
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
What competition?

195
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,460
[Registration form for Guangming Street Square Dance Competition]

196
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Mr. Zheng.

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,920
Are you sure about this competition?

198
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
This is too...

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,920
Too?

200
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
What do you want to say?

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
I won't compete.

202
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
You won't?

203
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,400
That is fine.

204
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Forget about...

205
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,160
our cooperation.

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,640
Mr. Zheng.

207
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Your request is too...

208
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,080
Mr. Zheng.

209
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,040
Let us discuss.

210
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
Why don't you just give in?

211
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
It's just square dancing.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
What are you saying?

213
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm the CEO of Kerwin.

214
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
Square dancing?

215
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,520
He obviously wants to make it difficult
for me.

216
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
I won't go even if you hit me to death.

217
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
Are you going or not?

218
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,160
No.

219
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
Mr. Zheng.

220
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
Is there no other choice?

221
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,920
Sure.

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,000
If this is the case,

223
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
forget about the cooperation.

224
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,480
Mr. Zheng is a psychopath.

225
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,040
Mr. Song hits a snag.

226
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,200
So.

227
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,680
Did Mr. Song say yes in the end?

228
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Yes.

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Aren't you...

230
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,240
looking forward to see Mr. Song's...

231
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,200
square dancing?

232
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,520
Just...

233
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
a bit.

234
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Me too.

235
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,040
You...

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
We...

237
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,640
The truth is,

238
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm also intrigued.

239
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,600
Mr. Zheng is your senior?

240
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes.

241
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,880
And...

242
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,240
I consulted him
with the insomnia symptom of you...

243
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,320
and Entong before.

244
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
That is why he knows
about me and Entong.

245
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Mr. Zheng.

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,640
Is there no other choice?

247
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,800
Fine.

248
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,840
Forget about the cooperation then.

249
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Also.

250
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,000
Your...

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,400
experiment of contact sleep disorder.

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,400
I also have no need to participate.

253
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,720
But Mr. Zheng seems old enough...

254
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,200
to be your mentor.

255
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,840
Why is he your senior?

256
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
He is my mentor.

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,320
But he usually loves to pretend
to be young.

258
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
I call him senior in public.

259
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,080
Then,

260
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
could you...

261
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
No.

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
I never...

263
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,720
interfere with others' decisions.

264
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
If you ask me,

265
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,640
you should do as what he requests.

266
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,160
If he refuses to join,

267
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,600
not only we have to suspend Banana 3...

268
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,280
but also the treatment
of your sleep disorder.

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,480
Suspend it then.

270
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
Stop.

271
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
Sorry, ladies.

272
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
Your movements were too fast
for me to see clearly.

273
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,440
We weren't fast.

274
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,000
This...

275
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,960
one, two, three, four.

276
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,280
How to twist the foot over here?

277
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,920
All right.

278
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
I'll dance again. Watch closely.

279
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,680
One, two, three, four.

280
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,920
I see.

281
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Cha cha cha.

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,600
Not bad.

283
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,680
What are you watching?

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,280
You're crazy.

285
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,440
Mr. Song will punish you to clean
the washrooms for a month...

286
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,160
if he knows you peep at him
square dancing.

287
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
It'll be more than that.

288
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,520
We'll have to depart for Africa.

289
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,120
Only heaven, earth and us know.

290
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
You don't tell him will do.

291
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,440
Let's watch together.

292
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,560
You...

293
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm not interested.

294
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,760
Why do you come back?

295
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,720
It's doesn't hurt to watch.

296
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,800
Mr. Song's dance posture.

297
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,280
Superb.

298
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
With you in the team,

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,200
there won't be a problem for us...

300
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,560
to win the street champion...

301
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
in the dance competition.

302
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,400
You're certainly young.

303
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,680
You learn faster than us.

304
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
Yes.

305
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,120
You're so handsome.

306
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,800
It's pleasant to our eyes.

307
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,080
Boy.

308
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
Where do you work at?

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,200
Do you have a girlfriend?

310
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
Let me introduce you a girlfriend.

311
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Yes.

312
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,200
Let me introduce one.

313
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,280
Ladies.

314
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,560
My girlfriend is here.

315
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
I should get going.

316
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,920
Why?

317
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,800
Do they want to introduce you
a girlfriend?

318
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,040
Why?

319
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,760
Do you still tease me
when I work so hard?

320
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,840
Do you want me to prove to them...

321
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
that you're my girlfriend?

322
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
No.

323
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,480
Entong.

324
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
Mr. Song.

325
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
How did you go with the square dancing?

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
You don't have to ask.

327
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,520
Mr. Song is the best
no matter what he does.

328
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
The ending movement in particular.

329
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
Cha cha cha.

330
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
That was super cool.

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
Didn't I warn you...

332
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,720
not to watch me dancing?

333
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
No bonus next month.

334
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,920
Mr. Song.

335
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll remove the scene
in my brain at once.

336
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,920
Mr. Song.

337
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,760
Mr. Song, you walk fast.

338
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,480
See?

339
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,880
He is doomed.

340
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
Why hasn't he come out
when the time is almost up?

341
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,240
Mr. Zheng.

342
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,800
You're quite fashionable.

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,080
Of course.

344
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm old with a young heart.

345
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,720
Where is Song Yanxu?

346
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,960
He is already at the competition venue.

347
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
I purposely come to pick you up.

348
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
We're running late.

349
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,960
Let's go.

350
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,800
Okay.

351
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,680
Mr. Zheng.

352
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,680
We've arrived.

353
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,240
Hold on.

354
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,200
Where have we arrived?

355
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,320
Venue of the square dance competition.

356
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,240
Square dance competition?

357
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,680
The application form
given to us the other day.

358
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,520
Square dance competition.

359
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,080
Oh no!

360
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
That was my wife's application form.

361
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
No wonder she couldn't find it.

362
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,040
Wait a second.

363
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Mr. Zheng.

364
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,800
You gave the application form
to us the other day.

365
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
You can't go back on your words.

366
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,840
I...

367
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,560
Why didn't you ask?

368
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,080
I won't...

369
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,840
let you join a square dance competition.

370
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,800
You usually look strange.

371
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,120
It's not surprising to be
a square dance competition.

372
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,280
What are you babbling?

373
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Listen.

374
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
The competition doesn't count.

375
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Then...

376
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,520
Can we still make it to the competition
you're talking about?

377
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,080
It's a minor competition.

378
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
Forget it then.

379
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,040
Moreover,

380
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,280
you didn't even apply to join.

381
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,720
What can you do over there?

382
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,760
Hurry and find Song.

383
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,800
Check on him.

384
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,800
Okay.

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,560
This way.

386
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:09,660
[Guangming Street Square Dance Competition]

387
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
Let's have Team 2.

388
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,160
So?

389
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,160
How did I dance?

390
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,440
You try to be smart.

391
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,720
What do you mean?

392
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
Mr. Zheng...

393
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,120
didn't mean for us to join
this square dance competition.

394
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,000
What?

395
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,040
Come with me.

396
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,960
Mr. Zheng.

397
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,960
I don't care.

398
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,920
We won the square dance competition.

399
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
You should work with us.

400
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
No.

401
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,960
I didn't mean for you
to join that competition.

402
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,800
It doesn't count.

403
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,680
What competition did you mean
for us to join?

404
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,880
Even if I fail...

405
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,800
I have to take a bold step.

406
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
Amateur hobby.

407
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Does cross-dressing count?

408
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,040
Am I right?

409
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
Log in.

410
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,440
Mr. Zheng.

411
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,280
Are you sure you want to compete this?

412
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,680
Why?

413
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,960
Do you look down on me?

414
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,840
I'm a 50-star King of Honour.

415
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,240
Mr. Zheng.

416
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,040
It seems that we really know
too little about you.

417
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,320
How about this?

418
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,400
I give you a chance.

419
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Who is good at it?

420
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,120
Fight me in a game.

421
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,600
One game to decide the winner.

422
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,720
Sure.

423
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,600
I'll fight you.

424
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,200
Log in.

425
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Tongtong.

426
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
Do you know what 50-star is?

427
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,720
Yes.

428
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,800
Bring it on.

429
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,040
Not bad.

430
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,760
I'll put out your fire.

431
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,320
You're surprised, right?

432
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,240
You sneak up on me.

433
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,760
What do you think, girl?

434
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I beat you, right?

435
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
My ultimate skill is ready.

436
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,880
Steady.

437
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
I can win this.

438
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,440
Gentlemen.

439
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Mr. Song is back.

440
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,480
Mr. Song.

441
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
Why do you come back alone?

442
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,080
Where is Mr. Zheng?

443
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Ten minutes ago,

444
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,360
Mr. Zheng signed the letter of intent...

445
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,000
and officially joined
the development of Banana 3.

446
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,920
The agreement details
have been sent to you.

447
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,320
Since we've convinced Mr. Zheng,

448
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,200
please continue to support Banana 3.

449
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,640
Congratulations, Mr. Song.

450
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay. Thank you for this matter.

451
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,720
Yanxu.

452
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
What brings you here?

453
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,120
I heard your successful signing
with Mr. Zheng.

454
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
I deliberately come to congratulate you.

455
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,240
What do you think?

456
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,880
Do you like it?

457
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,720
It's beautiful.

458
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But I don't like this in my office.

459
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,760
Take it back.

460
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Ms. Xu.

461
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,280
Please pass my message.

462
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,320
No one is allowed to enter...

463
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
my office next time when I'm away.

464
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,480
Sure,

465
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,560
Mr. Song.

466
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Cheers for King Entong.

467
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,320
Cheers.

468
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,760
Too bad.

469
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,160
Mr. Zheng didn't mean...

470
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,800
for the square dancing.

471
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
You sound...

472
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,480
quite disappointed.

473
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,040
No.

474
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,640
I just feel sorry for it.

475
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,320
Mr. Song won the champion for nothing.

476
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I didn't expect...

477
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,360
you to be so good in game.

478
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,640
You even beat the 50-star Mr. Zheng.

479
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,520
I played it when I couldn't sleep.

480
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
I got the hang of it after that.

481
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
I didn't expect it
to come in handy today.

482
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,040
Whatever it is,

483
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,640
you solved a big problem
of Kerwin today.

484
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,040
You're a great contributor of Kerwin.

485
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,680
Not really.

486
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm just slightly better than Mr. Song.

487
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,880
It's more than that.

488
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,080
Let's eat.

489
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,520
What do you think romance is?

490
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
I think...

491
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
romance...

492
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,920
is being able to play...

493
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,920
and joke...

494
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,080
with someone you like.

495
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
A joyful couple.

496
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,080
Entong.

497
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,080
What do you think?

498
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Me?

499
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,160
Hello.

500
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
Give me a glass of whisky.

501
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,960
Mansu?

502
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,320
Why are you here?

503
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,520
Why do you drink so much?

504
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
What is the matter?

505
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
He only has Lu Entong in mind.

506
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,920
I don't understand.

507
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
How am I not as good as her?

508
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,840
Mansu.

509
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
Stop drinking.

510
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,640
Listen to me.

511
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
I know you like Yanxu.

512
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,960
Just like I like Xiaotong.

513
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,080
No matter how sad you are,

514
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,560
you shouldn't torture yourself.

515
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
You know what, Chi Zuo?

516
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm not convinced.

517
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,080
I never lost since childhood.

518
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
Why did I lose to Lu Entong?
