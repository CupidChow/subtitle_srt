00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,440
Uncle, auntie.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
Uncle.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,840
Hello, auntie.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,840
What a fine-looking young man.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Your uncle and Tongtong

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,920
compliment you every day in front of me.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
Oh, I've had enough.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,200
I finally get to meet you today.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
Don't listen to her.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
When did I compliment him?

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
Uncle, auntie,

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
my father hasn't arrived.

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm sorry about it.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,920
It's no big deal.
The road is now a bit congested.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
Actually,

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
my father had a room reserved upstairs.

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Let's up first.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,520
Okay.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Let's go.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go.

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Song.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,520
It's just a meal together.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,680
Isn't this

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
too much?

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,720
Uncle, auntie,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is what we should do.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,320
Well,

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
I'll give my father a call first.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,040
Sure.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,480
Don't be anxious.

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,240
What happened？

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
My father is not picking up his phone.

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,160
How about calling his driver?

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
No answer either.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Could something have happened?

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
Uncle, auntie,

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
I can't contact my father.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Ma'am and Sir,

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,160
Mr Song who reserved this room
just sent a message

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,760
saying he had a last-minute
holiday trip with his friends.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
Please, suit yourself.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
What?

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
What is the meaning of this?

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,680
What's going on?

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Yanxu.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,080
Parents from both sides are
supposed to be meeting today.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,200
We also came after preparation.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,000
But your father failed to show up.
And that's fine.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
But his perfunctory attitude

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
just went overboard.

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
He went overboard.

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Mom.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
What's more to say?

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,760
It's obvious they looked down on us.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,280
Let's go.

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Uncle, auntie.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,880
There must be some misunderstanding.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Go home.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
Dad, mom, don't go first.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Don't go first.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,320
Uncle, auntie.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Why didn't you show up?

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
Because I want to enjoy my holiday.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Holiday?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Why didn't you say so when I
discussed the time with you?

81
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
You deliberately chose this time.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,680
You did it purposely.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Is this what you mean by a discussion?

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,200
This is merely informing me.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
Have you thought of me as your father?

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
Even if you're mad,

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,400
you can't just

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,400
pull out last minute
from an appointment.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
What would her parents think?

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
What would they think?

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
A golden goose son-in-law
just ran away.

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,040
What do you mean?

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,560
You knew she approached you for money.

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
And you still want to marry her?

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
Are you nuts?

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Why is this agreement here with you?

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
It's none of your concern.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
You should speak first.

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
What is this all about?

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,400
You still want this kind
of woman as your wife?

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Have you gone nuts?

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,760
We

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,600
are nothing like what you think.

105
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,120
This agreement,
it's for us to cure sickness.

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
You two are definitely sick.

107
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,960
Fine.

108
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
You and your uncle are the same,

109
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,480
thinking that I can easily be
bluffed because of my age

110
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
by those tricks of yours?

111
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
All this written down in black and white.

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
The number of sleeps
writes off the debt.

113
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,400
Is this not a sleep-with agreement?

114
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
I warn you,

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
I will never let that woman enter the
door of my Song family household

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,160
unless I die.

117
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm being kind for not
going to dinner today.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm telling you,

119
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
you should break up with her.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
Otherwise, don't blame me
for going overboard.

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,120
Dad, mom.

122
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,040
Are you still mad?

123
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Tongtong.

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
You saw his father's attitude.

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
Getting married or engagement
is not about you alone.

126
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
How can we not worry about you

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,320
for this kind of family?

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,520
Mom.

129
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
What if his father really has
urgent things to take care of?

130
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,960
What is so urgent?

131
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,200
He broke his promise at the
time we promised.

132
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,720
Isn't this clear enough for us?

133
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,880
He's telling us that we are not fit.

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
Who cares?

135
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
He wants to bully my daughter?

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,080
It's not happening.

137
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
Dad.

138
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,200
You can't blame Yanxu

139
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,560
for his father's attitude.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
Yanxu is good to me.

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Moreover,

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,360
the relationship between Yanxu
and his father has been tense.

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,400
We may not be the reason of why
his father didn't come.

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
Tongtong.

145
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I want to tell you,

146
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,280
you're now at the stage of dating.

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Everything in front of
you look wonderful.

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,360
When you get married,

149
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,760
small issues at home

150
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,560
will trouble you more.

151
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,680
With that father of his,

152
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,320
how are we going to be at ease?

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,600
And if Yanxu

154
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,840
can't handle this situation,

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,360
how can he protect you?

156
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
I am worried that
you will suffer.

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Father also worries.

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,440
Mom, dad.

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I have thought it through.

160
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,600
I want to be with him.

161
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
What's going on with this child?

162
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
You don't listen to us now?

163
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes.

164
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
It's not that child's mistake.

165
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Is he the only one best for you?

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,160
Did he drug you?

167
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
It's not a drug.

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
It's an antidote.

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,160
We are the one and only antidote

170
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
of each other's.

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,600
See that?

172
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Our daughter is mad.

173
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
You should talk to her.

174
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,400
My blood pressure is rising up.

175
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,920
It's not like that, dad.

176
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,760
Tongtong,

177
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
we were serious about this thing.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,520
Why did you say that?

179
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Mom, I'm telling the truth.

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:12,920
You...

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,360
Will you help me persuade my dad?

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
I tell you what,

183
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,320
this time,
I'm standing on your dad's side.

184
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,720
It's late. You're not allowed
to see Song Yanxu.

185
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
Stay at home and be a good girl.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Mom.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,600
What are all these?

188
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,600
Yanxu.

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Why are you so late?

190
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,880
Your father just left.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
What are you drinking?

192
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,880
I'll take it for you.

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Chen.

194
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
The signed agreement with Lu Entong,

195
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
is it here with you?

196
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
Of course.

197
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Speak.

198
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
Why did you give it to my father?

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
That time,

200
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,440
your father was rushing

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
over here for the
information of Lu Entong.

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,560
Saying what you two
are getting married.

203
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,800
I was panicked and gave it to him.

204
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,160
I didn't know the agreement
was kept in there.

205
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
Why didn't you say earlier?

206
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
Your father warned me about
it before he left.

207
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
I must keep this from you.

208
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,440
You know your father.

209
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,000
What can I do?

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,160
You are great.

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,360
I treat you as my brother.

212
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
And you're playing spies with me.

213
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,520
Do you have any idea how
awkward it was for me?

214
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,720
First,

215
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm your uncle.

216
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,360
Second,

217
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
do you really see me as your brother?

218
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
Then why do I know nothing about

219
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,280
you marrying Lu Entong?

220
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,800
One last thing,

221
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
it's my fault this time.

222
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,120
I guarantee,

223
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,240
next time,

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,080
I'll side with you next time.

225
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Okay?

226
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,360
Yanxu.

227
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Don't go.

228
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Don't quarrel with your father.

229
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,560
Ever since your mother left,

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
he has been all alone.

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Poor thing.

232
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,000
Is he pathetic?

233
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
He looks happy every day.

234
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
Help me bring a word to him.

235
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Don't meddle in my business

236
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
in the future.

237
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
What's with this?

238
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,380
[Song Yanxu]

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Hey.

240
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Tongtong.

241
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,920
Are uncle and auntie asleep?

242
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
Already slept in.

243
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Come to the window and look down.

244
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
What is it?

245
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,800
Why did you come?

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
I apologise to you all for my father.

247
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Silly, it's not for you to blame.

248
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
I just want to know

249
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
why uncle couldn't come.

250
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,280
Well, he

251
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
saw the agreement we signed
previously from Chen.

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,800
He misunderstood...

253
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Misunderstood

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,120
that I stay with you for money?

255
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
It's me to blame.

256
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,520
We rarely talk.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
He misunderstood again this time.

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,160
And made uncle and auntie mad.

259
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,120
It's alright. We can explain and
clear the misunderstanding.

260
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I was also mad when I
first saw that agreement.

261
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,240
Don't know what were you thinking.

262
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,680
Why it's all coming for me now?

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
Alright.

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,560
Since it's a misunderstanding,

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,480
I'll talk to my parents tomorrow.

266
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,240
After that, we can explain it to
your father. What do you think?

267
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,360
Tongtong.

268
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Yes?

269
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,920
I don't want to watch
you from faraway anymore.

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
After this matter is solved,

271
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
I'll marry you and bring you back home.

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll linger around you 24 hours a day.

273
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
How clingy you are.

274
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
Are you still the
Song Yanxu that I know?

275
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Have you heard what I say?

276
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,480
After this matter is solved,
I'll marry you and bring you back home.

277
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,480
Alright...

278
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,160
What alright?

279
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm saying...

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,680
Have you heard it or not?

281
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm suddenly losing signal,
can't hear you clear.

282
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,280
I said after this matter is solved...

283
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
I heard it...

284
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't be so loud.

285
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm going to hang up the phone.

286
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
I want to sleep now. Bye bye.

287
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,320
Tongtong.

288
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Time to wake up.

289
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,200
Eat some fruits.

290
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,840
How old are you?

291
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,520
Still playing hunger strike
like you're a kid.

292
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,280
I don't care.

293
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,720
If you don't let me and
Song Yanxu be together,

294
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,880
I'll starve myself.

295
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,600
It's not that we don't like him,

296
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,880
we're afraid you will suffer
after you got married.

297
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,880
Mom, I know.

298
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,400
But I really like him very much.

299
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,880
He's very good to me.

300
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,480
Can you both listen to his explanation?

301
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
Tongtong.

302
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,800
I can see clearer than you.

303
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,520
Compared to that Song Yanxu,

304
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
Chi Zuo is good to you too.

305
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,560
And you both have known
each other for long.

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,520
Why don't you consider Chi Zuo?

307
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,680
Mom.

308
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,720
I already told you.

309
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,560
Chi Zuo and I are just friends.

310
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay.

311
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
We can't meddle in

312
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
the matters of young people.

313
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Your father and I have
thought about it.

314
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,600
Time is different nowadays.

315
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,240
Since you both young people

316
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
think that it's good,

317
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
then find a day,

318
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,160
ask Yanxu to come over for a meal.

319
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,760
Really?

320
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Mom.

321
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,480
You're not mad at Yanxu?

322
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
Eat some fruits.

323
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,080
Mom, I love you.

324
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,480
Why did you bring so many things?

325
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
It's not enough for me.

326
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,960
You're quite mature.

327
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,800
Mom, see who's here.

328
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,600
Auntie.

329
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,080
That's early.

330
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,600
There's a saying.

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,480
A good meal should be eaten early.

332
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,760
Lu Huaichuan.

333
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
It's your parcel.

334
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
Coming.

335
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,400
Lu, come downstairs for a while.

336
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm going to get the parcel.

337
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay.

338
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,240
Uncle.

339
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,480
My father had something
to attend to last night.

340
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,680
He couldn't come as he promised,

341
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
and had you and auntie
wasted your time.

342
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
I apologise to you both for him.

343
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,880
That's alright.

344
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Since you're here,

345
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,920
come sit down.

346
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Go.

347
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,840
Lu,

348
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
what did you buy this time?

349
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Nothing.

350
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Well?

351
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,300
[Agreement]

352
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
What is it?

353
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,480
Dad.

354
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,720
What's wrong?

355
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,680
Song Yanxu.

356
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Uncle.

357
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
What do you mean?

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
You dare to ask my daughter to sleep
with you? To sleep with you...

359
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,960
Who do you think you are?

360
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,360
Dad, it's not like what you think.

361
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,880
I can explain this agreement.

362
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,760
Song Yanxu.

363
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,680
I have been saying good things for you.

364
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,120
I never thought you are
this kind of people.

365
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,960
Uncle, auntie.

366
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,720
Please listen to me.

367
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,760
What's more to listen?

368
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,480
Get lost.

369
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
I said get lost at this instant.

370
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Mom, dad.

371
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,840
There's a reason why
I signed this agreement.

372
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,400
We're simply just sleeping.

373
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
It's not like what you think.

374
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Well.

375
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,120
Simply just sleeping?

376
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,080
Bullshit.

377
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
You think your mother and I are fools?

378
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,000
Tongtong.

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Why did you sign that agreement?

380
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Just wait for her made-up stories.

381
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
Are you trying to tell us

382
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,320
you two can't live without each other

383
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,560
and must stay together no matter what?

384
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,840
That's right.

385
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Dad.

386
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,560
Most of what you say is true.

387
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,200
I was worried that
you wouldn't believe it.

388
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,880
So this is actually how it started.

389
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Both of us

390
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
have serious insomnia.

391
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,080
We found out by chance that

392
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
we can fall asleep together
just by a touch.

393
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,760
As for the agreement,

394
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,920
it's because when I first met him,

395
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
I broke his drawing.

396
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
In order to pay him back,

397
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
more for curing sickness,

398
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,080
I decided to sign it.

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,800
See that?

400
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,080
This is the good daughter you educate.

401
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,360
First, sleep with a man for money.

402
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,800
Now, making up absurd
stories to get us fooled.

403
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,760
Lu Entong.

404
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm very disappointed in you.

405
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,040
Dad.

406
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
I didn't lie.

407
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,480
If you can't believe me,
you can go and check.

408
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,720
There's still a lot of
sleeping pills in my bedroom.

409
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Hold it.

410
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,400
From now on,

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,120
you're not allowed to see Song Yanxu.

412
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,400
Stay at home, you're going nowhere.

413
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,720
Admit that you're wrong,

414
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
cut ties with that Song guy,

415
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
that's when you can
walk out of this door.

416
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,320
Mom.

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,280
I didn't lie to you both.

418
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,880
I was telling the truth.

419
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,360
Tongtong.

420
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Those reasons that you've said,

421
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
even I think that it's absurd.

422
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,920
The money you owed him,

423
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,440
your father and I will think of
a way to pay him back shortly.

424
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,160
Stay at home and be good.

425
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,200
Don't go anywhere.

426
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,960
Mom.

427
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
President Song, are you alright?

428
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Professor Li just called and

429
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,960
asked for you and Lu Entong to

430
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
visit the lab tomorrow afternoon.

431
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
What are you doing?

432
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,620
[Song Yanxu]

433
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,720
Tongtong.

434
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
How are uncle and auntie now?

435
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,600
I told them the truth.

436
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,760
But they didn't believe me.

437
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
That agreement

438
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,160
must be sent by my father.

439
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,920
I think

440
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,160
we're too careless.

441
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,280
We should've explained it clearly
to uncle first.

442
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,600
Now it's bad.

443
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,800
Both families are in
an awkward position.

444
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,920
Wait after some time when
uncle and auntie cool down,

445
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,720
I'll bring Professor Li along

446
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,400
to explain it to them.

447
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,040
Okay.

448
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Well,

449
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,240
seems like tonight is
another sleepless night.

450
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,480
I'll keep you company.

451
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
Alright.

452
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,200
You know what?

453
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm grounded by my parents
from going out.

454
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,760
I'm not allowed to go anywhere.

455
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,760
Professor Li just asked
to see us tomorrow.

456
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay.

457
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
If that's the case,

458
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,720
I'll think about a way.

459
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,560
Dad.

460
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Mom.

461
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,160
Lu Entong.

462
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
Where are you going?

463
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
I...

464
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm a bit hungry.

465
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm going to buy breakfast.

466
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
Oh.

467
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,240
Just the right time.

468
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,200
Sit down.

469
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,880
I have made you breakfast.

470
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,320
Don't think of playing tricks.

471
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
Our daughter.

472
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,880
Who knows what kind of drug

473
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
did that Song guy give her.

474
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
See how she's brainwashed by him.

475
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,120
In the dramas I watched recently,

476
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,480
many bad guys will do gas lighting on young girls.

477
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,360
It's scary.

478
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Must stay clear-headed.

479
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
Tongtong.

480
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,840
Don't eat too much

481
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,280
outside food.

482
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,760
Okay.

483
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
Hello, senior.

484
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,920
For the contact-to-sleep case
you told me last time,

485
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,920
did any sign of drowsiness
happen afterwards?

486
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,920
Yes.

487
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
And they even have their
dreams overlapped.

488
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,280
You are saying

489
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,600
their dreams overlapped?

490
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,240
Yes.

491
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
Yanxu and Entong's condition is
considered as a special case.

492
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
You must observe with attention.

493
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,320
Got it.

494
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,280
I'll hang up first. Bye.

495
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Bye.

496
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Professor Li.

497
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,800
You're here.

498
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,280
Have a seat.

499
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,800
Why are you here alone?

500
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
Entong has something to do.

501
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
You can ask me anything.

502
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,480
It's easier for me to solve
some tricky questions

503
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,560
if you two came together.

504
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
Something came up lately.

505
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
We are rarely together.

506
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Did anything unusual happen

507
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,200
in the most recent contact?

508
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
There's nothing unusual lately.

509
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
It's just that sometimes
when we get in contact,

510
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
there's a feeling of dizziness.

511
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
