00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,520
There they are, over there.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,640
We found them.

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,800
Have we been sleeping for a long time?

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
You two lost contact
since the night before.

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,920
Your parents sought help from the hotel.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,760
With the assistance
of the police officers,

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
they were able to locate your
mobile phone signal's position

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,360
and find you.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
So, in other words,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,960
we slept for over thirty hours?

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,760
Yes.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Why don't you

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
tidy up?

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,920
We'll be waiting for you at the exit,

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
and take you back later.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,920

Sister,

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
what's going on?

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,440
Don't worry, I'm looking into it.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
What's the matter?

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,000
What happened?

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
It's Dr. Li.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,520
Hello, Dr.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Song Yanxu,

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
what's the situation there?

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,240
We had

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
a little accident here.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
I asked you to go for a break,

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
not to sacrifice yourselves.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
We didn't expect it either.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
As soon as we touched each other, it...

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
How do you both feel now?

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,320
Is there any discomfort?

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,320
We're okay.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
Come to my lab tomorrow.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,760
Keep some distance from each other
on the way.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,640
I'll talk to him for a moment.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
He hung up.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,320
What did the Dr. say?

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
The Dr. said

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,880
we should try to maintain distance.

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
No way.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
Not coming to the company either.

have called you?

78

It's all my fault.

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,240
I wanted them to go out and relax

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
for the next stage
of hypnosis experiment.

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I didn't expect...

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Wait a moment.

83
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Right.

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Last time, I used hypnosis
for their treatment,

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
but there were some issues
in the process.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,520
Then I suggested they go out
for a walk,

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
and now this happened.

89
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,400

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920

had worsened.

of treatment.

All right.

96

I have something else to do.

97
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
I'll go and take care of it.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600

about Yanxu's matter,

103
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
just let him make his own decision.

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,560
What do you think?

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Can I really not intervene?

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
You're managing it well,

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
making him sign that
co-sleeping agreement.

108
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Why didn't you sign it yourself?

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
You old man, why are you
saying such things?

110
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
Well, if I signed it, would he agree?

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
Brother Chen, Dad.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,120
Do you still consider me your
dad in your heart?

113
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,600
Yanxu, come, sit down.

114
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,520
Well.

115
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,320
Haven't we, the three brothers,
been like this for a long time?

116
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Who are the three brothers with you?

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,440
Dad,

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,080
I have something to tell you.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,920
First, let me ask you where you've
been these past few days.

120
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
You've neglected the company.

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
I have something important to handle.

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Okay,

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
what is it?

124
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Something more important than
the company?

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Marriage proposal.

126
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
Mom, have some fruit.

127
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
Dad, have some fruit.

128
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,920
You're such a good dad.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,520
Let's not be angry anymore, okay?

130
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't be angry.

131
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
Dad isn't angry.

132
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,440
You were unconscious for over 30 hours.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,320
Do you know how worried I was about you?

134
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,240
I know.

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
I promise, from now on,

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll keep in close contact
with you at all times,

137
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,720
okay?

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,400
Now, you're having insomnia

139
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,520
when you're not together,

140
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,240
and having hypersomnia
when you are together.

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,320
It worries me and your dad.

142
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,080
Mom.

143
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
Yanxu's company is

144
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
the most proficient company
in China for treating insomnia.

145
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
Moreover, this researcher

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,760
has already been studying methods
to control sleep duration.

147
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
Things will get better.

148
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Dad, please stop crying.

149
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,240
We will get better.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Ugly or not?

151
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Not ugly.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Say it again?

153
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,520
I want to marry Lu Entong.

154
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,720
Darn thing!

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Hey, brother.

156
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Brother.

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Why are you getting mad at the child?

158
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Song Chen, don't stop me.

159
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm have to wake him up today.

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,360
Who gave you the right
to control me?

161
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,120
Have you ever taken care of me
from childhood to now?

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,320
What kind of good father
are you pretending to be?

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
Song Yanxu, how dare you speak
to your dad like that?

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Song Yanxu,

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,320
that co-sleeping agreement of yours...

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,400
Brother.

167
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,360
What responsible adult would do
such a thing?

168
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
You have the nerve to argue
with me here.

169
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
You never even asked me why I
signed that agreement.

170

What skills do you have?

342
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Tell me about them.

343
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,200
I have won

344
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
the city-wide championship

345
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
in the cello competition

346
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,520
for ten consecutive years in primary,
middle, and high school.

347
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,200
Also, a second prize in the
provincial calligraphy competition.

348
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,440
During my school years,

349
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,320
I was also a recipient of the
Outstanding Student Scholarship.

350
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,960
I ranked among the top 80
in the provincial Go competition.

351
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,760
Besides...

352
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,000
Being in the top 80

353
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,200
is great?

354
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
There are out of tens of thousands
of participants in that competition

355
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,000
I am quite impressive, you know.

356
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Do you still play now?

357
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
Of course!

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Checkmate.

359
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
Uncle,

360
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I mentioned that I can play weiqi,

361
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
but I didn't say anything
about playing Chinese Chess.

362
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,960
You excel in weiqi,

363
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,320
while I excel in Chinese Chess,

364
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,320
you could say we're

365
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,800
worthy opponents in
our respective games.

366
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,320
How can you call this a worthy opponent?

367
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
You're clearly just "Versailles".

368
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,560
What does that mean?

369
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Never mind, Uncle Song.

370
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,120
Haven't you taught others
how to play chess like this before?

371
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,200
Dad.

372
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,240
I don't want to play chess.

373
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
I want to play weiqi.

374
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
Xiaoxu,

375
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,600
although chess has only 32 pieces,

376
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,640
each one

377
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
has its own unique abilities.

378
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,640
The strategies of attack

379
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,560
and defense

380
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,720
are constantly changing,

381
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
with endless mysteries to explore.

382
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,320
It's a lot of fun.

383
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,200
If Xiaoxu wants to play weiqi,
just play with him.

384
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,720
Why insist on playing this?

385
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Nonsense.

386
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,560
My son hasn't experienced
the charm of chess yet.

387
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,960
Come, Xiaoxu,

388
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,080
let's play another game with Dad.

389
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Come over here, Xiaoxu.

390
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Let's ignore Dad.

391
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,840
Mom will play weiqi with you, okay?

392
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,560
Okay.

393
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Come,

394
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
let's play another game.

395
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,120
Great.

396
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,620
[Hospital Ward]

397
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,360
Hello, sir.

398
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,520
Where's this patient?

399
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,640
The patient and the caregiver have been
out for a while.

400
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,720
Where did they go?

401
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,000
They should be in the garden.

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,680
Thank you.

403
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,040
Checkmate!

404
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,760
Are you convinced now?

405
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
No moves left, huh?

406
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,360
I think it's because of

407
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,840
my improper placement of the chariot
in this game.

408
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
If I had exchanged my cannon
with your horse,

409
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,360
I would have definitely won.

410
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
Well, then I won't advance my horse,

411
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,840
I'll just move the advisor.

412
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
Well...

413
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,920
Well, I...

414
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,040
A true gentleman plays his
moves without regret.

415
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,440
How many moves have you
regretted so far?

416
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,440
You can't regret anymore.

417
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,040
You just taught me,
and I'm not proficient yet.

418
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
Let's play another round,
and I'm sure I'll win.

419
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,400
Okay?

420
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,120
As you said,

421
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,920
no regrets this time, alright?

422
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,720
Sure.

423
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,280
Nurse.

424
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,240
Hello.

425
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
How has the patient in this bed
been doing these days?

426
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,400
His condition is getting better.

427
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
He'll be able to discharge
in a few days.

428
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,640
Speaking of which,
thanks to this caregiver.

429
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,400
Really?

430
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
This caregiver is really great.

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,440
With her presence,

432
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,720
his complexion has been improving.

433
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Thank you.

434
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,360

435
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
