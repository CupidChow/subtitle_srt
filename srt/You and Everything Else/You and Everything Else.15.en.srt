[Sang-yeon] <i>Eun-jung…</i>

180
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm going to die.

181
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,720
It wasn't easy for me to accept either.

182
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,600
I want to live too.

183
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,356
If there was even a 1% chance to survive,

184
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,276
I would have tried everything I could.

185
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,863
There isn't though.

186
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,328
- Sang-yeon--
- You know the thing about hope?

187
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,833
It completely drains you.

188
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,215
Wanting to end this suffering

189
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,053
without losing any of myself
along the way,

190
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,098
is it so wrong and selfish

191
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,975
for me to want that?

192
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,149
[sighs] Don't you think I should at least
have the right to reject this pain?

- Yeah. You fixed it?

197
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,010
- You're a genius.
- Nah.

198
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,429
- I just got rid of some malware.
- [both chuckle]

199
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,598
- Want a beer?
- [Eun-jung] Is Ha-yun asleep?

200
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,059
Yeah, and my husband said
he'll be home late.

201
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,644
Isn't this a nice treat?

202
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,440
Are you starting a new series?

203
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,357
Mm-hmm.

204
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,776
Congratulations.

205
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,112
- [chuckles softly]
- It's finally happening.

206
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,949
Why do you look sullen?

207
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,869
Did something happen?

208
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,207
Don't do it.

209
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,294
You can't handle something like that.

[clicks tongue]

211
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,885
[sighs] I can't even think straight.

212
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,262
Everything's too surreal.

213
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,057
I can't believe she had the audacity
to ask you to do that.

214
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,811
Actually, she said
I didn't need to go, so…

215
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,608
You're kidding. In that case,
she shouldn't have even bothered to ask.

216
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,318
What did she expect from you?

217
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,154
[Eun-jung] If I felt like…

218
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,075
[sighs]

219
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,744
…I was slowly

220
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,997
losing my sense of self…

[sighs]

222
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,927
…I think I would want to end it all too.

223
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
So would I.

224
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,646
If I were in her position,
I might have had those thoughts too.

225
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,149
This isn't about that.

226
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,152
You're involving yourself
in someone else's death.

227
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,404
Take me, for example.

228
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,407
It's been six years
since my dad passed away.

229
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,243
It still haunts me.

230
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,495
I still haven't come to terms
with the fact

231
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,705
that I chose to remove his respirator.

232
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,544
Even after all this time,
I still have so much guilt.

233
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,923
Do you really understand
what you're considering here?

234
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,636
This could weigh on you for life,
considering how caring you are.

[Eun-jung] You're right. [sighs]

this process anytime you like, right?

369

Of course.

[doctor] Do you really desire
assisted suicide?

371
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,211
Yes, I do.

372
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,923
[doctor] Are you influenced by others
to make this decision?

373
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:04,219
[Sang-yeon] Not at all. I made all
of these decisions completely by myself.

We divorced three years ago.

398

I know. I heard.

399
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,943
I was shocked

400

when I heard you got married.

401
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,616
More so than I was
to hear you two had divorced.

402
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,452
How did it happen so quickly?

403
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,996

[Eun-jung chuckles]

408
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,509
It's not like he was
the only admirer that you ever had.

409
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,261
He liked me the most.

410
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,763
He was so into me.

411
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,184
He was so innocent and quiet-natured,

412
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,688
so it made me believe
that he would cherish me for a lifetime.

413
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,774
[chuckles] How wrong I was.

414
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,235
He wanted to split
less than a year into our marriage.

415
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,490
He said he never felt
even a hint of warmth from me.

I poured in every ounce of effort
I had to make it work.

Despite knowing it was all a facade,

422
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,092
it was a charade I upheld
for six long years.

423
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,180
Why did you try so hard?

424

[pensive music playing]

Those words of yours,

428
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,947
they haunted me relentlessly
throughout my thirties.

429
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,908
Like a song
that keeps playing in your head.

430
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,499
I needed to prove that you were wrong.

431
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,753
That I could be loved by someone,
and accepted in the end.

432
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,177
Then I got obsessed about having a child.

433
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,889
I had this stupid idea that a kid would

434
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,018
turn me into a warmer person than I am.

435
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,311
But I never conceived.

436
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,356
And then I got cancer.

Hey.

You don't have to get yourself so upset.

All I want is to share my truth with you.
Is that all right?

441
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,180

00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,787
[music fades]

530
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,706
What do you think? [chuckles]

531
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,962
Which one's better?

532
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,468
They're both really pretty.

533
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,929
I'll try them on, then.

534
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,435
Are you sure you're all right?

535
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,272
You were shaking a lot back there.

536
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,738
I was really nervous.

537
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,493
[sighs] I was so worried.

538
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,871
Seeing that big blue door.

539
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,999
[Sang-yeon sighs]

540
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,171
It was like
standing before the Iguazu Falls.

541
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,092
It was the most powerful thing
that I ever saw in the world.

542
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,346
When I stood in front of the Iguazu Falls…

543
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,225
I was completely overwhelmed.

544
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,688
It was scary because I felt like
I would be devoured by it.

545
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>And yet, rather than feel</i>
<i>repelled by it, I thought…</i>

546
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,736
<i>"I'm here now."</i>

547
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,615
<i>"I'm seeing this."</i>

548
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,741
<i>And I thought,</i>

549
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,995
<i>"I'm ready"</i>

550
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,998
It made me feel quite calm.

551
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,257
[music fades]

552
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,093
And you know the best part?

553
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,888
Getting to go through this with you.

554
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,809
[contented music playing]

555
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,481
At times, the pain was so consuming
that… all I could think of

556
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,985
was dying one of two ways.

557
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,449
Would I die like my mother did…

558
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,871
or leave the way my brother did.

559
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,836
But then,
when I heard about the blue house,

560
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,588
I found comfort in the thought.

561
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,509
I started thinking constantly
about my brother.

562
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,348
If he really had to do that…

563
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,686
or if he was destined to do that…

564
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,153
it would've been nice if he had
his own version of Switzerland.

565
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,284
It would've been nice
for my mom to have as well.

566
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,997
If I only could have,

567
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,542
I would've gone with them
and held both of their hands.

568
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,135
But at least I'm here now.

569
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,973
I'm not on the cold mountain,

570
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,644
or completely shattered from suffering.

571
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,316
I won't even get lonely
with you by my side.

572
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,989
Eun-jung.

573
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,911
No one's life could end
as happily as mine will.

574
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,913
I hope you know.

575
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,376
And I also hope…

576
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,213
our final evening together…

577
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,342
is filled with laughter.

578
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,647

I really don't want to
fall asleep tonight.

587
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,857
[Eun-jung] Neither do I.

588
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,193
Let's stay awake.

589
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,238
I think I will stay awake…

590
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,911
[sighs] …and watch
the sunrise in the morning.

591
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,122
Bid my last farewell

592
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,916
to the sun.

593
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,090
I better set a dozen alarms.

594
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,011
[chuckles softly] No.

595
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,721
Two dozen.

596
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,223
[both chuckle]

597
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,604
[Eun-jung] I have you

598
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,399
to thank for everything in my life.

599
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,401
How so?

600
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,405
When I was younger,

601
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,076
you're the reason I started reading books.

602
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,122
You were the one
who sparked my interest in films.

603
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,169
Then I quit college…
and went to film school.

604
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,423
Ultimately leaving the film industry

605
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,926
to become a scriptwriter for television.

606
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,597
All of that is because of you.

607
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,934
[chuckles softly] Oh my.

608
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,647
I created Ryu Eun-jung, then.

609
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,691
- Exactly.
- [both chuckle]

610
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,484
You created me.

611
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,653
[both giggling]

612
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,656
It's the same for me.

613
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,036
I went off track because of you.

614
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,957
I became wealthy

615
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,751
stealing your work.

616
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,965
And even got married…

617
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,259
[chuckles softly]

618
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,094
…due to the Eun-jung curse.

619
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,889
[chuckles softly]

620
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,057
[Sang-yeon] I mean it.

621
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,894
There's truly

622
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,938
no one else like you.

623
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,029
There's no one else like you
in this whole world either.

624
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,623
[chuckles ruefully] Why'd I act like that?

625
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,464
You were the only friend I had in my life.

626
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,010
Why did I have to…

627
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,804
Why did I have to lose you?

628
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,475
After all that,

629
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,352
we're friends again.

630
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,272
You mean it?

631
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,567
[Eun-jung] Of course.

632
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,990
Do you think you'll miss me?

633
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,544
Of course. You know I'll miss you a lot.

634
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,432
[Sang-yeon chuckles softly]

635
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,939
So you have accepted me…

636
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,402
in the end.

637
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,530
You did.

638
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,497
Do you think my mom can see this?

639
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,750
Us here together.

640
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,298
Mm-hmm.

641
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,180
Would she hug me?

642
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,561
Of course.

Yeah?

That's the key…

the story you wrote about us.

670

what will happen when you open the valve?

It'll bring my life to an end.
