175
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,215
- [Eun-jung] Get what?
- [cell phone ringing]

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,468
Ugh, I think Mr. Park's gonna ask
for another extension.

177
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,678
I'll see you later.

178
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,389
- Yes, Mr. Park.
- [Yu-chan] Bye.

179
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,682
[Hee-jin] Yes, I'm here.

180
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,310
[Eun-jung] Song Yu-chan.

181
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,899
Stop it. Only buy flowers
for whoever becomes your girlfriend.

182
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,403
Can't I even get you flowers
on your first day?

183
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,947
No. Act like you always have.

184
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,658
Stop taking care of me
and don't grow more feelings.

185
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,076
If I refuse?

186
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,829
Then we can't be friends.

187
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,958
- 'Cause of him, right? What if he got--
- I'll say it one last time.

188
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,545
I've never seen you
as a potential love interest.

189
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,213
I'm not going to start now.

190
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,885
Wow.

191
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,803
You've killed me twice.

192
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,722
[Eun-jung sighs]

193
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,942
I'm not worried, but I'm unsure
if Yeong-seo's lines sound plausible.

194
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,028
I'll brainstorm a bit more.

195
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,950
Oh my.

196
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,702
Director Joo Dong-hyang. That's you?

197
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,291
Uh… Producer Cheon
is coproducing <i>Good Man </i>with me.

198
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,044
[chuckles] I should have come
and visited you sooner.

199
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,963
- I apologize for the late introduction.
- Ah… yes.

200
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,966
[Sang-yeon] Thanks for writing
such a wonderful script for us.

201
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,510
[Dong-hyang chuckles] Sure.

202
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,805
Well, I'll see you around.
Take care, okay?

203
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,852
Come on, is she doing that on purpose
or is she shameless?

204
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
[Eun-jung chuckles] Please don't mind her.

205
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,858
Hi, everyone.

206
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,777
- [all] Hello.
- [Hyeon-ju] Hi.

207
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,082
Have you received
the test shoot locations permit yet?

208
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,084
[Ho-cheol] Yes,
our slot will start at 2:00 p.m.

209
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,759
[indistinct chattering]

210
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,804
[Hee-jin] <i>It's her, right?</i>

211
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,432
Cheon Sang-yeon. She's the one
who caused your breakup in college.

212
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,685
[easy-listening music playing]

213
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,062
I'm right, aren't I?

214
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,984
How'd you figure it out?

215
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,236
[sighs] That's not important.

216
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,950
Wow, this all really must've been
so uncomfortable for you.

217
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,160
Especially now with the both of them here.

218
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,914
I heard that she still has feelings
for Kim Sang-hak.

219
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,333
Ugh! Song Yu-chan. That guy.

220
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,505
Oh, whatever.
I don't care if she likes him or not.

221
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,841
Are you sure about that?

222
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,969
Of course I'm sure. So what?

223
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,639
I'm picking up on something.

224
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,141
[both chuckle]

225
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,686
What you're picking up on
is just me tired of everything.

226
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,146
[sighs]

227
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,608
It's a shame, though, isn't it?
Kim Sang-hak, hmm?

228
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,110
He seems like a decent guy.

229
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,989
He's a good person.

230
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,875
Wait. Don't start.
That's just me stating a fact.

231
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:23,047
I admit that I'd be intrigued…
mm-hmm, yeah, if we just met.

232
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,925
Oh-oh! [chuckles]

233
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,468
We already know each other.

234
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,304
"No one changes that easily," right?

235
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,722
[Eun-jung sighs]

236
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,140
[clicks tongue]

237
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,644
None of this is about him specifically.

238
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,732
Our breakup was

239
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,984
incredibly tough for me.

240
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,737
Initially,

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
I struggled with his absence.

242
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
And what…

243
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,038
what actually fueled my anger
was coming to terms with my own actions.

244
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,956
Yeah.

245
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,168
I was so upset that I went through
someone else's personal things

246
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,461
and read their diary.

247
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,380
[Hee-jin] You did?

248
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,422
Mm.

249
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,760
[sighs] I reflect on that a lot.

250
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,179
I hated who I had become.

251
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,682
I'll never forget.

252
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,144
I should love who I am.

253
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,398
I want my partner to love
who I am in the relationship.

254
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,568
In the end… I owe myself that much.

255
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,822
What about Yu-chan?

256
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,574
Are you sure there's nothing there?

257
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,493
Hee-jin.

258
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,578
Ooh, you sure answered that one quickly.

259
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,831
[chuckles] You're hilarious, Ryu Eun-jung.

260
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,290
Oh, why?!

261
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,877
The difference between Yu-chan
and Sang-hak is so apparent.

262
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,921
You're definitely bothered by Sang-hak.

263
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,674
That's not true!

264
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,761
That was so random. Hee-jin!

265
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,388
[Hee-jin] You're so funny.

266
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,432
[both chuckling]

267
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,975
Here's the new schedule.

268
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,020
[Yu-chan] The director isn't coming
to the test shoot?

269
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,648
No. None of the cast will be present.
It's a camera-and-lighting technical test.

270
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,067
- When will you all be arriving?
- Around dinner.

271
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,195
- I'll be observing the night shoot.
- I'm going to be there right after you.

272
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
- See you all later.
- [cell phone rings]

273
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,323
Yes, Director Gyeong?

274
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,202
Ah, okay. Will do, sir.

275
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,915
- [woman] Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,837
- What's this? Are you guys filming?
- Sorry, sir. You can't enter this area.

277
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,756
- [man 1] What are you filming?
- [man 2] Mr. Kim.

278
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,924
- Hello, Producer Ryu.
[all] Hello

279
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,844
- [woman] I have them prepped, right here.
- Where's Producer Cheon?

280
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,305
[Eun-jung] Probably still
at action school. How is everything?

281
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,723
Mm. Go say hi.

282
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,310
- [man 3] Stand in front of the camera.
- [man 4] Copy, sir.

283
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,064
- [In-ho] Oh, hey! You made it.
- Yeah.

284
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,070
- [Sang-hak] You think it's too bluish?
- Mm. It is.

285
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,821
Let's turn down the color temperature.

286
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,575
- [man 5] Resume once the lighting's fixed.
- [man 6] Copy that!

287
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,960
- [creaking]
- [electricity buzzing]

288
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,213
- Oh!
- [screaming]

289
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,714
- Mr. Kim!
- Producer Ryu!

290
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,424
- [Yu-chan] Eun-jung!
- [man 5] Are you okay?

291
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,093
- Are you okay?
- [Eun-jung] Yeah.

292
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,178
- Oh, Sang-hak!
- [In-ho] Are you hurt?

293
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,763
You're bleeding!

294
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,390
- [Hyeon-ju] What should we do?
- I'll call an ambulance for you.

295
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,643
I'll need to check the lights.
I think it's just a graze.

296
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,270
No! I think…
you should go to the hospital first.

297
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,773
- I'm fine. Let's continue.
- [Sang-yeon] Wait, Sang-hak.

298
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,024
[tense music playing]

299
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,234
[Eun-jung gasps]

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,322
[Yu-chan] Are you okay?

301
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,535
Will he be okay?

302
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,664
Be careful not to get water
on these sutures.

303
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,416
You can have them removed
at the clinic in five or six days.

304
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,210
And definitely no alcohol.

305
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,212
Okay. Oh, sir?

306
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,422
Could you take a look
at her wound as well?

307
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,676
No, it's okay.
I'll put ointment on it later.

308
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,889
What kind of person
throws themselves around like that?

309
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,850
The shoot can't go on without you.

310
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,311
Remember how important you are
before doing something like this again.

311
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,773
I wasn't thinking when I saw you.
It just happened that way.

312
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,570
I appreciate what you did.

313
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,946
And sorry.

314
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,991
Don't be. It's not that serious,
so don't worry about it.

315
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,413
Get in. I'll drive you home.

316
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,206
It's okay. I'll just take a cab.

317
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,167
Just get in her car.

318
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,295
I can go on my own.

319
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,463
Take care, okay?

320
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,137
[pensive music playing]

321
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,364
[sighs]

322
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,784
[Sang-hak] <i>I wasn't thinking</i>
<i>when I saw you. It just happened that way.</i>

323
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,829
[Eun-jung] <i>I appreciate what you did.</i>

324
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,039
<i>And sorry.</i>

325
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,338
[music fades]

326
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,133
I heard Mr. Kim got injured?

327
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,679
Yes.

328
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,431
He got five stitches.

329
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,101
And he needs to be careful
with his shoulders for the time being.

330
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,312
- Is he resting?
- Not exactly.

331
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,522
He's in Chuncheon scouting the laboratory.

332
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,650
I thought that got canceled.

333
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,779
He told Ho-cheol that he needed to go,
saying rescheduling wouldn't be an option.

334
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,614
[sighs] That guy's really something.

335
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,456
- [phone keypad beeps]
- [outgoing call rings]

336
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,713
Here is your updated schedule.

337
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,591
[Seung-ju sighs]

338
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm told Mr. Kim and Producer Ryu
acted out a scene from a film yesterday.

339
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,016
[pensive music playing]

340
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,774
[echoing crash]

341
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,870
[music intensifies]

342
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,214
[sighs]

343
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,888
[music fades]

344
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,191
[sighs]

345
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,530
[sighs]

346
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
[sighing]

347
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
Hey. How did you get…

348
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,349
[Sang-yeon sighs]

349
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,228
I like you, Sang-hak.

350
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,523
[tender music playing]

351
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,443
Ever since I was 17…

352
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,865
even up to now, I have always liked you.

353
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,788
Everything I said
about Uncle Tat was all a lie.

354
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,044
Kim Sang-hak was the one… I always liked.

355
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,506
And I've never felt this way
about anyone else.

356
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,804
Sang-yeon--

357
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,264
I wish that you had stayed out of my life.

358
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,896
Why did you have to show up
and make me feel this all over?

359
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,486
- My heart belongs to someone else.
- Eun-jung?

360
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,784
She told me she doesn't like you.

361
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,123
She isn't even interested in you at all.

362
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,417
I know.

363
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,795
Tell me, then. Why?

364
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,840
Why?

365
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,593
What is it about her
that makes you so interested?

366
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,429
[Sang-hak sighs]

367
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,223
I also hope it'll pass one day.

368
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,768
[sighs] And so should you.

369
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,357
Forget about me and focus on work. Okay?

370
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,112
You said don't burn out.

371
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,785
Why did you bother telling me that, then?

372
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,747
It would've been better if you hadn't.
I could've let the flames consume me.

373
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,172
I don't know

374
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,176
if you can let things pass that easily.

375
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,346
I can't do that.

376
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,479
Since I am alive because of you.

377
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,857
[hesitates] Listen…

378
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,360
All I wanted was for you to thrive.

379
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,362
I felt sorry for you.

380
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,323
I don't care what it was anymore.

381
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,869
You see, Eun-jung…
has so many people she loves,

382
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,454
and who love her back too.

383
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,918
The thing is, Sang-hak, all I have is you.

384
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,421
So… [sobs]

385
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,427
Will you please
just give me a chance for once?

386
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,809
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,190
Get home safely.

388
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,192
[sighs]

389
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,820
[sorrowful music playing]

390
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,947
[screams] Why?!

391
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,491
Why can't I be chosen for once?

392
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,374
[sobbing]

393
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,854
[music fades]

394
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,150
Stitches are gone tomorrow.

395
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,944
How's your shoulder?

396
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,028
All better.

397
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,953
- [man] Mr. Kim, are you okay?
- [woman] You're okay!

398
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm okay, everyone. Continue working.

399
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,506
- [Seung-ju] Good work.
- [glasses clink]

400
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,133
- [Sang-hak] You too.
- Great job you guys.

401
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,929
- [Sang-hak] Ah.
- You're allowed to drink now?

402
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,600
- [chuckles]
- [Seung-ju] You're shooting lasers.

403
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,893
No. [chuckles] The doctor said…

404
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,979
He can drink. It's been over a week.

405
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,815
[liquid pouring]

406
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,569
You're being quiet today, Producer Cheon.

407
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,280
[chuckles]

408
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,699
How's the storyboard going?
When can we see it?

409
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,035
[Sang-hak] I just need to organize
the ending sequence.

410
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,163
- It'll be ready in two days.
- [Seung-ju] I was thinking, Producer Ryu.

411
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,665
What do you think about
changing Tae-o's last line?

412
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,376
He'd say to Su-jin, something like,
"So it was you."

413
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,504
"So it was you."

414
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,260
Oh. That's going to be so sad.

415
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,720
Mr. Kim thought of it.

416
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,642
- Well, it's just a thought.
- [chuckles softly]

417
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,019
You two are quite similar, aren't you?

418
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,315
Well, I mean, anyone would agree
that it's a great line.

419
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,073
- [glass clinks]
- [liquid pouring]

420
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,033
- I'll take a taxi.
- Yeah, I will too.

421
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,827
Mm. All right.
I'll see you all on ritual day.

422
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,497
- Yeah, we'll talk soon.
- All right, take care.

423
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,837
You can catch the first cab.

424
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,839
Because the camera crew leaves first?

425
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,716
[chuckles] No.

426
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,761
Shall we walk for a while?

427
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,640
Sure, yeah.

428
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,309
[pensive music playing]

429
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,373
[Eun-jung] I'm curious.
How did you come up with that line?

430
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,083
I just said what came to mind.

431
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,711
I'm glad everyone's happy about it.

432
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,921
[Eun-jung] This is a huge deal,

433
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,590
especially considering
that it's Tae-o's final line.

434
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,844
By the way, what made you enroll
in K-Arts back then?

435
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,181
[Eun-jung] No reason. I watched movies
because I had nothing better to do.

436
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,394
Thinking about it now,
I suppose I owe you one.

437
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,437
Why?

438
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,896
Well… [chuckles]

439
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,899
…you inspired so many diary entries.

440
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,611
I drew from those entries
for my practical exams.

441
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,369
Well, I guess you should thank me, then.

442
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,079
Don't be ridiculous.

443
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,751
I entered the film scene thanks to you.

444
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,712
That's not true. You've always loved film.

445
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,965
Still, I never thought
of making it a career.

446
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,469
Then… [chuckles]
…I heard you enrolled in K-Arts.

447
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,055
Really?

448
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,100
So <i>you </i>copied <i>me</i>?

449
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,896
No, I didn't copy you. It's actually
called being inspired, you know?

450
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,939
[chuckling] That's not much different.

451
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,984
And maybe you should be saying
"thank you so much" to me instead.

452
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,527
- Don't you think?
- [chuckles]

453
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,988
Thank you so much.

454
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,823
[both chuckle]

455
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,993
Ah, this is fun.

456
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,621
Well, I guess my mom was right.

457
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,125
She always tells me that…
not every bad event is entirely negative.

458
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,631
Yeah, but we could've done without it.

459
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,510
Let it go. It's time to move past that.

460
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,472
[Sang-hak] I can't help but wonder…

461
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,602
"What if this was the first moment
our paths crossed?"

462
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,732
[music fades]

463
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,360
I want a fresh start with you.

464
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,821
Like it's our first time.

465
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,658
[sweet music playing]

466
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,586
Producer Cheon, here's the final
attendance list for the ritual.

467
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,800
Wait. This includes
our executive division director

468
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,884
and guests, right?

469
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,052
[Hyeon-ju] Of course.

470
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,971
GOOD MAN RITUAL ATTENDEES

471
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,098
SCRIPTWRITER JOO DONG-HYANG
NOT ATTENDING

472
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,272
You'll be checking on
the set later on, right?

473
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,149
- Why? Are you not going?
- I'll join later at 4:00.

474
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,735
- For Lee Seung-jae's fitting, okay?
- Okay, got it.

475
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,198
- [phone keypad beeps]
- [outgoing call rings]

476
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,576
Yes, Director.

477
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,744
I'll be coming right up.

478
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:13,955
All right.

479
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,499
[guard] Sir, we cannot let you through

480
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,751
if the person you're here for
isn't receiving your calls.

481
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,755
[Sang-yeon's father] She never picks up
my calls. Okay, okay, okay, fine. Here.

482
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,966
Can you make one call for me
to Cheon Sang-yeon?

483
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,553
- 010-3277--
- [guard] Sir, please leave.

484
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,847
[Sang-yeon's father sighs]
It doesn't cost you anything.

485
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,764
[tires skidding]

486
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,892
- You came out of nowhere.
- I'm so sorry.

487
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,144
- You should be careful.
- Dad, what happened?

488
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,604
[unsettling music playing]

489
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,356
She never picks up
her own father's calls anymore.

490
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,067
- Cheon Sang-yeon! Cheon Sang-yeon!
- [guard] Sir, be quiet!

491
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
I'll remove you--

492
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,070
- Hey!
- I'll take it from here. How can I help?

493
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,114
Is there something I can help you with?

494
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,825
- Do you know my daughter?
- I'm her coworker.

495
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,161
- Ah. Oh, really?
- Yes, let's talk over here.

496
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,913
Can I get a business card, then?

497
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,123
- That girl never answers my calls.
- Oh… Oh, she doesn't?

498
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,084
[man whispers] She's here.

499
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,920
- Yikes.
- That's her, right? Cheon Sang-yeon?

500
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,048
- [woman 1] I don't think she knows yet.
- [woman 2] I feel sorry for her.

501
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,841
Oh! You're back.

502
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,301
- Yes.
- [chuckles awkwardly]

503
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,011
[Hyeon-ju sighs]

504
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,682
[woman] <i>But I thought</i>
<i>her family had money.</i>

505
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,684
How can her father behave that way?

506
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,687
You've been friends with her
since childhood,

507
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,105
so you already knew.

508
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,358
But I can't believe
she had the rest of us fooled.

509
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,901
She didn't fool anyone.

510
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,821
Producer Cheon never claimed
that her family was wealthy, did she?

511
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,450
Why is her background
any of your business, Producer Kim?

512
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,993
Why do you care?

513
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,538
Why are you snapping at me over this?

514
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,958
- I can't ask a simple question?
- No, you can't.

stay out of others' business?

521

you aren't much of a charmer to me.

He isn't drawn to you,

It's time you stop suffering.
