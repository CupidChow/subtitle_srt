- Uh, I'm telling you, she hit my hands.
- [A-ra] Really?

13
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,429
- [Eun-jung] It really hurt!
- Yes.

14
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,182
I hit her really, really, hard. [chuckles]

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,601
But you didn't even remember
that it was me.

16
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,062
And that's why you got back at me, right?

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,356
And Eun-jung made sure
to only target me in dodgeball.

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,069
- You can tell me. You did it on purpose.
- Mm…

19
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,321
[chuckling] Of course. I totally did.

20
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,490
- I knew it!
- [both chuckle]

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,327
I still can't believe
we met again like this.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,412
- What are the chances?
- Seriously.

23
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,581
[man] Why'd you hide
your gorgeous friend from us?

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,166
You should've brought her a lot sooner.

25
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,126
- [cell phone rings]
- You're getting a call.

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,963
You should stop ignoring
your girlfriend's calls!

27
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,882
- Okay.
- Call her!

28
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,802
- My phone was on silent. What's up?
- [A-ra] <i>Oppa!</i>

29
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,386
- [Sang-hak] Yeah?
- [A-ra taps seat]

30
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,223
- [A-ra] Come say hi.
- [Sang-hak] Sure. Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,852
You and I met at the booth the other day.
I'm a business sophomore, Kim Sang-hak.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,521
[Sang-yeon] I know.

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,857
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon,
an engineering major freshman.

34
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,153
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I kept</i>
<i>checking her reactions.</i>

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>I was concerned for Sang-yeon.</i>

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
Cheers.

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117

<i>the same reaction I did</i>

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,619
<i>when I met Sang-hak,</i>
<i>but she seemed fine.</i>

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,872
Why didn't you two keep in contact
if you were so close?

40
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,958
Why didn't you look for each other
on I Love School?

41
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,084
I mean, I did.

42
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,795
When you first left,
I looked for you a lot.

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,004
Did you look for me?

44
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
- I didn't go on things like that.
- [A-ra] What?

45
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,260
But everyone was on I Love School.

46
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,762
- [Sang-yeon] Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I know.

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,433
[chuckles] Well, I was never
a person that loved school, so…

48
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,351
[A-ra] Oh.

49
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,855
Seriously, though, I wasn't really
attending school in those days.

50
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,232
[Sang-hak] You didn't go
to high school at all?

51
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,693
No, I did for two months. And then I quit.

52
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,194
- [Sang-hak] Oh.
- [A-ra chuckles]

53
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,029
Is your camera really a Leica?

54
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,866
- It's my brother's.
- [A-ra] Nice.

55
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,284
[Sang-hak] Does he do photography?

56
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,119
More like a hobby.

57
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,204
[Hyeon-guk] How old is he?
How does he have a Leica?

58
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,122
[A-ra] I know, right?

59
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,332
My older brother's
still attending college.

60
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,834
He's 25 years old,

61
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,295
and he just got discharged
from the military.

62
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,713
[group] Oh.

63
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,465
What does your brother major in?

64
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,595
What is this, an interrogation?
You should stop asking so many questions.

65
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,222
- He's a business major.
- What? So am I!

66
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,807
Sang-hak <i>oppa </i>too.

67
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,518
- Which college does he go to?
- SNU.

68
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,562
- [impressed gasping]
- What?

69
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,563
[woman] Wow!

70
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,275
[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-yeon spoke</i>
<i>about her brother so casually.</i>

71
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,445
<i>It's almost as if he were still alive</i>

72
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,238
<i>and thriving somewhere.</i>

73
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,699
Eun-jung, have you ever seen her brother?

74
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,034
Is he handsome?

75
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,204
What? He's a handsome guy.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,789
He's actually really, really good-looking.

77
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,835
Who do you think's better looking?
Her brother or your boyfriend?

78
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,170
[all giggle]

79
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,465
I think Kim Sang-hak
is much more handsome.

80
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,634
Guys. Hey.

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,386
I told you not to talk about my looks.

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,931
People will think
that's all I have to offer, man.

83
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,975
Say something.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

84
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,852
[Eun-jung chuckles] Mmm.

85
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,978
Hey, Sang-hak.

86
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,481
You've got pretty
symmetrical facial features,

87
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,025
although, you're not
as good-looking as you think.

88
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,237
Yeah, yeah, duly noted.
I got your message loud and clear.

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,364
[A-ra] Aw, this is so funny. [giggling]

90
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
Oh, these two are dating.

91
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,827
- Oh. Wow. [chuckles]
- Yeah.

92
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
You look great together.

93
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,205
- Do we?
- Yeah.

94
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,166
- [Sang-hak] That hurt my pride.
- But, Sang-hak, I'm right.

95
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,668
[laughter]

96
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,794
Amazing.

97
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,837
[A-ra] Oh, so funny.

98
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,551
- [A-ra] You have to go to work this late?
- I have a part-time job.

99
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,054
No one would cover for her. Taking a taxi?

100
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,847
- Subway.
- [man] Oh, me too.

101
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

102
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,686
[A-ra] Dae-gyu, didn't you say
you were going to stay for three rounds?

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
- Take care.
- [Su-mi] Guys!

104
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,232
Round two!

105
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,901
- You're that happy?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,240
But I still feel like this isn't real.
I'm feeling kinda numb.

107
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,202
I bet we'll have a lot
to talk about tomorrow. I'm excited.

108
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh, right.

109
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,540
Remember your old exhibition photograph?

110
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,418
Sang-yeon was the person
that I thought I saw in it.

111
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,669
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,796
Hold on.

113
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,842
Wow, Ryu Eun-jung.

114
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,094
If you two were so close,

115
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,346
why haven't you mentioned her
to me before?

116
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
I haven't? I don't recall.

117
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,144
"I haven't? I don't recall"?

118
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,689
You talk about Na-mi and Ju-eun every day,

119
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,691
but you've never mentioned
Cheon Sang-yeon to me.

120
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,485
Oh, come on.

121
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,991
That's because it's complicated.
I'll tell you about it later.

122
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,286
- You have to promise, okay?
- Yes, I promise. [chuckles]

123
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,996
I promise because

124
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,958
without telling you about her,
my life story would be missing a big part!

125
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,342
And in the future,

126
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,428
when you tell your story,
I'll be a big part.

127
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,307
[both giggle]

128
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,642
You don't have to worry about that.

129
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,811
You've already made it.

130
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,357
You're a big part of my story,
bro, all right?

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,399
"Bro"?

132
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,318
- Yeah, "bro."
- [both chuckle]

133
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,404
You didn't know?
I always call you that in my diary.

134
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,322
- Really?
- Sure!

135
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,115
Come here. I said come here.

136
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,200
Bring it, "bro."

137
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,035
- [chuckles]
- [Eun-jung giggles]

138
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,038
[Eun-jung] Sang-yeon.

139
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,414
Hey.

140
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,221
So, she resigned from the school?

141
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,100
Mm-hmm. The parents kept
complaining about her.

142
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,604
What made them complain?

143
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,440
[Sang-yeon] Mm…

144
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,443
She was a homeroom teacher

145
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,779
that didn't care much
about her students, I guess.

146
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,329
Your mom was the best. I loved her.

147
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,168
The teacher you once knew
has been long gone.

148
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,383
Really?

149
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,343
We went bankrupt. You knew, right?

150
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,386
Huh?

151
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
Uh-huh.

152
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,268
And you? Where do you live now?

153
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,399
Still in the same neighborhood,
but we moved to a different house.

154
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,027
We moved about two alleys over
from my old house.

155
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,028
[Sang-yeon] Mm.

156
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,406
Oh, my mom runs a <i>tteok </i>place.

157
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,118
Do you remember Daesung's Mill
at your old apartment?

158
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,164
- Uh-huh.
- Her and my uncle are running it.

159
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,916
Oh… got it.

160
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,836
My mom and dad divorced.

161
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,007
And after the divorce,
my mom and I moved to Gangneung.

162
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,884
[pensive music playing]

163
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
Um, is your dad still in Seoul?

164
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,061
Don't know. We're not talking.

165
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,106
I understand.

166
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,529
<i>I thought that I would have</i>
<i>so much to say to her,</i>

167
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,491
<i>but I had trouble making conversation.</i>

168
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>Maybe those five years</i>
<i>had taken something away from us.</i>

169
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,130
- See you around.
- Yeah, good luck writing your essay.

170
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,177
Sang-yeon.

171
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:40,978
I, uh…

172
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,525
How come you just left
without saying goodbye

173
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,026
before your family moved?

174
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,240
Were you upset with me or something?

175
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,953
Not at all. Why?

176
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,124
Ju-eun told me you and your family
were planning to move away,

177
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,919
so I dropped everything
and ran to your house,

178
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,921
but when I got there, you were gone.

179
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,507
I paged you, but you never answered.

180
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,635
And then later,
you changed your pager number.

181
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,140
We went bankrupt, remember?

182
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,603
And… we couldn't contact anyone
when we were pretty much running away.

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,065
I still thought

184
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,319
that someday maybe
you would contact me back.

185
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,827
I practically was forbidden
to contact any friends at that point.

186
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,745
My pager was long gone.

187
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,084
I understand.

188
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,467
Then, um… I guess
that you weren't mad at me, then?

189
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,095
Nope.

190
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,473
I'm actually glad that we met again.

191
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,767
Seriously.

192
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,729
I am too.

193
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,484
My mom might be the most excited.
She misses you a lot.

194
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,653
Really?

195
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656
Aw, I'd love to see your mom again.

196
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,994
Tell her I'm planning to visit her
when I can get a day off of work.

197
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,455
Uh-huh. I'm sure she'd love that.

198
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,416
- See you later.
- See ya.

199
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,550
[camera clicks]

200
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,096
- [camera clicking]
- Where's your friend? Cheon Sang-yeon.

201
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,182
Oh, she's probably at work.

202
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,060
Oh. She's got a lot on her plate,
doesn't she?

203
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,854
Does she even have time to participate?

204
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,397
I know, huh?

205
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,857
You're cute.

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
- [woman 1] Hurry.
- The food's so good here.

207
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,030
Your ticket. Have a good time.

208
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,709
[Eun-jung] <i>Do you cook your own meals?</i>

209
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
Yeah, I cook at least one meal a day.

210
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,633
But it's usually just putting rice
in the cooker. Super easy.

211
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,260
[Eun-jung] I'm glad to hear you're cooking
at least a little bit.

212
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,804
I tried to stop her.

213
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
I figured you probably didn't cook,

214
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,100
but she insisted
that her <i>myeolchi </i>wasn't salty

215
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,643
and you could eat it without rice.

216
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,644
[both chuckle]

217
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,313
Ah, I love your mom's cooking.

218
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,776
But please…
please let her know that I'm okay.

219
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,153
My fridge is tiny
and I don't have much room.

220
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,114
I told her this was her last one.

221
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,991
I just need to use the restroom.

222
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,870
- Mm-hmm. I'll wait here.
- No, you have to come with.

223
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,582
- [chuckles] But I don't have to pee.
- Just come with me anyway.

224
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,585
Why are you making me use it?

225
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,839
It's because I don't have
a toilet at my place.

226
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,216
You don't have a toilet?

227
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,220
[Sang-yeon] It's a squat toilet.
I don't like it.

228
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,478
- Careful.
- [Eun-jung] Okay.

229
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,482
[Sang-yeon] That's the toilet.

230
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,409
Give me back everything
you don't think you'll eat.

231
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,618
I'm gonna eat it all.

232
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,329
Just a sec, I'm almost done.

233
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,081
Take your time.

234
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,763
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Looking around,</i>

235
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,515
<i>I couldn't believe that this was</i>

236
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,101
<i>Sang-yeon's room.</i>

237
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,108
[Sang-yeon] Mmm!

238
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,236
Hey, this is so good.

239
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,614
Try some.

240
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,619
- Amazing.
- [chuckles] What?

241
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,745
[Sang-yeon chuckles]

242
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,750
Oh, that. Yeah, it broke.

243
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,627
Yeah.

244
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,712
It's okay.

245
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,299
I get paid today at the Internet café,
so I'll go get another pair tomorrow.

246
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,135
Mmm!

247
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,058
Other than the toilet issue,
everything else is pretty decent.

248
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,602
The rent's really affordable.
About 80,000 won.

249
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,312
That's, like, nothing.

250
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,940
Mm-hmm. So good.

251
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,275
Are you going to be all right

252
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,694
drinking beer
before you have to go to work?

253
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,113
- It's not a lot. Just one.
- [chuckles]

254
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,491
I have to be at work at 9:00,
so it'll totally be fine.

255
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm more annoyed at the whole toilet thing
than anything to do with work.

256
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,247
If I were you, I wouldn't care.

257
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,999
I grew up with a squat toilet
until about the fourth grade.

258
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,126
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,090
Hey, and here I thought
squat toilets only existed

260
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,634
in places like folk villages
or sometime long ago.

261
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,261
[Eun-jung laughs]

262
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,347
Yep, it wasn't weird growing up,

263
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,100
but I can't believe
there's one in Seoul in 2002.

264
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,062
That's the reason I make sure
not to eat anything past 7:00.

265
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,647
I don't wanna use that hole.

266
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,109
That toilet that we used
gets locked up after-hours.

267
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,237
Do you know what blew my mind?
Total culture shock.

268
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,990
I saw your house for the first time,
and it had two bathrooms.

269
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,741
[gasps]

270
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,745
I guess me having two bathrooms then
made me have none now.

271
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,705
[laughs softly]

272
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,915
[chuckling, clears throat]

273
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,670
Back then, I had absolutely no idea
my family was poor

274
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,005
until the fourth grade.

275
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,007
I only realized it

276
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,427
because we had to move
after the new apartments were built.

277
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,641
I really… liked your semi-basement.

278
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,768
Don't be ridiculous.

279
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,563
It's because you said I was the only one.

280
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,734
I was the only person you ever invited.

281
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,362
That's why you liked it?

282
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,156
Mm-hmm.

283
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,783
- You like the weirdest things.
- [chuckles]

284
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,035
Anyway,

285
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,871
it's just a concept.

286
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,331
Poverty is relative.

287
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
I think it's more of an absolute.

288
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,548
There's nothing you can do without money.

289
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,926
Absolutely nothing.

290
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,554
If you're desperately in need,

291
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,933
you'll be treated even worse
and given nothing

292
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,809
in this world.

293
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,941
Like… I had an excess of bathrooms
when I didn't need more than one.

294
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,192
But now I have none.

295
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,029
I go to a good school, but I'm broke,
and I can't get a tutoring job.

296
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,242
I know you'll get a one soon.

297
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,412
- I really hope you're right.
- [chuckles]

298
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,377
- [slurps]
- [woman] Here's the beer you ordered.

299
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,713
I mean, how come you were drinking so much
with someone who has to work?

300
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,257
She'll be fine
because she only had one beer.

301
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,552
I'm pretty sure I had three.
That's a lie. It was four. [giggles]

302
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,137
[chuckles]

303
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,266
- I bet you both still had a lot of fun.
- Yeah, we had a blast.

304
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,562
But the drinking

305
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,815
was to lessen the loneliness.

306
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,899
Why say that?

307
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
'Cause Sang-yeon kind of…

308
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,870
Never mind. I'll cry if I talk about it.

309
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,247
But you always cry.

310
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,581
I know that!

311
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,793
I hate that I cry about everything,
especially when I talk.

312
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,170
It's embarrassing
when tears pour out of my face.

313
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,840
- I'm not saying anything else.
- [chuckles]

314
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,052
- You'll still end up telling me.
- Nuh-uh.

315
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,389
It all felt pretty lonely.

316
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,307
Sang-yeon…

317
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,436
and her whole entire room.

318
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,318
Oh, I'm not going to cry.

319
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,946
You think I'm a crybaby, don't you?

320
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,865
Why are you being so sensitive?

321
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,992
Look. No tears.

322
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,577
Oh, I'm so proud of ya.

323
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,621
Oh yeah. Sang-yeon said
that your images are great.

324
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,665
- My photos?
- Yeah.

325
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,750
She saw my photos?

326
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,419
Probably in the clubroom
during her class break.

327
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,547
She mostly liked the one
that had the image of the chair in it.

328
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,923
[Sang-hak] Mmm.

329
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,801
Ah, she must have
a pretty good eye for talent.

330
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,428
- I agree.
- [chuckles]

331
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,472
Wait, don't you have extra prints of that?

332
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,682
- Yeah, I do.
- Can we give one to Sang-yeon?

333
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,476
Yeah, sure.

334
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,937
She told me
that she's gonna be at the seminar.

335
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,189
- The seminar?
- Yeah.

336
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,274
I bragged that you're presenting there.

337
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,109
She could just come
to the field trip instead.

338
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,737
- She's a part of the photography club.
- I know.

339
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,782
But you're way more impressive
when you're conducting your seminars.

340
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,866
[Sang-hak scoffs]

341
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,828
So then you want me
to impress your friend?

342
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,081
Of course.

343
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,166
Ah… I really hope

344
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,710
she doesn't end up
falling in love with me.

345
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,049
She won't. Don't worry at all about that.

346
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,510
- Wait a minute.
- Why?

347
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,261
You're not her type, Sang-hak.

348
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,014
Whoa. Now you're getting on my nerves.

349
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,308
- Why wouldn't she fall in love?
- Her standards are higher.

350
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,976
- Hey!
- [both chuckling]

351
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,523
Anyway, she's coming,
so, you have to make sure to do your best.

352
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
[chuckles]

353
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,818
I will. Best I got.

354
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,488
[Sang-yeon] Given the photographer's
inconsistent stories across interviews

355
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,448
and the varying accounts
among the witnesses,

356
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,908
perhaps I can understand

357
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,410
why you'd question
the photograph's authenticity,

358
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,955
but what I'm wondering is
why that has anything to do

359
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,706
with the sincerity of the photographer?

360
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,918
It has everything to do with it.

361
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,712
How can you go from understanding

362
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,006
the questionable nature
of the photo's authenticity

363
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,967
to questioning
its relevance to everything?

364
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,009
I don't understand!

365
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,096
What seems to be a manipulated photo
is an end result.

366
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,641
Whether it was by the photographer
or the editor is besides the point.

367
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,018
The responsibility
of the image's authenticity

368
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,062
ultimately falls under the photographer.

369
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,357
No ifs, ands, or buts.
How could you be in denial of that?

370
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,402
I think you're misunderstanding.
I'm not in denial.

371
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,071
The main thing
that I'm trying to point out to you

372
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,576
is that I find your presentation methods
to be quite uninteresting,

373
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,202
if I'm being honest with you.

374
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,372
You've been portraying the photographer
in an incredibly negative light

375
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,000
while you yourself
are being overly emotional.

376
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,586
- [man] Poor guy.
- [students murmuring]

377
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,379
I'm overly emotional?!

378
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,386
Do you truly think that someone can
separate themselves from their art?

379
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,138
[adult Eun-jung] <i>He was already done for,</i>

380
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,557
<i>but I still hoped</i>
<i>he'd win logically, at least.</i>

381
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,019
And this work…
it was taken by a documentarian.

382
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,605
That means people believe
his work to be the truth.

383
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,483
You're now missing the mark and moving
in a completely different direction.

384
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,945
What's so off the mark?
This was the point of the entire seminar.

385
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,780
[Sang-yeon] And what point is that?

386
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,616
[Eun-jung] <i>He's doomed.</i>

387
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,288
Did she come here to pick a fight or what?

388
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,041
Why did she show up out of nowhere
and argue everything he said?

389
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,667
She wasn't picking fights.

390
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,127
[A-ra scoffs]

391
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,087
Ah, my head hurts.

392
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,091
[Sang-hak] Oh, that was embarrassing.

393
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,595
Which one of us made more sense?

394
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,890
Next time, you'll do a lot better.

395
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
It's not about winning.

396
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,479
- [woman] See you tomorrow.
- You're taking her side?

397
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,024
[sighs] She crushed me, I guess.

398
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,401
Were you having fun?

399
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,445
Mm-hmm. It was great.

400
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,366
It really feels like I'm in college.
Like, for real now. [chuckles]

401
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,327
Your boyfriend led
a pretty interesting seminar.

402
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,205
What the heck? [chuckles]

403
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,251
- It wasn't interesting to you?
- You were the one who made it interesting.

404
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,796
- Gosh, I was being a know-it-all again?
- Oh yeah.

405
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,755
[Sang-yeon sighs]

406
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,675
[Ms. Jang] Goodness!
My gosh, when did you get so pretty?

407
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,010
- I hope you've been well.
- [Ms. Jang] Mm-hmm.

408
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,679
You're so beautiful.

409
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,223
[chuckles] So,
are you going to start tutoring?

410
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,892
Yes. I'm so grateful to you.
Thank you, ma'am.

411
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,811
Don't mention it. I barely did anything.

412
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,313
I just noticed the mother
who runs the piano academy upstairs

413
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,733
was looking for a tutor and gave her
my recommendation, that's all.

414
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,652
- [chuckles]
- What grade are they in?

415
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,071
The daughter's in high school,
the son's in middle school.

416
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,865
I'm gonna tutor the daughter alone
and the son with his friend.

417
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,034
Oh, wow, you're tutoring three kids!

418
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,953
- [both chuckling]
- [Ms. Jang] Oh, Sang-hak!

419
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,538
- I'm here.
- [Ms. Jang] Sang-hak's here.

420
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,207
- [Sang-hak] Oh.
- Hi, how are you?

421
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,918
Uh, hi. Long time no see.

422
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:37,879
[chuckles]

423
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,049
I'm so excited
for the three of us to drink together.

424
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,601
Wait, Sang-hak, are you shy?

425
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,437
[Sang-hak chuckles] Definitely not.

426
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,858
Yeah, you are. [giggles]

427
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,403
No way. Is this because of the seminar?

428
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,404
Hey!

429
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,367
Don't talk about the seminar.
That topic is off-limits.

430
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,828
Well, hey.

431
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,915
You know Sang-yeon was impressed
by your presentation. Right?

432
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:15,876
Yes.

433
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,005
I enjoyed it a lot, actually.

434
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,300
All right… the point isn't
it being interesting.

435
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,260
It's that it was a manipulated photo.

436
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,513
I never said that it wasn't manipulated.

437
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,768
- Then why'd you keep arguing with me--
- Okay, stop, stop.

438
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,771
I'm still on Sang-yeon's side
if we keep talking about the seminar.

439
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,315
Change the subject.
Change it up with a cheers!

440
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,984
[Sang-yeon chuckles] Cheers.

441
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,239
Oh, right.

442
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,785
Didn't you bring the photograph
with you to the seminar?

443
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,665
[chuckles] You did.

444
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,418
You did. I know you did!

445
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,253
- No comment.
- [Eun-jung giggles]

446
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,005
What?

447
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,299
Oh the chair photo
that you said you liked.

448
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:09,221
Hey, he brought the photo as a gift,
but then you put him through that ordeal.

"I find your presentation methods
to be quite uninteresting…"

00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,397
I am so sorry.

452
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,567
Well… could I have that photo,
please, sir?

453
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,528
That depends.

454
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,114
I'll do my best. Please, sir.

455
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,950
- I'll be keeping my eye on ya.
- [Sang-yeon] Okay.

456
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,410
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

I bet all the new club recruits have
to have the same crush on her. [laughs]

509
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,105
You're right.
She was always the most popular girl.

510
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,524
[A-ra] I wonder if she's just
not interested in anyone.

511
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:16,533
From your perspective… do you think
there's really no one in our club

512
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,660
Sang-yeon could be interested in at all?

513
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,912
[A-ra] Hmm…

514
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,290
[Hyeon-guk] Oh nice!

515
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,207
Kim Sang-hak?

516
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,501
What?

517
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,129
"What?" Why'd you say "what"?

518
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,757
You asked if there was anyone.
In my opinion, it's Kim Sang-hak.

519
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,845
I'm not saying I think they'll hook up.
It's just

520
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,223
there's an energy between them.

521
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,855
[pensive music playing]

522
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,902
In your opinion, does Sang-hak…

523
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,198
- Ugh, I don't wanna know.
- [laughs]

524
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,286
Hey, I knew you'd react like this.
I bet you're curious, yeah?

525
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,665
Does Sang-hak oppa even have a little
bit of interest in Cheon Sang-yeon, right?

526
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,084
- Not at all!
- [giggling]

527
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,379
- You're being so cruel.
- I know, right?

528
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,506
- [Gyu-ho] You didn't watch?
- [man 1] They scored once.

529
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,717
- [Jeong-seon] He was terrible.
- [Gyu-ho] Stop lying.

530
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,178
But who would've known
that Lee Chun-soo would deliver?

531
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,514
- [Jeong-seon] Right?
- Why? Did Lee Chun-soo score?

532
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,934
Yeah, after getting past the goalie
and all the defenders in the penalty box.

533
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,728
- [gasps] You're serious?!
- [laughs]

534
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,813
- Hey, we might make round 16!
- [Gyu-jo] Good chance.

535
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,233
[man 1] No way. They're on
a completely different level physically.

536
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,861
[Sang-hak chatting nearby]

537
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,237
Right, but he comes back later.

538
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,033
And in between all that, things get
chaotic when Arnie disappears. [sighs]

539
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,119
[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-yeon and Sang-hak</i>
<i>clicked in a lot of ways.</i>

540
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,580
<i>Especially films.</i>

541
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,709
<i>Why would you talk about films</i>
<i>in a photography club?</i>

542
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,879
<i>She should've joined a movie club instead.</i>

543
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,842
[Su-mi] Ta-da. I bought ice cream.

544
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,761
- [man 1] Okay!
- [Gyu-ho] How much?

545
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,971
- [Su-mi] 10,000.
- How much? 10,000 won? Okay.

546
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,807
- Did you buy Fanfare too?
- [Su-mi] Of course.

547
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,185
- Hey, Dwaeji Bar is Eun-jung's.
- [A-ra] Fanfare, Fanfare!

548
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,855
That's the one you want, right?
You want me to eat yours?

549
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,191
- [A-ra] Thank you, Su-mi!
- [Su-mi] Let's hear it again.

550
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,694
- [Gyu-ho] Thank you.
- [A-ra] Thank you.

551
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,071
[Su-mi] You can have this, punk.
Just eat what you're given.

552
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,706
I'm curious why you're not dating anyone?

553
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,042
- Hmm?
- There's nobody that you even sorta like?

554
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,545
I do have a little bit of a crush.

555
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,923
- A crush?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,259
Who is it?

557
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,469
[Sang-yeon] Well,

558
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,596
it's this guy

559
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,266
from Gangneung that I met online.

560
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,477
[relieved chuckle] "Online"?

561
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,022
Wait, Gangneung must've been
a long time ago.

562
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,566
Why aren't you dating each other?

563
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,569
People can't date everyone they like.

564
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,031
Yeah, but you're not everyone.
Who would ever turn you down?

565
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,702
The feeling wasn't mutual.

566
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,413
[sighs] It was really annoying.

567
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
Because it was one-sided.

568
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,834
"One-sided"?

569
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,504
[chuckles] You met him online,
but did you ever see his face?

570
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,589
[Sang-yeon] Mm-hmm.

571
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,967
- I followed him around.
- [shutter clicks]

572
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,177
You followed him?

573
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,971
More like… I stalked him.

574
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,640
[both chuckling]

575
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
Why? You should've confessed.

576
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,644
[Sang-yeon sighs]

577
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,397
He has a girlfriend now.

578
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,110
Oh… That's a real bummer.

579
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,112
[camera clicking]

580
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,655
What kind of person is he?

581
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,283
Is he handsome?

582
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,586
He couldn't be ugly.

583
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
He caught my eye.

584
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,677
I wonder what type of person
you would be drawn to.

585
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,554
I'm genuinely curious.

586
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,265
It's all history. [grunts softly]

587
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,726
I'm done. I'm gonna meet someone new.

588
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,564
Okay, I hope
you bring back a stud. [chuckles]

589
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,609
- [Sang-hak] What?
- Huh? It's nothing.

590
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,402
[pleasant music playing]

591
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,668
STORIES ON FILMS

592
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,147
- [Sang-yeon] You're reading about films?
- Oh my God!

593
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,569
Uh… You almost scared me to death.

594
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,864
[chuckles softly]
Why do you look so surprised?

595
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,199
- When'd you get here?
- [Sang-yeon] Last night.

596
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,578
- What?
- I developed almost 100 photos. Wanna see?

597
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,373
I kept getting it almost right.

598
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,624
It was driving me crazy

599
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,210
because I was getting different results
every single time,

600
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,129
but then everything just clicked.

601
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,213
Look there.

602
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,259
Those are the ones that survived.

603
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,052
Which one's the best?

604
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,097
[Eun-jung] Oh, well,

605
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,392
they all look really similar.

606
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,144
Really?

607
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,355
I can't seem to pick though.

608
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,403
You spent all night
developing this one photo?

609
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,781
Oh yeah. I think
photo development is so much fun.

610
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,074
[chuckles]

611
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,623
[Eun-jung sighs]

612
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,002
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I… could never beat her.</i>

613
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,171
[Su-mi] These photos came out so well.

614
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,007
Each one is amazing in its own unique way.

615
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,468
- Maybe it's the camera.
- [Sang-yeon chuckles]

616
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,262
Cameras don't take photos by themselves.
A person takes them.

617
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,265
What about these?
I'm not sure which of them came out best.

618
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,435
Wow. You did an amazing job
developing all these photos.

619
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,897
They're all unique, and the color gradient
in each one feels so vibrant.

620
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,981
Which one, everyone?

621
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,651
[Gyu-ho] We should include this
in our August exhibition.

622
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,779
[adult Eun-jung] <i>All the emotions</i>
<i>I had forgotten came rushing back.</i>

623
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,991
- [Gyu-ho] You could go pro, Sang-yeon.
- [Su-mi] Oh-ho! Ms. Pro. [chuckles]

624
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,035
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Being around Sang-yeon</i>

625
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,872
<i>always made</i>
<i>everything about me feel ordinary</i>

626
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,959
<i>and utterly unimportant.</i>

627
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,755
[Sang-hak] Yeah, I think so.

628
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,549
[Sang-yeon] I don't know
how to express emotions through…

629
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,345
Why didn't you show us your photos?

630
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,349
Didn't you develop the photos
of the owner of the side dish shop?

631
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,018
I did.

632
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,270
I developed them, but…

633
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,940
Let's see them. Weren't you gonna
use one for the exhibit?

634
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,944
Well, I might go with something else.

635
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,946
- Something else?
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,407
They're just images of people's faces.

637
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,701
They seem a little too simple.

638
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,703
Why? I think they're great.

639
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,919
Hey, what's wrong?

640
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,464
Is there something
that's making you feel upset again?

641
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,221
[sighs] It's just…

642
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,559
your photographs have this wow factor.

643
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,645
And Sang-yeon's photos
have that same thing.

644
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,440
But my photos are boring
compared to yours.

645
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,899
Really?

646
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,235
[Eun-jung] Mm-hmm.

647
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,822
I've been observing you both.

648
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,075
It's clear how extremely talented
you both are.

649
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,370
You'll be successful no matter what.

650
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,541
- And you don't think that you will?
- No.

651
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,254
Well, what would you like to become?

652
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:13,968
Me?

653
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,265
- I'm not really that good at anything.
- Don't say that. You're really eloquent.

654
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,644
I'm not that eloquent.

655
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,733
Aw, come on don't be like this
over something so trivial.

656
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,277
You have me next to you.

657
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,656
What?

658
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,326
[pensive music playing]

659
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,370
What's that supposed to mean?

660
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:42,955
[Sang-hak] Hm?

661
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,292
- What?
- What exactly did you mean by that?

662
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,047
- Mean by what? I was just--
- You think that you're my everything?

663
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,508
Eun-jung--

664
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,968
It doesn't matter how much I like you

665
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,763
or how proud that I am
to say that I'm your girlfriend.

666
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,808
I'm not successful because you are.
That success is yours.

667
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,895
That's not what I meant.

668
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,147
Your photos are perfectly fine--

669
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,733
It's not enough
to have perfectly fine photos!

670
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,570
Eun-jung, I…

671
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,957
[cell phone vibrating]

672
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,808
[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-hak couldn't</i>
<i>solve everything.</i>

673
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,687
<i>He could never soothe this anxiety.</i>

674

Earlier when?

712
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,692
During the kickoffs.

713
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,781
I don't recall. What was I thinking about?

714
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:33,662
I must've been thinking things like,
"I guess people like this kinda stuff."

715
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,997
Just wondering.

716
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,667

It's exciting.

00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,266
Eun-jung, can I ask you a question?

720
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,149
Do you ever feel like
you could just break away?

[sighs]

722
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,450
Similar to "estrangement."

You pretend and strive to make, hmm…

724

something into your reality.

725
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,632
But eventually, you can't keep up.
So you just give up and stop.

726
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,976
You disconnect.

727
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,234
Are you reminded of your brother?

Mm-hmm.

00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,702
I've been meaning to ask.

731
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,748
- You always talk about him as if--
- As if he were still alive?

732
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,960
Mm-hmm.

733
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,760
Not everybody who knew him
in the old neighborhood

734
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,307

735

he's alive and well somewhere,

[sighs] Well, even so…

769
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,844
40,000 won should be reasonable.

Why not sell me off too?

- Five.
- [Eun-jung] Fifty thousand?

781
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,256
I'll be able to add 2.5 five million.

I'll visit you real soon. I promise.

844
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,593
Yes, mm-hmm. Talk to you soon.

845
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,098
I didn't tell your mom we were here.

846
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,312
Let's just… go see her.

847
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,898
Come with us.

848
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,113
Why are you like this?

849
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,075
I even lied for you
because you asked me not to tell your mom.

850
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,993
We'll tell her we planned to surprise her.

851
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:19,122
Are you sure about just showing up?
I think I should just stay down here.

852
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,833
She'll be glad that you're here.
Come on up with us.

853

[doorbell rings]

854
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,935
[Ms. Yoon] Who is it?

855
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,353
Hi.

856
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,189
- [Ms. Yoon] Sang-yeon?
- Mm-hmm.

857
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,026
[Ms. Yoon] You should've called.
I wasn't expecting you.

858
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,990
Eun-jung?

859
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,952
[chuckles softly]

860
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,204
Ms. Yoon.

861
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,125
Ms. Yoon.

862

[gasps, chuckles delightedly]

863
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,546
- It's so good to see you.
- [Eun-jung] Mmm.

864
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,881
What brings you all the way here?

865
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,050
Uh…

866
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,387
- Oh, hello, ma'am. I'm--
- Sang-hak <i>oppa.</i>

867
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,557
He's in our photography club.

868

[uneasy music playing]

869
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,693
I forgot to mention my brother's name
is Sang-hak as well. Cheon Sang-hak.

870
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,251
Where are my manners?
Come inside. Come in.

00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,842
Oh,

873
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,511
No, not this way.

874
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,892
- Have a seat.
- Yes, thanks.

875
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,477
- [Ms. Yoon] This way.
- Okay.

876
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,855
[Ms. Yoon] I would've bought something
if I'd known you were coming.

877
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,815
[Eun-jung] Oh, no, it's fine.

878
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,735
We had a late lunch,
so you don't need to fix anything.

879
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,990
- Is plum tea gonna be all right?
- Oh, uh… I love plum tea.

880
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,955
Are you and your mom close?

881
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:26,833
Well--

882
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,211
My mom's really close
with my older brother.

883
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,882
I bet her favorite person in the world
is Cheon Sang-hak.

884
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,675
I'm sure.

885
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,193
- You might need one more…
- [Ms. Yoon] Right.

886
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,076
- I should've made dinner for you all.
- Not at all.

887
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,663
We're having a club barbecue,
so we'll have plenty to eat.

888
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,914
[Ms. Yoon] That's good.

889
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,374
Take care.

890
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,127
Eun-jung, you too.

891
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,130
- I'll call.
- Okay.

892
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,843

I couldn't throw it away
because it was so beautiful.

896
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,164
I don't think Sang-hak…
even knew that it was there.

for reading it without asking.

Your father gave you that clover?

902
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,585
Yes.

903
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,882
I'm so grateful to you that…

904
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,928
you gave something so precious to my son.

I'm sorry.

Eun-jung.

Every time they see each other,
they do this.

They're practically best friends.

No, she's more like her…

favorite student.

916
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,761
My mom wasn't even
Eun-jung's homeroom teacher,

917
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,347
but she liked her the best.

918
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,225
I suppose it was worth it for her.

919
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,520
She still gets to be considered
an amazing person. Right?

920
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,648
It figures.

921
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,942
She played favorites
with her children too.

922
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,991
My mom preferred my older brother over me.

923
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,994
Obviously.

924
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,708
She's the worst mother
in the whole world, right?

925
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,126
You don't have to explain.

926
