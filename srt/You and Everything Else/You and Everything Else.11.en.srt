3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,017
[Hee-jin] What's the rush?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,893
Location scouting. I'm late.

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,061
[Hee-jin] Have fun.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,313
[sighs] I'm sorry I'm late.

7
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,899
You're right on time. Don't worry.

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,028
All right, let's get started.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,489
It's not in operation any longer,
which is great.

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,700
But it used to be a church,
so I don't know

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,785
if it'll be convincing as an orphanage.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,580
While the outside may be
a bit too overbearing,

13
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,956
that could work to our advantage.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,167
A sense of claustrophobia.
An ominous feeling.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,418
[Eun-jung] I agree.

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,588
We could put the director's office
at the end of the corridor.

17
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,883
I think it might work well
for Su-jin's panic attack scene.

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,469
Great work, everyone.

19
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,637
- [Seung-ju] Good work.
- Thank you so much.

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,182
I noticed you left pretty late last night.

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,600
[Sang-hak] How'd you know?

22
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,935
Producer Cheon and I
were coming from dinner,

23
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,854
and we spotted your car.

24
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,273
Director Lee Chan-seok wanted to talk.

25
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,859
But it wasn't Director Lee
next to you, was it?

26
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,656
Ah, well, I ran into Producer Ryu
and offered her a ride.

27
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,576
[chuckles awkwardly] Right.

28
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,412
Luckily we ran into each other,
and I had a comfortable ride home.

29
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,039
So it was Producer Ryu?

30
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,917
I thought perhaps
it was a girlfriend of yours.

31
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,421
- I'll meet you at the location.
- [man] Okay.

32
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,344
[Seung-ju] I guess they aren't dating.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,889
[sighs] You were being so nosy.

34
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,225
You were watching him closely.

35
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,185
You like him that much?

36
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,815
That's why I suggested we look elsewhere.

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,944
You do like him, huh?

38
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,488
What's so special about him?

39
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,535
If it hadn't been for him,
I wouldn't be here now.

40
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,662
[Seung-ju] What do you mean?

41
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,250
Because I would've burned out
when my mother died.

Why watch them again?

Is that why you were so insistent
on meeting with me?

You don't come up
to the rooftop anymore either.

[Yu-chan] It's just awkward.

No.

75
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Then what?

00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,156
The old me would have said yes

when a guy like you asked me out.

78
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
Not now though.

79
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,209
Why not?

80
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,878
I'm sure how it'll end.

You don't learn about each other.

83
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,597
You just learn a lot
about who you are as a person.

About your flaws and your issues.

85
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,229
So to elaborate on what I learned,

86
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,316
I'm not settling for anything below 100%.

87
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,277

88
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah.

She needs to like
and trust them 100%, she says.

90
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,786
I doubt that kind of person exists
for anyone.

91
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,622
That's why she won't commit.
'Cause no such person exists.

92
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,916
[Hee-jin] I thought
she was smarter than this.

93
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,587
I mean, the heart isn't something
that can be controlled at will like that.

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,008
So what's next? Giving up?

95
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,428
No way. Why'd I buy you a meal just now?

Nice to see you again.

00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,515
Oh, right, we've met before.

110
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,683
I remember.

111
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,187

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,689
- It's a pleasure.
- [Seung-jae] Hmm, likewise.

113

[Jeong] And that's
Producer Cheon Sang-yeon.

114

Hi, how are you?
I look forward to working with you.

115
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,782
Looking forward to it too.

116
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,786
- [manager] Okay, let's sit.
- Yeah, let's sit down.

117
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,330
[manager chuckles] Of course.
I hope you didn't wait too long.

- [Jeong] No, not at all. No.
- [manager chuckles]

Oh, totally.

[Jeong clears throat]

123
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,980
Director Gyeong,
what are your thoughts on the storyboard?

124
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,066
It seems like the action
was pretty intense?

125
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,444
Well, that would be nothing
for a guy like you.

126
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,488
You're such an athletic action star.

127
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,156
You rarely use a double, right?

128
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,118
Oh, well…

129
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,162
[Jeong] Hmm.

130
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,666
Even if you use a double,
the scene is still yours.

131
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,254
If the audience still believes it's you,
then it's you.

132
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm sure the director
wouldn't allow it anyway.

133
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,885
If you try to do
dangerous scenes yourself.

134
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,889
Of course. Your emotional portrayal
is the most important thing.

135
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,517
[chuckles softly]

136
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,108
Your name is Cheon Sang-yeon?

137
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,402
May I call you <i>nuna</i>?

138
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,074
[Sang-yeon] Of course.
That would be an honor.

139
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,910
The honor's all mine, <i>nuna.</i>

140
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,955
[Sang-yeon] Thank you, but

141
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,209
we should go slowly
and… let it happen naturally.

142
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,967
- I'm sensing a hit here. Great vibe, guys.
- [all chuckling]

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,512
You're so fast to get folks
to just warm up to you.

144
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,306
Even a guy like Lee Seung-jae.

145
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,224
It's a secret.

146
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,894
[scoffs] A secret.
They already knew each other.

147
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,854
- [Sang-yeon scoffs]
- [Jeong] What?

148
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,232
So you were pretending you hadn't met?
How'd you know the guy?

149
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,652
Before he was known as Lee Seung-jae,
he was Lee Seung-yong.

150
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,197
He wouldn't have wanted people
to know that though.

151
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,866
What was that about the action scene?

152
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,327
Oh, I just heard rumors
he had issues with his knee,

153
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,746
and he confirmed it was true
with his face.

154
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,999
Whoa. How come you're so good
at reading people's faces?

155
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,292
You're really a natural.

156
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,086
[Sang-yeon chuckles]
It's my job to read people.

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,130

I was wondering whose daughter
it was who was looking so sad there.

161
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,979
Mine, it turns out.

162
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,400
[groans softly] Why? Something going on?

163
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,362
[Eun-jung] I'm just a little tired.

164
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,033
Did Sang-yeon say when she'd visit again?

165
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,869
Did you mention it?

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,540
Maybe would be nice
to cook her a meal again.

167
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,793
Blah, blah, blah.

168
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,462
Mom, you always say that.
She's not starving.

169
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
She's completely fine.

170
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,092
She eats well, so please stop
asking for her to come over.

171
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,761
She may be eating well and doing fine.

172
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,640
Although, she's probably lonely.
She's truly alone in this world.

173
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,809
[pensive music continues]

174
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,707
Hey, if you decide to move places again,
tell me, all right?

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,377
I don't have any money. Just go.

176
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,296
[father sighs]

177
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,172
It's the last time, I swear.

178
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,637
Hey, help me out just this once…
or your dad might end up in jail.

179
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,764
Then go to jail.

180
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
[tense music playing]

181
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,269
[pensive music resumes]

182
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,938
What the hell? Like mother, like daughter.

183
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,523
[door closes]

184
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,656
[can opening]

185
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,335
[sighs]

186
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,464
[sighs]

187
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,160
Was Producer Cheon born rich?

188
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Her outfits always look impeccable.

189
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,665
She makes cheap clothes look good.

190
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,874
Oh really?

191
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,543
She's always had that gift.

192
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,046
She can make a shirt worth 10,000 won
look like 10 billion.

193
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,840
- Making it look expensive, you mean?
- Ugh, what the hell?

194
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,092
Oh my God!

195
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,885
You scared me. Don't do that.

196
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,056
You feel insecure in her presence?
This outfit looks really pricey.

197
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,559
Hey, these are designer. They cost a lot.

198
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,604
Hey, Yu-chan. Maybe go
be annoying somewhere else, eh?

199
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,689
Yeah, I agree.

200
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,567
Folks on set feel insecure around someone
who knows scripts well like you.

201
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,152
I relate. I'm working on set a lot.

202
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,489
Whatever. But the script didn't even
come up during the meeting yesterday.

203
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,617
I suppose, Producer Ryu,
you're the figurehead, then.

204
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,329
- Why don't you get lost?
- [Hee-jin laughs]

205
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,665
- I just got here.
- [Hee-jin] Ah…

206
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,166
[cell phone ringing]

207
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,670
Mm. Director Gyeong?

208
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,296
Yeah, it is.

209
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,715
[clears throat]

210
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,884
Yes, Director Gyeong.

211
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,137
[footsteps approaching]

212
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,600
- [knocking]
- [Seung-ju] Come on in.

213
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,229
Ah, have a seat.

214
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,777
What's going on with them?

215
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,697
No idea. Told her to come in.

216
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,246
[Seung-ju] How did you
come up with that? [chuckles]

217
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,707
You brought scene 45 to life.
I appreciate that.

218
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,919
[chuckles] Well, I do agree
that the scene slowed down at that point.

219
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,337
I wanted to find a compromise

220
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,424
by repositioning the important lines
without losing anything.

221
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,263
So this is what Producer Cheon meant,
I guess.

222
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,222
What?

223
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,642
[Seung-ju] I am very impressed.
Thanks for your feedback.

224
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,478
- [both chuckle]
- I'm glad.

225
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,105
[Seung-ju] Since we're on the topic…

226
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,356
[dialogue muffled]

227
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,905
[sighs softly]

228
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,116
- [Sang-hak] Hi, everyone.
- [man] Hello.

229
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,201
[woman] Hello.

230
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,999
- [man] Here's the scouting schedule.
- Ah, yeah.

231
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,751
[uneasy music playing]

232
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
[Seung-ju] Why haven't you moved
to our floor yet?

233
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,760
You should be here,
at least till preproduction's done.

234
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,596
This way, I can consult with you
on the script if I need to.

235
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,599
I could use an EP who isn't indifferent.

236
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,060
Sounds good. Will do, sir.

237
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,615
[Eun-jung] Good morning!

238
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,408
- [others] Good morning.
- I'll grab that.

239
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,869
Production designer's coming soon.

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,790
[man] You're here.
Director Gyeong says he's on the way.

241
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,918
- Where will he be sitting?
- [man] Behind shotgun.

242
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,545
Oh, where do you wanna sit?

243
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,715
- Oh, I'll just--
- Of course, you're next to me.

244
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,133
Here.

245
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,388
- All right! The front seat!
- [Seung-ju] So you like the front seat?

246
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,848
[all] Morning, Director Gyeong.

247
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,641
[Eun-jung] The front's always
nice and cool.

248
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,767
[Seung-ju] Morning.

249
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,355
"Byeonsan, Chuncheon, Sokcho, Yangyang."

250
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,234
- This is a packed schedule, huh?
- [Yu-chan] Brace yourself.

251
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,153
I'm bracing with you
behind the wheel. [chuckling]

252
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,322
- [Yu-chan laughs]
- [gentle Korean ballad playing]

253
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,450
- So which location…?
- [Yu-chan] Let me check one thing.

254
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,619
- [Eun-jung chuckles]
- [Yu-chan] Yeah, see?

255
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
[Eun-jung] Oh, nice.

256
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,613
[Yu-chan chuckles] Go to sleep.

257
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,490
[scoffs] No, I'm not tired.

258
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,952
- You should wipe your drool at least.
- [Eun-jung] I didn't drool.

259
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:12,995
[Yu-chan] Here.

260
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
I said I wasn't tired.

261
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,916
[Yu-chan] It's a good pillow.

262
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,002
[Eun-jung] Oh, yeah. That's nice.

263
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,088
- [Yu-chan] No joke, right?
- [Eun-jung] It's perfect. Ah.

264
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,300
[woman 1] This looks fine.

265
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,261
- It's not too narrow, huh?
- [woman 1] No.

266
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,096
- I think it's over there.
- Ah, yeah.

267
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,231
[woman 2] Oh, it's pretty decent.

268
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,110
Tourist season, they're pretty booked.
We'll get you a room each tomorrow.

269
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,362
[Sang-hak] Okay, great.

270
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,739
- We gotta sleep doubles here. Sorry.
- No worries.

271
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,907
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,034
Just for tonight.

273
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,079
[Eun-jung sighs softly]

274
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,832
[Yu-chan] Okay. The film crew's all set.

275
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,467
Which one do you want?

276
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,802
Take your pick.

277
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,389
I'll go wash up first.

278
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,604
[Sang-yeon coughing]

279
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,321
[coughing continues]

280
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,994
Are you feeling sick?

281
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,831
[sighs]

282
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,291
[uneasy music playing]

283
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,171
[coughs]

284
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,133
- [coughing]
- Sang-yeon?

285
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,640
[gasps]

286
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,019
Uh…

287
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,146
Oh God.

288
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,815
Oh…

289
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,951
Do you have any medication
specifically for colds here?

290
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,952
[register beeps]

291
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,413
[cashier] We're all out, actually.

292
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,083
Is there a pharmacy
that might still be open nearby?

293
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,753
[cashier] There's a pharmacy
in the hospital

294
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,172
that should be open until 10:00 p.m.

295
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,716
- It's kind of far, though.
- [Sang-hak] Cold medicine?

296
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,385
- Uh…
- Are you sick?

297
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,558
Thank you. It's nothing.
Well, I hope you enjoy your night.

298
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,730
- [man] She seems fine. Wonder what's up.
- [doorbell rings]

300
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,072
Forget it.

305
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,431
You started up again?

306
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,142
What if I did?

307
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,980
Wait. Where were you?
How come you're so sweaty?

308
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,275
- Drug store.
- What's the matter?

309
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,528
Nothing.

310
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,739
Why did you give us
so much grief about smoking

311
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,908
if you were just going to start up again?

312
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,118
All right, all right.

313
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,580
[breathing heavily]

314
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,748
Here. [sniffles]

315
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,751
Medicine.

318
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,842
Where'd you get this?

319
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,678
[breathing heavily]
Just around the corner.

320
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,180
You got a fever? What happened?

321
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,391
Sang-yeon does.

322
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,018
I'll make sure she gets it. Thanks.

323
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,772
Okay.

324
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,733
I'm just glad you're okay. [sniffs]

325
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,117
[Yu-chan] What's with the fuss?

326
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,828
[Eun-jung] Sang-yeon.

327
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,164
Sang-yeon.

328
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,208
Sit up.

329
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,919
I got some medicine for you.

332
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,615
Put on an extra layer.

333
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,578
Thanks so much.

334
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,791
For this too.

335
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,173
I didn't buy it. Sang-hak did.

336
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,651
I wanna say thanks…
for the medicine last night.

337
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,238
It was nothing. You feeling okay?

338
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,449
Ah.

339
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,452
So you were the one
with the fever last night.

340
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,997
We thought Producer Ryu was sick,
since she was looking for medicine.

341
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,416
Ah.

342
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,640

00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,243
Why are you yelling?

522
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,707
[Sang-hak] Oh.

523
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,628
- [Eun-jung] Oh no.
- [car indicator beeps]

524
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,423
[woman groaning softly]

525
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,633
- [Sang-hak] Ma'am.
- Oh…

526
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,177
- Are you okay?
- [woman] Oh.

527
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,511
- Are you okay?
- Oh dear.

528
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,181
- One, two, three.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

529
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,600
- [Eun-jung] Are you all right? One moment.
- I got this.

530
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,728
Oh, that's so heavy.

531
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,271
[Sang-hak] Are you hurt?

532
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,816
Oh, no, you don't have to clean that.
You'll ruin your clothes.

533
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,569
- Oh no, don't worry about it.
- Oh. I know, but still--

534
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,655
- [Sang-hak] I can have them washed.
- You can stop, it's fine.

535
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,200
[groans softly] Is this your wife?

536
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,078
- [Sang-hak] Uh…
- Huh?

537
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,164
- Oh, no.
- Well, isn't she a pretty little thing?

538
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,833
- You're so pretty. [chuckles]
- [chuckling] Oh, no, ma'am.

539
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,251
[woman] Just lovely.

540
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,003
Wait, use this instead.

541
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,506

Here you go.

544
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,229
You do look very pretty.

545
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,023
[chuckles] You could use a wipe yourself.

546
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,484
- You missed a little right there.
- Whoa!

547
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,033
I've got it. Worry about yourself.

548
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,380
- [Seung-ju] Wow, spacious.
- [woman] Oh, I like the rust. [chuckles]

549
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,675
- [man] This spot's interesting.
- [woman] This looks fine.

550
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,470
[man] This space and that space,
so these two here.

551
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,099
[woman] We should confirm with the owners
how much we can change for set dressing.

552
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,726
We definitely need to dress
the doors and the roof.

553
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,358
- [Seung-ju] Hey.
- It's this way.

554
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,568
Right over here.

555
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,905
- [Seung-ju] This isn't bad.
- [man] Yeah, it's okay.

556
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,701
[Seung-ju] Good work, everyone.

557
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,371
Why isn't Producer Ryu here?
Is she feeling all right?

558
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,332
She looked fine to me.

559
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
Tell her to come. She has to try
the <i>hoe </i>in Sokcho at least once.

560
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,504
- [Sang-hak] Yeah.
- Yeah, Producer Song went to get her.

561
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,047
[Seung-ju] Oh, he did? Great.

562
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,428
- Why are you alone?
- She just said she's got no appetite.

563
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,681
[Seung-ju] No appetite?

564
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,808
She's really missing out.

565

Have you been drinking?

568
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,373
I was worried you might've caught my cold.

569
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,878
I told Yu-chan that I wasn't sick.

570
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,466
I'll have one too.

571
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,304
Are you sure about that?
You're still sick.

572
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,723
- [can opening]
- [Sang-yeon] Don't you know?

573
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,226
The cure is alcohol.

I can be grateful too.

[Eun-jung chuckles]

583
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,443
My mom mentions you often, actually.

584
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,990
- Even though it annoys me.
- [chuckles softly]

585
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,078
I wanna have <i>sujebi </i>right now.

586
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,875
Gosh, I wonder if it's the rain.

587
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,421
But I'm really craving your mom's <i>sujebi.</i>

588
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,635
You should go eat some.
I bet she'd be so happy to see you.

589
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,554
Visit her without you?

590
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,807
That would be awkward, I guess.

591
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,518
Maybe… we could go on one of our days off.

592
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,079
Do you visit Ms. Yoon…

593
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,166
ever?

594
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,464
No.

595
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,466
I haven't been.

596
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,518
I hate the ocean.

597
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,023
But still,

598
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,442
I like <i>hoe </i>a lot.

00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,452
Did something go on with Sang-hak earlier?

601
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,289
No.

602
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,126
It was pretty clear
you were annoyed with him.

603
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,546
[sighs] Yeah, well it was annoying.

604
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,383
I had to go out and get him
when it was pouring rain.

605
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,927
Is that all it is?

606
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,682
What else would it be?

607
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,314
So why act like this? If it's fine.

608
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,652
So it's awkward between you two.

609
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,530
Does everyone need to know that?

You're the only one who seems bothered.

613
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,674
It's completely normal
to skip dinner after work.

614
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,344
- Why am I being judged for that?
- The job includes dinner.

615
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,516

- [woman] This game again?
- Let's go!

645

but you're not allowed

would reciprocate your feelings?

actually likes somebody?

Of course she would.

that question and answer even mean?
