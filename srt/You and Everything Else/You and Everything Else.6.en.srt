We called her "Dylan."
She was also in the photo club.

Sure.

[Eun-jung] You were too, right?

It had to be strange to find out
that Sang-hak knew your brother so well.

Of course, yeah.
It was quite a shock to learn.

if you already knew who I was.

177
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,732
If I said something…

178
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,278
what would it have changed?

179
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,947
Huh?

180
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,037
Well, a lot. [chuckles]

181
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,623
Everything, 'cause you're his sister.

182
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,795
If you had mentioned it from the start,
I would've been even nicer to you.

183

But I don't need any of that.

184

I'm cool if you just act how you want.

185
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,898
[chuckles] But… but why?

186

- It's nice when people are nice.

187
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,322
Thanks for these.
Are you staying here longer?

188
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah, Eun-jung's coming,
then we'll meet up with the--

189
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,369
Sounds good.

190
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,373
Oh.

191
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,584
No, it's fine. I'll get it.

Sang-yeon said she'd go on date? What?

195
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,062
Mm-hmm. You look surprised?

196
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,066
Well, because she's basically never liked
any guy she's ever met

197
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,442
in the history of ever.

198
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,070
When? When did she tell you
she'd go on a blind date?

199
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
Just now. I just saw her on campus,
told her about A-ra turning down the date,

200
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,075
and she volunteered.

201
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,870
- [A-ra] That's so weird.
- [laughter]

202
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,581
What's with her?

203
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,834
Oh, and also a Big Mac.

204
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,628
- Could you make that two Big Mac combos?
- Okay.

205
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,755
- No, it's my treat.
- [Sang-hak] Uh--

206

- That I won't be home tonight.

00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,873
Um, so Sang-yeon… what's she like?

216
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,250
What kind of question is that?

217
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,878
You've known her for almost a year.

218
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,589
You must have an idea by now.
What do you think?

219
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,840
I don't know.

220
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,219
She just seems a bit hard to read,
at least more so than I thought.

221
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,804
More complex.

222
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,267
She's complex. You're right about that.

223
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,396
I think she operates
in a different way than me.

224
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,231
How so?

225
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,487
I mentioned this. When she's struggling,
she pretends to be totally okay.

226
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,114
I think it's probably her pride.

227
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,451
I'm open about everything.

228
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,827

You're late, then.

Oh, hey.

00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,410
- Early appointment?
- Class. First period.

236
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,330
Hey.

237
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,794
Did you tell Eun-jung that I asked you
to try and go get that number I wanted?

238
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,754
No, I haven't. Why?

239
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,591
Then I would really appreciate it
if you don't tell her.

240
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:51,927
Why?

241
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,889
'Cause she doesn't need to know.

242
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,020
Until my brother's suicide is more clear,
I'd prefer to keep it between us.

243
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,067
Sure, I guess. She's curious
about your brother, too, though.

244
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,360
I'll tell her.

245
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,446
When I'm prepared to, I will.

246
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah.

247
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,410
Fine, then. Our secret.

248
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,080
And

249
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,334

I also wanna keep that between us.

Yay, now we're all late!

255
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,101
It's pretty good.

256
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,313
Just "pretty good?"

257
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,356
It's an A-plus, man!

258
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,942
Remind me what your grade was last year?

259
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,652
A… minus.

260
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,654
[both laugh]

261
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,076
It's really well-written though. I guess
that's what an A-plus requires, huh?

262
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,204
Really? You think it's well-written?

263
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,623
All I did was write about
how bad the movie was.

264
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,335
No, you didn't just write about that.
This is really honest and well-balanced.

265
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,087
You present a strong argument here.

266
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,964
- Think so? [chuckles]
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,842
But I actually thought
that the film was so amazing.

[both chuckle]

269
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,139
I never knew that so many things
could be captured in just one shot.

00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,224
It blew my mind.

271
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,727
What's even more fascinating
was the professor's lecture.

In our last class,
we watched Fellini's <i>I Vitelloni.</i>

the friends were asleep,

- You like it?
- Understatement of the century.

00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,721
So cool. How'd you think
of something like this?

286
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,390
You love taking pictures,

287
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,352
so I thought, well,
since cameras aren't allowed on the base,

288
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,062
that would be the next best thing.

Mm. I mean, I couldn't find it yet,
but I'll definitely keep trying.

350
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,893
What do you want with her contact?

351
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,271
Oh, it's just…

352
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,566
something to do with my brother
I'd like to know.

353
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,614
My brother, what was he like?

354
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,658
Moonee?

355
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,911
- [tender music playing]
- [Sang-hak inhales slowly] Mm…

356
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,496
Moonee was…

357
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,501
- [Sang-yeon clears throat]
- [laughter]

358
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,710
He was so very meticulous.

359
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,504
- Hilarious.
- Yeah, he's right.

360
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,340
We could be halfway through eating,
and he'd still be mixing his food.

361
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,592
- Ah! That's so stupid though!
- [man] Mixing nonstop!

362
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,137
Of course, he never minded,
but we hated it.

363
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,764
Oh, he… he seemed weak at first glance.

364
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
Definitely not. Not at all.

365
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,060
You remember he said
"You have no right!" right to his face?

366
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,479
Yeah, sure I do. In Incheon or something.

367
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,772
- Right.
- Moonee got so angry.

368
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,441
[man] He just walked over and said--

369
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,693
He went over like,
"You have no right, sir."

370
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,403
- That sounds like him.
- "That's enough."

371
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,530
- Hey, get home safe, guys, okay? Call.
- Call me, dude.

372
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,490
Yeah. Call me.

373
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,908
[Sang-yeon giggles]

374
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,537
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I still got a couple of his photos.

375
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,538
You want any?

376
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,248
I would, yeah.

377
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,374
[both chuckle]

378
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,377
I want all of it.
If it was his, I wanna have it.

379
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,546
[chuckles] Yeah?

380
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,007
What's so funny, huh?

381
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,094
Nothing. I just thought
he would've found that adorable.

382
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,846
[chuckles]

383
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,640
My brother?

384
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,769
Did he ever mention me to you?

385
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,688
- Mention you?
- Yeah.

386
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,024
[Sang-hak] Well…

387
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,193
[Sang-yeon sighs] I shouldn't have asked.

388
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,615
Oh!

389
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,451
- Your bus home is this one, right?
- Yeah.

390
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,621
[gasps] I thought
you were taking the subway.

391
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,872
Didn't we pass it?

392
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,582
I'll go after I've seen you off.

393
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,629
Oh, I was gonna walk a bit before I go.
For the exercise.

394
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,175
Then how about we walk up to Jonggak?
To sober up.

395
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,594
Sounds great.

396
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,350
When he was younger,
he was a real chatterbox.

397
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,310
He used to play dolls with me

398
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,188
and he always brought me along
when he hung out with his friends.

399
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,314
Then puberty hit,

400
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,108
and he just totally changed.

401
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:32,155
I still really don't get it.
He became a different guy overnight.

402
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,618
You know, I've been mad
ever since, I think.

403
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,620
There were chances to talk, and I…

404
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,583
I would snap and just get angry,
like for no reason whatsoever.

405
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,919
Yeah, just like in his photo.

406
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,421
- [chuckles] Right, yeah.
- [chuckles]

407
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,216

[both chuckle]

409
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,263
Oh!

410
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,016
He did mention you.

411
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,602
You're a dancer, right?

412
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,648
- What?
- Yeah. He did mention you once.

413
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,400
He said you were a great dancer.

414
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,945
Sure. How would he know I was though?

415
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,491
I'm almost certain
that he never got to see me dance.

416
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,201
- Really?
- Mm.

417
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,287
He bragged that you were so good though.

418
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,664
Then he smiled, looked so proud.

419
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,459
- Really?
- Mm.

420
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,338
Now that I'm thinking about it,

421
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,009
about that photo he took,
the "keep out" one…

422
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,847
I think he wanted to go in, you know?

423
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,183
Otherwise, why would he have taken it?

424
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:48,315
Every photo he took of you
was a reflection of his affection.

425
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,775
[Sang-yeon chuckles softly]

426
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,902

Can't tell you how hard it was
to master that when I was little.

432
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,148
What do those lines mean?

433
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,816
Watch the movie. You'll get it.

434
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,485
Stephen Chow says it twice,

435
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,446
and the second round, man,
it really gets you right in the heart.

436
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,324
Oh. So it's a sad bit, huh?

437
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,244
Mm. Sorta. You could say that.

438
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,000
But I never thought my brother would be
such a huge fan of Stephen Chow films.

439
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,421
He liked <i>A Chinese Odyssey </i>at least.
Especially, <i>Part Two: Cinderella</i>.

440
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,673
Mm.

Should we just walk up
to the next station?

443
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,853
Just to wrap up this thread?

444

Why?

472

You're really cool
for having boundaries like that.

703

It's not about boundaries.

it's because he did something.

I'd rather be cheated on
than be treated like this.

707

Because from what she said,
