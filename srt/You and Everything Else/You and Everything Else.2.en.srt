00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,076
I should… be the one who should apologize.

346
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,246
I'm kinda embarrassed.

347
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,248
[gentle music playing]

348
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,752
People think I'm always so confident.

349
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,258
I'm the same.

350
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,180
There's things I don't show others

351
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,808
or let people know.

352
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,727
I keep them all to myself.

353
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,687
[Eun-jung] You do?

354
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,483
You mean that… you hide things too?

355
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,776
A lot of things.

356
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,029
Super…

357
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,823
super-duper… lots.

358
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,743
"Super-duper lots"?

359
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,579
Mm-hmm.

360
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,375
Would you like to take a look?

361
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,045
[tender music playing]

362
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,344
[winds camera]

363
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,728
[adult Eun-jung] <i>It was</i>
<i>a strange experience.</i>

364
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,606
<i>The alley through this lens…</i>

365
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,068
<i>was beautiful.</i>

366
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,945
<i>It was a lie.</i>

367
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,115
[Eun-jung] It's pretty.

368
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,249
I'm glad that I'm not the only one
who sees its beauty.

369
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,630
[music intensifies]

370
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,916
[music continues]

371
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,422
[music softens]

372
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,924
Don't you think
that Ms. Yoon is really lucky?

373
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,969
If I got you a tutor,

374
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,888
do you think you could get into SNU
and make me proud?

375
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,474
What kind of tutor?

376
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,352
An SNU student.

377
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,479
CONGRATULATIONS CHEON SANG-HAK
ILYEONG HIGH THIRD-YEAR

378
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,399
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Sang-hak </i>oppa

379
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,859
ACCEPTED TO SNU
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

380
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,611
Sang-yeon's <i>oppa</i>?

381
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,573
- [inhales deeply] Hmm…
- [music fades]

382
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,412
My <i>oppa</i>'s weird now. Don't be surprised.

383
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,999
What? Your <i>oppa</i>'s weird?

384
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,126
He doesn't really talk a lot.

385
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,711
I mean, he never did,

386
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,629
but right before he went to college,

387
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,756
he mentioned wanting
to major in photography,

388
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,218
and it made my dad really mad,
so now he only answers "yes" or "no."

389
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,598
- Then, how's he gonna tutor us?
- That's gonna be fine.

390
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,308
He's getting paid to teach us.

391
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,102
What I meant was
he won't talk about anything else.

392
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,520
Oh…

393
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,356
Wait, is that a new shirt?

394
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,109
Yeah.

395
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,988
- I just thought it looked pretty.
- Oh, it does.

396
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,283
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

397
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,120
- Hi, nice to see you.
- [door closes]

398
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,998
[chuckles]

399
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,545
Let's start with the first unit.

400
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,965
Polynomials and factorization.

401
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,553
Factorization will be first.

402
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,517
9 MONTHS LATER
AUTUMN 1997

403
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,103
The Korean language test was so hard.
Who comes up with questions like that?

404
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,188
[Sang-yeon] I know.

405
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,649
- Want some toast?
- [Eun-jung] Yeah.

406
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:35,033
I, um… I got the math questions right
and one wrong in English,

407
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,452
Korean language wasn't great.

408
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,247
Sang-yeon did so good
and basically only got one wrong.

409
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,723
[Sang-hak] I see why
this might've been tricky.

410
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,894
Number two makes sense as the answer,
but five is also correct.

411
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,440
I think it would be fair to describe
the character as pessimistic as well.

412
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,362
Ah. This word.

413
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,947
Do you know it?

414
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,992
"Pessimistic."

415
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,704
No, I've never heard of it.

416
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,874
It uses the characters
"to hate" and "the world."

417
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,377
Combined,
it's "to grow weary of the world."

418
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,213
In other words,
it means someone who is pessimistic.

419
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,549
Ah…

420
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,551
Pessimistic.

421
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,848
[peppy music playing]

422
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,528
"To grow weary… of the world."

423
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,449
[girl 1] Here!

424
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,161
Ooh. Whatcha doing?

425
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,914
I think I'm too pessimistic.

426
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,292
Pest… what?

427
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,710
[girl 2] Whoa!

428
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,131
I didn't say "pest." I said "pessimistic."

429
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,802
- [Na-mi] What's that mean?
- It's two characters put together.

430
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,055
"To hate" put together with "the world."

431
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,600
Hmm, okay.

432
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,228
Let's go to Ju-eun's later
to watch <i>Men in Black </i>together.

433
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,149
[chuckles softly] Yeah, okay.

434
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,279
[adult Eun-jung] <i>No one understood.</i>

435
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,991
<i>But whether I could</i>
<i>explain it correctly or not,</i>

436
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,494
<i>I used that word…</i>

437
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,662
The pen won't work.

438
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,205
<i>…whenever I got the chance.</i>

439
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,247
Use mine.

440
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,126
- The tip pops out on those pens.
- [Ju-eun] That happened to mine too.

441
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,296
- [Na-mi] Really?
- [Ju-eun] Yeah, but Monami pens are good.

442
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,632
Blue's all you're gonna get?

443
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,051
Blue can mean that you're sad.

444
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,260
[Ju-eun] Are you sad?

445
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,514
- I'm just too pessimistic.
- [Ju-eun] "Pessimistic"?

446
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,142
[Na-mi] Whatever.
She keeps talking about being a pest.

447
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,436
[Eun-jung] It's not "pest."
It's "pessimistic."

448
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,647
"To hate" put together with "the world."

449
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,858
- I'm a pessimistic person.
- Whatever.

450
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,819
That's what I am.

451
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,990
- [music fades]
- [door opens]

452
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,161

<i>I'm just too pessimistic.</i>

459
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,238
Eun-jung.

460
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,992
What do you like most in this world?

461
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,829
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Since</i>
<i>our tutoring sessions began…</i>

462
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,788

Well,

the thing I love most in this world…

466
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,300
Uh…

467
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,011
I think it's <i>Wink</i>, yeah.

468
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,888
<i>"Wink"</i>?

469
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,308
It's a <i>manhwa.</i>
It comes out every two weeks.

470
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,476
Ah…

471
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,436
[Eun-jung] I like <i>Wink, </i>H.O.T.,

472
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,063
and I love dogs,
but my mom won't let me have one.

473
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,566
I like corn a bunch too.

474
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,361
Oops, I forgot my mom. I love my mom too.

475
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,407
I like Sang-yeon, Na-mi,
Ju-eun, and a bunch of friends.

476
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,201
And Ms. Yoon too.

477
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,078
Your mom is such a good person.

478
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,956
Also…

479
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,131
our tutoring sessions.

480
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,259
[sweet music playing]

[Sang-hak chuckles]

483
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,274
What?

484
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,318
It's just Eun-jung.

485
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,948
She, uh… she considers herself
a pessimistic person.

486
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,866
- She said that?
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,744
So I asked her
if there was anything she liked.

488
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,206
She came up with
an endless list of things.

489
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,167
She says she considers
herself a pessimist…

490
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,545
[chuckling] …but she loves so many things.

491
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,924
I keep thinking about it.
It makes me laugh every time.

492
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,680
That's what makes you laugh?

493
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,057
[Sang-hak] Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

494
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,107
Eun-jung.

495
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,277
Oh. Hello.

496
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,328
Sang-yeon and I are gonna
get some <i>tteokbokki.</i>

497
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,998
Where are you coming from?

498
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,882
I just bought a new camera. Wanna see?

499
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah.

500
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,596
A Leica.

501
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,100
- It's called "Leica"?
- Mm-hmm.

502
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
It's the company
that makes the cameras.

503
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,939
Oh. It's pretty.

504
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,233
It's pretty like a girl's name.

505
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,653
Eun-jung.

506
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,533
There was once a dog named Laika.
Do you maybe know the story?

507
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,578
I don't.

508
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:59,083
The Russians used to…
conduct space research.

509
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,546
Instead of a human,
they sent a dog out into space.

510
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,924
And that dog was named Laika.

511
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,593
- Outer space?
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,762
What happened to it?

513
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,309
Well, it never managed
to return, actually.

514
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
Oh, that's sad.

515
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,857
It must've been really scared.

516
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,612
Maybe.

517
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,914
Yeah, but you have so many cameras.
Why another one?

518
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,086
Well, I've always wanted
this one the most.

519
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,545
Oh.

520
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,882
<i>Oppa</i>, you like taking pictures that much?

521
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,010
Mm.

522
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,765
When I take photos…

523
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,311
it puts my whole mind at ease.

524
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,106
How does it make it do that?

525
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,441
You're curious?

526
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,866
Look.

527
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,912
This photo was taken
at a shutter speed of 1/60,

528
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,416
which means one sixtieth of a second
is captured in this photograph.

529
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,585
It appears to be a still photo,

530
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,506
but it's actually capturing
1/60th of a second of movement.

531
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,386
Taking photographs is like
collecting time, essentially.

532
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,888
Although they capture
just a glimpse in time,

533
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,391
right there, in that moment is the truth.

534
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,396
However, sometimes
a photo can be misleading.

535
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,524
Since they capture only a fleeting moment,

536
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,819
sometimes what seems true
may not be the whole story.

537
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,737
[Eun-jung] Hmm.

538
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,991
What do you think? Is it interesting?

539
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,993
Absolutely.

540
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,704
Will you teach me
how to take pictures later?

541
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,417
You got it.

542
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,756
[chuckling in distance]

543
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,176
What do you think? Pretty?

544
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,802
[Eun-jung] Yeah, so nice.

545
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,024
- [Sang-yeon] What are you doing?
- You're here.

546
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,443
<i>Oppa </i>showed me his camera.

547
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,613
- You bought another one?
- Have a great time.

548
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,781
[Eun-jung] Bye.

549
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,080
I should've asked him to come.

550
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,499
Does he not like <i>tteokbokki</i>?

551
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,335
You asked him to show you?

552
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,420
[Eun-jung] Hmm?

553
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,671
The camera.

554
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,760
Oh. He told me he just bought it
and asked if I wanted to see it.

555
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,805
He said he'd teach me
how to take pictures.

556
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,518
He always talks about interesting stuff.
He speaks in the most unique way!

557
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,479
How come you told me he never talks?
He speaks fine to me.

558
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,814
Okay, so,

559
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,609
you think my brother talks to you
because you're special?

560
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,531
Hey. What's wrong?

561
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,282
You're being funny.

562
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,285
How am I being funny?

563
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,580
Do you really think you're pessimistic?

564
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,709
Well, that's random. Why bring that up?

565
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,546
You've been telling everybody that
for no reason.

566
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,965
You're too simpleminded
to ever be pessimistic.

567
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,218
Hey!

568
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,847
You have no idea what my mind is like.

569
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,808
If I'm simpleminded, or complex,
or pessimistic, you would never know--

570
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,017
You like my brother.

571
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,602
[tense music playing]

572
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,315
- No, I don't.
- Oh, come on.

573
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,527
I don't. Okay? You should listen
when someone tells you the truth.

574
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,611
[Sang-yeon] Okay, fine.

575
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,114
Well, he already has a girlfriend.

576
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,995
There's no chance even if you do like him.
Keep reminding yourself that.

577
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,000
- [tender music playing]
- Hey!

578
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,501
[sighs]

579
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,642
<i>Oppa</i>, do you have lead refills?

580
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,064
[Sang-yeon sighs]

581
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,035
[clicks pen]

582
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,254
- [Ms. Yoon] Did you have a good session?
- Yes. Goodbye, ma'am.

583
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,841
Oh, don't go, Eun-jung.
We ordered pizza. Eat some before you go.

584
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,509
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

585
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,430
[door opens, closes]

586
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,391
All right. Get home safe, mm?

587
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,270
- Take care.
- [Eun-jung] Have a good night.

588
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,986
She's the worst person ever.

589
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,453
Why did you not say goodbye
to your friend?

590
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,000
She didn't say goodbye to me either.
Why are you getting mad at me?

591
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,753
Eun-jung is a guest in our home,
but you live here.

592
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,633
Whatever. I have an exam tomorrow.

593
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,134
Cheon Sang-yeon!

594
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,347
You always say goodbye
with that smug face from the couch.

595
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,976
If your friend is leaving, you should
open the door for her, at the very least.

596
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,394
Being good in studies isn't--

597
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,062
If you like her so much…

598
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,066
make her your daughter, then.

599
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,485
Problem solved.

600
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,570
- What?
- [door opens]

601
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,449

Wow. The line's freaking long.

609
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,617
Ms. Yoon just paged me.

610
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,579
She's Sang-yeon's mom,
and Sang-yeon skipped school today.

611
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,122
That's probably why.

612
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,124
She skipped?

613
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,501
- We have an exam.
- [Ju-eun] I know.

614
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,047
Our teacher called her house earlier,
but they said she left already.

615
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,341
Maybe she ran away.

616
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,884
Ran away?

617
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,054

624
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,411

I'm not?

Do I have a choice?

You don't have money,
and you're too stubborn to go home.

Your only option's a public bathhouse,

- Stop lying.
- Why would I be lying about that?

Because you have lots of friends.
You hang out a lot.
