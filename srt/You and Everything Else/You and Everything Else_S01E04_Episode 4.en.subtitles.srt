1
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,966
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,052
I'm telling you, she hit my palms.

3
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,553
-Really?
-Yes!

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,681
Yes. I hit her really hard.

5
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,851
And you didn't even know it was me.

6
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,270
But you got your revenge, didn't you?

7
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,356
As for her, she always targeted me
during dodgeball.

8
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,610
Fess up.
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

9
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,739
-Yeah. I think I did.
-Seriously?

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,952
I still can't believe it.
What are the chances we'd meet here?

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:18,953
I know, right?

12
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,917
You should have told me earlier
that you had such a beautiful friend.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
Your phone's ringing.

14
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,797
Stop avoiding your girlfriend's calls.

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,882
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, go.

16
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,842
Sorry, my phone was on silent. What's up?

17
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,802
-Come here!
-Yeah.

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,348
-See how I look out for you?
-Sure. It's nice to meet you.

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,894
We met at the booth. I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,395
I know.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,857
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Engineering. Class of 2002.

22
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,736
Whenever he would say his name,

23
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,030
I felt conscious of Sang-yeon.

24
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,077
But Sang-yeon didn't seem to care at all
about something as trivial as a name.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,872
Why didn't you stay in touch
if you were so close?

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,083
Can't you find old friends
on I Love You School?

27
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,084
You're right.

28
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,921
I actually looked you up ages ago.
Didn't you look me up?

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,090
I didn't go on those sites.

30
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,260
Really? Almost everyone has
a profile on I Love You School.

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,766
I never really loved school, you see.

32
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,021
Also, I wasn't even in school back then.

33
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,232
So you missed high school entirely?

34
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,818
I attended for two months or so,
then quit.

35
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,029
Wait, do you really have a Leica?

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
It's my older brother's.

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,075
Is he a photographer?

38
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,244
As a hobby, I guess.

39
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,454
How old is he? How can he afford a Leica?

40
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,834
-I know.
-He's 4 years older than me, so he's 25.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,461
He just left the military,
so he's still in university.

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,882
What's his major?

43
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,636
Guys, stop asking questions.
What is this, a hearing?

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,222
-Business management.
-No way. Me too!

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,682
Sang-hak here too.

46
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,934
What university is he at?

47
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,102
Seoul University.

48
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,442
Sang-yeon spoke of her brother
with such ease.

49
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:17,155
As though Sang-hak were really alive
and well somewhere.

50
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,699
Eun-jung, have you met her older brother?

51
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,909
Is he handsome?

52
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,204
What? Yeah, I've seen him.

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,789
He's handsome. Really handsome.

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,835
Who's more handsome?
Sang-hak oppa here or Sang-yeon's oppa?

55
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,465
Kim Sang-hak seonbae is far more handsome.

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,634
Jeez, come on.

57
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,386
I told you to stop bringing up my looks.

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,472
People will think
that's all I have to offer.

59
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,017
Come on, put him in his place.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

60
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:51,606
Okay. Well, your facial features
are well-proportioned,

61
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,650
but you're not that good-looking.

62
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,111
Okay, duly noted. I get it.

63
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,863
God, you're so funny.

64
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
These two are dating, by the way.

65
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,703
Wow, really? You guys look good together.

66
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,038
-Do we?
-Yeah.

67
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,206
That hurt my pride.

68
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,375
Honestly, you're not that handsome.

69
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,837
Brilliant. So funny.

70
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,883
Where do you have to be this late?

71
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,176
I have a part-time job.

72
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,054
No one could cover her shift.
How will you get there?

73
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,847
-Subway.
-I'm taking the subway too.

74
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye, guys.

75
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,686
Dae-kyu, didn't you say
you'd stay for round three?

76
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,688
-Bye, guys.
-Bye!

77
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,232
Let's go for another round!

78
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,026
-Are you that happy?
-Yeah.

79
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,240
But it all feels like a blur.
Maybe because I still can't believe it.

80
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,202
I think we'll have a lot to talk about
when I see her tomorrow.

81
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,498
Do you remember that photo
from one of your old exhibitions?

82
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,418
I thought it was Sang-yeon in that photo.

83
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,669
-Really?
-Yeah.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,796
Hold up.

85
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,842
Jeez, Ryu Eun-jung.

86
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,929
Why didn't you ever mention her to me
if you were so close with her?

87
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,600
Didn't I? I can't really remember.

88
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,311
You can't really remember?

89
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,691
You always spoke of Na-mi and Ju-eun,
but I never heard about Cheon Sang-yeon.

90
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,527
Oh, I don't know.

91
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,115
It's all so complicated.
I'll tell you next time.

92
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,326
Will you actually?

93
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,286
Of course I will.

94
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:33,958
Because I can't talk about my life
without mentioning Cheon Sang-yeon.

95
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,011
And going forward, you won't be able to
discuss your life without mentioning me.

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,642
That's true even now.

97
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,939
Even now, I can't talk about my life
without mentioning you, silly.

98
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,399
"Silly"?

99
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,567
Yes, "silly."

100
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,404
I bet you didn't know
that's what I call you in my diary.

101
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,322
-You do?
-Yeah.

102
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,116
Come here. Bring it on, you.

103
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,788
Sang-yeon!

104
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,373
Hey.

105
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,221
She resigned from school?

106
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah. Complaints from parents
were pouring in.

107
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,604
Complaints?

108
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,695
I guess she was a homeroom teacher
who didn't care about her students.

109
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,329
Ms. Yoon didn't care about her students?

110
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,085
She's not the Ms. Yoon you remember.

111
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,383
Really?

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,051
You know we went bankrupt, right?

113
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,386
What?

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
Yeah.

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,268
What about you? Where do you live?

116
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,566
I still live in the same neighborhood.
We moved to a different house though.

117
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,027
It's two streets over from my old house.

118
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,406
My mom runs a rice cake shop.

119
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,993
Remember Daeseong's Mill
in your old apartment complex?

120
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,245
Yeah.

121
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,164
She runs it with my uncle.

122
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,083
Right, I see.

123
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,711
My mom and dad got divorced.

124
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,840
After the divorce,
Mom and I moved to Gangneung.

125
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,474
And your dad still lives in Seoul?

126
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,061
I don't know. We don't stay in touch.

127
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,939
I see.

128
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:11,073
I thought we'd have so much to say,
but I was flustered by how awkward it was.

129
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:19,457
Perhaps those five years
had taken something away from us.

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,961
See you around.

131
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,963
Yeah. Good luck with that paper.

132
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,177
Sang-yeon?

133
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,062
Can I askâ€¦

134
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,026
why you didn't tell me
you were moving back then?

135
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,822
Were you upset with me or something?

136
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,953
No. Why?

137
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,750
Ju-eun called me to say
it looked like your family was moving,

138
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,671
so I rushed over to your place,
but you had already left.

139
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,507
I paged you, but you never replied.

140
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,468
You even changed your pager number.

141
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,140
I told you that we went bankrupt.

142
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,603
How could I contact you
when we were practically running away?

143
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:30,236
Still, I thought that if I waited,
I'd hear from you. But I never did.

144
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:39,662
Dad told me not to contact anyone
and got rid of my pager.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,042
I see.

146
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,467
So you weren't mad at me or something?

147
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,345
Of course not.

148
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,390
I'm happy to see you again.

149
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,350
I mean it.

150
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,729
I am too.

151
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:11,193
My mom's even more excited than I am.
She keeps asking when youâ€™ll come visit.

152
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,528
Really?

153
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,656
I'd love to see her too.

154
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,994
Tell her Iâ€™ll come visit
as soon as I get a day off work.

155
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,330
Sure. Mom would love that.

156
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,582
I'll see you later.

157
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,541
See you.

158
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,138
Where is your friend Cheon Sang-yeon?

159
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,182
She's working.

160
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,101
Gosh, she sure has a lot on her plate.

161
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,937
Does she even have time
for club activities?

162
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,397
Who knows?

163
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,485
Hurry. The food's delicious.

164
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll take that. Thank you.

165
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,542
Do you cook at home?

166
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,295
Yeah. I cook at least one meal a day.

167
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,633
It's usually just putting rice
in the cooker. I keep it simple.

168
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,260
It's good you eat
at least one meal at home.

169
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,931
I tried to stop Mom
in case you might not eat at home.

170
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,768
She insisted her anchovies aren't salty
and you could eat them without rice.

171
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,313
I do love your mom's cooking.

172
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,776
But tell her not to cook for me next time.

173
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,153
My fridge is tiny,
so I don't have much space.

174
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,988
I already told her not to.

175
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,991
Let's stop to use the toilet.

176
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,827
Okay, go ahead.

177
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,870
You should come too.

178
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,956
I don't need to go.

179
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,582
Come with me anyway.

180
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,168
I really don't need to go.

181
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,839
I don't have a toilet at home, that's why.

182
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,258
You don't have a toilet?

183
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,137
There is one, but it's a squat toilet.

184
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,145
-Careful.
-Okay.

185
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,441
That's the toilet.

186
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,284
I can take back anything you don't want.

187
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,577
I'm going to eat it all.

188
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
I'm almost done.

189
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,081
Take your time.

190
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,265
I couldn't quite believe

191
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,101
that this was Sang-yeon's room.

192
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,403
Hey, this is really good.

193
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,322
Try some.

194
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,619
-Good, right?
-They're okay.

195
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,042
Oh, those. The hinge broke.

196
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,627
I can see that.

197
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,545
It's all right.

198
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,299
It's payday today, so I'll buy a new pair
first thing tomorrow.

199
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,849
Other than the toilet issue,
this place is decent.

200
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,935
The rent's affordable too. 80,000 won.

201
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
That is affordable.

202
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,940
This is so good.

203
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,277
Are you sure it's okay to drink
before your shift?

204
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,779
It's just a beer.

205
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,491
I don't have to be there until 9:00,
so it's fine.

206
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,620
Work won't be a problem,
but going to the toilet will be.

207
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,247
I'm fine using that toilet.

208
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,999
We had a squat toilet until fourth grade.

209
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,126
-Really?
-Yeah.

210
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,634
I always thought that squat toilets
only existed in places like folk villages.

211
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:11,100
I am a little shocked that there's still
a squat toilet here in Seoul in 2002.

212
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,063
That's why I don't eat after 7 p.m.
To avoid using the toilet.

213
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,109
The toilets we went to earlier
close at 10:00 p.m.

214
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,237
You know what was
a real culture shock for me?

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,990
Seeing two bathrooms in your old house.

216
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,745
Maybe I have zero bathrooms now
because I had two back then.

217
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,500
The thing is,

218
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,671
I didn't even know my family was poor
until fourth grade.

219
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,302
It only hit me after the city developments
and our move to a semi-basement.

220
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,641
I really liked your old house.

221
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,768
Don't be ridiculous.

222
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,146
You said I was the first.

223
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,567
I was the only one you invited.

224
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,362
That's why you liked it?

225
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,156
Yeah.

226
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,657
How silly.

227
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,160
Anyway,

228
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,331
I think being poor is all relative.

229
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
I think it's absolute.

230
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,882
If you have no money,
there's nothing you can do.

231
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,967
Absolutely nothing.

232
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,596
The world is a place

233
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,601
that offers even less
to those who are most desperate.

234
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,815
Think about it. I had two bathrooms
when I didn't even need them,

235
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,192
but now I have none.

236
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,029
And now I'm at a good university,
but I can't find students to tutor.

237
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,242
You'll find students.

238
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,411
I do hope so.

239
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,297
How could you drink so much
with someone who has to go to work?

240
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,425
She only had one beer.
I ended up having three beers, maybe?

241
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,135
That's a lie. I had four.

242
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,515
Seems like you had fun though.

243
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,392
Yeah, it was fun.

244
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,731
But the alcohol wasâ€¦
Maybe because it all felt a little bleakâ€¦

245
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,857
Bleak? Why?

246
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,487
Sang-yeon, sheâ€¦

247
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,870
Never mind.
I think I'll cry if I talk about it.

248
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,831
What's new? You always cry.

249
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,543
Exactly. I absolutely hate crying
while talking,

250
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,753
but I just can't stop myself.

251
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,672
So I'd rather not say.

252
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,134
You'll blab eventually.

253
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,219
I so won't.

254
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,389
It all looked a little lonely.

255
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,391
Sang-yeon

256
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,394
and her place.

257
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,318
I'm not going to cry.

258
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,654
You think I'm a big crybaby, don't you?

259
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,865
Yikes, you're sensitive.

260
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,992
Look. No tears, right?

261
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,577
Why, I'm so proud of you.

262
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,621
Sang-yeon says she likes your photo.

263
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,582
-My photo?
-Yes.

264
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,624
She's seen my photos?

265
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,502
She must have gone to the clubroom
during some free time.

266
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,547
She asked who took the photo of the chair
that was on the wall.

267
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,843
She must have an eye for photography.

268
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,802
I agree.

269
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
Don't you have some prints of that?

270
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,473
Yeah, I do.

271
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,682
Let's give her one.

272
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,476
Okay, sure.

273
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,353
And she's coming to the seminar.

274
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,274
-The seminar?
-I bragged about you presenting.

275
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,486
If she comes to anything,
she should come on a photography trip.

276
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,448
No. You're most admirable
when you're leading your seminars.

277
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,828
Do you want her to admire me?

278
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,081
Of course.

279
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,710
Boy, I do hope she doesn't
complicate things by falling for me.

280
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,632
Don't worry. She won't.

281
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,009
She won't?

282
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,261
Yes. She would never.

283
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,890
Excuse me? I feel strangely offended.
Why wouldn't she?

284
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,308
She has high standards.

285
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,392
Hey!

286
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm just saying she'll be there.

287
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,606
So make sure to do your best.

288
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,818
Okay, I'll do my best.

289
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,488
I understand that we cannot verify
the photo's authenticity

290
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:38,951
because the photographer,
as well as the witnesses,

291
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,452
gave inconsistent testimonies.

292
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,456
But what does that have to do
with the photographer's integrity?

293
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,918
It has everything to do with it.

294
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,006
If a photo's authenticity is questionable,
of course, it's a matter of integrity.

295
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
Why is this even a question?

296
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,054
Okay. Let's say a moment of greed
led to a manipulated photo,

297
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,558
or they accepted
the editor's manipulation of the photo.

298
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,645
Regardless, the photographer is
responsible for any deceptive photos.

299
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,773
No excuses. How can you deny that?

300
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,860
I don't mean to deny that.

301
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,988
The point I'm trying to make here isâ€¦

302
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,160
To be honest, the reason I find
your presentation mind-numbingly dull

303
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,832
is that from the start, you've portrayed
the photographer in a negative light.

304
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,000
It's irrational.

305
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,418
Dude, this is crazy.

306
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,379
I'm irrational?

307
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,261
Do you really think that artists
can be separated from their art?

308
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,180
He'd already been outsmarted,

309
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,682
but I still hoped
he'd turn it around using reason.

310
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,977
We're talking about war photography here.
It's documentary work.

311
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,521
People have already accepted
these photos as truth.

312
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,900
Now, that's completely off the mark.

313
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,987
How am I off the mark?
This was the point from the beginning.

314
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,614
How is that even relevant?

315
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,324
Defeated.

316
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,205
Did she come here to pick a fight?

317
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,291
She never shows up for club activities,
then comes to pick a fight?

318
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,959
She wasn't picking a fight.

319
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,087
Gosh, my head hurts.

320
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,591
How embarrassing.

321
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,428
Who do you think was right?

322
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,100
You can do better next time.
Don't think about it too much.

323
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,479
So you agree with her, then?

324
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,024
She totally crushed me.

325
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,360
You had fun?

326
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,445
Yeah. How should I put it?

327
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,823
It felt like I was finally
a true university student.

328
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,327
Your boyfriend's presentation
was so interesting.

329
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,496
Seriously?

330
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,541
-Didn't you find it interesting?
-It was interesting, all right.

331
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,836
Did I act like a snob again?

332
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,213
Yeah.

333
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,675
Goodness! When did you become so pretty?

334
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,927
-Have you been well, Mrs. Jang?
-Of course.

335
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,679
You look so beautiful.

336
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,223
So will you take the tutoring job?

337
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,392
Yes. Thank you for the recommendation.

338
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,769
Oh, don't mention it.
I didn't do anything.

339
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,189
The piano academy owner upstairs
needed a tutor for her kids,

340
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,190
so I mentioned you.

341
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,610
Are they in high school?

342
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,487
Yes, her daughter is.

343
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,282
Her son's in middle school,
and he'll be bringing a friend.

344
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,034
Wow, I didn't know it would be three kids!

345
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,370
-Seonbae.
-Hello.

346
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,538
Welcome, Sang-hak.

347
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,207
Hello.

348
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,793
Yeah, hi. Long time no see.

349
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,049
I'm so excited that the three of us
are drinking together.

350
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
Hold up. Are you feeling shy?

351
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,936
As if.

352
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,441
You so are!

353
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,403
No way. Is this because of the seminar?

354
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,362
Hey.

355
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,367
Don't talk about the seminar.
The topic is off-limits.

356
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,706
Sang-yeon said
she found your presentation interesting.

357
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,458
Isn't that right?

358
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:15,876
Yes.

359
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,005
It was interesting, actually.

360
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,844
Interesting or not, the point is
that the photo was manipulated.

361
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,096
I never said that it wasn't.

362
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,475
If you agree, then why did you--

363
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,768
That's enough.

364
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,771
I have to agree with Sang-yeon
about the seminar.

365
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,105
Let's change the subject.

366
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,315
Come on. Cheers.

367
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,193
Cheers.

368
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:49,785
By the way,
didn't you bring that photo that day?

369
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,418
You did, didn't you?
You brought it, right?

370
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,628
No comment.

371
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,005
What?

372
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,383
The chair photo that you said you liked.

373
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:09,221
My boyfriend brought that photo for you,
but you put him through that ordeal.

374
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,809
"The reason I find your presentation
mind-numbingly dull isâ€¦"

375
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,397
Oh dear. God, I'm so sorry.

376
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,359
Could I have that photo, please?

377
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,528
It depends.

378
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,114
I'll do my best. Please?

379
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,949
I'll be watching you closely.

380
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,950
Okay.

381
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,410
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

382
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,825
Once Sang-yeon started tutoring,
we began to hang out almost every day.

383
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,788
-One, two, three.
-Let's do this!

384
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,165
Let's go!

385
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,461
Hurry up! Come on!

386
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,795
Pass it to me!

387
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,422
Nice shot!

388
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey, it's fine.

389
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,182
I'll switch. Switch with me. You're in.

390
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,267
Good luck!

391
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,810
-Go.
-Hello, oppa.

392
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,769
Hey.

393
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,611
Hey. Why do you call everyone else "oppa"
but your boyfriend "seonbae"?

394
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,367
Since orientation, I've called
the upperclassmen in my major "oppa,"

395
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,038
whereas I've called Sang-hak "seonbae"
since I first signed up for the club.

396
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,748
Yeah, but why?

397
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,210
You're the only girl in our year
who calls him "seonbae."

398
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,711
Everyone calls him "oppa."

399
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,339
That's becauseâ€¦

400
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:15,680
I could never bring myself
to call him "Sang-hak oppa."

401
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,019
Doesn't it sound kind of cool?
"Seonbae. Sang-hak seonbae."

402
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,981
But still, calling your boyfriend
"seonbae" is a bitâ€¦

403
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,486
She calls him "seonbae" too, you know.

404
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,280
Is it some weird custom
from your hometown?

405
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,995
I bet her reasons for calling him that
are similar to mine.

406
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,542
By the way, how come she never dates?

407
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,627
She isn't seeing anyone, is she?

408
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,379
I'm not sure.

409
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,591
Do you know why Byeong-gi and Dae-kyu
are nowhere to be seen these days?

410
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,219
They asked her out,
but she flat-out refused.

411
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,304
Byeong-gi liked Sang-yeon too?

412
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,014
I doubt he's the only one.

413
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,476
I'm pretty sure everyone from her cohort
is interested in her.

414
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,105
I'm not surprised.
She's always been popular.

415
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,482
I wonder if she really
isn't interested in anyone.

416
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,655
Do you think

417
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,660
there's anyone in our photography club
that Sang-yeon might like?

418
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,207
Kim Sang-hak?

419
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,126
What?

420
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,087
What do you mean, "What?"

421
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,757
You asked whether there was anyone
she might like, and I think there is.

422
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,802
This isn't about
whether they'll go out or not.

423
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,137
There's just

424
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,098
a vibe, you know?

425
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,944
Then do you think Sang-hak seonbaeâ€¦

426
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,697
Forget it.

427
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,286
I knew you'd react like this.
Be honest. You're curious, aren't you?

428
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,081
About whether he's even
the slightest bit interested in her.

429
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,961
Not at all! You're so mean.

430
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,379
I'm right, aren't I?

431
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,090
Did you miss it?
They actually scored a goal.

432
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,136
Stop lying, man. Who would have known
that Lee Chun-soo would deliver?

433
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,220
Right?

434
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,264
Why? Did Lee Chun-soo score?

435
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,893
Yeah. He got past the defense
and the goalie in the penalty area.

436
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,852
Really?

437
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,480
What if we get to the final 16?

438
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:32,859
Fat chance. In terms of physicality,
the opponents are on a different level.

439
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,861
â€¦he gets in the car after their fight.

440
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,531
Yeah, and he comes back later.
But Arnie disappears, causing chaos.

441
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,116
-Right.
-I swear DiCaprio isâ€¦

442
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,411
Sang-hak and Sang-yeon
clicked in many ways.

443
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,622
Especially regarding movies.

444
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,626
Why would you talk about movies
in a photography club?

445
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,754
They should have joined
a movie club instead.

446
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,884
Ta-da. I bought us all ice cream.

447
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,260
-Nice.
-How much?

448
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,138
-10,000 won bet.
-10,000? Okay, you're on.

449
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,765
-Did you buy vanilla?
-Of course!

450
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,226
Hey, save the chocolate-coated one
for Eun-jung.

451
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,185
I want vanilla!

452
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,312
Guys, what should you say?

453
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,481
-Thank you.
-That's more like it.

454
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,692
-Vanilla, yum.
-Thank you!

455
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,694
-Thank you.
-You're on.

456
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,071
Eat this. Just take what you're given.

457
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,706
Why don't you date?

458
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,625
-What?
-Does nobody strike your fancy?

459
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,294
I do have a crush.

460
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,506
You do?

461
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,424
Yeah.

462
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,008
Who is it?

463
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,594
Well,

464
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:46,307
someone I met in an online chat room
while I was in Gangneung.

465
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,644
"Online chat room"?

466
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,566
If you were in Gangneung, that was
ages ago. Why aren't you dating him?

467
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,235
You can't date all of your crushes.

468
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,282
If it's you, then yeah.
Who would pass you up?

469
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,118
It wasn't mutual.

470
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,413
Man, I'm annoyed.

471
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
It was an unrequited crush.

472
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,751
"Unrequited crush"?

473
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,920
Do you know what he looks like?

474
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,422
Yes.

475
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,008
I followed him around.

476
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,177
Followed him around?

477
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,511
Secretly.

478
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:24,971
I stalked him.

479
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,351
Why? You should have
confessed your feelings.

480
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,314
He has a girlfriend.

481
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,319
Ohâ€¦ That's too bad.

482
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,655
What kind of person is he?

483
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,283
Is he handsome?

484
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,463
He got me to fall for him,
so I guess he wasn't ugly.

485
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:06,471
I'm really curious about
what kind of person you would be drawn to.

486
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,056
It's all in the past now.

487
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,851
I'm going to find someone new.

488
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,730
Okay. Keep your eyes peeled.

489
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
For what?

490
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,193
It's nothing.

491
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,668
STORIES ON MOVIES

492
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,147
-You're reading about movies?
-Holy crap!

493
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,569
God, you scared me.

494
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,947
Why were you so surprised?

495
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,116
-When did you get here?
-Last night.

496
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,869
-What?
-I developed almost a hundred photos.

497
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,786
Want to see?

498
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,166
It's such a delicate process,
so I kept getting different results.

499
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,668
It was driving me nuts.

500
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,545
Then it suddenly clicked.

501
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,297
Look there.

502
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,175
Those ones made the cut.

503
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,052
Which one is the best?

504
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:34,350
Oh, well, they all look similar to me.

505
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,144
They do?

506
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,397
I can't seem to pick one.

507
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,403
You developed this one photo all night?

508
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,781
Yeah. Developing photos is so much fun.

509
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,960
I could never beat her.

510
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,087
These photos turned out really well.

511
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,007
Each one is great in its own unique way.

512
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,217
Maybe it's the camera.

513
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,137
Cameras don't take photos by themselves.

514
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,140
I couldn't pick the best one out of these.

515
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,809
Whoa, you did a great job
developing these.

516
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,647
All three are unique,
but each one has a vibrant color gradient.

517
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,981
Which one do you guys like?

518
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,734
-Let's show this in our August exhibit.
-This one?

519
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,487
All the emotions I'd forgotten
came flooding back.

520
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,238
You could go pro, Sang-yeon.

521
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,324
Ms. Pro.

522
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,242
Being around Sang-yeon

523
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,497
makes everything about me
feel so ordinary.

524
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,959
Insignificant, even.

525
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,549
I'd like to express emotionsâ€¦

526
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,136
Why didn't you share your photos?

527
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,516
Didn't you develop the photos
of the rice cake and side dish shops?

528
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,145
I did. I developed them, butâ€¦

529
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,982
Let's see them.
You said you'd pick one for the exhibit.

530
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,944
I might just go with something else.

531
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,028
Something else?

532
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:09,946
Yeah.

533
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,575
Theyâ€™re all just photos of people,
so they feel a bit too simple.

534
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
How so? I think they'd be great.

535
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,919
What is it?

536
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,047
What's got you feeling down?

537
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,430
It's just

538
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:42,562
your photos have a special something,
and so do Sang-yeon's.

539
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,356
Mine seem too ordinary in comparison.

540
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,899
They do?

541
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,235
Yeah.

542
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,739
When I look at the two of you,

543
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,075
itâ€™s clear how talented
and curious you both are.

544
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,370
I bet you'll both succeed
in whatever you do.

545
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,248
And you won't?

546
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,833
No.

547
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,129
What is it you want to do?

548
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:13,968
Me?

549
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,221
I'm not really good at anything--

550
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,681
You're eloquent.

551
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,644
How am I eloquent?

552
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,941
Come on. Don't be like that
over something so small.

553
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,652
You have me, don't you?

554
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,656
What?

555
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,370
What's that supposed to mean?

556
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:42,955
What?

557
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,292
-What is it?
-What did you mean by that?

558
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
Mean by what?

559
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,005
-I just--
-Do you think you're all I need?

560
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,508
Eun-jung.

561
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,593
No matter how much I like you

562
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,763
or how proud I am
to call you my boyfriend,

563
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,808
your achievements are yours, not mine.

564
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,147
That's not what I meant. I just think
your photos are perfectly fine--

565
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,733
Perfectly fine isn't good enough!

566
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,445
Eun-jung.

567
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,599
There are things even he can't do.

568
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,562
He could never calm this anxiety.

569
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,148
I wanted to know.

570
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,610
I wanted to line up
all the 21-year-olds in the world

571
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,113
to know where I stood amongst them.

572
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,659
To know what I was capable of
and what I couldn't dream of doing.

573
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:34,233
Why aren't you answering? Please pick up.

574
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,694
I need you to talk to me.

575
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,033
But I really do admire the things you say.
Your photos too.

576
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,619
They're not just fine.
They're really good.

577
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,303
I just woke up,
and I'm feeling pretty embarrassed.

578
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,097
I'm sorry I took my anger out on you.

579
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,949
You managed to rest, did you?

580
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm sorry.

581
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,090
I'll forgive you
because you seem really sorry.

582
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,342
Okay.

583
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,597
Let's see.

584
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,392
You're wearing this?

585
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,313
I forgot! Give me one minute.

586
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,108
-Just one minute!
-Okay.

587
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,819
Go, Korea!

588
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,072
In June of that year,
the entire country was buzzing.

589
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,700
Go, Korea!

590
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,953
Ahn Jung-hwan shoots! And he scores!

591
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,375
Ahn Jung-hwan!

592
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,058
Hong Myung-bo!

593
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:36,939
He shoots, and he scores!
Korea is through to the semifinals!

594
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,235
Team Korea is through to the semis!
The actual semifinals!

595
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,613
This is incredible.
A very emotional moment for us all.

596
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,062
What were you thinking about earlier?

597
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,981
Earlier when?

598
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,609
During the shoot-out.

599
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,864
I'm not too sure.
What was I thinking about again?

600
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,953
I guess I was thinking,
"People really like this kind of stuff."

601
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,997
That sort of thing.

602
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,167
Don't you like this?

603
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,212
Of course I do. It's the semifinals.

604
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,058
Eun-jung, do you ever feel that way?

605
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,982
As if you snap and break away.

606
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,450
Feeling detached, I suppose.

607
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,040
You strive to pretend,

608
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,419
trying to make something your reality,

609
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,715
but you simply can't keep up
and just come to a halt.

610
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,934
Like being snapped away.

611
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,234
Are you reminded of your brother?

612
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,487
Cheon Sang-hak?

613
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,990
Yeah.

614
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,119
I've been meaning to ask you.

615
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,496
You always talk as if--

616
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,623
He's still alive?

617
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,002
Yeah.

618
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,760
There must be people
who knew him in the past

619
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,890
who are still unaware that he's gone.

620
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,354
They must think that he's somewhere,

621
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,106
alive and well.

622
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,196
Or since they assume he's well,

623
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,240
maybe he never even crosses their minds?

624
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,497
It's like that for me too.
He never even crosses my mind.

625
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,137
Eun-jung, let's go.

626
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,056
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,322
I can't help but like you.

628
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,365
So annoying.

629
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
Why? What is?

630
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,662
Forget it.

631
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,669
What do you mean, what?
You're annoying, of course.

632
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,880
-What did I do to annoy--
-I'm annoyed.

633
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,882
Cheon Sang-yeon, you're so annoying.

634
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,302
Hey, what did I do?

635
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,887
BALANCE: 723,254 WON

636
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,597
Only 720,000 won?

637
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,500
Hello, sir.

638
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,918
Welcome.

639
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,546
-I'd like to sell these books.
-Sure.

640
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,381
Mom, please.

641
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,757
No.

642
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,843
Come on, Mom. Please?

643
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,386
I said no.

644
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,680
It's just that--

645
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,391
Hey! No means no!

646
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,103
Why would you move out
when you have a perfectly good home?

647
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,355
-If you think about--
-Zip it!

648
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,151
Lift your foot. And the other one.

649
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,420
-Sir, I only rode this a few times.
-I see.

650
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,756
So these brakes are practically new.

651
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,844
Well, even soâ€¦
40,000 won should be reasonable.

652
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,055
But this bike changes gears, and--

653
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,182
The tires are pretty much flat.

654
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,893
-But filling them with air costs nothing.
-That's not true.

655
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,938
Come on, please? Mom, please.

656
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,399
Move it.

657
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,654
Why don't you just sell everything off?
Why not sell me off too?

658
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,115
I just need you to pitch in
one million won.

659
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,910
On second thought, just 500,000. Please?

660
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,621
Come on. It's Sang-yeon.

661
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,501
How much is the deposit?

662
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,379
-500,000 won.
-500,000?

663
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:38,008
Then let's add 2.5 million to that
and find a place with a 3 million deposit.

664
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,640
Is your mom really okay with this?

665
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,017
Of course, she said no at first.

666
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,270
But she changed her mind
when I said I'd be living with you.

667
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,442
-I would love that, but--
-That's settled, then.

668
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,780
Let's start searching tomorrow.
There's that photography trip next weekâ€¦

669
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,411
Are you really not coming this time?

670
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,580
It's a trip to Gangneung.
Why would I go there?

671
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,998
But stillâ€¦

672
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,169
It's Sang-hak's last trip
before joining the military.

673
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,009
He's going to the military?

674
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,053
Yes.

675
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,933
When?

676
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,812
July 16th, so in just three weeks.

677
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,080
I'm not going in.

678
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,551
Sang-yeon, there's something
really cool over there.

679
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,970
-Whoa, no way!
-No way!

680
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,140
In you go!

681
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,105
Guys! How could you?

682
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:02,152
It's so cold.
Why is it so cold in the summer?

683
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,572
Because it's technically not summer.
It's still June.

684
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,700
Aren't you glad you came?

685
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,538
No. What was I thinking
when I agreed to come here?

686
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,040
I know you're having fun.

687
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,212
Now that I'm here,
I would love to see Ms. Yoon.

688
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,383
Should we pay her a quick visit
before dinner?

689
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,260
No.

690
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,265
We're here anyway. Wouldn't she be upset?

691
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,143
She doesn't even know we're here.
Why would she be upset?

692
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:42,484
Was it supposed to be a secret?
I actually called her earlier.

693
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,279
A secret to whom?

694
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,074
Ms. Yoon. Sang-yeon's mom.

695
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,370
Did you tell her that we're here?

696
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,502
She didnâ€™t answer, so I couldn't tell her.
I just didnâ€™t realize it was a secret.

697
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,592
It's Ms. Yoon.

698
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,931
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

699
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,977
I just thought I'd give you a call.

700
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,104
I hear your mother's a great person.

701
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,816
My mom?

702
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,570
Eun-jung says your mom is the person
she respects the most.

703
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:33,452
She said she always felt timid at school
because she didn't have a father,

704
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,163
but your mom helped fill that void.

705
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,793
She filled that void?

706
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,048
Yes, Ms. Yoon. I'll come visit you soon.

707
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,593
Of course. Take care.

708
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,890
I didn't tell her we're here.

709
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,187
Let's go see my mom, then.

710
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,023
You should come too.

711
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:13,075
I don't get you. I even lied
because you asked me not to tell her.

712
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,576
We'll say it's a surprise.

713
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,079
Are you sure it's okay
to just show up like this?

714
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,039
Maybe I should wait outside.

715
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,833
My mom will be happy to see you.

716
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,768
Who is it?

717
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,186
It's me.

718
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,563
Sang-yeon, is that you?

719
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,481
Yeah.

720
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,068
Why, you should have called
to say you were coming.

721
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,115
Eun-jung.

722
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,204
Ms. Yoon.

723
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,125
Ms. Yoon.

724
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,337
It's so good to see you.

725
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,007
What brought you all this way?

726
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,302
Hello, ma'am. I amâ€¦

727
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:18,557
This is Sang-hak oppa.
We're in the same photography club.

728
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,693
Did I mention that my brother is
also named Sang-hak? Cheon Sang-hak.

729
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,834
Where are my manners?
Please come inside. Come in.

730
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,636
Come this way.

731
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,892
-Please take a seat here.
-Yes.

732
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:02,809
Right here.

733
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,855
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have bought some food.

734
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,777
It's fine. We had a late lunch,
so you don't need to put anything out.

735
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,321
All I have is plum extract.

736
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,116
I love plum extract.

737
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,955
Are you close with your mom?

738
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,044
-Wellâ€¦
-My mom is super close with my brother.

739
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:35,509
I bet she loves him
more than anyone else in the entire world.

740
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,776
-We need one moreâ€¦
-Right.

741
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,699
I'm sorry I had no food.

742
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:04,329
Itâ€™s fine. Weâ€™re having a barbecue,
so we'll be eating soon anyway.

743
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,374
All right, then. Take care.

744
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,835
Eun-jung, you too.

745
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,462
I'll call.

746
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,380
Okay.

747
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,843
Eun-jung?

748
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:33,692
TO SANG-HAK OPPA

749
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,778
Do you remember this?

750
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,741
I couldn't throw away
such a beautiful letter.

751
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,330
I don't think Sang-hak even knew
that it was there.

752
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,919
I know it wasn't mine to read.

753
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,006
I'm sorry I read it
without your permission.

754
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,413
You said your father
gave you that clover, right?

755
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,585
Yes.

756
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,673
Thank you for gifting

757
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,844
something so precious to my son.

758
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,365
I'm sorry.

759
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:07,953
I'm sorry.

760
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:12,958
Eun-jung.

761
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,148
They are taking a long time.

762
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,867
They do this every time they meet.

763
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,579
They're practically best friends.

764
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,626
That was an exaggeration.

765
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,006
Her favorite student?

766
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:08,680
Eun-jung was my mom's favorite
even though she wasn't in her class.

767
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,350
I suppose it was all worth it

768
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,520
since Eun-jung still considers Mom
an amazing person.

769
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,734
It makes sense since Mom even
played favorites with her children.

770
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,991
She clearly preferred my brother to me.

771
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,453
She never tried to hide it.

772
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,207
Some kind of mom, isn't she?

773
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,876
You can stop talking.

774
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,882
It must have been tough.

775
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,523
Of course it was tough.

776
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,320
I deserve to be more rebellious.

777
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,117
My mom would have no right to judge me.

778
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:29,417
