1
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,966
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

2
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,186
She's the unresponsive patient
we called about.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,189
Vitals are stable,
except for low oxygen at 91.

4
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,690
Her mental status is unchanged…

5
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,754
Fortunately, she's in the clear for now,
but this could happen again at any time.

6
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,547
At this point,

7
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,425
she's beyond the stage
where treatment would be effective,

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,052
let alone lead to a full recovery.

9
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,431
In my medical opinion,
there is no chance of recovery.

10
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,352
And the patient herself
does not want any further treatment.

11
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,566
I felt helpless.

12
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,207
Sang-yeon.

13
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,493
Stay here.

14
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,259
Then I'll stay by your side.

15
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,362
Yeah.

16
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,742
Okay.

17
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,156
Everything's so different.
I can't tell where anything is anymore.

18
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,119
It's still the ocean,
which means she'll know you're here.

19
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,538
You think so?

20
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,471
That was so typical of me earlier.

21
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,935
When we were struggling
to find Mom's spot.

22
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,648
It's been 20 years, but I thought
I'd recognize it at a glance.

23
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,821
I'm always like this.

24
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,910
I'm the one who insists on walking away,

25
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,997
but I expect everyone to be
where I left them.

26
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,170
Still, I'm sure she's pleased
that I came with you.

27
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,093
She'd be pleased that you're here,

28
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
not because you came with me.

29
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,771
Did you really think
she loved me more than you?

30
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,485
Yes.

31
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,071
How could you ever think that?

32
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,076
It's not a question
of how I could think that.

33
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,581
When such thoughts
settle in a child's mind…

34
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,752
it shapes their entire world.

35
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,058
You're right.

36
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,357
It really does.

37
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,613
Why did you change your mind?

38
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,209
I don't know either.

39
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,464
I never wanted to see you again…

40
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,720
but I guess you have a strange hold on me.

41
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,937
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,232
I'm sorry for everything.

43
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,074
Okay.

44
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,914
I have something to give you.

45
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,501
What is it?

46
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,299
I'm finally returning it to you.

47
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,352
How do you still have this?

48
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,774
Because I'm spiteful and wicked.

49
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,572
I refused to sell it
even when I was cold and hungry.

50
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,491
And now I finally get to return it to you.

51
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,370
But…

52
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,207
are you sure I should have this?

53
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,126
It was yours to begin with.

54
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,752
My brother's gift to you.

55
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,798
And who else should have it if not you?

56
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,344
The joy it brought my brother

57
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,057
and the comfort I felt knowing
that I've held onto it all these years…

58
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,268
You're the only one who gets it.

59
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
Thanks.

60
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,072
I'll have this, then.

61
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,370
I need to switch out my patch.

62
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,543
I'll take that.

63
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,901
Don't you have work? I know you're busy.

64
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,403
We're securing
the source material license,

65
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,571
so I'm good for now.

66
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,616
Yay! Lucky me.

67
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,868
I'm ill at the perfect time.

68
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,620
Hey.

69
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,873
I'm just happy, that's all.

70
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,587
Are you sure that you don't want it?

71
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,257
The building in Seongsu.

72
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,052
Yes, I don't need it.

73
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,806
I have no one else to give it to.

74
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,560
How futile.

75
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,063
That's all that will be left of me.

76
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,571
That's not true.

77
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,366
You produced 11 films, remember?

78
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,163
You'll come again tomorrow, right?

79
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,262
When are you coming?

80
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,652
Is this really Mrs. Jang's broth?

81
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,198
The dough is also your favorite.
It was made by my mom.

82
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,870
Eat up.

83
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,540
So I can finally stop hearing about
you craving hand-torn noodles.

84
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,473
Are you okay?

85
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,355
Sang-yeon told me

86
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,941
that this happened all the time.

87
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,255
What is this?

88
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,925
INTERNET EXPLORER IS NOT RESPONDING

89
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,968
What the…

90
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,762
This is bad.

91
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
Is something not working?

92
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,560
Gosh, that's a relief.

93
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,437
I only lost ten lines.

94
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,772
What is it?

95
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,607
Just some simple stuff.

96
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,319
The original author wants to know
how their work will be adapted.

97
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,446
Good luck.

98
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
Are you done?

99
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,123
What was that just now?

100
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,046
What do they mean
about two people being prepared

101
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,048
to accompany you as requested?

102
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,682
-Eun-jung.
-You said you wouldn't go.

103
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,434
To Switzerland.

104
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,151
You don't have to go.

105
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,741
But you will?

106
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,293
I'm sorry for not telling you.

107
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
But…

108
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,761
I'm in so much pain.

109
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,891
You still have time.

110
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,812
You can still talk and walk.

111
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,980
You're still breathing--

112
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,066
That's precisely why I want to go now,

113
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,776
while I'm still

114
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,612
myself.

115
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,750
You said that if I stayed,

116
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,255
you would stay by my side
until the very end, didn't you?

117
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,427
I know that you will do just that.

118
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,598
But…

119
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,062
I can't ask that of you.

120
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,277
When my mom was dying…

121
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,367
I witnessed the lowest depths of pain.

122
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,086
The feeling of helplessly watching,
knowing that your hands are tied…

123
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,844
I know it all too well.

124
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,268
Still, stay.

125
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,814
No.

126
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,748
Eun-jung.

127
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm going to die.

128
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,970
It was hard for me
to come to terms with that too.

129
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,600
Of course I want to live.

130
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,230
If there were even
a 1% chance of surviving,

131
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,276
I would have been willing to try anything.

132
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,780
But there isn't.

133
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,493
Sang-yeon…

134
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,036
The thing about hope…

135
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,084
is that it drains the life out of you.

136
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,215
I want to end this suffering

137
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,053
while I am still
holding onto my sense of self.

138
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,265
Is that so wrong and selfish a thing
to ask for?

139
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,066
At the very least, shouldn't I have
the right to end this pain?

140
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,996
There, all fixed.

141
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,505
Did you send it?

142
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,132
Yes. Did you fix it?

143
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,467
You sure are impressive.

144
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,429
Please, I just removed
a couple of antivirus programs.

145
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,722
Do you want a beer?

146
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,515
Is Ha-yun asleep?

147
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,101
Yes, and my husband's coming home late.

148
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,644
What a treat.

149
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,440
Are you starting a new series?

150
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,357
Yes.

151
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,776
Congratulations.

152
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,528
It's finally happening.

153
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,949
But why the long face?

154
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,785
Did something happen?

155
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,291
You can't go.

156
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,294
Do you really think you could handle it?

157
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,968
I can't think properly.

158
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,262
Everything feels so surreal.

159
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,057
Is she out of her mind,
asking you for something like this?

160
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,728
She says I don't need to go with her.

161
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,188
You're kidding.

162
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,608
Then why did she mention it to you
in the first place?

163
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,318
What does she expect from you?

164
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,154
If I felt like…

165
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,577
I was slowly losing

166
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,747
my sense of self…

167
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,927
I think I would want to leave as well.

168
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
So would I.

169
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,646
If I were in her position,
I might have had those thoughts too.

170
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,149
But this isn't your burden to bear.

171
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,735
You'd be tied to someone else's death.

172
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,491
Take me, for example.
It's been six years since my dad passed,

173
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,660
but even to this day,

174
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,664
I still haven't gotten over our decision
to take him off life support.

175
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,544
It's too agonizing to even think about.

176
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,923
Do you understand
what you're considering doing here?

177
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,136
This could haunt you forever,
especially someone like you.

178
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,984
I read

179
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,279
that only a few follow through

180
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,866
when faced with the moment of truth.

181
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,748
For some, leaving is surprisingly easy.

182
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
While others

183
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,129
stop midway

184
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,964
and live on for weeks,

185
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,966
even months.

186
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,052
SWITZERLAND ASSISTED DYING

187
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,137
Some even live on for several years.

188
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,224
10 KOREANS DIE BY ASSISTED SUICIDE
IN SWITZERLAND

189
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,060
Those people discover new ways
to face their pain

190
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,855
that help them cope.

191
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,694
Knowing that there is a way out…

192
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,279
TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY
TO DIE WITH DIGNITY

193
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,908
…can ease people of the pressure

194
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,828
of having to end their suffering.

195
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,171
As for which side Sang-yeon would be on,

196
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,133
I can't say for certain.

197
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,178
No.

198
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,681
Perhaps

199
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,934
I already know the answer.

200
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,272
Maybe that's why I feel so anxious.

201
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,362
But still…

202
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,783
I don't think I can

203
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,077
let you go alone.

204
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,871
For the flights…

205
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,042
we're getting round-trip tickets.

206
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,046
For both of us.

207
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,641
If you really

208
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,811
end up coming with me…

209
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,026
let's leave as though
we're going on a real trip.

210
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,362
Smiling and all.

211
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,162
We never got the chance…

212
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,501
to go on a trip together.

213
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,716
But don't ever forget this.

214
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,093
Until the very end…

215
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,639
I will keep hoping for us
to return together.

216
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,227
You know what a trip is, right?

217
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,065
You leave

218
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,525
and then come back home.

219
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,298
I never imagined it would be this hard.

220
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,806
That it would be this terrifying.

221
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,438
I hadn't fully comprehended
what it meant to be going there.

222
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,986
How afraid

223
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,906
and terrified I would be.

224
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,328
Only after I had made the choice to go…

225
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,832
did I realize.

226
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,323
I wonder if those people…

227
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,662
have found their answers.

228
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,885
I packed some pickled cucumbers
and a little bit of everything.

229
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,346
Will she call you old-fashioned
if you take this?

230
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,391
No, she'll love them.

231
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,352
Does Producer Choi like Korean food too?

232
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,270
Yes.

233
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,481
So the flight's tomorrow at 12:00?

234
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,816
It's 12:20 p.m.

235
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,775
I see.

236
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,070
Well then, you should leave
by 10:30 at the latest.

237
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
Mom.

238
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,914
When Dad got into that accident,

239
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,417
how did you manage?

240
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,088
What sort of silly question is that?

241
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,175
He left for work with a smile,
just like any other day,

242
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,844
and less than an hour later,
you saw him like that.

243
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,349
Weren't you scared at all?

244
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,726
When you first saw him like that.

245
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,064
I wasn't scared, so to speak,
maybe because he was my husband.

246
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,941
I was dumbfounded though.

247
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,487
When something like that happens,
your mind goes blank.

248
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,572
You get through it

249
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,075
because it happens to you.

250
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,036
I didn't have a choice.

251
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,376
There were preparations
I still needed to make.

252
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,714
There was a chance that I might be alone.

253
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,969
I still needed…

254
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,930
to brace myself

255
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,100
for the possibility
that I would be returning alone.

256
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,178
EUN-JUNG

257
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,522
Attention, please.
Passengers for Korean Air Flight 917

258
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,027
departing for Switzerland,
boarding will begin shortly.

259
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,322
Please proceed to the departure gates
as soon as possible.

260
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,139
I know there is no right answer.

261
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,392
Even so,

262
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,479
I will choose

263
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,147
to spend this time with you.

264
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,040
Wow, it's a river view.

265
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,293
I didn't know they had a river in Zurich.

266
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,089
My goodness.

267
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,258
You didn't even look it up?

268
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,887
Come on, this is the Limmat River.

269
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,681
I like it more because it's a surprise.

270
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,078
It's a crane.

271
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,332
How random.

272
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,918
You're right.

273
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,466
I've never stayed in a suite before.

274
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,594
Way to go, Eun-jung.

275
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,221
You lost the chance

276
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,432
to own a building.

277
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,018
I'm getting to stay in a suite, aren't I?

278
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,773
Sang-yeon, look here.

279
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,067
-These rooms seem to be connected.
-Yes?

280
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,068
Oh really?

281
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,515
It was set to happen four days later.

282
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,976
Before then,

283
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,562
Sang-yeon needed to have
two medical interviews.

284
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,610
Sang-yeon was free to schedule
the first interview whenever she liked,

285
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,490
but the second one had to be scheduled
for the night before.

286
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,742
For the final time…

287
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,997
the doctor would make sure
she hadn't changed her mind.

288
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,843
It's another crane.

289
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,720
Did you know?

290
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm a swallow, and my brother's a crane.

291
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,644
The "hak" in your brother's name
means "crane"?

292
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,105
Yes, Cheon Sang-hak.

293
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,107
Your first love.

294
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,071
"This short middle school kid would,

295
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,699
three years later, become my first love."

296
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,161
Hey, do you have a death wish?

297
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,669
Jeez, you scaredy-cat.

298
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,056
How did you decide to get married?

299
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,314
I got a divorce three years ago.

300
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,983
I heard.

301
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,027
But

302
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,616
I was more shocked to hear about
your marriage than your divorce.

303
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,452
How did it happen so quickly?

304
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,704
And why with Han Jae-jun?

305
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,127
He was successful, had a lot of money,

306
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,046
and liked me.

307
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,509
But there were so many other guys
that liked you.

308
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,219
He liked me more.

309
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,930
He was really into me.

310
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:16,184
Plus, there was a strangely
innocent side to him

311
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,939
that made me believe
he would cherish me for a lifetime.

312
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,690
How wrong I was.

313
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,818
He wanted to split
within a year of our marriage.

314
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,740
He said he'd never felt
so much as a hint of warmth from me.

315
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,285
You sort of get that, right?

316
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,498
So from that moment on,

317
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,502
I poured every ounce of effort I had
into our relationship.

318
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:48,758
I knew it was all a facade,
but I kept up the act for six long years.

319
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,263
Why did you try so hard?

320
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,141
"Who would

321
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,186
accept you in the end?"

322
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,943
Those words

323
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,863
haunted me all throughout my thirties

324
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,908
like an unshakable curse.

325
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,123
I needed to prove you wrong.

326
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,668
That I had been accepted by someone

327
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,170
and that I was being loved.

328
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,302
Then I became fixated
on the idea of having a child.

329
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,805
If I had a child,

330
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:40,018
I was confident
that I could become a good mother.

331
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,186
But it never happened.

332
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,356
Then came the cancer.

333
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,658
Hey.

334
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,911
You don't have to get so upset.

335
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,708
I'm simply being honest with you.

336
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,133
Did you pack warm clothes?

337
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,763
I asked for the rental car
to come a little earlier.

338
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,732
It really felt like we were on a trip.

339
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,942
Whoa, look at the sky.

340
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,364
Do you finally get why people rave about
how amazing Switzerland is?

341
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,077
It's straight out of a postcard.

342
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,502
Sang-yeon told me that, at some point,

343
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,297
she had developed a new habit
of saying goodbye to everything.

344
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,425
Because every moment

345
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,177
felt so precious.

346
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,253
I can't believe
I'm seeing the Alps with you.

347
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,591
From now on, when we think of Switzerland,

348
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
let's think of the Alps.

349
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,267
Let this moment be
how we remember Switzerland.

350
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,146
Okay.

351
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,442
Let's take a photo.

352
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,700
I can't say no to a selfie.

353
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,372
Ta-da!

354
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,293
-You packed this yourself?
-Yes.

355
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,594
Suddenly,

356
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,097
I felt a sense of relief.

357
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,436
I'm so glad.

358
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,896
What?

359
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,732
That I came here with you.

360
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,448
So there's no reason for you
to bear any guilt, okay?

361
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,035
You really can't.

362
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,664
My therapist told me this once.

363
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,916
Guilt is…

364
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,545
a deep and relentless emotion.

365
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,800
So when the pain is unbearable,

366
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,261
some people end up
inventing their own guilt.

367
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,270
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't go to sleep.

368
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,273
Sang-yeon's words

369
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,817
lingered in my mind.

370
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,071
Had the pain been so unbearable

371
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,449
for Sang-yeon over the years

372
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,412
that she had created
her own feelings of guilt?

373
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,463
Are you feeling okay?

374
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,216
Yes.

375
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,845
I'm feeling good today.

376
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,515
My head barely aches at all.

377
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,270
Yesterday was tough, wasn't it?

378
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,568
What should we do today?

379
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,695
Should we go over there?

380
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,990
I heard that Chagall designed
the stained-glass windows in that church.

381
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,868
Let's go scouting.

382
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,579
"Scouting"?

383
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,124
To the blue house.

384
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,965
That was the place

385
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,096
where Sang-yeon was intending
to end her life.

386
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,921
Both Sang-yeon and I

387
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,883
could feel that something was coming.

388
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,598
All I could do

389
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,518
was to hope for Sang-yeon

390
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,104
to have a change of heart.

391
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,074
Ta-da!

392
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,747
What do you think?

393
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,129
Is my dress prettier?

394
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,468
They're both pretty.

395
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,845
Let's try them on.

396
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,268
Are you sure you're all right?

397
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,064
You were shaking back there.

398
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,738
I was nervous, of course.

399
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,576
It was so scary,

400
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,412
to see that blue door.

401
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,129
It felt as though
I was looking at the Iguazu Falls.

402
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,092
It's the most powerful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

403
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,346
When I saw the Iguazu Falls…

404
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,100
I was completely overwhelmed.

405
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,603
I felt scared it would swallow me whole.

406
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,648
Yet, rather than feel repelled by it,

407
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,817
I thought, "Oh,

408
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,028
"I am really here."

409
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,242
"I am actually seeing this."
And I thought,

410
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,995
"There, I'm satisfied."

411
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,998
A hush settled over me.

412
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,302
I'm so happy right now

413
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,722
because I get to be here with you.

414
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,646
In moments when I was writhing in pain,

415
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,481
I could only see

416
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,068
two kinds of death before me.

417
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,282
A death like my mom's…

418
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,871
or a death like my brother's.

419
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,836
But when I found out
about this place in Switzerland,

420
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,588
I felt so comforted.

421
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,426
I couldn't stop thinking about my brother.

422
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,348
If he had to go through with that…

423
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,562
if his life was fated to end like that…

424
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:16,070
it would have been nice
if he'd had a Switzerland of his own.

425
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,117
It would have been nice
if my mom had one too.

426
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,580
If I only could,

427
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,417
I would have held their hands
and gone with them.

428
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,010
But here I am.

429
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,182
I'm neither up in the cold mountains

430
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,644
nor completely shattered by pain.

431
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,316
Nor am I alone,
because you're here with me.

432
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,989
Eun-jung.

433
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,744
Nobody could face their death

434
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,038
as happily as I am.

435
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,292
That's why I hope…

436
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,213
we can spend our last night…

437
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,300
laughing.

438
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,228
I really don't want
to fall asleep tonight.

439
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,523
Me neither.

440
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,276
Let's stay awake.

441
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,363
I'm totally going to stay awake.

442
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,744
I'm going to watch the sunrise tomorrow.

443
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,122
I should say goodbye

444
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,082
to my last sunrise.

445
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,049
Let's set five alarms.

446
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,178
No.

447
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,721
How about ten?

448
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,229
I have…

449
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,233
you to thank for everything.

450
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,318
How so?

451
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,405
When I was younger,

452
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,909
you got me into reading books…

453
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,497
and sparked my interest in films.

454
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,086
How I quit university and majored in film…

455
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,881
Why I ultimately left my job

456
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,259
to write screenplays for TV series…

457
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,013
I owe everything to you.

458
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,142
No way.

459
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,230
So I practically created you.

460
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,067
Exactly. I find it absurd too.

461
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,614
It's the same for me.

462
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,287
I went offtrack because of you…

463
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,165
and I became wealthy

464
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,002
by stealing what was yours.

465
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,840
I even got married…

466
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,844
due to your curse.

467
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,182
I mean it.

468
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,019
There's truly no one else

469
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,771
like you.

470
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,403
You're the only one like you as well.

471
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,456
I wonder why I acted that way.

472
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,213
You were the only friend I had.

473
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,093
I wonder why I let myself…

474
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:52,971
lose you.

475
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,224
But in the end,

476
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,769
you found me again.

477
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,105
I did?

478
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,525
Of course.

479
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,157
Will you miss me too?

480
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,544
Of course I'll miss you.

481
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,772
So you have accepted me…

482
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,402
in the end.

483
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,405
You have.

484
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,247
I think my mom would be so happy…

485
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,583
to see me here with you.

486
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,132
Yes.

487
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,305
She would hug me, right?

488
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,686
Of course.

489
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,005
Sang-yeon…

490
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:48,957
Eun-jung.

491
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,169
Yeah?

492
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:53,920
What is it?

493
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,855
How beautiful.

494
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,274
Yeah.

495
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,157
Still, I wish we were back in Korea.

496
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,453
It would have been nice

497
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,539
to see my last sunrise there.

498
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,095
Eun-jung.

499
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,097
Come here.

500
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
What is this?

501
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,162
The key

502
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,665
to the top drawer of my desk.

503
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,126
If you look in there,

504
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,004
you'll find my diary.

505
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,634
Use it however you like.

506
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,846
It was great.

507
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,683
The story you wrote about us.

508
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,982
If you finish writing that…

509
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,278
it would be as though…

510
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,282
I am living on in your story forever.

511
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,286
And

512
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,914
let's just say our farewells here.

513
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,002
Thank you for everything.

514
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,713
Truly.

515
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,770
Just ask me to come with you.

516
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,859
Say what you really want.

517
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,411
You want me to come with you, don't you?

518
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,882
Yes.

519
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,428
Are you okay?

520
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,598
Yeah.

521
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,518
Don't you feel scared?

522
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,773
I'm not scared.

523
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,820
That's good to hear.

524
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,241
Give me a hug.

525
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,844
When we meet again…

526
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,390
I promise I'll be a good friend.

527
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,519
Okay.

528
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,438
Let's meet again.

529
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,076
Sang-yeon

530
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,287
opened the valve.

531
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,332
With resolve

532
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,252
and without a moment's hesitation.

533
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,025
Sang-yeon…

534
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,738
you did well.

535
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,907
You did so well.

536
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,202
You held on so well.

537
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,337
Everything is okay now.

538
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,124
It took a long time…

539
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,086
before I could finally…

540
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,759
place a picture of you on my desk.

541
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,350
Before I could finally bid you farewell.

542
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,563
Goodbye…

543
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,068
my friend…

544
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,323
whom I hated…

545
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,829
and loved.

546
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,835
Cheon Sang-yeon.

547
