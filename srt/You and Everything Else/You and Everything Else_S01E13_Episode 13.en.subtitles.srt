1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,595
You…

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,976
can live without him just fine.

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,191
But I have nobody,

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,235
so please…

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,280
please don't see him.

6
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,452
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,204
Promise me that you won't see him.

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,878
You're being strange.

9
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,048
You're acting really strange.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,549
This isn't normal--

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,427
I had feelings for him first.

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,724
If it hadn't been you,

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,186
I wouldn't have cared
if he had a girlfriend or not.

14
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,148
But I stayed away because of you.

15
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,778
Because you were more important to me.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,076
It's been ten years.

17
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,997
If you loved him so much,
you should have told him by now.

18
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,502
After all this time,
how was it because of me?

19
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,048
You don't know how…

20
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,676
you don't know
how hard I fought to keep going.

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,389
You brought him back into my life,

22
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,392
so why are you getting in the way now?

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,646
You're the one who got in the way.

24
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,650
Back then and even now,

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,069
it was always you.

26
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,282
You were the one who first suggested

27
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,284
we work with him.

28
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,202
So?

29
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,458
Are you going to date him again?

30
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,710
Do I owe you an answer?

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,757
Eun-jung.

32
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,843
Eun-jung, you're a nice person.

33
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,719
I'm not nice at all.

34
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,639
Is that

35
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,851
your idea of being nice?

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,603
What do you want from me?

37
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,021
Call it what you like.

38
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,774
I don't care if it's out of pity.

39
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,943
Just please don't date him.

40
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,028
Why would I pity you?

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,617
What you're doing now isn't love.

42
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,329
It's a twisted obsession.

43
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,457
You're right. I'm twisted and sick.

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,044
You're right about everything,
so please don't see him.

45
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,504
I beg you.

46
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,062
Get it together, Cheon Sang-yeon.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,818
Whatever we decide to do…

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,488
It's between him and me.

49
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,722
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

50
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,865
What you're doing now isn't love.

51
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,701
It's a twisted obsession.

52
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,192
You have it all.

53
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,155
You even have a loving mom.

54
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,535
But I have nothing.

55
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,831
So please…

56
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,251
don't see him.

57
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,805
Seonbae.

58
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,566
I…

59
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,071
don't think I can do this.

60
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,839
I understand where you're coming from.

61
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,720
I've also thought about
how nice it would have been

62
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,348
if we were meeting now for the first time.

63
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,186
I tried hard to resist it,

64
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,147
but I'll admit that I was swayed.

65
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,650
Even so, I--

66
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,568
Eun-jung.

67
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,158
You don't have to explain.

68
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,413
I understand how you feel.

69
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,627
I must say, I expected this.

70
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,798
I let my lingering feelings…

71
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,427
hurt you once again.

72
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,472
Don't say that.

73
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,852
I am sorry

74
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,230
for turning you down.

75
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,567
At least a weight's been lifted
now that I've told you.

76
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,615
I think I can finally move on.

77
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,458
-Where are you headed?
-To check on the equipment. You?

78
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,751
-The office?
-Yes.

79
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,962
Ryu Eun-jung.

80
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
Let's finally enjoy being colleagues.

81
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,469
Sure.

82
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,056
I hope we get along, Director Kim.

83
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,309
Likewise.

84
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,061
Bye.

85
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,825
Hello, Producer Ryu.

86
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,914
Where's Ho-cheol?

87
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,998
In the bathroom.

88
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,751
Then shall we start
the technical meeting in ten?

89
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,294
Sure, since we're short on time.

90
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,468
How's that sound, Producer Cheon?

91
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,427
Hello?

92
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
Yes, hello.

93
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:16,931
Yes.

94
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,182
Did something happen?

95
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,106
The update for the fifth shoot
is the lead actors' waiting area.

96
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,485
The waiting area is a bit far
from the parking lot.

97
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,820
It's fine where it is.

98
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,031
Even if it's far,
they'll get more privacy during breaks.

99
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,203
What did the assistant director say
about the actors' call times?

100
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,164
We'll start at 9:00 a.m.,
so they can come in by 7:30,

101
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,958
but Lee's always late, so 7:00 a.m.

102
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,628
I think doing that from day one
might backfire.

103
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,050
I agree that we should start
with a call time of 7:30.

104
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:53,968
Okay.

105
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,139
How early does
Director Gyeong usually arrive?

106
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,314
-Producer Cheon?
-The sixth update.

107
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,276
Aren't we moving on?

108
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,739
Shall we move on to the sixth shoot, then?

109
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,073
Yes.

110
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,079
-Great work, everyone.
-Great work.

111
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
We need to talk.

112
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,670
I have a meeting.

113
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,844
I swear,

114
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,931
I never told the bastard to invest.

115
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,851
He practically begged me to include him,

116
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,896
but he's suing me
now that things have gone south.

117
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,440
How much did you scam off him?

118
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,566
Hey, I didn't scam--

119
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,449
120 million.

120
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,996
I'm not asking you to cover it all.

121
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,916
Just 80 million.

122
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,464
You work at a major company,

123
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,218
so that's doable for you, right?

124
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,140
Don't worry too much.
Your old man won't go down too easily.

125
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,393
I'll pick myself up no matter what

126
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,310
and repay you--

127
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,007
I'll give you the money.

128
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,385
Just wait.

129
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,889
In return, never show your face again.

130
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,767
Of course.

131
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,270
This really is the last time.

132
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,403
Sang-yeon.

133
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,406
These are new, damn it.

134
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,075
When do you think

135
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,286
you can get the money?

136
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,374
Dang, it's scuffed.

137
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,131
How could you afford new shoes?

138
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,261
I guess she didn't tell you.

139
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,808
She said she was your colleague.
This fair, young lady.

140
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,982
You received money from her?

141
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,321
Please tell me you didn't.

142
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,294
What's keeping you so busy?

143
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,213
I'm just brewing some tea.

144
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,134
Why would I be busy?
You're the one who's busy.

145
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,805
Why don't you drink the coffee I…

146
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,764
Right.

147
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,933
I've been liking tea these days.

148
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,519
I'll drink this instead.

149
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,356
Did you say filming starts in two days?

150
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,111
So, Yeong-seo met Jae-han before Min-ju

151
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,697
through an online music society
in middle school.

152
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,580
-Director Ju.
-Yes?

153
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,334
Did you meet Producer Cheon Sang-yeon?

154
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,006
Well, yes. She stopped by a few days ago.

155
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,679
She seemed concerned
that I wasn't attending the ritual.

156
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,558
She's nicer than I expected
and has plenty of great ideas too.

157
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,706
It's one million won.

158
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,257
Why stick your nose in my business?

159
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,342
You know how much

160
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,012
I hate it when you do that.

161
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,182
Keep out of my business for good.

162
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,312
I was planning on it.

163
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,399
I heard you went to Director Ju's studio.

164
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
Did you read our treatment?

165
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,324
Yes.

166
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,328
He emailed it to me.

167
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,373
-Without even telling me?
-Should he have?

168
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,836
Isn't it obvious?

169
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,840
Sneaking a look at a film treatment,

170
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,760
especially before our team lead's review,
is out of line.

171
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,511
I only dropped by

172
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,307
because he missed the ritual.
The rest just happened.

173
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,728
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I’ll be more careful going forward.

174
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,205
And cut!

175
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,331
-Cut!
-Play that back.

176
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,959
We're checking the shot, everyone.

177
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,670
Who suggested we call him at 7:30?

178
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,297
Call him half an hour earlier tomorrow.

179
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,257
-Okay.
-That won't be nearly enough.

180
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,469
-He arrived after 8:00 a.m. today.
-Man, he's really something.

181
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,558
No photos, please! No photos!

182
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,358
We're filming all day, so I'll be late.

183
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
You have shoots every day.

184
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,028
It's still early stages.

185
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,990
Eventually, I'll just attend
the key scenes.

186
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,785
Have you made up with Sang-yeon?

187
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,665
How much did you hear?

188
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,334
Just whatever I could make out.

189
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,171
Go on and patch things up.
You're not kids anymore.

190
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,132
There's nothing to patch up.

191
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,427
When backed into a corner,
people will go to great lengths--

192
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,344
Mom.

193
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,182
How is she backed into a corner?

194
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,686
Whatever. Just don’t even mention her.

195
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,196
So I can't take out a loan?

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,701
You would be eligible for the government's
Sunshine Loan or New Hope Loan.

197
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,911
The Sunshine Loan
offers up to ten million won,

198
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,621
and the New Hope Loan provides…

199
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,582
I called earlier, but I'll try again.

200
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,000
-Okay.
-Hi, Producer Ryu.

201
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,587
Is he still not here?

202
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,921
Don't get me started.

203
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,591
If it were up to me,
I'd expose him so badly.

204
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,508
What about Su-a?

205
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,801
Already here, of course.

206
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,846
If it were any other actress,
they would never wait this long.

207
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,643
There he is.

208
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,694
Cut. Okay.

209
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,696
Yes. Okay, let's eat now.

210
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,115
Enjoy your lunch,
and be back here by 2 p.m., please.

211
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,408
-Okay.
-Okay, by 2 p.m.!

212
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,326
Great work, guys.

213
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,535
Aren't you having lunch?

214
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
I need to clear my head first.

215
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,253
The company should speak to his people.

216
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,758
Is this about Seung-jae being late?

217
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,842
That's one issue.

218
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,887
He knows we have
back-to-back shoots in Gangneung

219
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,639
but booked another commercial.

220
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,434
I understand.

221
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,938
If you don't feel like having lunch,
shall I buy you something?

222
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,064
No, I'm good.

223
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,275
-I'll leave you to it, then.
-Okay.

224
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,693
Hello?

225
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,073
Ten million won?

226
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,118
Okay, I'll take the loan, then.

227
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,079
Yes, all right. Thank you.

228
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,414
You're not going to help your dad,
are you?

229
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,335
It's only right
to cut off leeching parents.

230
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,463
A dad who can't buy his daughter
a winter coat is no dad.

231
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,814
Right.

232
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,149
Okay.

233
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,610
-What did they say?
-He's coming.

234
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,530
They didn't specify when
but just said, "Coming," then hung up.

235
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
What was on the schedule?

236
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
What? Wait, Su-a is leaving.

237
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,287
I'll get Director Gyeong.

238
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,247
Su-a!

239
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
Su-a, please wait!

240
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,925
Come on, sir.

241
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,635
What time do you call this?

242
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,930
Who sent out the location?

243
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,975
Who the heck
sent out the location address?

244
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
I did.

245
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,478
You.

246
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,397
Do you know where I went, thanks to you?

247
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,149
I went all the way to Ssangmun-dong.

248
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,526
I texted again
to tell you it was Myeonmok-dong.

249
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,237
-Didn't you receive my--
-So we got it wrong?

250
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,323
-Is that it?
-Well, I clearly--

251
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,116
Seung-jae, you can talk to me--

252
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,076
Did you say "clearly"?

253
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,331
You clearly didn't.

254
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,334
Otherwise, why the fuck
did I end up at Ssangmun-dong?

255
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,544
For fuck's sake…

256
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,840
Did you just cuss at me?

257
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,134
I did no such thing.

258
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,011
You prick.

259
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,183
Hey, hit me if you want.

260
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,393
Go on. Hit me!

261
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,813
What did I even do wrong?

262
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,274
You little bastard…

263
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,658
What the…

264
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,575
Let go.

265
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,619
I said let go, damn it!

266
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,956
Director Kim,
what do you think you're doing?

267
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,918
Let go of him.

268
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,548
You're not the only one making this movie.

269
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,801
Please apologize to Ho-cheol.

270
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,763
Fucking hell.

271
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,559
I can't act today because my arm hurts.

272
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,146
I can't do this! Got it, you bastard?

273
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,402
And don't you fucking dare
apologize to me.

274
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,570
I won't accept your apology.

275
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,786
Seung-jae, talk to me.

276
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,623
Seung-jae.

277
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,769
Lee Seung-jae's people

278
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,230
want us to hire another cinematographer.

279
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,443
What does Gyeong say?

280
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,820
He won't allow it.

281
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:08,744
The agency executive insists that
Director Kim should personally apologize.

282
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,538
But Director Kim says no way in hell.

283
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,958
He never said that, actually.

284
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,295
He's willing to apologize,
but only if Lee Seung-jae

285
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,130
first apologizes to Ho-cheol.

286
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,381
It's the same thing.

287
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,637
His agency has put on a hard front,

288
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,432
but I'm sure
they're just as anxious as we are.

289
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,477
Our best course of action

290
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,772
is to give him a valid reason
to return to set.

291
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,358
And how on earth will we do that?

292
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,443
What if Ho-cheol apologizes?

293
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,115
Ho-cheol is the victim here.

294
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,619
If he hadn’t reacted
to Lee Seung-jae's initial provocations,

295
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,371
things wouldn't have blown up.

296
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,748
Ho-cheol's apology
could be a valid reason.

297
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,208
I can't agree to that.

298
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,253
Over 80% of our difficulties on set
are caused by Lee Seung-jae.

299
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,341
He ignores call times
and adjusts the schedule on a whim.

300
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,343
We should address everything now.

301
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,930
Do you really think that will work?
We just don't have time for that.

302
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,432
This Ho-cheol guy, will he apologize?

303
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,475
Sir.

304
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,894
Yes, he feels responsible.

305
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,981
Are you sure you didn't guilt him into it?

306
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,568
Even if he’s willing to apologize,
we can’t let him do that.

307
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,237
The entire crew saw what happened.

308
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,614
What would they think
if Ho-cheol apologized

309
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,950
after he was hit by Lee Seung-jae?

310
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,867
Producer Ryu.

311
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,665
Who do you think is crucial
in making this movie?

312
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,003
It’s not me

313
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,131
nor you, Producer Ryu.

314
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,717
It's not even Director Gyeong Seung-ju.

315
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,304
We are all replaceable.

316
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,558
But not Lee Seung-jae.

317
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,354
Without him,
this entire project falls apart.

318
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,315
At this rate,

319
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,610
we won't finish filming
before he's drafted, anyway.

320
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,990
Which is why we need this resolved.

321
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,617
Do you think
Ho-cheol’s apology will be enough?

322
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,369
Mr. Jeong.

323
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,662
We'll make it be enough.

324
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,998
I'll try

325
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,250
convincing Lee Seung-jae.

326
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,592
That rude prick.

327
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,137
Let’s call it a day for now.

328
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,890
Tomorrow's shoot is canceled,
and maybe even the day after.

329
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,266
Even the day after tomorrow?

330
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,187
Ho-cheol has agreed to apologize,
so I’ll keep you all updated.

331
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,564
Wait, Ho-cheol's apologizing?

332
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,693
Ho-cheol.

333
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,989
Did you say that you would apologize?

334
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,160
What other choice do we have?

335
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,829
If I get the movie shut down--

336
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,915
Who said that would happen?

337
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,042
It won't get shut down.

338
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,544
And you're the one

339
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,214
who should be receiving an apology.

340
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,722
Go and get some rest for now.

341
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,308
I'll just apologize.

342
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,061
It's only right.

343
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,687
How would that be right?

344
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,397
Once word gets out about this,

345
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,691
who would hire me?

346
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,068
I'll hire you.

347
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,655
Besides, I can find you a project to join

348
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,282
that's not ours, if need be.

349
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,291
Director Kim says he'll apologize.

350
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,130
Are you sure about this?

351
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,258
I prefer this over Ho-cheol apologizing.

352
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,429
How could I face Lee Seung-jae again
if Ho-cheol apologizes?

353
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,224
Thank you.

354
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,894
Don't thank me.
Where do I need to go tomorrow?

355
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,191
Look at that fruit basket.

356
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,444
Do you really need to apologize?
This is pissing me off.

357
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,988
It's the gesture that counts.

358
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,698
I'm off. Check on the equipment.

359
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,491
Damn it.

360
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,706
Well done for coming.

361
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,542
Nothing comes easy, does it?

362
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,003
Let's go inside.

363
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,006
This way.

364
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,677
Lee Seung-jae.

365
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,178
Right here.

366
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,141
Wait out here for a moment.

367
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,684
And this.

368
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,103
Let's just say Director Kim bought this.

369
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,372
Seung-jae.

370
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,583
How are you feeling?

371
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,295
He'll be in the hospital for two weeks.

372
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,006
My goodness.

373
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,675
Of course, your recovery
is our highest priority.

374
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,429
But I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

375
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,475
He's waiting out there to apologize.
What should we do?

376
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,312
You said you'd get him fired.

377
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,022
Come on.

378
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,941
We need to finish the movie
before you're drafted.

379
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,069
Damn it.

380
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,529
Seeing his face might be too triggering.

381
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,241
You should at least
give him a chance to apologize.

382
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,081
Let's have him come in.

383
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,053
Would you look at that?
Director Kim brought you a fruit basket!

384
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,930
Wow, these look great.

385
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,474
Vitamins do help with a swift recovery.

386
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,227
They sure look ripe.

387
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,901
I'm sorry, Seung-jae.

388
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,362
I sincerely apologize.

389
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,042
Come on, Director Kim is apologizing.

390
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,377
What do you say?

391
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,676
I apologize.

392
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,386
Truly.

393
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,851
You don't seem sorry at all.

394
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,939
Did you just laugh?

395
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
He's laughing because he's sorry.

396
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,193
Who apologizes

397
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,988
while snickering like that?

398
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,658
Get out.

399
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,082
Seung-jae.

400
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,093
-Sang-yeon.
-I should have apologized sooner.

401
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,471
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,640
We gave you the wrong information,

403
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,893
so please forgive us.

404
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,312
Why are you…

405
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,904
Good work, everyone.

406
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,366
You did well, Director Kim.

407
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,702
You too, Producer Cheon.

408
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,291
You guys take the car to set.
I'll just catch a cab.

409
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,797
He said he'd return, so we're good.

410
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,466
Lighten up, everyone.
You too, Producer Ryu.

411
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,134
Start the car, Yu-chan.

412
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,761
I'm leaving.

413
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,658
We need to talk.

414
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,251
Why did you have to go that far?

415
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

416
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,673
-Why would I thank you?
-It was either me on my knees or seonbae.

417
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,052
You wouldn't let Ho-cheol apologize.
How would you bear it if he--

418
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,263
It doesn't matter who was apologizing.

419
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,598
We both know nobody owed him an apology.

420
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,393
Why would you get on your knees
when he's the one…

421
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,271
Are you okay

422
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,565
with Ho-cheol apologizing

423
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,234
but not with seonbae doing so?

424
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,493
I get you like him,
but don't stoop so low.

425
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,956
Don't go so far for anyone,
not even for yourself.

426
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,209
That's not how to get things done.

427
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,170
I don't understand what you mean by that,

428
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,339
but at least I get things done.

429
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,883
Unlike you, who's all talk.

430
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,634
What have you resolved?

431
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,222
What you gave him today
wasn't just a reason to return.

432
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,516
You handed him a crown.

433
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,311
One that enables him to do as he pleases.

434
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,396
To keep being late.

435
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,358
To act violently toward others
without facing any repercussions--

436
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,570
But he is the king here.
At the top of the food chain.

437
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,158
Consider the money we lose
each day that filming is delayed.

438
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,333
You're lucky you have time
to worry about such petty things.

439
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,543
Yes, Director.

440
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,629
Yes, we just got back.

441
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,593
Is he really that incredible?

442
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,803
Why would you…

443
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,681
Why get on your knees because of some guy?

444
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,438
You're on about that kneeling thing too.

445
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,691
Can't you just let it go?

446
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,069
Why the hell would you do such a thing?

447
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,196
You wouldn't kneel to anyone--

448
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,864
Precisely.

449
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,951
So can't you, of all people,

450
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,370
just say "well done" and move on?

451
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,336
You don't see him as a man.

452
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,173
A woman in love doesn't do that.
This is more like an obsession.

453
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,593
You called me for this?

454
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,136
Yes, I called you to say this.

455
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,098
Because I was so stunned.

456
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,856
When you see Seung-jae tomorrow,
please greet him with a smile.

457
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,153
A boycott?

458
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,948
The entire crew is boycotting the shoot.

459
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,285
They want Lee Seung-jae to apologize
and Producer Cheon to leave the project.

460
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,374
They were shocked
that she made Ho-cheol apologize,

461
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,794
which forced Director Kim to step in
and apologize instead.

462
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,965
First off,
Seung-jae should apologize to Ho-cheol.

463
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,051
-Then Producer Cheon should drop out--
-I don't need an apology.

464
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm sorry.

465
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,806
You have no reason to be.

466
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,308
Where is everyone right now?

467
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,770
-I'll try to--
-I'll drop out.

468
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,191
That solves

469
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,861
at least one problem, right?

470
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,282
-Producer Cheon.
-I'll go.

471
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,288
Why won't you tell them the truth?

472
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,582
They'd change their minds
if they knew what you did.

473
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,375
For the whole world to know?

474
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,796
I don't want that.

475
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,593
Please just let this end

476
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,137
with me leaving the project.

477
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,434
Hey! Are you really quitting?

478
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,660
Upper management insists
we resolve this before any media fallout.

479
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,540
Lee Seung-jae has agreed to express
his regret, so let's settle it at that.

480
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,460
Be sure to explain this
at the core staff meeting.

481
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,421
What about Producer Cheon?

482
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,550
We'll get her working on another script.

483
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,012
Don't feel bad.

484
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,182
It is her fault for suggesting
we make Ho-cheol apologize.

485
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,645
But you agreed to that as well.

486
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,233
I'm a father of three.
Should I quit instead?

487
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,361
The project was yours to begin with.

488
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,988
See this as a blessing,
and let's make it work.

489
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,448
Okay?

490
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,430
You cleared your desk?

491
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,517
I just gave the division head
my letter of resignation.

492
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,980
What for?
Did they tell you to resign as well?

493
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,774
I wasn't fired. I chose to resign.

494
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,569
Why?

495
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,905
I'd rather not be pathetic.

496
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,495
Shouldn't you be happy?

497
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,455
Lucky you.

498
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,749
Now you get your project back.

499
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,338
Do you truly think that

500
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,050
resolving misunderstandings is pathetic?

501
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,679
That's just who I am.

502
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,977
How can you give up on things so easily?

503
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,564
Is your pride that important?

504
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,526
Yes.

505
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,031
It's more important than my life.

506
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,538
Then what does that leave you with?

507
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,501
If you give everything up
to protect your pride…

508
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,797
what does that leave you with?

509
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,055
Stay on the project
for Director Gyeong's sake.

510
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,140
I'll persuade the crew.

511
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,146
God, you're so full of it.

512
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,030
You think you’re a good person, don’t you?

513
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,162
You simply got lucky.

514
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,631
You seem to think

515
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,468
that you were always unlucky.

516
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,765
But you're the one who made your own luck.

517
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,352
I hope that you, at least once,
understand how it feels…

518
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,146
to be truly alone.

519
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,648
You chose to walk away

520
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,026
from those who cherished and loved you.

521
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,489
Ten years ago…

522
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,994
because you just had to
protect your pride.

523
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,416
Your loneliness was caused…

524
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,419
by you.

525
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,006
I resigned from JD today.

526
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,133
What?

527
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,056
I’m on my way back from meeting the crew.

528
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,059
I've cleared the air,
so you can come back.

529
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,063
You cleared the air?

530
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,731
I didn't tell them the details.

531
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,233
Just that you apologized for me.

532
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,612
The entire crew should understand by now,

533
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,405
so there's no issue.

534
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,784
In other words,
"We've graciously forgiven you,

535
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,161
so you can come back now."

536
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,499
I did nothing wrong.

537
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,796
So please let them know
that I don't need their understanding.

538
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,631
Sang-yeon.

539
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,257
It's already been decided.

540
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,058
Do you have anything more to say?

541
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,945
Take care.

542
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,537
Why, do you think I won't do just that?

543
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,876
You think the same, don't you?

544
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,712
You think I'm strange.

545
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
I've never said that.

546
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,385
You should learn to receive
from others for once.

547
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,305
I'm saying take care of yourself
and find some stability.

548
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,184
Like Eun-jung, you mean?

549
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,102
Yes.

550
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,562
At the very least,

551
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,605
Eun-jung always protects herself.

552
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,529
So you do think that.

553
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,992
You think I walked away from everything.

554
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,120
Sang-yeon.

555
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,872
But let me tell you this.

556
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,628
I did love you.

557
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,675
You're the one who walked away.

558
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,683
Nobody willingly ruins themselves.

559
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,483
Eun-jung would be the same
if she were in my shoes.

560
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:32,948
Go now.

561
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,120
And I hope we never cross paths again.

562
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,209
You're truly

563
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,128
a stranger to me now.

564
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,430
You think the same, don't you?

565
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,973
You think I'm strange.

566
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,391
At the very least,

567
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,769
Eun-jung always protects herself.

568
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,689
You're the one who made your own luck.

569
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,859
You chose to walk away.

570
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,154
Your loneliness was caused…

571
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,115
by you.

572
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,250
Why do you look so concerned?

573
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,210
Everything's finally as it should be.

574
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,922
Is it really?

575
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
Of course.

576
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,551
Whatever the case, it all turned out well.

577
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,763
But why don't I feel pleased?

578
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,851
Even if it's just once,

579
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,314
I wish I could truly understand
how Sang-yeon feels.

580
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,403
I wish I could know
what I did to anger her.

581
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,199
It's just her personality.
You can't explain people like her.

582
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,201
She wasn't like this back then.

583
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,912
Back when?

584
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,791
Back then.

585
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,753
Way back when.

586
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,050
When I think about her,
my mind always runs in circles.

587
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,596
Ryu Eun-jung.

588
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,518
Just walk away, okay?
There’s a reason it never worked out.

589
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,396
Why keep trying to understand her?

590
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,775
You seem relieved,
not having to deal with me anymore.

591
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,613
Of course.

592
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,073
I am super relieved.

593
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,367
Don't drink too fast though.

594
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,370
You shouldn't, but I will.

595
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:46,915
I'm free.

596
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,669
What do you mean you’re free?
You're unemployed now.

597
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,506
I finally quit

598
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,593
Kim Sang-hak.

599
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:02,931
You did?

600
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,814
Well done.

601
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,652
But why quit the company too?

602
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,445
You need the paycheck.

603
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,741
A monthly paycheck isn’t nearly enough.

604
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,535
Just you wait.

605
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,913
I will…

606
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,379
make a ton of money.

607
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,676
And when I do,

608
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,429
I'll help you make all the films you want.

609
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,558
I'm grateful.

610
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,936
You do know, don't you?

611
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,609
That I can do anything.

612
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,613
Of course.

613
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,700
Cheon Sang-yeon

614
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,202
can do anything.

615
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,415
Do you really know it though?

616
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,089
I really can do anything.

617
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,436
It should take around five minutes.

618
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,943
Just a little more.

619
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,326
Hello.

620
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,036
-Hey.
-Yes, hello.

621
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,872
Let's do that. Okay.

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,210
Let's roll once our body double's ready.

623
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,128
Yes, sir.

624
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,212
Yes, we're ready.

625
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,130
We're ready.

626
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,590
-On standby.
-Standby.

627
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,801
There you are.

628
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,471
It's great seeing you here, Director Han.

629
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,097
Likewise, sir.

630
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,476
Were you two always close?

631
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,311
Well,

632
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,731
I can't say we're close.
That's giving me too much credit.

633
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,691
You're too generous.

634
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,904
A producer as bright and talented
as Producer Cheon is a rare find.

635
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,171
DIRECTOR JU DONG-HYANG

636
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,344
I hope you've been well, Director Ju.

637
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:50,516
I was in the area and thought of you,
so I figured I should call.

638
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,643
Yes.

639
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,687
You're at your studio?

640
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,899
May I stop by for a moment, then?

641
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,401
All right.

642
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,283
What did they say?

643
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,994
The demolition's been postponed
for five days.

644
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,538
That's great.

645
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,957
How on earth did you convince them?

646
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,458
In the end, they wanted money.

647
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,669
Why didn't they just say so?

648
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,212
Now we can finally breathe.

649
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,589
-Thank you.
-No worries.

650
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,716
-Director Gyeong, we're ready.
-Okay.

651
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,051
All right. Shall we roll?

652
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,223
Sang-yeon?

653
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,018
-Mrs. Jang.
-So it is you, Sang-yeon.

654
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,895
What brings you here at this hour?

655
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,231
Oh, but Eun-jung's in Gangneung.

656
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,859
I know. I'm not here to see her.

657
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,611
Really? Then are you here to see me?

658
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,572
Yes.

659
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,741
I missed you too. It's good to see you.

660
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,743
You haven't eaten yet, have you? Let's go.

661
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,124
I have to leave soon.

662
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,626
I only came here to see you.

663
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,380
You're leaving without even having dinner?

664
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,215
Mrs. Jang.

665
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,133
Yes?

666
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,514
I know I'm a bitch…

667
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,436
but could you give me a hug, please?

668
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,559
I should go.

669
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,227
Sang-yeon.

670
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,856
Come again, okay?

671
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,489
Yes, Mrs. Jang.

672
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:11,823
Good.

673
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,954
Goodbye.

674
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,128
-Hello.
-Hey, where are you off to?

675
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,505
I'm going fishing.

676
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,549
I'm going to an Internet café
to get some serious gaming in.

677
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,927
They're pumped to finally get a day off.

678
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,221
-What are you up to?
-I'm going to eat and sleep.

679
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,014
Me too.

680
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,182
-See you.
-Have fun.

681
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,517
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

682
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,768
Go on ahead.

683
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,022
Hey, Hui-jin.

684
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,067
Me? I'm chilling, of course.

685
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,695
Did you hear the buzz about our day off?

686
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,656
What?

687
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,035
She took what?

688
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,674
What do you mean she took everything?

689
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,969
Cheon Sang-yeon and Director Han Jae-jun
launched a company together,

690
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,973
and JD invested ten billion won
in return for 100% of the company shares.

691
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,685
The kicker is that Director Ju Dong-hyang
has decided to leave with her.

692
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,815
I hear her primary condition
was securing Young Hearts.

693
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,881
There you are.

694
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,098
How do you like the name Swallow?

695
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,436
The name of my company.

696
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,981
Swallow Pictures.

697
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,822
Is it true
that you'll be taking Young Hearts?

698
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,907
I already did.

699
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,949
No.

700
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,244
You can't take it.

701
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,124
This is stealing.

702
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,336
Stealing someone else's project.

703
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,755
I'm not stealing just anyone's project.

704
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,841
I'm stealing yours.

705
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,142
Why?

706
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,020
Why are you doing this to me?

707
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,819
I hate that you're fine.

708
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,161
I want to see you ruined,

709
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,622
like me.

710
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:48,053
