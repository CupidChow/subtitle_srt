1
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,524
Wait a minute, Eun-jung.
It's not what it sounds like.

2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,027
I swear, my feelings
haven't changed for you.

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,821
I can't understand
why I'm doing this either.

4
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,489
[inhales sharply]

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,867
So just

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,286
give me some time, will you?

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,954
[Eun-jung] Then what?

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,252
You'll let us know
which one of us you like more?

9
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,719
I don't want that.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,640
You already decided…

11
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,645
the minute you turned off your phone.

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,403
[pensive music playing]

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,203
[sighs]

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,346
Hey, Eun-jung, can we talk?

15
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,102
- Yesterday, I--
- There's nothing to say.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,648
Sang-hak and I are over.

17
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,905
[door closes]

18
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,178
[sighs]

19
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,071
[tender music playing]

20
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,109
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

21
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,235
[music fades]

22
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,529
And Eun-jung?

23
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,823
[A-ra] <i>She was supposed to be</i>
<i>on desk duty this morning.</i>

24
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>She didn't show or give me a heads-up.</i>

25
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,672
Okay, I'll go over there
right now and check.

26
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,675
Can you let me know
if she contacts you before I get there?

27
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,276
[somber music playing]

28
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,244
SENDER
PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK

29
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:17,966
[gasps]

30
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,134
It's nothing, Ms. Jang.

31
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,429
She wasn't in her bed this morning.
so I thought she might've gone to yours.

32
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,932
- Bye.
- [line beeps]

33
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,894
[line ringing]

34
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,104
Hey, where are you?

35
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,485
She isn't home right now.

36
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,322
But A-ra… called you about this, right?

37
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,492
What time did she leave?

38
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,327
What did you say to her yesterday?

39
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,124
[Sang-hak sighs]

40
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,336
- [unsettling music playing]
- [breathing heavily]

41
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,280
[music slowly fades]

42
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,953
[A-ra] Did something happen to Eun-jung?

43
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,789
I called Sang-hak.
He wasn't making any sense.

44
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,168
What's going on? They looked so in love.
Did they have a fight?

45
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,212
I don't actually know.

46
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,466
[A-ra] Okay. You can refill
the pamphlets here.

47
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,009
- I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

48
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,345
[pensive music playing]

49
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,099
[Eun-jung] <i>I wanted</i>
<i>to stop my thoughts from racing.</i>

50
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,061
<i>And if I couldn't stop them,</i>

51
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>then I wanted to blame someone.</i>

52
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,608
<i>This is </i>your <i>fault.</i>

53
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,613
<i>What you did to me was wrong.</i>

54
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,122
[Kim Sang-hak] <i>When I get my discharge</i>…

55
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>we should come back here.</i>

56
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,716
[whispering] I like you so much.

57
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,808
[Eun-jung] <i>How long will it take</i>
<i>for the memories of us to fade away?</i>

58
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,772
<i>Is it even possible for me to forget?</i>

59
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,860
[pensive music continues]

60
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,196
[footsteps approaching]

61
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,260
[Sang-yeon] I don't think she's home yet.

62
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,809
You should go.
If she comes home, I'll text you.

63
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,394
Okay.

64
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,152
[sighs heavily]

65
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,736
[door slams closed]

66
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,158
[pensive music continues]

67
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,833
- [beep]
- [outgoing call tone]

68
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,127
Where are you, Eun-jung?

69
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,421
Why are you making me so worried?

70
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,844
[sighs]

71
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,642
- [sighs]
- [music fades]

72
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
[train chugging]

73
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,731
[birds singing]

74
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,075
- [Eun-jung] Go.
- Can we please talk?

75
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,537
Don't bother coming to the exhibit today.

76
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,999
Eun-jung.

77
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,251
[footsteps receding]

78
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,378
[sighs]

79
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,463
[front door closes]

80
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,342
Where have you been all this time?

81
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,135
Mountains.

82
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,264
And Sang-hak?

83
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,310
I told him to go.

84
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,897
You should rest.
You need to get your photo later.

85
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,775
- That's not important now.
- Then what is?

86
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,902
[Sang-yeon sighs]

87
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,696
You have misunderstood the whole thing.

88
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
I'm not the reason he's here. I swear.

89
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,703
He came out of pity.
There's nothing else going on.

90
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,541
You said you had a crush on a guitarist.
But you lied, didn't you?

91
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,796
You said he strummed with his left hand
and dropped out of high school.

92
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,675
[Sang-yeon sighs]

93
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,885
You're right.

94
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,513
I had feelings for Sang-hak.

95
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,101
But he never liked me.
I promise you that was all it was.

96
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,022
- Is that so wrong that I--
- I never said it was wrong to like him.

97
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,067
You're free to feel however you want.

98
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,362
The reason that I'm so angry with you

99
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,200
is that you've made me into an obstacle
standing in between you both.

100
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,954
[somber music playing]

101
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,622
Sorry.

102
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,166
I apologize I didn't tell you sooner.

103
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,087
But the person he likes is you, Eun-jung.

104
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,631
He told me himself
he has feelings for you,

105
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,966
and he's never even thought--

106
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,594
I don't need you to convince
me about how he feels.

107
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,850
Why don't you tell me
what's been going on?

108
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,606
What happened with <i>oppa</i>?

109
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,613
If you had been honest with me,

110
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,407
I would've been all right
with you both going alone

111
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,409
somewhere even further than Jecheon.

112
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,077
I didn't want to tell you.

113
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,666
Why?

114
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,718
You shouldn't have kept it from me.

115
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,640
I have been treading so carefully…

116
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,602
waiting for you to open up to me.

117
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,189
I didn't wanna make you open old wounds.

118
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,276
You used your brother as an excuse,

119
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,446
because you wanted
more time alone with Sang-hak.

120
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,158
Yeah, you're right.

121
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,702
That's part of it, but…

122
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,581
I admit I wanted it to.

123
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,170
But he came all the way
over to Jecheon for a good reason.

124
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,924
- It had nothing to do with him liking me--
- Tell me what that good reason was.

125
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,388
As soon as he heard you weren't here,
he rushed to your side,

126
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,764
and ignored me.

127
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,896
Are you even my friend?

128
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,735
Eun-jung.

129
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,154
Don't ever talk about Sang-hak
to me again.

130
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,783
This is between him and me.

131
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,326
[somber music intensifies]

132
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,717
- [Su-mi] Here. [grunts]
- [Hyeon-gyu] Yeah.

133
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,218
[Su-mi wipes hands together]

134
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,803
[Su-mi] What's wrong?

135
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,348
- I'm a little tired. I should go--
- [A-ra] Hey.

136
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
Where do you think you're going?

137
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,477
You didn't show yesterday,
and now you're skipping the wrap party?

138
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,021
Not a chance. I'll be back.
Don't let her go anywhere.

139
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,606
- [Hyeon-gyu] Understood.
- [A-ra] Ma'am.

140
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,025
- [Su-mi] Let's go.
- We can handle the drop-off.

141
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,196
In exchange, may we skip
the wrap party? [chuckles softly]

142
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,365
- We haven't gone on a date in ages, so…
- [all gasp]

143
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,951
[Su-mi] That is the one exception
we can make.

144
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,746
- [A-ra] Yep. Dates are acceptable.
- [Jeong-seon] Leave 'em to it.

145
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,705
[Su-mi] Okay.

146
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,664
Cheers.

147
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,958
- Great job, you guys.
- Nice job, you all.

148
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,419
[Hyeon-guk] To our rookie members!
You all did a great job.

149
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,503
[Jeong-seon] Ah!

150
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,424
[Su-mi] Hey, guys, seriously, great job.
How many visitors did we get?

151
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,093
- [Chang-wook] Gosh, I'd say almost 200.
- [all] Whoa!

152
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,219
You two fought?

153
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,764
Just let it go.

154
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,768
I can't do that. Was it serious?
You wouldn't be this quiet otherwise.

155
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,853
What about Sang-hak <i>oppa</i>? Where is he?

156
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,606
That's exactly why
I'm asking you to let things go.

157
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,150
[Su-mi] Hey, Eun-jung.

158
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
Let's create a couple's display
in the clubroom,

159
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,654
where we can see Sang-hak's photos
right beside your photos--

160
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,781
Don't do that!

161
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,948
[stunned silence]

162
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,618
[Su-mi] Why?

163
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,497
Oh… [chuckles uneasily] It's just
that we're too recognizable in those--

164
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,374
[scoffs] Hey, are you guys over?

165
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,793
- [laughs]
- [all laugh]

166
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,920
Oh, come on, Hyeon-guk, quit it!

167
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:20,049
I mean, it's only a couple of photos.
You're being a bit ridiculous, no?

168
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,759
- Hyeon-guk.
- [Hyeon-guk] What?

169
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,303
You're not allowed
to treat breakups so lightly.

170
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,014
- [Su-mi] He's single. He knows nothing.
- Am I right?

171
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,683
All right, let's take a shot
since you all know now.

172

00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,671
I think he might've actually
quit the club for good.

521
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,757
He quit the club?

522
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,052
<i>He came and cleared out all his things</i>
<i>last time he had time off.</i>

523
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,805

<i>to feel uncomfortable.</i>

524

[scoffs] You called me
just to tell me that?

525

<i>Oh, right.</i>

526
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,981
Why did Sang-yeon taking the semester off?

527
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,985
Wait, she's… taking it off too?

536
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,240
Why would you move out?

537
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,911
Our lease isn't over.
We still have two months left.

538
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,872
'Cause… the house
I lived in was available.

539
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,542
- Yeah, but that house isn't--
- You'll find there's 5,000 won in there.

540
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,839
I received the deposit
but… something urgent came up, so…

541
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,760
I used it all without telling you.
I'm sorry.

542
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,891
I came here to tell you that.

543
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,191
Is this all…

544
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,653
because of Sang-hak?

545
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,657
What does Sang-hak have to do with me?

546
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,245
- Never mind.
- What do you mean by that?

547
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,581
What are you implying?

548
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,421
For someone who was so dedicated
to graduate early,

549
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,758
I'm kind of confused
why you would take a semester off.

550
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,261
You thought
I'd start dating him or something?

551
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,722
I never said that.

552
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,605
I already broke things off,
so… it's none of my business.

553
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,070
Why did you leave school?
What urgent thing came up?

554
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,825
Just take the money, will you?

555
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,953
I will pay everything back,

556
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,455
I promise you.

557
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,167
I don't know what's going on, but you can
explain it all later if you want.

558
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,588
You should keep your money.

559
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,051
You said it was urgent, so just use it.

560
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,846
I never expected any of it back anyway.

561
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,352
You weren't expecting any of it back?

562
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,900
Do you think I'll keep living like this?

563
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,321
You're putting words in my mouth.

564
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,574
I made it clear.
You can pay me back later when--

565
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,160
Are you seriously gonna
keep humiliating me?

566
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,832
I don't understand--

567
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,460
Why do you think
you can always act so generously?

568
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,756
It's none of your business?

569
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,801
But the one who read my diary was you.

570
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,471
Deep down,

571
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,766
I know you're actually blaming me
for your breakup with Sang-hak.

572
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,851
Why?

573
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,021
Does it hurt your pride
to finally confess it?

574
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,649
That you two broke up because of me?

575
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,651
Just vent already.

576
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,488
And stop playing… with my emotions.

577
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,995
"Playing with your… emotions"?

578
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,706
Every single time
you sent the monthly rent out,

579
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,917
how do you think I felt?

580
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,506
No one has ever made me loathe myself

581
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,590
the way you did.

582
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,555
How much more humiliation do you want me
to suffer before you're satisfied?

583
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,266
How much more superior must you feel

584
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,937
before your broken pride
is finally healed?

585
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,691
- Stop it.
- I'll tell you one last time.

586
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,903
Kim Sang-hak is nothing.

587
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,698
He's just a guy, and I don't want him.

588
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,369
So you can stop pretending to be kind.

589
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,038
And since you can't seem to forget him,

590
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,125
he's all yours.

591
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:10,007
- You can stop now.
- I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

592
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,301
I hope to never see you again.

[Eun-jung] Sang-yeon moved out.
She'll pay the rest of the deposit later.
