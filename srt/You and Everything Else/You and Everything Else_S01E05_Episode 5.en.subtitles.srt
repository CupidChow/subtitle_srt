1
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,041
What took you so long?

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,544
-Hyeon-guk, get the fire going.
-Eun-jung!

3
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,964
-Grab a new one.
-We're firing up the grill.

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,717
Let's talk for a second.

5
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,927
You can start eating without us.

6
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,556
Kim Sang-hak, you're supposed to grill!

7
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,891
Where are you going?

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,325
This letter is adorable.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,288
Is this why you were crying?
Because it brought up old memories?

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:28,838
I just felt bad
seeing Ms. Yoon like that.

11
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,720
Since Sang-yeon and I reconnected,

12
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,266
we haven't had a chance
to really talk about her brother.

13
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,563
I did ask her about him once though.

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,692
There must be people
who knew him in the past

15
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,822
who are still unaware that he's gone.

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,913
They must think that
he's somewhere, alive and well.

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,295
It's like that for me too.
He never even crosses my mind.

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,717
I figured it was her way of coping,

19
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,096
but seeing her behavior
towards Ms. Yoon today…

20
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,808
I really don't get it.

21
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,687
You felt it too, right?

22
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,943
She deliberately took us there
to hurt Ms. Yoon's feelings.

23
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,740
That's why…

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,704
I couldn't stand to look at her earlier.

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,835
What did she tell you?
Did she not say anything?

26
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,965
I'm not sure,

27
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,802
but she seemed pretty shaken up herself.

28
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,265
Why do something that's just going to
weigh on your own mind?

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,686
Sang-yeon's brother…

30
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,149
What happened to him?

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,279
It was suicide.

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,325
But I don't know why.

33
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:27,832
Sang-yeon told me that
Ms. Yoon disapproved of his girlfriend.

34
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,256
The night before he left…

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,052
I slept over at Sang-yeon's place.

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,558
In the middle of the night, he suddenly
offered to teach me how to use a camera.

37
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,227
Eun-jung.

38
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,520
Yes?

39
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,065
One second.

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,074
Now that I think about it,
it was an odd thing to do.

41
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,246
He was acting strange
in more ways than one that day…

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,667
but I missed all the signs.

43
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,378
Like an idiot.

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,592
Do you actually think it would have made
a difference if you'd caught on?

45
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,057
That's just not true.

46
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,726
That clover…

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,603
The clover?

48
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,066
The gift from your father? What about it?

49
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,778
My dad is…

50
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,449
He's dead.

51
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,203
I gave him something…

52
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,291
from someone who was dead.

53
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,668
Hey, that's absurd.

54
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,295
Come here.

55
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,348
Everyone, eat up before it burns.
What's taking them so long?

56
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,560
I know, right?
Did they have an argument or something?

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,770
-No.
-Here they come.

58
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,860
Where on earth have you been?
Get a move on already.

59
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,987
Man, I'm the best at grilling.

60
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,032
-You should've hurried, then.
-Come on, show us your skills.

61
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,242
Hey, mosquito alert.

62
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,536
Wait, were you crying?

63
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,332
Oppa, did you make her cry?

64
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,374
It's not like that.

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,710
Forget it and eat up. Open up.

66
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,880
How is it?

67
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,964
It's so good.

68
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,925
You heard her.
Your girlfriend says it's good.

69
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,595
-Duh, I grilled it.
-Do you guys even know good meat?

70
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,515
-It's burning.
-My bad.

71
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,560
-Flip that one.
-This one?

72
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,103
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

73
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,031
I'll take that. You take the smaller ones.
Take that fan instead.

74
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,038
-Is it heavy?
-Very.

75
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,175
All the stuff's moved in.
Shall we get to organizing?

76
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,179
This room could have been a tad bigger.

77
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,015
I told her to take the bigger room,
but she's so stubborn.

78
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,021
-Sang-yeon.
-Yeah?

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,356
Ms. Yoon's calling.

80
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,040
-Trust me. This is it.
-I got my workout for the day.

81
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,585
See? We're in the right place.

82
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
Hey!

83
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,963
-This place is great.
-Hi!

84
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,715
Cheers!

85
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,634
Don't even think about crashing here
after a night of drinking.

86
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,137
You two, don't ever let them in.

87
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,889
Of course we won't.

88
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,683
If we come knocking,
she'll welcome us with open arms.

89
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,060
-Really?
-And you'll be in the military anyway.

90
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,604
Don't bring up the m-word.

91
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,482
-I got a military exemption.
-You mentioned it again!

92
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,608
-Hi, Jeong-seon!
-Hi!

93
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,943
Here she is, the loyal one.

94
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,446
Eun-jung, meet your future.

95
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,158
She's been flying solo since Kyu-ho left
for the military a month ago.

96
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,204
Jeong-seon, what's it like sending
your boyfriend off to the military?

97
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,414
When's he leaving?

98
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,791
In six days.

99
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,837
You must be clueless as of now.
Enjoy your last moments, you two.

100
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,341
You're not planning on sticking around
at home all day, are you?

101
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,759
Sorry?

102
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:35,264
You need to give them some space
so they can be all lovey-dovey.

103
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,516
Hey, what are you…

104
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,267
Right.

105
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,685
Don't worry about us.

106
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,312
"Don't worry about us."

107
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
We're out of drinks.

108
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,942
-I'll go buy some.
-Me too.

109
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,903
Where are you two going?
Off to sneak a kiss?

110
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,571
Just a kiss?

111
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,281
What?

112
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,870
-Man, he's a total pervert.
-I'm cringing so hard.

113
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,790
Kyu-ho asked me to send him
an electric watch.

114
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,041
An electric watch?

115
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:06,254
Yeah. Not an expensive one
but a simple, black one.

116
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,173
-Do you know what that is?
-Yeah, they're…

117
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,017
Still unpacking?

118
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,562
Yeah. Just a bit.

119
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,274
Drinking wasn't the plan,
but they just showed up.

120
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
Sleep and finish tomorrow.

121
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,318
I will. Are you going to bed?

122
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,612
-Yeah.
-Good night.

123
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,530
You too.

124
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,032
Feel free to let me know.

125
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,494
You know, before he enlists…

126
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,456
I told you it's not like that.

127
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,375
Just tell me if you need to.

128
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,170
Instead of that,

129
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,424
let's get our stories straight.

130
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,761
-Stories?
-We're going on a trip in two days.

131
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm worried Mom might find out.

132
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,265
This trip is with you, okay?

133
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,309
Where are you going?

134
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,896
Gapyeong. Just for one night,
so we can't go anywhere far.

135
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,773
I got you.

136
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,567
Thanks.

137
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,642
What's this?

138
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,559
Get in.

139
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,853
Are we taking this car? Look at this.

140
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,356
It's my dad's.

141
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,692
I've never seen you drive before.

142
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,778
Get in. We'll give you a ride to school.

143
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,197
I'm good. Go have fun. You too.

144
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,740
I'll drive you.

145
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,741
No, thanks.

146
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,958
Seonbae.

147
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,296
You look so cool driving.

148
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,923
Really?

149
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:19,011
You're all silent and serious.
What are you thinking about?

150
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,054
Dirty thoughts.

151
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,893
Dirty thoughts? As if!
I bet you're too focused on driving.

152
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,729
When I'm with you,
my mind's always in the gutter.

153
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,980
That reminds me.

154
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,150
Sang-yeon told me to let her know
if we want the house to ourselves.

155
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:38,572
Wow, however did she come up with
such a great idea?

156
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,203
I would gladly leave the house for her
every single day if she were dating.

157
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,539
-She doesn't want to date?
-It's not that.

158
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,960
She mentioned having a crush on someone
who she met online back in Gangneung.

159
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
Online?

160
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,257
It's unlike her, isn't it?
She said the feelings weren't mutual.

161
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,344
Have you ever met someone
in an online chat room?

162
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,262
You think?

163
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,722
I thought not.

164
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,041
-Give me a hand.
-Here.

165
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,251
Wait.

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,594
-Hey!
-Let's go!

167
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,678
Are you ready?

168
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,140
You fall, you lose, okay?
Don't get too hung up on winning.

169
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,810
I used to deliver milk.
I can even ride hands-free.

170
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,729
And the loser has to grant a wish.

171
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,023
Jeez, you sure talk a lot.

172
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,024
Ready, go!

173
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,318
Hey, you cheater!

174
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,681
Did you want to win that bad?

175
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,517
Of course. The prize was a wish.

176
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,268
So what's your wish?

177
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,187
Brace yourself.

178
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,611
Go on, then. I'll grant you any wish.

179
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,535
When I get discharged…

180
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,455
let's come back here.

181
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,833
What? That's your wish?

182
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,709
Yes.

183
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,883
What, you think I can't wait
two years for you?

184
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,553
I never imagined I'd feel this way,

185
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,099
but enlisting certainly sends you
on an emotional roller coaster.

186
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,227
You're so silly.

187
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,690
I like you so much.

188
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,347
-I need to go in now.
-Don't skip your meals.

189
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,185
-Take care, okay?
-Okay.

190
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,812
I'll be in touch.

191
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,444
Thanks for coming.
Take care on your way back.

192
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,987
-Yes, sir!
-Call when you're on leave.

193
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,284
I'll go now.

194
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,329
-Father, I'm going in!
-I'm off.

195
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,080
You got this!

196
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,750
-Write to us!
-Goodbye!

197
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,084
See you.

198
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,338
-I'm going in.
-See you.

199
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,006
-Bye.
-I'm off.

200
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,288
FROM PRIVATE KIM SANG-HAK
TO RYU EUN-JUNG

201
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:02,336
3 MONTHS LATER

202
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,295
Hey.

203
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,888
You have a letter from Sang-hak.
It's here with the electricity bill.

204
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,223
A letter?

205
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,752
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

206
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,964
Sang-yeon?

207
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,676
She stepped outside for a moment
but must have left her phone.

208
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,304
I'll tell her to call you
as soon as she gets back.

209
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,390
Yes.

210
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,312
Of course. You too, Ms. Yoon.

211
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,523
Goodbye, then.

212
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,744
You heard that, right? Give her a call.

213
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,043
Okay?

214
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,171
I'm going to cook ramyeon. Want some?

215
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,101
Can't you just answer her calls?

216
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,904
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll tell her to stop calling you.

217
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,739
That's not my point.

218
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,791
Stop calling Eun-jung
whenever you can't reach me.

219
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,751
She says it's annoying.

220
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,505
Whatever. Talk later.

221
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,300
Why did you do that?

222
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,641
You know I didn't say that
because I'm annoyed by her calls.

223
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,558
Then?

224
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,780
Is it that hard for you
to simply answer her calls?

225
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,661
What are you getting at?

226
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,174
You are all she has.

227
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,265
How ridiculous.

228
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,643
Hey.

229
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,731
You think every mother-daughter
relationship out there

230
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,818
is like the one
you have with your mom, don't you?

231
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,656
My mom and I were never meant to be
mother and daughter.

232
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,409
Don't say that.

233
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,827
She said it herself.

234
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,206
I won't ask you to believe me.

235
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:32,171
Just don't tell me what to do
when you don't know anything.

236
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
What would you even know?

237
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,019
What do you actually know?

238
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,734
I hear most moms…

239
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,821
when they lose a child,

240
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,367
try to carry on
for the sake of their other children.

241
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,037
But not my mom.

242
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,790
My mom, she…

243
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,757
You could never understand.

244
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,236
Sang-yeon and I didn't exchange
a single word for the next three days.

245
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,824
It was thanks to Sang-yeon
that I could finally bring myself

246
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,993
to develop that film roll.

247
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,997
My mind was all jumbled because of her,

248
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,542
and I drew strength from the anger.

249
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:02,302
The first photo was of a quote
from some book.

250
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,146
Then a frame that he had hung in his room.

251
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,191
A photo of Laika the dog.

252
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,569
Some VHS tapes.

253
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,033
The sticker I had placed.

254
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:38,463
He looked more peaceful
than I had always imagined.

255
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,656
What is this?

256
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,122
Photos that Sang-hak oppa took.

257
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,087
Not Sang-hak seonbae…

258
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,134
but your brother.

259
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,063
My brother?

260
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,738
I've actually had a film roll of his.

261
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,075
I joined the photography club

262
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,119
because I wanted to develop these.

263
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,915
Seeing her sitting there, trembling,

264
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,043
made the three days of silence

265
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,545
and our argument…

266
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,176
feel utterly pointless.

267
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:50,178
YOU'RE SO LUCKY

268
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,429
DO NOT ENTER
SANG-YEON'S ROOM

269
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,882
I had no clue back then…

270
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,388
just how deeply those photos affected her.

271
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,921
It's her, isn't it?

272
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,555
The woman that he loved.

273
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
Why did he die?

274
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,452
I know that it's my fault.

275
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,120
What?

276
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,623
You also think that he died because of me.

277
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,708
Can't you just let them date?

278
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,710
What?

279
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,340
Look. He'll never get over her.

280
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,636
If you keep doing this,
he might really leave home.

281
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,516
Do you mean to say
that he died because of me?

282
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,394
How is that because of me?

283
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:31,816
It's because of you.
You said yourself that you killed him.

284
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,946
If you hadn't gotten involved,
then he wouldn't have died!

285
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,994
I wouldn't have known
if it weren't for Sang-yeon.

286
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,997
Every single diary entry is about it.

287
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,749
I couldn't…

288
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,129
I couldn't sit back and do nothing.

289
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,550
I only showed you the diary
because I was curious.

290
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,930
Your grown son had found someone he loved,

291
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,434
and I couldn't understand
why you were making such a fuss.

292
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,853
But then…

293
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,774
a week later…

294
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,655
He died one week later.

295
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,076
He died because of me.

296
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,330
No. Sang-yeon, it's not like that.

297
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,668
I didn't know you felt that way.
It's simply not true--

298
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,212
Then tell me!

299
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,298
Tell me what the truth is!

300
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,804
"Your brother died
because of these other reasons,

301
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,598
so it's not your fault."

302
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,643
You need to tell me
so I can live with myself!

303
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,858
It wasn't your fault. It was my fault.

304
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,780
I'll know once I ask her.

305
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,491
I'm going to find this woman,

306
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,494
and I'm going to ask her.

307
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,001
Do you think I can't?

308
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,134
I know someone who knows him very well.

309
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,512
Who…

310
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,141
who knew my Sang-hak that well?

311
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,165
Hi, seonbae.

312
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,921
Are you on leave?

313
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,839
Yeah, my first military leave.

314
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,551
Done for today?

315
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,388
Yes, I'm done for today.

316
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,307
Good, because I was getting bored.

317
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,475
What about Eun-jung?

318
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,229
Tutoring. She'll be here in an hour or so.
Let's hang out and eat together, then.

319
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,817
Sure. But what should we do?

320
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,403
We could go to a café.
Or I was thinking about taking a walk.

321
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,155
-A walk?
-Yeah.

322
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,157
-Where?
-Up that mountain.

323
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,914
I don't really like mountains.

324
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,293
-Should we just go to a café?
-Sure.

325
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,886
Why do you look so down today?

326
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,763
-I do?
-Yeah.

327
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,141
Is it that obvious?

328
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,353
I thought I had a solid poker face.

329
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,774
What's got you feeling down?
Don't say it’s for no reason.

330
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,363
How did you know
I was just about to say that?

331
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,698
Well?

332
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,371
No reason, really.

333
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,125
How about this?

334
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,335
I just

335
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,797
felt like hating Mom today.

336
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,885
Let's leave it at that.

337
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,559
Shall we go for that walk?

338
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,729
Would you like that? All right, then.

339
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:42,275
Cafés can be stuffy, so a walk is great.
Let’s grab something to drink first.

340
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:51,951
But

341
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,038
why the sudden change of heart?

342
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,505
What would you like?

343
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,262
My brother

344
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,640
is dead.

345
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,696
I know.

346
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,453
I happened to figure it out,

347
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,581
and Eun-jung told me later.

348
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,714
I'm happy… that you told me yourself.

349
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,305
Could I have a milk tea, please?

350
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,890
Yeah, sure.

351
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,061
All right.

352
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,314
She just got off the subway.

353
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,694
-We'd better hurry, then.
-We'll go slowly but surely.

354
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,707
How have you been?

355
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:37,015
I'm telling you,
the air is fresher on the outside.

356
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:38,975
He's so silly.

357
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,893
Listen.

358
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,895
-Here's my list.
-Okay.

359
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,690
McDonald's, pork belly, chicken with beer,

360
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,609
pizza, jjatang.
That's black bean noodles and fried pork.

361
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,278
Ramyeon, Choco Pie, and Coke.

362
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,654
McDonald's comes first?

363
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,408
Yeah. And it has to be a Big Mac with
two patties and three pieces of bread.

364
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,996
Hold up, I already had Choco Pie and Coke.

365
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,082
I ate five in one sitting earlier.

366
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,167
Five?

367
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,763
Sang-yeon!

368
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,307
Cheon Sang-yeon!

369
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,816
I only found out later…

370
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,238
what Sang-hak seonbae…

371
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,659
truly meant to Sang-yeon.

372
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,641
It's on the third floor.
I'll see how it looks.

373
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,558
Sure.

374
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:10,983
FALL OF 1998

375
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,280
After quitting school
and moving to Gangneung,

376
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,159
Sang-yeon refused to do anything
for a long time.

377
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:08,040
She never went out,
met people, or spoke to anyone.

378
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,965
The only thing that Sang-yeon did…

379
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,347
was search for four-digit numbers.

380
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,016
GANGWON 81D 2578

381
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,730
Two, five, seven, eight…

382
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,363
INCORRECT PASSWORD

383
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:45,119
Sang-yeon had once asked her brother
about creating passwords,

384
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,162
and he had replied…

385
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,163
I don't know.

386
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:52,376
I guess you could use a combination
of four digits and some letters.

387
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:59,884
She had long forgotten why she was even
trying to log in to his account.

388
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,013
Like any other day, she was trying
different combinations when…

389
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,788
Laika 1957.

390
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,391
INCORRECT PASSWORD

391
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,522
INCORRECT PASSWORD

392
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:37,898
MESSAGE INBOX

393
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,734
INBOX

394
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,819
Why is it so cold in October?

395
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,867
I asked to delay printing the pamphlets,
but everyone says they can't wait.

396
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,786
At this point,
no one believes you'll return.

397
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,082
Even if you show up,
I won't return your tapes.

398
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:01,380
I'm not sure whether I'm messaging you
out of habit or stubbornness anymore.

399
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:06,469
My teacher says I might not get in
to university. Isn't that worth a reply?

400
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,349
Moonee? Is it really you? Hey, I--

401
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,925
How could you disappear like that?

402
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,428
Nobody believes me
that you appeared online.

403
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,266
We're having an impromptu meetup
tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. Please come.

404
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,354
You know Jang's Gamjatang, right?
Across the street from Cine Core.

405
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:08,572
CINE CORE

406
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,920
Come on in.

407
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:30,511
-Aren't you going to drink something?
-So is he coming or not?

408
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,513
Let's give him some time.

409
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,558
Are you sure he was online?

410
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,895
I'm positive. I messaged him about
our meetup, and he definitely read it.

411
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,107
What would you like?

412
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,945
Pork neck bone soup, please.

413
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,366
Either way, it's a relief. I was worried
something had happened to him.

414
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,286
So let's just wait one more week.

415
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,788
It's not like printing pamphlets
takes long.

416
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:02,126
Why should we wait for him?
It's not like he was anything special.

417
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,921
He was to Uncle Tat.
You know he respected Moonee.

418
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,298
And what about us?

419
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:12,136
Moonee needs to come back for his sake.
Don't you need to study for your exams?

420
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,391
I don't get it. He promised he'd come.

421
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,604
He's just some jerk
who let his art go to his head and quit.

422
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,232
Stop making a big fuss.
It's no big deal, okay?

423
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,151
Are you done talking?

424
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,239
Not yet. I haven't even begun.

425
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,035
I wasn't going to say this,

426
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,204
but do you know why
Dylan's been MIA lately?

427
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,539
What does that have to do with Moonee?

428
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:45,294
-Wait, hey--
-It's because Moonee hit on Dylan.

429
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,421
He acted innocent
but was a two-faced sneak.

430
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,340
Bullshit! Watch your damn mouth!

431
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,300
Watch your mouth, you little prick.

432
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,719
-Cut it out. Sorry, ma'am.
-What is this?

433
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,180
You can dish it out but can't take it?

434
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,558
Just because you hit on everyone
doesn't mean we all do.

435
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,019
Come on, guys!

436
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,188
Cut it out.

437
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,273
Are you okay?

438
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,409
Don't run your mouth
when you know nothing.

439
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,538
Moonee doesn't deserve to be
talked about like that.

440
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,747
Tat, wait.

441
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,666
-That little bastard.
-Drop it.

442
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,833
Hey!

443
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,419
-What's wrong with you kids?
-Sit down.

444
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,088
He was being a prick!

445
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,381
We're sorry, ma'am.

446
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,925
Hey, cool it.

447
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,159
Do you know
what people are saying about you?

448
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,454
That you're some art-obsessed nobody
trying to act relevant

449
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,207
and that Dylan quit
because you did her dirty.

450
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,501
Do you know what I think?

451
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,670
I agree with them.

452
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,757
You're a real coward,
and I won't be writing shit to you again.

453
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,260
This is my last message.

454
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,026
Thank you for…

455
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,738
fighting…

456
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,869
for me.

457
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,270
Hi, Uncle Tat.

458
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,524
I am doing well.

459
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,488
We can't meet right now, but…

460
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,533
I'm…

461
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,332
doing…

462
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,838
really…

463
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,169
From that moment on,

464
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:00,674
Sang-yeon decided to believe
that her brother was alive somewhere.

00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,837
Hello.

470
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,589
Introduce yourself now.

471
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,508
I'm a high schooler in Ilyeong.

472
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,885
I'm in high school too.

473
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,888
-Who's finished developing?
-I need another round.

474
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,807
How many rounds has it been already?

475
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,978
Everyone's busy preparing
for the exhibition. Excuse them.

476
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,609
I'm fine. It's fun just to watch.

477
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,736
Well, enjoy.

478
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,617
Is it okay that I don't know much
about photography?

479
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,410
It's my first time joining a club.

480
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,956
UNCLETAT HAS LEFT THE CHAT

481
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,503
UNCLETAT INVITED YOU TO A PRIVATE CHAT

482
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,097
Welcome.

483
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,066
May I take your order?

484
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,610
For drinks, we have Coke and Sprite.

485
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,488
Did you watch the Soonpoong rerun?

486
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,659
I've never watched it. Is it good?

487
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,788
No way. You've never watched
Soonpoong Clinic?

488
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,164
Are you even Korean?

489
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,084
Sorry?

490
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,086
No, I'm good.

491
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,843
I think I should give up
on this year's entrance exams.

492
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,849
Are your grades that bad?
Are you an airhead?

493
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,185
No way. I was just going through a phase.
I'm actually hella smart.

494
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,478
A phase?

495
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,986
There was something more important
than studying.

OFFLINE USERS
UNCLETAT

497
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,538
Let's do this!
I'm officially retaking the exam!

498
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,261
Perhaps he was busy
studying for the entrance exam.

499
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,891
There was no news from Uncle Tat
for a very long time.

500
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,818
Then, one day…

501
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,764
Guys, I'm back!

502
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,416
-Hello.
-Hello.

503
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,703
-Hey!
-Uncle Tat!

504
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,331
-Hey, bro.
-I heard you got in.

505
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,166
Yeongang University, was it? What major?

506
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,377
-Business management.
-Whoa, Kim Sang-hak.

507
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,129
Since when were you smart?

508
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,297
I've always been smart.

509
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,508
-Let's take a photo.
-Sure.

510
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,617
Kim…

511
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,954
Sang-hak.

512
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:09,626
That's when Sang-yeon decided
that she'd go to university.

513
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:15,173
It's nice to meet you.
We met at the booth.

514
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,883
I'm Kim Sang-hak, a business major.

515
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,801
I know.

516
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,929
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Engineering. Class of 2002.

517
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,349
Come on, put him in his place.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

518
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,310
These two are dating, by the way.

519
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,606
Wow, really? You guys look good together.

520
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,024
-Do we?
-Yeah.

521
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,067
That hurt my pride.

522
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,319
Honestly, you're not that handsome.

523
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,285
Sang-yeon said it had felt unfair.

524
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,974
Hi, seonbae.

525
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,111
It's been a while since I've smelled this.
The scent of mountains.

526
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,738
It's nice.

527
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,585
Sang-yeon.

528
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,131
I can't

529
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,801
possibly know exactly how you feel,

530
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:47,015
but I feel like I understand
to some extent, even if just a little.

531
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,811
I'm talking about
being the one left behind.

532
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,275
There was this guy
I was good friends with in the past.

533
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,737
One day, he just vanished.

534
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,825
You can never quite come to terms with it

535
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,995
because you will never know why.

536
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,290
I see.

537
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,836
Were you two very close?

538
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,464
Yes, we were.

539
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,384
Well, I can't speak for him,

540
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,721
but I really liked him as a person.

541
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,313
Do you want this?

542
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,482
What?

543
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,529
A watch?

544
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,825
It was a freebie,
but black isn't really my color.

545
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:51,037
Wow, I was looking to buy one
exactly like this.

546
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,000
It's a really cheap model,
probably because it was a freebie.

547
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,459
That doesn't matter.

548
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,088
Thanks, seriously.
I needed a watch just like this.

549
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,050
I'm glad it's something you needed.

550
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,429
Sang-yeon realized that day

551
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,224
that she had been in love with him
for a long time

552
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,811
and that she could no longer…

553
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,982
hide her feelings.

554
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,163
Sang-yeon.

555
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,125
Cheon Sang-yeon!

556
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,466
Maybe something's up.
I've never seen her act like that.

557
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,177
Maybe you should head home.

558
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,848
Please enjoy.

559
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,395
It's okay. I'll go check on her later.

560
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,066
This looks good.

561
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,784
-Did you get a new watch?
-Yeah.

562
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,243
Sang-yeon gave it to me.

563
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,330
She got it as a freebie
but didn't like the color.

564
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,210
A mountain?

565
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,796
Yeah, the one behind campus. Why?

566
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,510
It's nothing.

567
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,805
I'm glad.

568
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,765
Glad about what?

569
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,855
Sang-yeon used to be
really afraid of mountains.

570
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,067
Her brother was found on a mountain.

571
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,904
I see.

572
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,242
I also had a place
that I avoided for a long time.

573
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,786
Dajeong Supermarket.

574
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,374
Sang-hak oppa walked me home once,

575
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,876
and we had walked past there.

576
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,379
I couldn't go there for over a year.

577
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,716
I'm sure Sang-yeon
had it much worse than me.

578
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,512
She probably has countless places
that haunt her like that.

579
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,682
Sang-yeon told me today

580
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,017
that her brother died.

581
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,813
She did?

582
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,981
Yeah.

583
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,280
I think it might be a first for her…

584
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:36,327
opening up to someone about that.

585
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,039
It was probably because I suggested
going up the mountain.

586
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:50,633
Still, I think it’s great that she got to
share that with someone at all.

587
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:57,348
But I can't help but feel a little hurt.

588
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,605
I've been patiently waiting for her
to open up to me.

589
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:09,068
Knowing how painful it must have been,
it's not something I can just bring up.

590
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,615
Maybe it's like this.

591
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:19,204
I know nothing, so maybe she felt
more comfortable talking to me about it.

592
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,539
Things are different with you.

593
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:26,753
Perhaps that’s why it's harder for her
to open up to you about it.

594
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,382
Still, I want her to be honest with me.

595
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,929
I want her to tell me
if she's in pain or feeling sad.

596
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,351
Maybe someday, right?

597
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,061
Of course.

598
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:51,277
By the way, I developed the Tri-X roll.

599
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,781
Really? Let's see it, then. I'm curious.

600
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,287
Don't get jealous. He's really handsome.

601
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,380
Hey, I have this VHS tape too.

602
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,007
-Really?
-Stephen Chow's A Chinese Odyssey,

603
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,300
Parts one and two.

604
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,056
I placed this sticker in his room
when I was in elementary school.

605
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,476
I didn't even know
this was Sang-yeon's place.

606
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,435
-Really?
-Yeah.

607
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,982
That's Sang-yeon. Adorable, isn't she?

608
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:14,777
This person…

609
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,868
is Sang-yeon's brother?

610
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,080
Yeah.

611
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,167
Why?

612
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,631
I know him.

613
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,980
Sir, wait! I'd like to get off.

614
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,222
Did something happen?

615
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,892
You've never called this late.

616
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,775
Is this about how I left earlier?

617
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,985
I saw a photo of your brother.

618
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,908
It was you, wasn't it?

619
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,121
You're the one…

620
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,958
who replied to me as Moonee.

621
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:39,268
