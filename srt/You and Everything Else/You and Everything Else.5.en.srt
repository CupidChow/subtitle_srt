00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,208
- [Su-mi] What took you so long?
- [A-ra] What?

3
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,211
- Hyeon-guk, let's get the fire going.
- [A-ra] Hey, Eun-jung!

4
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,756
- [Jeong-seon] Let's start another one.
- [Su-mi] Start grilling.

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,508
Can we talk a second?

6
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,927
Go ahead and start without us!

7
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,347
[Su-mi] Where are you going?
You're supposed to grill!

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,891
[A-ra] Eun-jung, where are you going?

00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,814
[contemplative music playing]

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,325
This is a pretty sweet letter.

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,370
Is this why you were crying?
Reminded you of something?

12
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,958
I just…

13
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,713
I don't know.
I felt bad… seeing Ms. Yoon like that.

14
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,845
Sang-yeon and I haven't had the chance

15
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:40,266
to talk about her brother
since we reconnected either.

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,438
I asked about him. Just once though.

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,692
Not everybody who knew him
in the old neighborhood

18
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,239
knows that <i>oppa </i>is no longer with us.

19
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,869
Mm… I'm sure they'll think
he's alive and well somewhere,

20
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,913
living his life.

21
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,003
I'm doing the same thing.
I don't act like he died.

22
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,717
[Eun-jung] <i>I just thought that was</i>
<i>her way of coping with things, but…</i>

23
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,846
I saw how she acted
towards Ms. Yoon today.

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,724
I realized that wasn't it.

25
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,770
You felt it too, right?

26
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:32,527
She only took us there
to deliberately hurt Ms. Yoon's feelings.

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,740
And I…

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,704
I was really upset with her today.

29
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,835
What did you talk about?
Did she say anything?

30
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,798
Well, I'm not positive,

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,802
but she seemed to be pretty flustered.

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,346
[sighs] Why did she have to act like that?

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,682
I mean,
it would obviously weigh on her later.

34
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,436
About her brother…

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,065
What happened to him?

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,362
Suicide.

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,325
I never found out why.

38
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,369
Sang-yeon mentioned that

39
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,999
Ms. Yoon apparently didn't approve
of who he chose as his girlfriend.

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,215
The night before he left,

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
I stayed over at Sang-yeon's.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,558
In the middle of the night,
<i>oppa </i>suddenly gave me a camera lesson.

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,227
[Cheon Sang-hak] Eun-jung.

44
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,520
Yeah?

45
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,065
Hold on a minute.

[Eun-jung] <i>Reflecting on it now,</i>

49
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,115
<i>I realize it was odd</i>
<i>for him to act in that way.</i>

50
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,371
In many ways, though,
he wasn't being himself, actually.

51
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,583
Of course, hindsight is 20/20.

52
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,378
I was stupid.

53
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,257
So what you're saying is
that if you had known,

54
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,218
everything would've worked out
differently for him?

55
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,057
That's crazy. You couldn't have known.

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,143
I gave him the clover that day. [sniffles]

57
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
"The clover"?

58
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,066
What, the one your dad gave you?

59
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
I'm trying to say…

60
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,321
[sobs]

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,449
…it was supposed to be good luck.

62
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,370
But because it was a gift
from my dead father…

63
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>oppa</i>'s death was my fault.

64
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,917
Hey, come on. Don't say that.

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,671
- Oh my goodness, come here.

66
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,849

Dude, what's taking them so long?

67
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,601
I know.
Did those two get in a fight or something?

68
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,354
- Oh, no.
- [Hyeon-guk] Here they come.

69
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,525
- [Hyeon-guk] Mm-mm!
- [Su-mi] Hey, where've you been, buddy?

70
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,735
Hurry up!

71
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,987
[Sang-hak] Yeah, man.
You know I'm the grill master.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,032
- [Su-mi] Oh, yeah? Then let's switch.
- [Hyeon-guk] You should've come sooner.

[Su-mi giggles] You heard.

80
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,926
- Your girlfriend says it's good.
- [Sang-hak] Of course. I grilled it.

Of course I won't.

to send him a watch.

- [Hyeon-guk] Oh, a digital watch?

but the simple-looking ones in black.

- Uh-huh. Sort of.

everyone. It turned into a hangout.

- Go to sleep. Finish tomorrow.
- Yeah, I should.

<i>busy studying for the entrance exam,</i>

679
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,016

<i>from Uncle Tat for a very long time.</i>

- [woman] Uncle Tat!

- [Sang-hak] Hey, bro!
- [woman] I heard you got in!

695
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,833
Yeah, Yeongang University.
So what's your major?

696
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,461
- [Sang-hak] Uh, Business.
- [man 2] Damn, Kim Sang-hak.

697
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,297
- When did you get so smart?
- [Sang-hak] I was always smart, man.

[Sang-hak] Nice to meet ya.

705
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,883
You and I met at the booth the other day.
I'm a business sophomore, Kim Sang-hak.

706
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,801
I know.

707
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,929
I'm Cheon Sang-yeon,
an engineering major freshman.

708
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,890
Say something.
Your boyfriend's getting cocky again.

- [A-ra giggles]

00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,310
Oh, these two are dating.

711
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,270
[chuckling]

712
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,690
- Oh, wow! You look great together!
- [A-ra] Yeah.

713
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:32,983
- [Eun-jung] Do we?
- Yeah.

714
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,319
- [Sang-hak] That hurt my pride.
- But, Sang-hak, I'm right!

715
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696

[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-yeon said</i>

717
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,974
Oh, hey. [chuckles]

00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,855
[Sang-yeon sighs]

719
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,859
The scent of the air up here…

720
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,528
I haven't smelled it in a while.

721
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,738
It's nice.

722
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,585
Sang-yeon…

723
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,131
Listen.

724
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,885
I'm sure I can't know
everything you're feeling,

725
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,679
but I think I get it, to some extent,

726
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,057
even if it's only a little.

727
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,020
It's hard losing someone
that's important to you.

728
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,275
I also had someone…
that I used to be close to at some point.

729
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,737
But he disappeared all of a sudden.

730
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,243
It can be hard to come to terms
with something like that

731
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,162
because you'll never know the real reason.

732
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,288
[Sang-yeon] Mm.

733
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,374
I understand.

734
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,920
Were you two close?

735
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,464
Uh, yeah.

736
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,384
Well, I can't speak for him, but…

737
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,721
I mean I certainly liked him a lot…
as a person.

738
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,897
Do you want this?

739
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,482
What?

740
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,529
Oh… A watch, huh?

741
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,825
Yeah, it was free.
It's just… a little bit dark for my style.

742
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,368
Oh, seriously?

743
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,913
I was just about to get
something like this! [chuckles]

744
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,916
It's not fancy or anything,
probably because it was free.

745
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,459
Hey, that doesn't matter.

746
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,714
Seriously, thanks a lot.
I really needed a watch just like this.

747
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,134
Well, good. I'm glad you needed it.

755
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,069
[Sang-hak] Oh, and I already had
Choco Pie and Coke.

756
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,488
And before, I finished
five Choco Pies all in one sitting.

757
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,741
- [Eun-jung] Five?!
- [wistful music playing]

758
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,163
[Eun-jung] Sang-yeon!

Cheon Sang-yeon!

760
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,466
Is something going on with her?
I've never seen her behave like that.

761
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,427
Should you go home and check on her?

762
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,806
Enjoy, you guys.

763
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,187
Nah, it's okay.
I'll just check on her later.

764
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,066
This looks great.

765
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,490
Hmm.

766
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,784
- Is that new?
- [Sang-hak] Mm-hmm.

767
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,243
It's from Sang-yeon.

768
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,497
She got it for free,
but she didn't really like the color.

769
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,457
[Eun-jung] Mm…

770
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,377

That's really nice.

[Sang-hak] What is?

775
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,687
Sang-yeon used to…
to hate going to the mountains

776
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,980
because of

777
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,150
what happened to her brother out there.

778
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,819
[sad music playing]

779
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,654
Oh…

780
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,409
I also had a… place
I couldn't go to for a while.

781
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,453
This place called Dajeong Supermarket.

782
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,374
Sang-hak <i>oppa </i>walked me home once,
and he waited while I bought things there.

783
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,793
And because of that time,

784
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,671
I couldn't walk past it for over a year.

785
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,967
It had to be harder for Sang-yeon.

786
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,220
I bet she had lots of places
that haunted her the same way.

787
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,723
Sang-yeon admitted today

788
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,934
that her brother had died.

789
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,480
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

790
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,029
That's a first, I think, for her.

791
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,286
I'm surprised that…
she opened up to someone about it.

792
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:40,457
Maybe because
I suggested the walk in the mountains.

793
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,793
Oh…

794
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,007
Either way, I'm glad
that she was able to share that

795
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,050
with someone.

796
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,888
It's just…

797
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,057
it's also a little upsetting.

798
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,897
I've been waiting to talk to her, too,
hoping that she would talk about it.

799
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,192
Because it's hard for me
to just bring it up,

800
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,652
especially when I know
how much it hurt her.

801
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,740
Maybe there's another reason.

802
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,576
You know, maybe it was easier

803
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,329
because I'm not attached to the situation.

804
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,956
But with you, it's different.

805
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,753
And so… it could've been harder
for Sang-yeon to open up to you.

806
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,674
Still… I'd rather she was honest.

807
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:36,346
I'd prefer if she told me
that she was hurt or depressed.

808
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,351
Maybe she will one day?

809
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,061
