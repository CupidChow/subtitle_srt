00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,173
For the production designer
and cinematographer,

179
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,467
are Park Sun-ho and Jeong Ji-yun
still your front-runners?

180
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,096
Oh, uh, how about we consider…
Kim Sang-hak for cinematographer?

181
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,017
Kim Sang-hak for cinematographer?

182
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,811
[director] Yeah. You've seen
the film <i>Wasteland</i>, right?

183
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,229
I have.

184
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,523
The only thing is,

185
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,484
Kim Sang-hak's actually busy.

186
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,570
He's working on a project
with Director Lee Chan-seok right now.

187
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,740
- Apparently, they're in South Ameri--
- He came back to Korea two days ago.

188
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,283
[director] It's my understanding

189
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,328
when Director Lee Chan-seok got switched
out of the project, he withdrew.

190
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,790
Oh… I didn't know that.

191
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,212
Why? Are you unsure about him?

192
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,005
No. [chuckles]

193
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,840
My opinion doesn't really matter.

194
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,761
Sure, okay, I'll inform Mr. Jeong
to set it up for you.

195
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,721
We'll see if he's available.

196
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,473
[director] If he's open to taking this on,

197
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,518
prioritize getting a meeting
before anyone else does. [chuckles]

198
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,937
- [chuckles softly] All right.
- Good.

199
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,648
I can't promise
that Mr. Jeong won't object though.

200
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,568
Are you secretly hoping that he does?

201
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,903
Of course not.

202
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,614
What reason would I have
to hope for that? [chuckles]

203
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
[pensive music playing]

204
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
Mr. Jeong.

205
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,642
- Have a minute?
- [Jeong] The division director wants me.

206
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,354
Ah… the one who withdrew
along with Director Lee Chan-seok?

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,481
Right.

208
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,984
What do <i>you </i>think about him?

209
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,448
Well… I do think he did
a good job for <i>Wasteland.</i>

210
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,999
If you don't object, I'll go ahead.

211
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,880
However, it's a blockbuster
with extensive CGI work.

212
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,048
I'm not sure if he has enough experience.

213
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,095
But… Director Lee's known
for his high standards,

214
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
and he chose him so…

215
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,556
[elevator bongs]

216
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,517
Okay, go ahead.

217
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,480
[uneasy music playing]

218
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,068
CINEMATOGRAPHER
KIM SANG-HAK

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,740
[Eun-jung] <i>I can't believe it.</i>
<i>I still remember this number.</i>

- [line clicks]
- [clears throat]

222
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,171
Oh, yes, hello.
Is this Mr. Kim Sang-hak's…

223
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,428
Yeah. [sighs]

224
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,807
I… hope you've been well too.

225
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,398
Yes. Well, I'm calling regarding work.

226
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,735
Are you around tomorrow to meet with us?

227
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,907
[pensive music playing]

228
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,118
[groans softly]

[sighs]

232
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,296
[sighs]

233
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,868
It's been a while.

234
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,579
You're right, it has. Let's go inside.

235
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,621
[Sang-hak sighs]

236
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,255
I heard what happened on your project
with Director Lee Chan-seok.

237
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,340
[chuckles] Word travels fast.

238
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,259
It always does.

239
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,138
- Do you have another project lined up?
- Not yet.

240
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,599
Could you take a moment to review ours?

241
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,770
The director told us
that he wants to work with you.

242
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,566
He mentioned that he met you once
at the Busan International Film Festival.

243
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,026
GOOD MAN

244
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,527
Gotcha. [chuckles]

245
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,322
So you're working on this project
with Director Joo?

246
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,533
Yes. Our project is based on a webtoon.

247
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,701
It's called <i>Good Man.</i>

248
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,287
It's pretty popular these days.
Have you seen it?

249
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,291
- Lee Seung-jae is going to be our lead.
- Whoa. Lee Seung-jae? Congrats.

250
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,293
We're gearing up for preproduction

251
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,420
after the final
investment analysis is done.

252
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,839
Given Lee Seung-jae's military enlistment,

253
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,800
it's crucial that we start filming
by June at the latest.

254
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,679
- I guess I need to decide soon, then.
- We'd appreciate that.

255
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,432
[Sang-hak sighs softly]

256
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,270
How's your mother?

257
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,065
Is she doing well?

258
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,443
[gentle instrumental music playing]

259
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,694
Yeah, she's good.

260
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,380
Why?

261
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,549
Well, I knew you were over at JD,

262
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,803
so… I figured that our paths
would cross eventually.

263
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,182
But to get an actual work proposal
from you… it's strange.

264
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,353
You shouldn't feel strange.

265
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,398
You should make your decision
based on the project.

266
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,733
I still can't get used to
you being so polite.

267
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,403
Get used to it.

268
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,905
I'm here to meet you
for professional purposes.

269
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,201
- [Sang-hak sighs]
- [cell phone buzzes]

270
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,870
One moment. [clears throat]

271
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,166
Hi, Yu-chan. I'm in a meeting.

272
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,670
Oh, no, we're done. I was about to leave.

273
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,256
Yes.

274
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,634
Okay. I'll call you back in a little bit.

275
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,219
- Bye.
- [phone beeps]

276
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,472
Let me know when you review this.

277
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah, all right.

278
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,146
- Do you have a card on you?
- Oh, right.

279
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,824
[music fades]

280
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,118
[Hee-jin] Wait,
so that guy was Kim Sang-hak?

281
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,454
The guy you dated
from your photography club in college?

282
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,873
The male protagonist
in your graduation film?

283
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,834
A film is just a film, okay?

284
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,545
Right… it's fiction.

285
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,631
I heard
Yu-chan's mother's surgery went well.

286
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,591
[Hee-jin] Mm.

287
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,260
He was anxious
that it took longer than he imagined.

288
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,679
I bet Yu-chan will be shocked
to hear all this.

289
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,973
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

290
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,476
The cinematographer is your ex-boyfriend.

291
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,812
We don't know that yet.
He could still say no, you know.

292
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,690
Who in their right mind would turn down
a tentpole blockbuster

293
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,650
with a production cost of 12 billion won?

294
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,696
Are you sure you're okay with all of this?

295
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,991
Would you be okay with it?
Of course I'm uncomfortable.

296
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,951
You should've told Mr. Jeong
you didn't agree.

297
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,246
It's work though.
I won't let feelings get in the way.

298
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,664
That would be petty.

299
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,835
I felt anxious
before meeting with him today,

300
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,505
but I felt nothing
when I actually saw him.

301
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,885
Hee-jin, your stew's getting cold.

I'm finally writing a report

I finished… around 11:00, I think.

Why would you stay late to finish work
that isn't due until tomorrow?

It just naturally happened that way.

He's accepting the job.

Whoa! And he couldn't wait to tell you?
It must be love.

- I'm done talking if you keep teasing me.
- Ah, I was just messing with you.

Hey. I'm not encouraging you
to revive a relationship that's ended.

It'd be a bad idea to rekindle things
from a messy breakup.

Well, honestly,
the breakup wasn't that messy.

it kind of makes sense.

- Oh, I have a meeting.

348
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,821
Oh, Mr. Jeong? Kim Sang-hak says
he'll take on the project.

349
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,531
- Let's schedule a meeting.
- Sure.

350
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,784
- [Eun-jung] Oh, I thought you could join--
- Yeah, okay.

351
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,288
What's with him? He looks so out of it.

352
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,082
I don't know.

353
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,044
- I have to go to the restroom.
- Mm. Mm. Go, go.

354
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
Hey. Hey, hey.

355
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,597
Something just happened to you.

356
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:06,974
What?

357
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,018
Do you know who that cinematographer
she's talking about is?

358
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,312
- Who?
- Her ex-boyfriend.

359
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,314
"Ex-boyfriend"?

360
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,525
[Eun-jung] Our director of photography,
Kim Sang-hak.

361
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,068
It's a pleasure to meet you.

362
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,320
- [Sang-hak] Likewise, sir.
- [Joo] Yes. [chuckles]

363
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,658
It is. And I am Producer Ryu Eun-jung.
It's an honor to work with you.

364
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,246
But… why didn't you tell me before
that you already knew him?

365
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,664
Sorry?

366
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,294
I heard you went to the same college.

367
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,547
You acted like you were complete strangers
when I mentioned him last time.

368
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,923
[Eun-jung] Oh… [chuckles]

369
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,508
Did I?

370
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,760
That's not important now, is it?

371
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:45,887
[Joo] Huh?

372
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,390
- Now I'm even more suspicious.
- Uh--

373
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,268
I actually dropped out
halfway through college, so…

374
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,604
Uh… And halfway through,
I joined the military.

375
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,814
[Joo] Oh, okay.

376
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,650
- So you weren't there at the same time?
- Right.

377
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,570
Producer Ryu dropped out
and went to K-Arts.

378
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,572
Meanwhile, you went
to the Academy of Film Arts.

379
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,489
Right.

380
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,118
Even so, you two must've known each other
if you were in the same club--

381
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,162
What are your thoughts on our script?

382
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,583
- I made a reservation at Takoharu.
- Oh, really? Okay.

383
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,836
- Oh! Congratulations, Director Joo.
- Oh, thank you, Producer Oh.

384
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,088
- Of course. Oh. You leaving?
- [Joo chuckles]

385
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,799
- We're going to dinner.
- Ah. I guess I'll be seeing you around.

386
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,634
- [Joo] Yes. [chuckles]
- All right.

387
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,471
[elevator dings]

388
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,934
Ooh!

389
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,396
- Oh, come on!
- Oh!

390
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,649
Ah! You should've come out sooner!
You just missed him!

391
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,319
Hang on, you're questioning
why those scenes were even shot?

392
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,403
They were necessary!

393
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,989
No, I'm not arguing that
they were unnecessary.

394
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,159
I'm merely suggesting
that it may not have been necessary

395
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,371
to depict the limbs being ripped apart
from the body so explicitly.

396
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,539
You can convey the same
without resorting to vulgarity.

397
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,377
Okay. But still, that isn't a valid reason
to hate the film itself.

398
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,712
I think it's valid.
Pornography's no different.

399
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,298
- Both are about stimulating the senses.
- [chuckles]

400
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,883
What did you think about that film?

401
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,513
Oh, we always fight like this
talking about films. Don't worry.

402
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,725
Well, honestly, I agree that the scene
didn't have to be so explicitly shot,

403
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,061
but I really enjoyed
watching the film itself.

404
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,647
Tell me, if you have
a long list of pet peeves,

405
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,232
then how do you watch so many films?

406
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,403
Well, it's kind of my job
since I'm a film producer.

407
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,656
Producer Ryu here makes sure to watch
every single film out there.

408
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,784
Well, was there any film that you liked?

409
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,245
Oh, there are so many.

410
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,873
Mm… over the last couple of years…

411
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>Moneyball…</i>

412
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,629
and… Mike Leigh's <i>Another Year</i>.

413
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,923
I also liked <i>Still Walking.</i>

414
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,052
I mean, of course, a good film
should feel like a gift to its viewers,

415
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,263
but I usually focus more
on the planning side.

416
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,557
A great film to me is one

417
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,059
that's well-planned
and breaks even successfully.

418
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,853
Mmm, so money's everything?

419
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,688
It goes beyond breaking even.

420
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,897
The duty of a producer

421
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,984
is to ensure whatever film
they help create makes a profit.

422
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,735
That's where I come in.

423
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
Cheers.

424
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,074
[Joo chuckles]

425
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,209
- See you soon!
- Yes. Take care, Director Joo.

426
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,587
- Careful now. Good night.
- Okay. All right.

427
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,469
You should catch
the next cab that comes along.

428
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,971
After you, Producer Ryu.

429
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,057
No, I… I shouldn't leave until after you.

430
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,315
Has the production team ever left
before the film crew?

431
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,694
Please, get in.

432
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,574
- [Sang-hak] Sir, do you go to Ilyeong?
- [driver] I do. Hop in.

433
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,494
Still, you should go first today.

434
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,749
Okay, then.

435
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,417
Get home safe.

436
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,796
[wistful music playing]

437
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,525
[music fades]

438
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
GOOD MAN
PRODUCTION INVESTMENT MEETING

439
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,198
Everything working?

440
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,783
Yeah, but I'll double-check.

441
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,328
[mouse clicking]

442
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,376
[man] No one appears
to be in disagreement.

443
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,712
Mr. Jeong, great job on this one.

444
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,256
[chuckles] It wasn't me.

445
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,967
You should thank Producer Ryu
for the great script.

446
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,052
She's the best one on our team, sir.

447
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,763
Oh… [chuckles] It wasn't me.

448
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,849
Director Joo Dong-hyang
has worked really hard on the script,

449
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,726
so we have him to thank for this.

450
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,606
Well, do you have any updates
on Director Gyeong Seung-ju?

451
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,235
He said yes.
It seems he rather enjoyed the script too.

452
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,945
And Mr. Jeong here told me

453
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,699
that Director Gyeong was quite fond
of the webtoon even before the offer.

454
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,866
[man] That's great.

455
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,578
Then let's finalize this meeting
with conditional approval,

456
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,664
provided that <i>Good Man</i>
will be directed by Gyeong Seung-ju.

457
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,793
Gyeong Seung-ju… is directing, sir?

458
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,547
Producer Ryu.

459
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:32,841
Wait…

460
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,135
You're not suggesting

461
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,846
that we change directors
this far in, are you?

462
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,182
[whispering] Hey.
Let's talk later. [chuckles]

463
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,815
Uh… sir, I can't accept this.

464
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,983
Producer Ryu.

465
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,402
I think we're done, sir.

466
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,738
[sighs] I'll leave you to it, then.

467
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,364
Prepare diligently, everyone.

468
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,782
Good luck.

469
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,705
[Jeong] Thank you everyone.

470
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,792
The planning through
to the third script re-write

471
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,004
was all single-handedly done
by Director Joo Dong-hyang.

472
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,590
He's even paying his assistants
out of his own pocket.

473
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,883
Do you realize that, sir?

474
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,305
We're talking about 12 billion won here.

475
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,932
They think it's risky
putting a rookie in charge.

476
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,645
They want proven box office hits.
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,023
And, frankly, this isn't even
Director Joo's original work.

478
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,107
He just had good source--

479
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,484
He was the one

480
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,737
that first suggested
that we acquire the copyright

481
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,031
before anyone was even aware
of the source material.

482
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,949
He dedicated two solid years to this

483
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,911
and was also the one
who suggested casting Lee Seung-jae.

484
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,954
You left me out on all of this,

485
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,749
and just handed the script
to another director?

486
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,627
I already knew you'd react like this,
so I couldn't.

487
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,880
I wanna know… why is Director Joo
being thought of as a rookie?

488
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,176
He's already directed a feature film,
so he's experienced.

489
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,678
And what "box office hits"?

490
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,806
Director Gyeong's never helmed a project
with this large of a budget either!

491
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,101
Director Gyeong?
He's beloved by a lot of actors.

492
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,894
Who do you think suggested
he should direct?

493
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,646
It was Lee Seung-jae.

494
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,399
Let's just tell him
that we'll give him a credit,

495
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,485
"screenplay by," and offer him
a young adult feature instead.

496
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,653
You have the project you--

497
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,363
I will be addressing this

498
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,365
with CEO Hwang directly.

499
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,075
Producer Ryu.

500
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,035
Ryu Eun-jung.

501
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,123
For this film,
we can't afford to turn him down.

502
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,083
[sighs] This investment

503
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,794
is our team's first opportunity
in three years.

504
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,256
Our entire team won't even exist
if we lose out on this opportunity.

505
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,843
Stop being unreasonable.

506
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,679
It's best you resolve this.

507
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,182
[papers rustling]

508
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,562
[door opens]

509
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,064
[door closes]

510
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,816
[frustrated sigh]

511
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,994
What's this? What's with the vibe? Huh?

512
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,372
Oh, and what is this
about Gyeong Seung-ju?

513
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,999
- What?
- Sh.

514
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,792
- Oh, come on, what's it about?
- Sh.

515
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,378
What did I do? [scoffs]

516
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,130
[cell phone buzzes]

517
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,216
DIRECTOR JU DONG-HYANG

518
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,801
[Dong-hyang] <i>Did the meeting go well?</i>

519
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
[sighs wearily]

520
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,099
<i>There's no clause in the contract</i>

521
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,478
that guarantees any kind
of priority claim for the director.

522
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,024
[sighs] If I'd known they'd pull this,
I would've insisted on adding that.

523
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,151
That wouldn't have changed anything.

524
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,653
JD never includes those clauses
with rookie directors.

525
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,864
What's really frustrating

526
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,949
is that I was the one

527
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,535
who encouraged him to sign it.

528
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,748
How did you break it to Director Joo?

529
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,375
I said that everything went well,

530
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,879
and that I'll tell him the details
in person tomorrow.

531
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,672
[Hee-jin sighs sadly]

532
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,008
The film industry can be so cruel.

533
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,679
[alarm beeping]

534
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,932
[pensive music playing softly]

535
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,072
[beeping stops]

536
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,755
[Hee-jin] What time are you meeting him?

537
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,715
Eleven.

538
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,262
When you see Director Joo, don't tell him
the decision's already been made.

539
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,597
[sighs] How could I not?

540
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,475
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out.

541
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,269
I can't let him hear it
from somewhere else.

542
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,397
You might believe that honesty
is the best policy, but it isn't.

543
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,401
Especially for someone who will get hurt.
It's the least you can do for him.

544
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,611
Think about how mortified he'd be

545
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,781
if he heard he was being replaced
by Director Gyeong behind his back.

546
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,533
[groans softly] But still…

547
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,826
[Hee-jin] Do what I say.

548
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,745
Being honest in this situation is selfish.

549
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,956
[cell phone buzzes]

550
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,047
It's Mr. Jeong.
He called me to the director's room.

551
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,386
[man] Yeah, come in. Sit down.

552
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,097
[tense music playing]

553
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,023
Ryu Eun-jung.

554
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,276
[man] You two know each other?

555
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,037
Yes, we're childhood friends.

556
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,500
Uh… really?

557
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,794
I wasn't aware.

558
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,673
Why are you just standing there?
Come, have a seat, Producer Ryu.

559
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,981
[Jeong] Wow. You two are friends?
Well, that's great. [chuckles]

560
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,820
Producer Cheon Sang-yeon
will be joining us as of today.

561
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,243
What do you mean… "joining"?

562
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,412
Exactly that.

563
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,665
She'll be coproducing <i>Good Man.</i>

564
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,377
[tense music playing]

565
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,255
We're co-producing?

566
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,175
[Jeong clears throat]

567
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,683
Could we have some privacy?

568
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,939
[Jeong] Um… Producer Cheon, you probably
haven't even seen your cubicle yet.

569
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,442
If you'll… come out, I'll show it to you.

570
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,319
Come. This way.

571
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,699
If you look over there…

572
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,871
If you don't mind, sir,
please tell me what's going on.

573
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,751
Producer Cheon taking on
the role of executive producer

574
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
is Director Gyeong's number one condition.

575
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,423
The executive producer?

576
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,592
[Jeong] But our division director
clearly stated it would not be feasible.

577
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,054
You can thank him
that it hasn't come to that.

578
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,182
It's a co-producing role,
so nothing has to change for you.

579
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,352
It's already been decided. I understand.

580
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,688
[Jeong] Producer Ryu, well… [sighs]

581
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,314
Producer Ryu.

582
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,275
[sighs]

583
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,901
[uneasy music playing]

584
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,990
[breathing emotionally]

585
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,493
[division director] <i>Producer Cheon</i>
<i>taking on the role of executive producer</i>

586
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,704

587
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,209
[shuddering breaths]

588
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,134
My meeting with Director Joo's
in 30 minutes.

589
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,927
If he agrees to the YA film,

590
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,513
promise that he'll be given
a director's contract.

591
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,182
Not a phase contract.

592
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,768
A full contract,
complete with incentive clauses.

593
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,352
And contracts for his assistants.

594
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,774
Yeah, sure. You're doing the right thing.

595
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,401
I was obviously considering that as well--

596
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,778
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

597
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,322
What are you doing?

598
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,657
Remember what you told me
when I was hired?

599
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,619
"A producer must execute with compassion."

600
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,413
"That's the essence of the job."

601
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,920
- [Jeong sighs]
- [Hee-jin] Producer Ryu.

602
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,174
[Dong-hyang sighs]

603
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,967
I'm sorry.

604
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,472
Thought I'd experienced enough
after more than a decade in this industry.

605
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,183
But… JD's another thing entirely.

606
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,894
I am so sorry about this.

607
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,147
I'm honestly speechless.

608
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,734
If I happened to return my fee,

609
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,487
do you think they'd return
the script I wrote?

610
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,281
You know the answer.

611
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,283
Given the original content,

612
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,954
retrieving it wouldn't grant you
any rights to it.

613
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,248
Is Mr. Jeong at the office?

614
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,333
How dare these pricks
treat creators like shit--

615
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,501
Director Joo, please.

616
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,255
Please, before you go…
listen to everything I have to say.

617
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,799
Turn the company upside-down.

618
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,802
Or grab Mr. Jeong by his shirt.
I won't stop you.

619
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,846
Just please hear me out first, okay?

620
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,390
[Dong-hyang sighs]

621
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,231
So, who is this outstanding director
that the company's going with?

622
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,024
[Eun-jung sighs]

623
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,028
[sighs] Director Joo.

624
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,410
You might not wanna consider
anything else at this point…

625
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,708
besides <i>Good Man…</i>

626
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,796
Please move on.
Consider a romance feature.

627
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,133
Hold on. Are you really
gonna be like this now?

628
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,051
You think I'm doing this
over losing one lousy--

629
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,804
I know. I'm aware
of how devastating this is.

630
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,931
But please listen to me.

631
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,226
I can only advise you on everything today.

632
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,313
[pensive music playing]

633
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,191
If you do sign a new contract,

634
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,195
it's likely they won't raise
the director's fee.

635
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,365
You can demand around 60 million
for writing the script.

636
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,076
They'll counter with at least 50.

637
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,124
Yes, I resigned from JD today.

638
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,127
Wait, but why would you?

639
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,671
I can't keep doing this.

640
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,841
Ask for 5% for the incentive--

641
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,177
Yes. That's why I'm asking
why you are quitting.

642
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,054
You had absolutely nothing
to do with this!

643
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,474
- I was the one who wrote your contract.
- God, seriously, enough!

644
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,935
I am not letting
Mr. Jeong off easy, damn it.

645
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,521

Eat before you sleep.

653
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,747
How much have you had to drink?
Did you call the office?

654
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,293
PTO… I applied for time off.

655
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
[Ms. Jang] My goodness.

656
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,171

00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,596

<i>I still didn't feel</i>
<i>like going back to work.</i>

[Ms. Jang] You're finally
coming back to life.

664

I can't die that easily.

- [Ms. Jang] Who?
- [door opens]

- [Ms. Jang] Oh, Sang-yeon!
- [Sang-yeon chuckles]

[Ms. Jang] Oh my God!
How long has it been?

671
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,054
Sang-yeon is here!

672
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,139
- [Sang-yeon] I hope you've been well.
- Of course.

673
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,058
- [Sang-yeon] Here.
- What is all this?

674
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,060
- [Sang-yeon] It's heavy, ma'am.

Come, come inside.

- [Eun-jung] Let's talk outside.
- Oh.

talk with Eun-jung.

00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,944
- Sorry.
- [Ms. Jang] Oh…

680
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,571
- Take care, okay?
- [Ms. Jang] Sure.

681
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
- I'll visit you soon.
- See you soon.

- Okay?
- Okay!

- [door closes]

684
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,418
Are you relieved now… that you've quit?

685
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,757
I honestly wasn't aware
that this was your project.

686
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,011
And I really thought
it was confirmed internally.

687
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,808
If you ask me if I inquired about

[Sang-yeon] Come back.

693
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,332
I heard you abandoned
your other projects when you resigned.

694
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,168
If you're not working
with Director Joo anyway,

695
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,546
why would you abandon all those projects?

696
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:30,177
Is your reasoning similar to why
you'd send me your monthly rent back then?

- I really don't get it, that's all.
- And you never will, okay?

700
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,321
I guess you're right.

701
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,077
Regardless, I don't intend to take
someone else's position unfairly.

702
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,372
If you honestly can't tolerate me,
you can be executive producer.

703
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,082
I'll take a supporting role.

704
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,796
Do you know that my Mom passed?

705
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,885
What?

706
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,182

00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,943
It was right before
the last time I met you.

718
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,577
When the doctor said
that she only had three months left,

719
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,871
I called you, thinking she'd want to see…

720
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,084
her favorite student just one last time.

721
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,048
But you ignored my call.

722

00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,348
Mm, you did.

729
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,492

730

It's not that you didn't cross my mind,

but… I was getting so irritated
by the fact that you were in my thoughts.

740
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,828
So you spread her ashes alone?

741
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,165
- Who else would I have spread them with?
- Why are you so…

742
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,001
[Sang-yeon] Since I'm leveraging
my mom's story,

743
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,211
I'll make it worthwhile.

Honestly,
I'm not doing this for your sake.

Your team won't even
make eye contact with me.

747

I know nothing about the company system.

748
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,647
And I'm treated like an intruder
for being there.

749
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,234
But most importantly,
once Director Gyeong gets involved,

750
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,945
I'm sure he'll adjust the script
however he likes.

751
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,199
You should be there to advocate for it.

752

I'll likely pick his side.
