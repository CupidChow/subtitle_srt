00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,216
[tense music playing]

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,431
I don't like that you're fine.

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,644
I want your life to be ruined.

4
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,147
Like mine.

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,487
You'll be compensated for your work.
And you will appear in the credits too.

6
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,535
It's not for sale.

7
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,414
- It's my project.
- It's mine. I already told you.

8
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,087
[outgoing call tone]

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,592
[Sang-yeon] <i>Do you know one thing</i>
<i>I've learned from life?</i>

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
[outgoing call ringing]

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,350
[Sang-yeon] <i>Everyone tends</i>
<i>to lose their dignity over money.</i>

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>I've yet to see someone</i>
<i>who has proven otherwise.</i>

13
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,027
<i>Who do you think was the easiest</i>
<i>for me to convince?</i>

14
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,787
Joo Dong-hyang was.

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,996
[knocking on door]

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,539
Director Joo, let me in.

17
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,252
I know that you're in there.

18
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,131
Hello?

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,011
[Sang-yeon] <i>But I will admit,</i>
<i>I'm curious to see</i>

20
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,805
if he'll change his mind on this.

21
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,810
Considering how <i>Romance of Youth</i>

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,938
nearly made you quit
just so he could have that one.

23
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,319
[music intensifies]

24
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,943
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

25
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,160
Sang-hak.

26
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,082
[Sang-hak] Go ahead and eat.
I know you haven't been eating.

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,417
[cutlery clatters]

28
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,880
Why are you here?

29
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,174
You don't wanna be late
for tomorrow's shoot.

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,302
Producer Oh explained everything.
All of it.

31
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,180
[cutlery clinking]

32
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,559
We'll grab a bite, then I'll drop you off.
Don't hate me for showing up.

33
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,686
We owe each other that.

34
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,938
Come on, eat.

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,481
[tender music playing]

36
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,702
[Eun-jung sighs]

37
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,913
Why would I hate you?

38
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,666
If something like this happened to you,
I would do the same thing.

39
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,838
What'd Director Joo say?

40
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,051
I'll know when I talk to him.

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,553
You haven't talked to him yet?

42
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,430
When he's clearly home?

43
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,352
[scoffs softly] I'll see him soon.

44
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,314
- [Sang-hak sighs]
- Don't get angry.

45
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,733
That's exactly what Sang-yeon wants.

46
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,447
I've worked with him for four years,

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,992
so I need to just wait for him
to tell me his side.

48
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,877
[music fades]

49
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,633
- [Eun-jung] Director Joo.
- Oh…

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,302
Hey, Producer Ryu.

51
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,474
[pensive music playing]

52
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,977
[sighs]

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,313
It's just that

54
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,942
I heard that Producer Cheon…
settled everything,

55
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,278
so I assumed you had endorsed it as well.

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,155
[clears throat]

57
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,199
You did?

58
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,745
You really believed
I'd relinquish my project…

59
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,125
without coming
to talk to you about it first?

60
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,631
[sighs] Well, I mean,
I just took their word for it.

61
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,396
Director Joo, please.
Would you please look at me for a second?

62
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,778
It's not too late for you
to do something about it.

63
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,658
I know this can't be easy for you either.

64
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,703
If I upset you in any way,
can we please address it now--

65
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,123
No, did you… hear
about your credit and fee?

66
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,833
Well, that's…

67
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,380
Do you honestly believe…

68
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,135
that's all it will take
to make everything okay?

69
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,265
If everyone agrees,
there shouldn't be legal complications.

70
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,356
- "Legal complications"?
- [sighs]

71
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,944
Director Joo, you, of all people?

72
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,366
You really don't have the right
to speak to me in that way.

73
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,828
Why?

74
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,248
Why not? [chuckles]

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,627
I got switched out
due to that shitty contract.

76
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,923
You can't speak to me like that either.
You know how I was treated by JD.

77
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,968
And if we're talking about being upset,
I should be the one who's upset here.

78
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,307
I heard they made the decision to go
with Director Gyeong before you told me.

79
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,558
You knew everything,

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,645
and yet whenever I asked you about it,
you told me that nothing was finalized.

81
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,273
Do you have any idea how betrayed I felt
when I learned about it later?

82
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,617
Why do you think I lied to you?

83
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,205
Now you're just making excuses.

84
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,291
You're talking about these things
knowing that none of it--

85
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,168
Okay, hey! Fine, I'm the bastard here.

86
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,462
I had no choice
once they made their decision.

87
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,215
Why do you believe
that you have no power in this?

88
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,134
Tell them you don't want
to work with them and--

89
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,136
Honestly, I want to work with them.

90
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,142
JD only offers 30 million won
and 10% shareholding.

91
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,643
Producer Cheon, though…

92
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,942
Producer Cheon, what?

93
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,283
I'm the one who told her
that she should pay you for your part,

94
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,535
so you should know that I owe you nothing.

95
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,787
We're done here.

96
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,874
What do you mean, we're done?

97
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,502
Director Joo, come back.

98
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,213
Director Joo, please come back!

99
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,638
[music fades]

100
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,270
[Sang-yeon] It's 60 million won
for developing the story,

101
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,689
which you and I will split.

102
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,276
FILM DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT
TERMINATION AGREEMENT

103
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,282
Do you like the title?

104
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,285
<i>Echoes of Summer.</i>

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,123
Let me know if you'd like
to adjust anything.

106
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,542
As long as you don't ask
for full credit, I'm--

107
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,627
[paper tearing]

108
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,843
[tense music playing]

109
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,428
[chuckles]

110
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,933
You're rejecting the offer?

111
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,977
Well, that's better for me.

112
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,230
If you sacrifice everything
for your pride,

113
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,149
then that's all you'll have left,
so take the offer, okay?

114
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,737
You can keep being a thieving bitch.

115
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,117
[laughs cruelly]

116
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,622
So this is what it takes
to change you, isn't it?

117
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,755
Damn. You're really pathetic.

118
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,259
You're always this way.

119
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,346
You act like the greater good
has always been on your side.

120
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,765
Don't you realize?

121
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,102
You're currently
being backstabbed right now.

122
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,853
Eun-jung.

123
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,731
Call me a bitch, would you?

124
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,113
Didn't you hear what I said?

125
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,574
I just called you a thieving bitch.

126
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,162
- [chuckles softly]
- Maybe from now on, I'll be one too.

127
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,583
I will never forgive you for this.

128
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
[Sang-yeon] You only lost
one petty film to me.

129
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
That doesn't mean
you should forget everything you took.

130
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,430
Sang-yeon…

131
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,310
I hate you.

132
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,772
You can achieve
all the success in the world.

133
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,110
But you'll always just be
a pathetic thieving bitch.

134
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,824
You would never be able to
sabotage yourself like this

135
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,327
if you only understood…

136
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,415
how radiant you used to be.

137
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,464
Who will be at your side when you die?

138
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,686
[music fades]

139
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,868
- [Seung-ju] CEO Cheon.
- [Sang-yeon chuckles]

140
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
You're here. Oh!

141
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,039
It suits you.

142
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,666
"Swallow."

143
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,418
- 'Cause I'm a bum?
- [chuckles]

144
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,296
- [giggling]
- You're glowing a little bit.

145
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,257
How'd the Gangneung shoot go?
Did you finish all right?

146
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,051
Just barely.

147
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,518
So you took Director Joo's material too.

148
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,562
Yes. The first draft
will be ready next month.

149
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,233
Was that really necessary?
Director Han should've been enough.

150
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,363
I mean, the more talented directors,
the merrier. Isn't that right?

151
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,616
That's all there is?

152
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,078
[snickers softly] Of course not, no.

153
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,623
[sighs smugly]

154
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,836
She called me a thieving bitch.

155
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,089
[Eun-jung] You can achieve
all the success in the world.

156
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:02,388
- But you'll always…
- "…just be a pathetic thieving bitch."

157
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,350
Do you feel wronged?

158
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,769
Not at all.

159
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,941
Now that I've become a thieving bitch,
I'll taste real success,

160
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,235
and buy buildings in Gangnam and all.

161
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,990
Why do you feel the need
to do all of this to her?

162
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,077
[Sang-yeon sighs] Hmm…

163
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,127
'Cause I hate her guts.

164
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,631
[Seung-ju] I really don't think
you can fail here.

165
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,675
You're clever and talented.

166
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,803
You can succeed
without resorting to these tactics.

167
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,768
You can't imagine…
how excited I feel right now about this.

168
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,520
Everything that you've done

169
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,106
will find its way back to you again.

170
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,485
So be it, then.

171
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,738
Have you experienced this feeling?

172
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,990
It's like I have a sword.

173
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,577
I have nothing to fear now.

174
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,666
Just don't hurt yourself
swinging that sword of yours, all right?

175
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,544
I don't care if I do.

176
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,381
'Cause my welfare,

177
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,259
it doesn't really mean anything to me.

178
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,890
SONG YU-CHAN

179
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,391
[pensive music playing]

180
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,116
[cell phone buzzing]

181
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,462
- [sighs]
- [Hee-jin] She must be asleep.

182
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,924
That would be a relief,
but I don't think she is.

183
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,512
[sighs] She keeps taking everything on,
but… she needs a day or two's rest.

184
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,973
Yeah, she does. It makes me anxious.

185
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,270
These assholes. I'm not surprised
about Sang-yeon, but what's up with Joo?

186
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,983
It's such a tough blow for her.
Try and keep an eye on Eun-jung, will you?

187
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,735
What can I do though? I can't do anything.

188
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,202
- [Seung-ju] Okay.
- [radio beeps]

189
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,872
Cut. We have our shot.
And that's meal break, everyone.

190
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,584
[Yu-chan] Meals are in the cafeteria.
Enjoy your food. We'll come back by two.

191
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,502
- Enjoy your meal, sir.
- You too.

192
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,172
- What do you think?
- I think it's great.

193
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,300
I spoke with Manager Lim,

194
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,760
and she said
that Su-a is feeling a lot better,

195
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,388
so we can stick to the original
filming schedule in Chuncheon.

196
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,472
That's great.

197
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,808
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy yours as well.

198
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,977
It's the first floor.

199
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,064
Eun-jung.

200
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,776
- We're eating on the first floor.
- I heard ya.

201
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,863
[pensive music playing]

202
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,180
[chair gently slides]

203
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,694
[Sang-hak] Do you know
what Hayao Miyazaki's motto is?

204
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:59,208
"No matter how tough things get,
it will eventually always end."

205
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,842
That's nice.

206
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,765
It does sound like something he'd say.

207
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,978
[Sang-hak] And that's why

208
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,981
you should at least eat something.

209
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,819
I will.

210
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,408
Give me ten minutes.

211
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
I'll be there in a little while.

212
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,880
[Sang-hak sighs]

213
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,953
[Eun-jung] <i>Everything…</i>

214
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,584
<i>seemed so distant.</i>

215
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,885
<i>This was the beginning</i>
<i>of a dark tunnel ahead.</i>

216
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,484
[sighs]

217
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,247
Ah, you startled me.

218
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,335
[sighs] Well, I just saw my name, so…

219
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,879
Why would you read someone else's stuff?

220
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,631
[Sang-yeon chuckles] You're one to talk.

221
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,967
Remember you read my diary too.

222
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,429
Well, I think I'm almost at the end,
so I might as well--

223
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,722
Move.

224
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,935
[Sang-yeon sighs]

225
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:28,774
I saw it while trying to check my email
because my phone ran out of battery.

226
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,487
I was feeling wronged for a while there.

227
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,739
Can't you let me finish this?

228
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,786
This is just
what you think about me, isn't it?

229
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,917
I'm not going to do anything with it.
Are we good?

230
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,879
Actually I wrote something about you too.
Would you like to have a look at it?

231
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,260
Oh, come on, you're a writer.

232
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,220
I mean, shouldn't you be interested

233
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,556
in seeing the perspective
from the other side?

234
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,682
- [sighs] Move.
- [screams]

235
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,724
[gasps]

236
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,989
[chuckling]

237
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,577
Gosh.

238
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,662
You see?

239
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,250
I already knew
you'd be this surprised by it. [chuckles]

240
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,212
Stop trying so hard
to be coldhearted. [chuckles]

241
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,341
You're unbelievable!

242
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,137
Leave.

243
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,226
[Sang-yeon] Please wait for me downstairs.

244
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,948
- [door opens]
- [door lock chimes]

245
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,533
[Sang-yeon] It's on the 28th.

246
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,078
- [door closes]
- [door lock chimes]

247
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,832
[sighs] Sometime before then,

248
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,544
could you please
hear me out just for once.

249
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,797
[typing on laptop]

250
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,260
What about Gangneung, then?

251
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,678
[continues typing]

252
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,224
I'm gonna go see my mom.

253
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,836
[sighs]

254
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,219
[cell phone buzzing]

255
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,104
Ah, yes, Producer.

256
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,357
[sighs] Sorry,
I meant to reach out to you.

257
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,151
The material's complicated and heavy.

258
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,029
Although, it's rare
to find original source material

259
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,823
that's even remotely intriguing.

260
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,408
[producer] I was thinking the same.

261
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,203
- Please make your decision this week.
- I'll do it.

262
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,957
Wait, you will?

263
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,753
What? Isn't it better if I decide quickly?

264
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,757
Of course, but, um,

265
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,428
I just thought you were still
contemplating doing the story

266
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,221
about you and CEO Cheon.

267
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,726
[sighs] Oh, um,

268
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,395
I thought that I had already told you.

269
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm going to leave that one alone.

270
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,735
What have you been doing this whole time?

271
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,904
You haven't responded to my emails
or messages for the past five days.

272
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,866
I was dillydallying.

273
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,912
- [producer] "Dillydallying"?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

274
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,294
So why did CEO Cheon want
to meet with you, then?

275
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,965
[cell phone buzzing]

276
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,258
One moment, please.

277
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,431
Hello?

278
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,810
Sorry, who's this?

279
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,772
SWALLOW PICTURES
JIN YU-MI

280
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,901
[Yu-mi] We only met in passing yesterday,
so I apologize for calling without notice.

281
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,570
What's this about?

282
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,116
Do you mind…
me asking how you know CEO Cheon?

283
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,122
There's not much to say.

284
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,633
We were friends… when we were kids.

285
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:12,015
I've been feeling really lost recently,
so I thought you might have the answers.

286
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,644
About what?

287
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,770
About a month ago,

288
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,564
CEO Cheon told me
to take over the company.

289
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,403
She said she was going to the countryside,

290
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,239
but she won't share
any further details on where or

291
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,825
what any of her plans are.

292
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,745
I'll be honest with you.

293
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,750
I'm worried she might be considering
something… irreversible.

294
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,130
"Something irreversible"?

295
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,840
Suicide.

296
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,009
[uneasy music playing]

297
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,514
What's happening on the 28th?

298
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,393
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but

299
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,146
I thought that you might know.

300
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,275
I'm curious.

301
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,903
Just how serious… is her condition?

302
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,701
It's extremely serious.

303
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
What exactly do you mean by--

304
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,916
They're saying
she has three months to live.

305
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,800
She said she wanted
to stay with you for three days,

306
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,219
so I dropped her off here, but I never

307
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,182
anticipated anything happening to her arm.

308
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,518
Her arm?

309
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,439
Due to significant bone metastasis,
the slightest pressure leaves marks.

310
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,819
But… I'm sure it happened
without her even realizing.

311
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,987
- [sighs] Move!
- [screams]

312
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,946
[gasps]

313
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,344
[Yu-mi] <i>Could you please meet</i>
<i>with… CEO Cheon?</i>

314
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,522
[Sang-yeon] <i>Can we</i>

315
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,942
travel there together?

316
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,877
Take a seat.

317
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,344
Ah… It's nothing, really.

318
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,471
Even picking up a pen can injure me.

319
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,400
[Eun-jung] Ms. Jin Yu-mi

320
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,318
came to see me.

321
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,862
Were you able to read it?

322
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,450
I suppose you haven't.

323
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,249
- It's okay. You don't have to read--
- Then why did you leave it there?

324
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
Does Director Han

325
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,672
know about this?

326
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,553
I'm guessing he doesn't.

327
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,557
What are you expecting from me

328
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,768
if you can't even tell your husband?

329
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,604
[Sang-yeon] I want us…

330
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,109
to try and be friends once more.

331
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,491
- What?
- Eun-jung.

332
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,371
Mm… I'm sick.

333
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,292
I don't have much time left.

334
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,799
That means nothing to me.

335
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,305
Do you expect me to cry?
Am I supposed to feel bad or something?

336
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,894
- I'm sorry for everything--
- Just stop.

337
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,271
I'm not here for an apology.

338
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,650
It's because of Ms. Jin.

339
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,570
She's afraid you'll take matters
into your own hands.

340
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,113
She asked me about it.

341
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,575
You need to tell them the truth.

342
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,037
Both Ms. Jin Yu-mi and your husband.

343
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,165
That's all I came here to say.

344
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,668
Eun-jung.

345
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,379
Eun-jung, please hear me out.

346
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,047
Eun-jung…

347
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,598
[engine starts]

348
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,659
[sighs]

349
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,042
[sighs]

350
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,965
- [girls giggling]
- Ugh, for real! Oh!

351
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,591
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

352
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,177
- It's fine.
- Seriously, why are you like this?

353
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
[girl giggles]

354
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,189
[Eun-jung] <i>Mom, I'm home.</i>

355
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,691
- Hmm?
- [door closes]

356
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,651
Oh. You didn't tell me you were coming.

357
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,611
It's Parent's Day today, so I'm here.

358
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,488
[Ms. Jang chuckles]

359
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,658
Here.

360
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,494
Oh. You're generous today.

361
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,829
[both chuckle]

362
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,164
Oh-ho-ho!

363
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,583
How come you're eating <i>sujebi</i>
instead of rice?

364
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,127
Oh… the side shop auntie

365
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,671
dropped off some kimchi
and was craving my <i>sujebi,</i>

366
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,881
so I made her a batch.

367
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,925
This is what's leftover.
Want some? There's more.

368
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,511
- [Eun-jung] I already had lunch.
- Mm.

369
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,972
Did Sang-yeon reach out to you yet?

370
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,351
Why would she do that?

371
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,270
Well, the side dish auntie

372
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,356
showed me a clip of someone
talking about you on TV.

373
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,649
It was Sang-yeon.

374
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,238
I can't with her. That was so unnecessary.

375
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,033
- [Ms. Jang] Where are you going?
- To wash my hands.

376
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,785
[Ms. Jang] Hmm.

377
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,417
Can you please send a thank you to auntie?

378
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,543
[Eun-jung] Mm.

379
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,880
And if Sang-yeon reaches out, go see her.

380
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,385
What's going on with you?

381
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,681
Why are you suddenly
asking me to meet her?

382
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,185
You're being weird, and you don't even
know the whole story between us.

383
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,814
I know.

384
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,774
I'm aware she did you wrong.

385
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,778
Wait a second. How would you know that?

386
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,280
[sighs] When she came by, she said,

387
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,325
"I'm a bitch, I know that,
but can I please have a hug?"

388
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,160
When was that?

389
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,872
[sighs] It was about six months
before you resigned.

390
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,291
You were shooting that film in Gangneung.

391
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,381
What'd you do?
Tell me what you said to her.

392
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,675
What do you mean? She just wanted a hug.

393
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,301
Did you give her a hug?

394
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,929
Of course I hugged her.

395
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,724
Mom, why would you do that?
She even called herself a bitch.

396
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,436
She couldn't even look me in the eyes
when she asked for a hug.

397
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,647
So yeah, I couldn't help but feel bad.

398
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,568
I told her she could come back,
but I knew she wouldn't.

399
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,653
[groans] You being like this is why I--

400
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,738
What about you?

401
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
[sighs] Whatever.

402
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,578
Remember what you always said?

403
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,580
"Mistakes can be forgiven
if unintentional,

404
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,707
but intentionally hurting others
is wrong."

405
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,001
Well, what she did to me was intentional!

406
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,630
You should hate her, then.
You would be justified in that.

407
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,633
- I don't hate her. I just dislike her.
- Same thing.

408
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,843
It's different.

409
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,446
[keypad beeping]

410
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,579
What are you doing?

411
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,167
I'm sorry for everything.

412
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,002
What did I say?

413
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,296
I don't want your apology.

414
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,679
[pensive music playing softly]

415
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,351
Why are you being so stubborn?

416
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,816
- I want to apologize.
- Apologizing to me won't change anything.

417
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,819
Are you here because

418
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,573
you genuinely think you'll convince me
to take you to Frieden?

419
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,451
You have a husband.

420
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,372
You should be asking him
to take you there instead.

421
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,582
[sighs] No, it's not like that.

422
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,626
Then why put me through all this?

423
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,545
Because you're still alive.

424
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,178
With my mom or my brother,

425
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,347
I never got the chance…

426
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,601
to say I'm sorry.

427
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,360
But I still

428
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,363
have the chance to tell you.

429
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,001
[Eun-jung] Tell me something.

430
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,714
When you were thriving and healthy,

431
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,592
was I ever in your thoughts?

432
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,183
When your films were box office hits
and huge successes,

433
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,644
when you hosted parties
and bought buildings…

434
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
were you thinking about
how sorry you were?

435
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,533
Don't you think it's a little late now?

436
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,872
If you wanted to apologize,

437
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,249
you should've done it then.

438
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,504
Back when I could actually
still blame you.

439
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
[Sang-yeon exhales slowly]

440
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,383
Before you were sick.

441
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,427
[sniffles]

442
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,138
[Eun-jung] You…

443
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,559
You're a real bitch, you know that?

444
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,525
[music fades]

445
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,036
If it hadn't come to this,
I'd never have the courage.

446
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,917
Because apologizing is
not nearly enough for what I did to you.

447
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,257
I wish I could say
that I simply liked you.

448
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,761
But I didn't.

449
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,146
I hated you too.

450
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,649
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,710
[wistful music playing]

452
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,203
[music fades]

453
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,629
[music resumes]

454
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,186
[cell phone buzzing]

455
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,606
[Eun-jung] Hey, Hee-jin.

456
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,649
[Hee-jin] <i>Insane! You saw it, right?</i>

457
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,819
<i>What's with Cheon Sang-yeon?</i>
<i>Has she actually lost her mind?</i>

458
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,446
That was ages ago.

459
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,240
You're the tenth person to tell me that.

460
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,118
<i>Really? But this article just came out.</i>

461
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,996
What are you talking about?

462
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,582
MY START WAS A LIE

463
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
[pensive music playing]

464
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,797
CEO CHEON OF SWALLOW PICTURES
REACHED OUT FOR AN INTERVIEW

465
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,467
THERE IS SOMETHING I MUST SAY…

466
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,470
SOMEONE ELSE DEVELOPED THE SCREENPLAY
OF ECHOES OF SUMMER…

467
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,931
IT HAS WEIGHED ON MY HEART
FOR A VERY LONG TIME

468
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,063
ALTHOUGH IT IS LATE,
I WISH TO RIGHT MY WRONGS

469
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,440
[Hee-jin] <i>"Right my wrongs." </i>[scoffs]

470
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,235
- Why is she seeking penance now?
- [chuckles softly]

471
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,324
Maybe she's nearing the end.
No one in their right mind would do that.

472
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,579
[sighs] Did you run on the dirt road?

473
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,207
Mm! Running on dirt roads
is the best ever!

474
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,834
- I really should've moved sooner.
- [both chuckle]

475
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,797
[Hee-jin] How do you feel?

476
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,759
With Cheon Sang-yeon

477
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,012
saying what she did
at the Baeksang Awards.

478
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,018
She apologized.

479
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,938
Oh, she did? You met up with her?

480
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,315
[Eun-jung] Mm.

481
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,236
You're crazy.
Why would you speak to her? Ugh!

482
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,155
I can't believe her audacity.

483
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,658
I doubt she'd ever have
the courage to apologize

484
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,243
if she saw how you were affected.

485
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,495
She's the reason you stepped away
from the film industry.

486
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,039
[sighs] That's a bit
of a stretch, isn't it?

487
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,960
I'm glad I quit that industry.
I prefer TV over films now.

488
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,629
Well… I hope her company fails.

489
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,715
I wonder how long it'll take.

490
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,843
[Eun-jung groans] You don't have to
hate her, too, for my sake.

491
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,261
I can if I want.

492
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,264
Thinking about those times…

493
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,849
[sighs]

494
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,228
The problem is, she's sick.

495
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,026
What's wrong with her?

496
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,532
What? Is it serious?

497
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,993
[Eun-jung] Mm.

498
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,833
But I won't dwell on it.

499
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,377
[Hee-jin] That's good.

500
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,838
Don't get involved with her anymore.

501
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,174
She'll manage fine on her own.

502
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,807
She's still happily married
to Director Han Jae-jun, right?

503
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,644
Oh…

504
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,315
You really have been living under a rock
when it comes to the industry.

505
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,984
- [door closes]
- [door lock chimes]

506
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,289
They got divorced?

507
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,002
Um… I think
they've been divorced for three years.

508
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,881
Oh…

509
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,343
I see.

510
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,012
[Hee-jin] Divorce isn't a big deal.

511
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,348
[music fades]

512
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,974
You said she had a brother?

513
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,936
Right. She was an only child.

514
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,567
Yeah… She's all alone.

515
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,816
[sentimental music playing]

516
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,654
[Sang-yeon] <i>To me, life is like…</i>

517
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,994
<i>a box that I cannot bear to open.</i>

518
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,166
<i>Looking back on it…</i>

519
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,546
<i>I'm left with just a few names in the end.</i>

00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,760
<i>Cheon Sang-hak…</i>

522
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,639
