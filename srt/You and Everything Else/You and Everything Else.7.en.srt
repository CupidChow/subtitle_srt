00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,307
Beyond that.
You're like a breath of fresh air.

179
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,392
[laughing]

180
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,435
Eat some more.

181
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,521
Hmm. So how's the exhibit? Coming along?

182
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,858
I have one print ready now.
And everyone else is just starting.

183
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,944
- Whose picture's on the poster?
- Sang-yeon's.

184
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,738
Hers will be displayed up front.

185
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,241
And yours? Which one are you using?

186
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,245
Just, um… a few foggy photos at Yangsuri.

187
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,581
- Mmm. From the trip we all took?
- Mm-hmm.

188

[gentle music playing]

189
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm not totally happy with it,
but I wanted to get my stuff done early.

190
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,763
The shop's busy next week
for Lunar New Year.

191
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,223
Those photos are perfectly fine.

192
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
I mean, not just fine.

193
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,853
They're really great. Perfect!

194
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,647
Jeez.

195
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,449
Yeah, so the other day…
I met Sang-yeon's boyfriend.

196
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,036
Mm. What did you think? Was he all right?

197
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
He seemed like a good guy, I think.

198
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,292
They suggested the four of us hang out
the next time you get leave.

199
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,753
- Yeah, of course.
- [both chuckle softly]

203
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,682
[Sang-yeon] Ma'am,
how much are your <i>tteokguk </i>rice cakes?

204
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,143
Oh! What are you doing here?
You don't even have tutoring today.

205
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,228
I was bored

206
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,939
- How can I help?
- [chuckles]

207
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,319
Oh, my. Sang-yeon, you're here!
[giggles delightedly] Have you eaten yet?

208
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,487
Yeah, what can I do?

209
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,656
- Just have a seat.
- That's all right.

210
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,538
- You can help out for three whole days?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,749
No tutoring since it's New Year.
And selling rice cakes is fun.

212
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,711
[scoffs] Yeah, right. Enjoy today!

213
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,547

216
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,101
- [woman] Good luck with your sales.
- Thank you. Yes, Happy New Year.

217
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,561
- It's 5,000 won-- Oh.
- Excuse me.

218
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,604
[man] Over here.

219
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,439
It's your choice
of three packs for 5,000 won.

220
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,773
- [man 2] What a deal.
- Thank you.

Well, it's just evident…
his love for the subject.

243
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,989

245
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,624

335

I couldn't focus
on protecting the country.

336
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,326
- Huh?
- What?

- [Su-mi] He shows up and saves the day!
- You should've told me.

- [Jeong-seon] Sang-hak!

[whooping]

347
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,348
How are you here?

348
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,059
You said your next leave
wasn't until April.

349
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,103
Did you really come for the exhibit?

350
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,524
Mm. It was a last-minute request,
but luckily, the captain approved.

351
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,567
[chuckles] This is great.

352
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,112
Your photos are showing too.

353
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,365
That's why you're here, admit it.

354
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,700
[chuckles] That's it.
I've got photos to hang.

355
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,330
Oh man, I would've canceled
my tutoring lesson if I'd known.

356
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,583
- How long are you staying?
- Till next Thursday.

357
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,460
A whole ten days?!

358
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,255
- [gasps] Yay, I'm so excited!
- [chuckles] Excited, huh?

359
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,173
- Yeah. [giggles]
- We have plenty of time.

360
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,636
[woman in movie] <i>Look. Look at me closely.</i>

361
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,639
<i>Tell me what you see…</i>

362
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,641
[pensive music playing]

363
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,686
- 'Kay, talk to you later.
- [phone beeps]

364
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,606
- So, you're on leave?
- [Sang-hak] Mm-hmm.

365
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,943
Glad you're here.
There's something I wanna share.

366
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,834
Tomorrow, when I transfer the frames,
you should go see Dylan.

367
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,090
- Shit!
- [Su-mi] Is it too heavy, A-ra?

368
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,133
You wanna carry it?

369
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,552
- Nope.
- [chuckling]

370
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,389
- [Sang-hak] How's this?
- [Su-mi] A little lower.

371
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,183
Nah, that's too much.

372
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,435
- [Sang-hak] And now?
- Okay.

373
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,107
[power tool whirring]

374
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,943
That looks so cool, don't you think?

375
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,695
Yeah, it's great.

376
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,907
I love the title too.
<i>Moments, Unfamiliar Yet familiar.</i>

377
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,910
[laughs] I have no clue
what he's talking about.

378
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,871
Yeah, well, neither does he.
I wrote those words.

379
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,665
Oh yeah? How shocking.

380
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,918
Oh, yeah… where's Sang-yeon?

381
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,254
Oh, something came up
with her mom in Gangneung.

382
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,926
She apologized for not being able to help
with the photo hanging today.

383
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,929
She seemed a little under the weather
when she left the house.

384
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,222
I think she has a cold.

385
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,140
She said she hadn't slept very well.

386
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,975
[Su-mi chuckles] She'll be fine.

387
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,397
I like this.

388
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,872
[pensive music playing]

389
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,261
MOON JI-YEONG. ADDRESS: 29-88 MOSAN-DONG
TAKE THE 42 BUS TO DOHARI VILLAGE

390
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,440
Tomorrow will be your last chance.
she's going to Canada for her studies.

391
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,361
And she'll meet me if I go there?

392
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,779
Mm-hmm.

393
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,536
Well, I appreciate it.

394
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,915
- Let's go inside.
- Cheon Sang-yeon.

395
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,546
Her house is in the mountains, I heard.

396
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,966
- So maybe you shouldn't go alone.
- No, I'll be all right.

397
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,552
I'm gonna bring my boyfriend along.

398
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,972

[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-yeon used to…</i>

402
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,368
<i>to hate going to the mountains because of…</i>

403
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,247
<i>what happened to her brother out there.</i>

404
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,294
- A little to the left.
- Hmm?

405
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,590
Ah, to the left?

406
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,970
Yeah… that's what I just said.
Why are you so distracted?

407
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,099
Okay, to the right a little bit.
Just a tad.

408
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,060
Right there.

409
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,897
Wow. Looks great!

410
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,316
Your photos are stealing the show.

411
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,735
[Eun-jung] Half are Sang-hak, to be clear.

412
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,487
Whoa. [gasps]

413
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,572
You two are really bold for doing this.

414
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,283
Why? You don't think you could
do this with Gyu-ho at all?

415
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,911
No way! It would be embarrassing
if we ended things!

416
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,579
- You think?
- [Jeong-seon chuckles]

417
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,915
Hear what she said?
It'll be embarrassing if we end things.

418
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,542
- Good thing we're never ending it!

[music fades]

422
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,333
Your brother talked a lot about you.
Did you know that?

423
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,422
Oh, really?

424
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,717
Yes, he did.

425
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,555
He said that he loved just two people
the most in the entire world.

426
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,056
His mother

427
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,183
and you, his sister.

428
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,357
Oh, I see.

429
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,277
I had no clue.

430
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,448
What did you come here to ask me about?

431
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,702
[Sang-yeon] Hmm…

432
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,746
Um, well, he…

433
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,249
he liked you a lot, didn't he?

434
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,214
I assume that you mean
as a love interest, right?

435
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,884
- Yes.
- Actually, no.

436
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,845
It wasn't like that.

437
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,641
If you asked
if we liked each other as friends,

438
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,019
I would definitely say yes.

439
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,520
I cared about him a lot,

440
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,523
and he felt the same about me.

441
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,029
You really don't have to lie

442
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,281
for my mother's sake.

443
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,660
I know she wasn't okay…
with him seeing you.

444
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,787
I'm not lying.

445
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,582
I wouldn't have asked you to come here
if I was planning on lying to you.

446
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:58,046
Your mother wasn't opposed
to our friendship with each other.

447
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,012
What was it that gave you
the impression that she was?

448
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,850
Well, the diary…

449
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,268
I mean, his diary.

450
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,356
Everything that he wrote
was addressed to you.

451
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,902
Uh… "to M." You know? A capital M.

452
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,282
Ah… Moon Ji-yeong.

453
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,705
[Dylan sighs]

454
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,089
This is the first letter
I received from Moonee

455
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,508
at the beginning of our friendship.

456
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,763
- TO DYLAN
- M

00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,016
My brother signed this?

459
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,726
Mm-hmm.

460
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,528
That's right.

461
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,196
That's M.

462
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,702

00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,335
Are you here to see Sang-yeon?

468
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,337
She went to Gangneung, actually.

469
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,716
Yeah, I did,
but I guess she went to Gangneung…

470
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,551
- [Su-mi] Oh, pizza!
- [Hyeon-gyu] Oh…

471
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,554
- [Su-mi] Everybody, let's eat!
- [Hyeon-gyu] Grab some.

472
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,015
Guess you didn't tell her
you were coming to surprise her.

473
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,350
- [Hyeon-gyu] Yeah, I'll call her.
- Thanks for the pizza!

474
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,603
[Hyeon-gyu] Have some
before it gets cold, guys.

- One sec, I have to take this.
- Oh, sure.

00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,957
[Sang-hak] <i>She disappeared?</i>

479
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,751
How would she disapp--

480
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,004
- [Dylan] <i>Has she not contacted you either?</i>
- No, she hasn't.

481
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,298
I was concerned
because she didn't look well,

482
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,468
and by the time I came back
after a quick call she was gone.

483

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,481
No. Her phone's turned off.

488
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,653
Remember she didn't sleep well last night?
Maybe she's sleeping on the bus.

489
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,571
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

490
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,741
She didn't look so good
when we were at the movies last night.

491

[Su-mi] What's taking Sang-hak so long?
The pizza's almost gone.

She should still be in the area.

every two hours?

Are you okay? Where did you go?

511

00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,550
Oh, her mother's place.

689
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,720
[Na-mi chuckles] I was hoping we'd see
how much prettier she got.

Yeah, he's at his grandfather's…

693
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:51,947
What are you doing here?
You told me you were stuck in Cheonan.

Uh-huh…

695
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,577
- I'm sorry I ran out yesterday.
- [A-ra] Hmm!

696
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,373
- [Na-mi chuckles] It's been a while.
- [Sang-hak] It has. Nice to see you both.

697
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,125
[A-ra] You stayed out last night, huh?

698
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,586
What do you mean by that?
He was at his grandfather's.

699
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,880
[A-ra] I know. I was just kidding!

700
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,133
He's wearing the same clothes
as yesterday.

701
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,634
I was helping my grandpa.

702
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,054
[A-ra gasps] That explains why
you look like you were up all night.

704

Pretty! Thank you both.

706
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,527
- [Eun-jung] Aren't they?
- Uh-huh.

707
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,070
Look around!

708
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,451

[Sang-hak] I went to Jecheon.

I had to get Sang-yeon.

753

Did she ask you to go with her?

[Sang-hak] No.

- Eun-jung…
- If not, why can't you tell me?

760
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,540
Why couldn't you be honest
and tell me you were in Jecheon with her?

761

And why did you have to
turn off your phone?

- Stop making this about her!
