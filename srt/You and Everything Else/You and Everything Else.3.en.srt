00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
Make sure you check
the film's wrapped around tightly.

174
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,012
After that, close it up.

175
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,409
[adult Eun-jung] <i>That was the moment…</i>

176
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,705
<i>something changed in me.</i>

177
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,419
<i>I started to freeze…</i>

178
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,089
<i>every time he was around.</i>

179
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
[Sang-hak] Basically,

180
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,138
it's like a butterfly net.

181
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,230
Taking photographs
is like collecting time.

182
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,861
Taking photographs
is like collecting time, essentially.

183
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,656
[Sang-hak chuckles]

184
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,451
Capture beautiful moments. Gotta go.

185
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,387
[Eun-jung] Oh, yes, right,
the paper is completely stuck,

186
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,098
and the copy card won't come out.

187
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,439
[Sang-hak] Oh?

188
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,611
- Oh, hello.
- Hey there.

189
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,243
Uh, the copy machine's not working.

190
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,328
- [Sang-hak] Oh, it's not?
- Right.

191
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,666
[copy machine opening]

192
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,669
[paper rustling]

193
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,854
[Sang-hak] You need three copies of each,
starting from this page, correct?

194
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,650
- Yes. [clears throat]
- [copy machine whirring]

195
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,819
[Sang-hak chuckles] Impressed?

196
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,821
This is my turf, actually.

197
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,074
Oh.

198
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,827
[chuckles] I'm a working
fellowship student this semester.

199
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,998
One moment.

200
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,589
[papers shuffling]

201
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,220
- Oh, no, I can do it myself.
- I'm just very generous.

202
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,015
[stapler clicking]

203
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
[Sang-hak] Here.

204
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,772
I appreciate it.

205
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,566
Join my research division if you mean it.

206
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,034
[adult Eun-jung] <i>The nicer he was,</i>
<i>the more timid I became.</i>

207
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,038
[man] The ball!

208
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,748
Huh?!

209
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,751
Thank you.

210
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,927
- Oh!
- [men chuckling]

211
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,053
Oh man!

212
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,972
Did you see her throw it? [chuckles]

213
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,599
- Oh no. I'm sorry!
- [man] Don't worry about it!

214
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,394
[adult Eun-jung] <i>And that</i>
<i>was an epic fail.</i>

215
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,729
[sighs] I'm so embarrassed.

216
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,606
[woman 1] I'll break
everything down for you.

217
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,525
You're embarrassed
because it just happened.

218
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,736
But in time, all anyone's gonna remember
is how funny you were.

219
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,697
She's right. It's adorable.

220
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,157
I know.

221
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
They probably thought it was so hilarious.

222
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,829
But that's the least of my problems.

223
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,707
- Then what?
- I'm so awkward.

224
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,084
I can't even speak to him properly.

225
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,088
He offered to treat me that one day,
but I just ran away.

226
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,008
Maybe you just,
like, don't like him that much?

227
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,305
- That's not it.
- [woman 1] So what's the issue?

228
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,766
He offered to treat you,
helped you use the copier for free,

229
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,768
and even invited you to join his division.

230
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,980
That's what I'm saying.
I have no idea why I'm being this way.

231
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,983
Are you going
to your welcome party or not?

232
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,695
Of course I'm going.

233
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,782
- I'm going but I'm still--
- Why are you nervous? Just go.

234
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,659
Get a little buzzed, then ask him,

235
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,203
"Why are you like that?
Why do you make me weird?"

236
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,288
[woman 2 giggles]

237
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,919
- [man 1] Let's drink!
- [cheering, laughter]

238
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,546
[man 2] Oh man.

239
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,798
[pop music playing over speakers]

240
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,635
Ryu Eun-jung,
Freshman, College of Humanities.

241
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,513
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh… Kim Nam-ju, Engineering freshman.

242
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,184
Kwon Hyeon-guk,
German major, and a sophomore, right?

243
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,811
Not Nam-ju. It's "Nam-su." Kim Nam-su.

244
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,271
- "Kim Nam-su."
- Oh, it's "su"?

245
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,858
Okay, everybody. All the club executives
are gonna start the introductions.

246
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,610
General Affairs Manager, go!

247
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,236
[cheering, clapping]

248
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,697
MAGIC HOUR NEWBIE WELCOME PARTY

249
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,823
Hello, everyone.

250
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,784
I'm the general affairs manager,
Park Kyu-ho.

251
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,911
- [woman] What a stud!
- See that guy there?

252
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,455
- With that, uh, hoodie on.
- [Kyu-ho] Okay, okay.

253
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,415
The general affairs division
seems boring, right?

254
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,335
He's a business major as well.
He's my direct senior.

255
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,962
I've had my eye on him
since student orientation.

256
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,465
They said he was a photo major
in the business department,

257
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,633
but that's weird.

258
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,550
[Kyu-ho] Next.

259
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,219
[cheering]

260
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,765
- They're dating.
- Hmm?

261
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,935
The planning manager and general affairs.
They're a couple.

262
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,521
How do you know that?

263
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,690
I saw him petting her hair when
he was pretending to remove something.

264
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,276
In the most natural way. [chuckles]

265
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,278
So this, is my specialty.

266
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,491
While everyone around us seems
focused on what's happening up front,

267
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm picking up on the energy in the air.
What's that? Everyone's sending signals.

268
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,830
[cheering]

269
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,124
[cheering]

270
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,959
[Hyeon-guk] Come on! Good job!

271
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,130
Hi. I'm the research division's
Kim Sang-hak.

272
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,465
[cheering]

273
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,178
So our division is in charge of covering
all the areas related to photography,

274
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,555
things like that.

275
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,974
Uh… this includes the technical aspects

276
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,685
such as developing, printing,
and the history of the medium.

277
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,105
Anyone interested in photography
is especially welcome to join.

278
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,607
- Me! Me. I'm interested!
- [man chuckles]

279
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,651
- [woman 2] Who is that?
- You're more than welcome!

280
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,905
Ah! Also, if there's anyone who wants
to develop their old roll of film

281
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,658
that they happen to lose a lot,
please join as soon as possible.

282
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,120
[Hyeon-guk] Hey, just be direct
and tell Tri-X to join us, bro.

283
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,164
- [Sang-hak] That's all I got.
- [Hyeon-guk groans]

284
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,915
[cheering, applause]

285
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,584
What's a Tri-X?

286
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,210
- Oh, well--
- You don't know what that is?

287
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,797
- Why don't you tell me what it is?
- [man 3] Well, it's--

288
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,424
- Oh… Slow down!
- [man 3] Whoa.

289
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,011
Why did you start chugging that
out of nowhere?

290
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,306
I hope we all get along.
Let's all do our best!

291
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,892
[cheering, whooping]

292
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,268
[Hyeon-guk] All right!

293
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,441
Uh… uh… hello, everyone. [clears throat]

294
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,319
- My name is Ryu Eun-jung.
- [Hyeon-guk] Tri-X!

295
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,945
- [chuckling, whooping]
- Whoo!

296
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,448
- [Hyeon-guk] Say something fun!
- [Eun-jung] Uh…

297
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,866
I'm in the College of Humanities

298
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,784
majoring in
Korean language and literature.

299
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,579
- [Hyeon-guk] And uses Tri-X!
- And uses Tri-X. [giggles]

300
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,916
- [Eun-jung] I'll try my best in the club.
- [Sang-hak] Sounds good.

301
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,375
[cheering, whooping]

302
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,962
[Hyeon-guk] Everyone with
a GPA average below 3.7, fold.

303
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,005
[scattered groans]

304
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,049
Hey! Target the freshmen, okay?

305
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,344
All you pricks in relationships,
fold your fingers down, all right?

306
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,305
[Kyu-ho] Hey, you call that
targeting the freshmen?

307
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,306
[woman 3] Right?

308
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,517
Fold if you kissed someone
in the last 24 hours.

309
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,146
- [woman 2] Hey. What the hell!
- [chuckling]

310
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,106
- Good-looking people, fold.
- Ah!

311
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,817
- [woman 2] Oh!
- [woman 3] Why are you guys folding?

312
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm folding, I'm folding,
I'm folding, and I'm down!

313
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,197
[woman 2] Take a shot!

314
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,699
[playful cheering]

315
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,909
[laughter]

316
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,370
- [man 4] Nice!
- [woman 3] Keep it going!

317
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,664
College of Humanities, fold.

318
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,957
- [Eun-jung sighs]
- [laughter]

319
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,584
- [man 3] Oh, take a shot!
- Man, that took long enough.

320
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,127
- Drink up!
- [Sang-hak] I volunteer!

321
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,088
- Whoa!
- [man 3] Whoa, what's going on?

322
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,465
- [woman 3] Wow.
- [cheering]

323
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,635
- [Kyu-ho] That's sad!
- [woman 2] You lost that one!

324
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,137
- Cool down, man.
- [man 2] You like her like that?

325
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,390
- Dude.
- [woman 3] Hey, it's Eun-jung's turn.

326
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,059
- [woman 2] Everyone, quiet.
- Oh, uh, everybody who's not a freshman!

327
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,811
- [group] Wow.
- [woman 2] You're awesome!

328
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,688
- [woman 3] Direct hit.
- [groaning]

329
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,147
- Drink, drink!
- Are you okay?

330
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,275
- Sang-hak will take care of her.
- There goes Eun-jung!

331
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,151
Sang-hak will take care of her.

332
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,278
Cheers!

333
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,238
- [cheering]
- [woman 2] Cheers!

334
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,825
[laughter]

335
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,326
[Eun-jung sighs]

336
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,498
[television playing in distance]

337

Your twenties are a beautiful time. Aw!

509
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:09,325
Oh! Enjoy every moment.
Your life is just blooming. [chuckles]

510
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,035

<i>This is not what I'd imagined</i>

515
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,838
<i>my life at 20 to be.</i>

516
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,968
<i>I'd imagined something</i>

517
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,512
<i>more colorful.</i>

518
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,224
<i>A life that was more exciting.</i>

519
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,731
<i>To use her words…</i>

520
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,192
<i>it should've been blooming.</i>

[line ringing]

524
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,001
Why not?

525
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,586
[A-ra] <i>I don't know.</i>

526
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,088
<i>Whatever's going on</i>
<i>with you two is not cool.</i>

527
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,133
<i>Don't be petty and skip the trip</i>
<i>because you two don't vibe.</i>

528

529

[door closing]

530
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,609
- Hello.
- You here to take photos?

531
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,320
Go ahead. No one's here.

532
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,114
Sang-hak!

533
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,290
Are you really going to skip the trip
because it's awkward?

534
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,793
Am I making you uncomfortable?

535
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,422
We're both uncomfortable.

536
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,092
So I can just skip it.

537
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,763
Why would you have to not go?

538
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,225
[Sang-hak] I'm the upperclassman.
And I've gone twice.

539
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,770
Still, you…

540
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,688
[Sang-hak] And…

541
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,318
if I knew you'd feel uncomfortable,
I wouldn't have acted like that.

542
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,656
I've been wanting to apologize.

543
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,575
I'm glad we ran into each other.

544
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,745
I promise it won't happen again.

545
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,331
Don't let me affect your club activities.

546
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,751
Giving up what you want to do
because you don't like someone

547
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,795
- is unfair to you.
- [sighs]

548
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,425
It's not that I dislike…

549
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,303
Sang-hak, please know
that you didn't do anything wrong.

550
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,347
[sighs]

551
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,892
Uh… I was the one who was out of line.

552
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,644
I made myself uncomfortable.

553
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,232
[Sang-hak sighs]

554
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,654
Can you maybe tell me why?

555
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,866
Why are you so uncomfortable around me?

556
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,369
It's 'cause…

557
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,289
Tell me why you've hated me from day one.

558
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,373
You said that.

559
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,293
- I said that?
- Yeah.

560
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,757
[Su-mi slurring] <i>So,</i>

561
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,427
<i>why do you hate Sang-hak so much?</i>

562
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,347
Because he's… Sang-hak.

563
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,225
Right, Sang-hak.

564
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,687
Doesn't seem like it,
but he's the most popular guy.

565
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,397
So why don't you like him?

566
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,819
[Eun-jung sighs drunkenly]
From the moment I saw him and…

567
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,904
[Su-mi] Yeah?

568
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,697
…found out that he was Sang-hak,

569
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,867
I was… uncomfortable.

570
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,163
[sighs softly, snores]

571
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,998
About that…

572
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,668
I was talking about your name.

573
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,757
You just have the same name
as someone that… I once knew. That's all.

574
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,259
Name?

575
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,055
[chuckles]

576
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,433
[chuckling] Wait a sec.

577
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,314
Was this person
that incredibly awful to you?

578
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,526
So what's his problem? That Kim Sang-hak?

579
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,197
It's Sang-hak, not…

580
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,450
not Kim Sang-hak, like you.

581
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,706
He's Sang-hak… <i>o… oppa.</i>

582
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,795
I had a big crush on him.

583
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,507
I'm reminded of him when I see you.

584
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,300
[chuckles awkwardly]

585
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,596
Your registration form.

586
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,101
It's him, right? One sixtieth of a second.

587
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,982
[gasps]

588
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,733
Collecting time.

589
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,113
Wait, Sang-hak, did… did you mention
collecting time because you read that?

590
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,281
Of course I did.

591
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,240
[gasps]

592
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,786
Oh! This explains so much.

593
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,332
It was surprising enough as it was
that you both share the same name,

594
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,042
but then you said the same things he did.

595
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,253
And honestly,
he was the reason I joined the club.

596
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,299
It's not that I share the name
as someone who was awful to you.

597
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,426
Instead,

598
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,470
I share the name with a person you liked.

599
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,145
So why do you find me so uncomfortable?

600
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,151
You're nice to me.

601
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,946
You're nice to me
for no particular reason.

602
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,531
You've got to be kidding.

603
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,241
You told me to join the Research Division

604
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,410
when I haven't done anything
particularly well.

605
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,996
- It's kinda weird.
- Nothing particularly well?

606
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,999
Come on. The first day we met,
you made me laugh so hard,

607
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,334
making me chase you.

608
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,380
And also, I'm not the only one
who wanted you to join my division.

609
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,092
Jeong-seon tried to get you
for the planning division. And the others…

610
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,638
Hey. [sighs]
Can't believe I'm saying this.

611
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,682
We had to play rock-paper-scissors!

612
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,060
I had to play against Jeong-seon
to get you.

613
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,354
[chuckles awkwardly]

614
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,314
[hesitates] Anyway…

615
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,239
[chuckles]

616
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,161
It'll be nice.

617
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,080
You should come tomorrow.

618
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,796
Promise?

619
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,840
Yeah.

620
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,135
I'll buy you a popsicle…
if you come early.

621
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,223
[chuckles] A popsicle?

622
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,016
Yeah. A popsicle.

623
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,270

[chuckles] Popsicles.

627
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,845
[gasps] Eun-jung!

628
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,305
- Oh!
- [both giggle]

629
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,306
Hello!

630
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,058
Well, you're here super early.
We're on the 6:50 bus.

631
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,476
Right.

632
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,020
Ah, Jeong-seon…

633
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,606
- I have the fee.
- [Jeong-seon] Oh, sure, cool.

[Hyeon-guk] No, sit down.
No need to stand.

00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,597
Everyone get on the bus by 6:45, okay?

647
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,848
[all] Sure. Okay.

648
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,016
[Hyeon-guk] Let's go.

649
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,395
You can sit by the window.
I never stay awake on car rides.

650

- [Su-mi] Can I go home? I feel dizzy.

654
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,284
- [Jeong-seon] Can you get on the bus?
- [Su-mi] No way.

- [Jeong-seon] Hey, seriously.

656
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,123
- Sang-hak said he'd be here as well.
- [Su-mi] Oh, that's right.

657
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,084
- [Jeong-seon] He's coming too?
- Yeah.

658

- I thought he wasn't.
- [Su-mi] He told me he was.

659

[A-ra] Oh, right.

663

Our research manager's
supposed to be here.

664
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,069
Well, he's not picking up,
so I guess he overslept.

665
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,822
Hey, don't worry. He'll come on his own.

666
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,199
[A-ra] He's always on time though.

667
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,412
[Su-mi] Why am I kinda hungry again?

668
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,708

681
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,022
[Eun-jung] <i>He overslept.</i>
<i>That's all that happened.</i>

683
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,859
<i>Sang-hak isn't Sang-hak </i>oppa.

684
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,237
<i>He just overslept.</i>

00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,864
[line ringing]

686
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,410
- [A-ra] This lodge is super nice!
- [Hyeon-guk] It's awesome.

687
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,538
- [Su-mi] Should we eat or chill out first?
- [Hyeon-guk] Bag's heavy.

688
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,207
[A-ra] I said I could carry it.

689
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,292
Why don't you learn to listen?

690
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,544
[Hyeon-guk] What the heck? You scared me.

691
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,088
- [Su-mi] Hey, Kim Sang-hak!
- [Sang-hak] Hmm? What?

692
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,217
[Su-mi] I thought you were still sleeping.
How'd you get here before us?

693
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,678
- [Sang-hak] I flew here, so what?
- [Su-mi] Oh yeah? How'd you fly here?

694
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,266
- What do you mean, how? I took a plane.
- [Su-mi] You take planes too?

695
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,353
Oh… Hey, don't eat all the
popsicles in the fridge.

696
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,812
- [Su-mi] Popsicles?
- [Nam-su] Where…

697
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,523
- [Su-mi] Yeah!
- [Nam-su] Where's he going?

698
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,358
[Su-mi] Hurry, get inside.
Let's eat 'em all.

699
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,777
- [Jeong-seon] Awesome!
- [A-ra] But I don't like popsicles.

[seagulls calling loudly]

701
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,909
Ryu Eun-jung!

702
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,496
Wait up, Eun-jung! [breathing heavily]

703
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,124
Eun-jung!

704
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,423
Are you crying?

705
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,552
No, I'm not. [sniffles]

706
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,762
[Sang-hak] What's wrong? Were you worried?

707
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,974
I got here as fast as I could.
I took a plane so you wouldn't worry.

708
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,977
Do you know how expensive planes are?

709
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,439
I still bought the ticket anyway
so you wouldn't worry.

710
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,944
This might sound stupid, but I actually
left my house really early this morning,

711
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,697
but then,
at Yeongdeungpo-gu Office Station,

712
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,365
my phone fell through the opening--

713
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,701
I thought that you were dead.
[breathes shakily]

714
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,079
Dead?

715
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,624
I'm not…

716
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,042
[solemn music playing]

<i>it was weird that I was crying.</i>

720
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,482

<i>Sang-hak oppa died,</i>

723
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,197
<i>I didn't cry like this.</i>

724
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,832
<i>That was the day</i>

725
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,335
<i>Sang-hak was able to</i>
<i>make sense of some things.</i>

726
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,258
<i>Why I had acted so strangely</i>
<i>when I heard his name…</i>

727
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,848
<i>and who owned the film roll I brought…</i>
<i>that first day.</i>

728

[ship horn honking]

730
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,545
[Sang-hak] Will you go out with me?

731
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,177
I… like you.

732
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,312
[Eun-jung] I do too.

733
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,360
[tender music playing]

734
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,153
[Sang-hak sighs]

735
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,368
[Hyeon-guk] Hey!

736
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,370
What are you two doing?

737
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,873
Hyeon-guk!

738
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,251
Give A-ra 10,000 won.

739
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,877
- [A-ra gasps]
- [Hyeon-guk] Why?

740
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,838
[Sang-hak] We're officially dating!

741
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,881

[A-ra] What did I say?

745
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,097
Oh!

746
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,683
[Sang-hak] Let's go get a popsicle.

[all cheering]

748
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,399
[A-ra] Hey, Ryu Eun-jung!

749
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,568
- [Hyeon-guk] You did it!
- [A-ra] Eun-jung!

750
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,819
[Hyeon-guk laughs]

751
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,697
[Eun-jung] Whoa.

752
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,116
I didn't even realize
you were taking these.

753
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,367
You took three of them.

754
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,660
I actually took five.

755
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,954
- You took five?
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,205
SPRING OF 2002

757
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,374
Look. See?

758
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,293
[Eun-jung gasps]

759
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,421
You made this contact print?

760
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,673
How pretty.

761
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,760
Did you… just call yourself pretty?

762
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,263
- Uh-huh.
- [both chuckle]

763
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,434
[Eun-jung] By this point, you already
had feelings for me, didn't you?

764
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,478
You should've confessed.

765
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,897
Ah. Yeah, but I… [clicks tongue]

766
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,232
It was impossible
to know what you were thinking.

767
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,568
You had an air of mystery.

768
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,528
But now…

769
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,947
I'm an open book. [giggles]

770
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,908
[chuckles]

771
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,744
- I tell you every single thing!
- Oh! [chuckles]

772
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,329
Yeah, you sure do.

773
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,959
You must've had… wow,
so many exhibitions before.

774
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,504
I've been taking photos
since I was in middle school.

775
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,172
Oh, I got this.

776
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,384
- Hi, welcome.
- [woman] Hi. How much is that one?

777
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,178
- This one, you mean?
- [woman] Yeah.

778
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,773
- Thank you.
- [Sang-hak] Thank you. See you next time.

779
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,399
[door closes]

780
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,151
[Sang-hak] What is it?

781
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,154
When was this exhibition?

782
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:08,492
Oh, this. With the photo society
during my entrance exam prep. Why?

783
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,911
Oh, no, it's just…

784
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,498
it's just this person seems familiar.

785
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,125
I'm probably wrong.

786
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,128
Nah. [chuckles] Yeah, it's not her.

787
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,672
[footsteps approaching]

788
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,674
Oh, my uncle.

789
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,591
[Sang-hak] Mm.

790
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,427
- Hi, Sang-hak.
- [Sang-hak] First time here?

791
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,430
- [chuckles] You been well?
- [Sang-hak] Yes, sir.

792
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,474
Did we get many new members?

793
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,269
[Sang-hak] A few kids took flyers.

794
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,729
Only one person completed
a registration form.

795
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,231
I was there the whole day.

796
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,651
[sighs] I guess freshmen
really are rare to come by.

797
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,404
Oh, right.
Something funny happened earlier.

798
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,865
- About the person who filled out the form.
- Oh yeah?

799
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,243
They said they had no money, but asked
if they could still do photography.

800
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,911
MAGIC HOUR
29TH RECRUITMENT

801
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,122
[person] Excuse me…

802
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,209
Can I take photos
if I don't have any money?

803
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,338
Of course.

804
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,092
But still, you'd need a camera,
even if it's not expensive.

805
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,260
Do you have a camera?

806
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,890
[Sang-hak] <i>She reached into her bag</i>
<i>and pulled out her camera.</i>

807
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,099
<i>Guess what model?</i>

808
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,271
<i>A Leica M3.</i>

809
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,190
A Leica?

810
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,403
[gasps] Wait, M3 is the model…
you always wanted, right?

811
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,780
Yeah, it's my dream camera.

812
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,657
But this kid with no money,
pulls out a Leica.

813
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,909
What the heck?

814
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,786
And her reason for joining
is even funnier. [laughs]

815
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,040
We were all cracking up
because of her registration form.

816
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,877
[quizzical music playing]

817
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,129
What's it say?

818
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,050
"I cannot…"

819
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,468
- "Tell."
- Hmm?

820
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,802
- Huh?
- Huh?

821
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,012
- What?
- What's…

822
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,180
What's… it mean?

823
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,556
- No idea.
- Well…

824
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,558
[chuckles]

825
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:02,731
REASON FOR JOINING:
I CANNOT TELL

826
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,525
Wait, that's what she wrote?

827
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,070
- "I cannot tell," just like that?
- Uh-huh. Hilarious!

828
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,738
She sounds interesting.

829
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,407
Oh yeah,
when's your mother being discharged?

830
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,659
Day after next.

831
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,912
Oh, great to hear that. Then you can be
at the welcoming party, can't you?

832
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,038
Of course.

833
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,748
[cheering, clapping]

834
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,920
Hello, I ended a relationship
three months ago.

835
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,546
[man 1] Aw. Poor thing!

836
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,298
[man 2] I hope to find new love

837
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,300
and explore the campus grounds
at my new school.

838
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,551
My name is Kim Dae-gyu,

839
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,304
and I'm a freshman
majoring in social sciences.

Laica, Laica!

843
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,521
- [whooping]
- [Hyeon-guk] Yeah!

844
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,690
Good for you!

[laughing]

846
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,403
[woman] Okay, hello.

847
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,363
I'm a freshman
in the college of engineering.

848
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,990
