YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,343
Please join Cheerleading Club!

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,888
One, two, let's go! One, two…

4
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,931
You just might be the lucky one!

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,642
We're Game Club!

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,150
We're Photography Club!

7
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,610
MAGIC HOUR PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,864
First, you can sign up for our registry…

9
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,620
If I learn photography here,
would I be able to develop this roll?

10
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,580
Absolutely!

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,500
You're a freshman. Class of 2001, right?

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,417
Yes.

13
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,631
Isn't that Sang-hak?

14
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,633
You're right. It is.

15
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,051
Hey, Sang-hak!

16
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,665
You sure took your damn time.

17
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,667
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

18
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,294
-How's the turnout?
-This freshman brought a Tri-X roll.

19
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,131
She couldn't develop the film.
Why don't you take a look?

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,048
Sure.

21
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,844
Can I have a look at the Tri-X roll?

22
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,309
I hear you brought film
and asked if we could develop it.

23
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,565
It's this.

24
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,778
Did you study photography?

25
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,530
No.

26
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,490
Then where did you get this from?

27
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,414
I've just

28
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,167
had it for a long time.

29
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,881
Sorry for bombarding you with questions
before an introduction.

30
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,341
I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

31
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,182
Never mind.

32
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,248
I'm Kim Sang-hak.
Business management. Class of 2000.

33
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,464
What significance does language have
in the way we think?

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,467
It allows us to distinguish concepts,

35
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,428
conceptualize habitual actions,

36
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,640
and generate new ideas.

37
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
If we simplify the history of mankind…

38
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,187
Room 207.

39
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,397
"Understanding Language…"

40
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,235
Room 207…

41
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,864
Hurry up!

42
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,789
Hey, wait up!

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,141
Is everything all right?

44
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,644
Did you see a film roll here?
A black-and-white one.

45
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,188
Did you lose that Tri-X roll
you had earlier?

46
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,106
Yes.

47
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,650
There's no other place it could be.

48
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,658
Sure seems like it's super important.

49
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,868
You ran off so quickly
you didn't hear me call you.

50
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,122
Thank you.

51
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
Take a seat if you're grateful.

52
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,462
Please.

53
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,718
Come on.

54
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,555
The least you can do
is finish what you started writing.

55
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,062
I had to go to the humanities office
and your lecture hall because of this.

56
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,232
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,236
You'll understand better next year,
but freshmen are rare in our club.

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,698
Everyone kept harping on at me
about how I scared you off.

59
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,368
-You didn't.
-Right?

60
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,537
Did you guys hear that?

61
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,415
-Yeah, congrats.
-Why else would she run away?

62
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,043
REGISTRATION FORM
RYU EUN-JUNG

63
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,879
Once you're done,
I'll drop the formalities.

64
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,175
I haven't

65
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,094
finished filling out the form just yet.

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,517
I apologize.
Please go ahead and fill it out.

67
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,777
DATE OF BIRTH: 1982…

68
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,612
ADDRESS: GYEONGGI-DO, ILYEONG

69
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,697
TO LEARN HOW TO DEVELOP
BLACK-AND-WHITE FILM…

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,367
It's Magic Hour. Welcome.

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,960
We're Magic Hour, the photography club.

72
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,423
A long time ago,

73
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,343
someone once told me this.

74
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,137
This was shot with a shutter speed of 60,

75
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,557
which means this photo captured
1/60 of a second.

76
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,436
They said that although
time may appear frozen in a photograph,

77
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,315
1/60th of a second lives on
in the photo forever.

78
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,194
And so to take a photograph

79
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,905
is to collect time.

80
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,729
Hey, it's me.

81
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,940
What?

82
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,444
Sang-yeon. I'm outside,
so I can't hear you well.

83
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,363
Say that again. What happened to Sang-hak?

84
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,867
He's dead.

85
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,748
Sang-hak's dead.

86
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:32,678
CHUNGMURO

87
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,353
Could you lend this to me for one week?

88
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,522
I promise to return it after that.

89
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,820
That day, Sang-hak left home
early in the morning.

90
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,990
Three days later,
they found him in the mountains.

91
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,682
Eun-jung.

92
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,525
The first person to answer the call
from the police…

93
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,903
was Sang-yeon.

94
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,964
What's on your mind?

95
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,800
-Hello.
-Hey.

96
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,427
Is that a camera?

97
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,180
-Yes. I just bought it today.
-Today?

98
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,808
It's secondhand. I got it today.

99
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,185
Can I have a look? What model is it?

100
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,230
-FM2.
-I see.

101
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,732
Shall we take a look?

102
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,361
Sit here.

103
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,658
How much did you pay for it?

104
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,161
It was originally 370,000 won,

105
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,831
but since I had to go pick it up,
the seller gave it to me for 350,000.

106
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,751
350,000 won?

107
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,089
And how far did you have to go
to pick it up?

108
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,674
Uijeongbu.

109
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,052
Uijeongbu? Yikes.

110
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,929
Are you free right now?

111
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,806
Yes.

112
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,750
It seems to be in decent shape.
And the lens is clean.

113
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,504
But this camera is fully manual.
Do you know how to use it?

114
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,299
I learned how a long time ago.

115
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,011
I learned everything
except how to change the film.

116
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,681
Except changing the film?

117
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,227
But you can adjust exposure
and shutter speed?

118
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,144
Yes.

119
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,771
Who was it?

120
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,484
Who taught you how to use a camera
but skipped the part about changing rolls?

121
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,570
Is it difficult?

122
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,030
Do you have a roll?

123
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,120
It's a Tri-X roll.

124
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,625
So Tri-X carries around a Tri-X roll.

125
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,005
The seller gave it to me as a freebie.

126
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,510
To put the film in,
you just need to open the back cover.

127
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,931
Look here.
You turn this lever counterclockwise,

128
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,058
then lift this rewind knob.

129
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,144
That's it.

130
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,397
You got that?

131
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,906
You're good.

132
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
You then insert the film here

133
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,789
and align these holes in the film…

134
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,293
with these things here.

135
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,754
Now turn the film advance lever

136
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,881
to wind the film.

137
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,798
Right.

138
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,803
Lastly, make sure the film is
tightly loaded before you close the cover.

139
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,075
From that moment on…

140
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,705
I couldn't help myself.

141
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,419
Whenever I would see him…

142
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,881
I couldn't help but freeze.

143
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,469
So,

144
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,180
is it like a dragonfly net?

145
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,230
To take a photograph
is to collect time, right?

146
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,861
To take a photograph is to collect time.

147
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,242
Collect lots of good moments.

148
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,785
See you.

149
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,262
Yes, well, the paper's stuck.

150
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,098
The machine's not returning
my copier card.

151
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,439
Hey!

152
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,695
-Hello.
-Hi.

153
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,201
That machine is broken, actually.

154
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,327
Is it really?

155
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,662
Yes.

156
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,645
Do you need three copies
of each of these pages?

157
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,149
Yes.

158
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,696
Pretty impressive, huh? This is my turf.

159
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,411
I mean,
I'm a work-study student this semester.

160
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,998
Coming through.

161
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,137
-I can do it.
-I'm just so helpful.

162
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
Here you go.

163
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Thank you.

164
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,483
Join the research team if you're grateful.

165
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,034
The nicer he was to me,
the more timid I became.

166
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,080
Please catch it!

167
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,751
Thank you.

168
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,641
-I'm so sorry!
-It's okay!

169
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,394
I couldn't have made
a bigger fool of myself if I'd tried.

170
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,270
How embarrassing!

171
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,606
Let me be direct with you.

172
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,443
You're right to be embarrassed,
but the people who saw won't care.

173
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,697
-They probably thought it was funny.
-Yeah. I think it's cute.

174
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,159
I know. The people watching
must have found it hilarious.

175
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,078
That's not the problem.

176
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,289
-Then what is?
-I just feel so awkward.

177
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,792
I keep stumbling over my words.

178
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:46,213
And when he said he'd take me out
to eat that day, I just ran away.

179
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,008
So do you not like him?

180
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,804
No.

181
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,305
Then what's the issue?

182
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,808
He offers to buy you food
and copies your papers for free.

183
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,768
And he asked you to join his team.

184
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,980
Exactly! Why am I like this
when he's being nice?

185
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,983
So are you going to miss
the welcome party?

186
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,862
Of course I want to go.

187
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,573
-I want to go, but…
-Why are you so nervous?

188
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,659
Just go. Go get wasted and ask him,

189
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,412
"What's your deal?
Why do you make me feel this way?"

190
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,418
Bottoms up!

191
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,635
Ryu Eun-jung. Humanities.
Straight out of high school.

192
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,513
Kim Nam-ju, you study engineering.

193
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,142
Kwon Hyeon-guk. Class of 2000.
And you study German literature, right?

194
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,936
Not Nam-ju. "Soo." It's Kim Nam-soo.

195
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,229
-Kim Nam-soo.
-Right, soo.

196
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,858
Now, let me introduce our club executives.

197
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,610
Let's start with our treasurer.

198
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,697
MAGIC HOUR NEWBIE WELCOME PARTY

199
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,950
Hi, everyone.
I'm Park Kyu-ho, the treasurer.

200
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,996
Do you see that guy over there?
The one wearing the hoodie.

201
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,998
Finance sounds like a drag, huh?

202
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,001
He also studies management.
He's in the same department as me.

203
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,962
I've had my eye on him
since freshman orientation.

204
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,049
Everyone says he's secretly
a photography major though.

205
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,133
Next!

206
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,765
-They're dating.
-What?

207
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,935
The treasurer
and head of planning are dating.

208
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,104
How do you know?

209
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,690
He wiped dust off her hair
and even brushed it.

210
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,484
It was totally smooth.

211
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,821
It's a hidden talent of mine. Listen.

212
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,491
It might look like
everyone's paying attention,

213
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,077
but really, there's constant
back and forth. Of what?

214
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,203
Of vibes.

215
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,130
Hello. I'm Kim Sang-hak
from the research team.

216
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,301
You can think of our research team

217
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,304
as the embodiment of photography
in every aspect.

218
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,974
From the technical aspects
of taking photos

219
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,518
to development, printing, and history.

220
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:08,188
Anyone with a genuine interest
in photography is welcome.

221
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,899
That's me! I'll join the research team!

222
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,776
-Who is that?
-We'd love to have you.

223
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,863
And if any of you
are carrying around an old film roll

224
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,658
in the hopes of getting it developed,
you should join us immediately.

225
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,704
Come on, just go ahead and say
you want Tri-X to join you.

226
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,746
Thanks for listening!

227
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
What's Tri-X?

228
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,210
You don't even know Tri-X?

229
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,046
Tell me. What is it?

230
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,340
-It's just--
-Oh my! Hey.

231
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,428
Wow, you seem to be quite the drinker.

232
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
I look forward to our time together.
Thank you!

233
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,692
Hello. My name's Ryu Eun-jung--

234
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,610
Tri-X!

235
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,201
I'm a humanities major,
hoping to study Korean literature.

236
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,120
-And you use Tri-X.
-Yes, she does!

237
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
Nice to meet you!

238
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,415
Welcome!

239
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,004
Fold a finger
if your current GPA falls below 3.7.

240
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,217
Why aren't you targeting the newbies?
Make them fold first.

241
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,551
Those who are dating, fold.

242
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,264
-How's that targeting the newbies?
-Exactly!

243
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,517
Fold if you've kissed
within the past 24 hours.

244
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
Seriously?

245
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,689
Fold if you're handsome!

246
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,817
That doesn't include you guys.

247
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,778
Here I go. I'm folding!

248
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,697
Now drink up!

249
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,954
Keep going.

250
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,455
Humanities, fold.

251
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,584
We finally got Eun-jung.

252
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,127
-Bottoms up!
-I'll drink for her.

253
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,843
-Man, that's embarrassing!
-She doesn't like you!

254
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,599
It's Eun-jung's turn now. Everyone hush.

255
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,934
Non-freshmen, fold.

256
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,811
Nice one, Ryu Eun-jung!

257
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,523
-Bottoms up!
-Will you be okay?

258
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,858
-Eun-jung's drinking!
-Drink up!

259
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,716
Mom.

260
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,260
How did I get home last night?

261
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,097
You need to ask how you got home?
Way to go, Eun-jung.

262
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,598
Nice going!

263
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,142
It won't happen again.

264
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,144
What time did I get in?

265
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,771
I don't know! Maybe 2:00 a.m.

266
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,024
The seniors from your club
brought you home.

267
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,775
Seniors? Who?

268
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,154
There was a girl called Cho something,

269
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,697
and the other one was

270
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,199
Sang-hyeok? Right, Sang-hyeok.

271
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,410
And what did you say to them?

272
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,953
What do you think I said?

273
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,248
I gave them a piece of my mind
for getting you so drunk!

274
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,046
There's rice porridge in the pot.
If that ever happens again, I swear…

275
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,989
-Hello?
-Excuse me!

276
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,533
Hello?

277
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,663
How's the hangover?

278
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,460
Fine. I heard that you brought me home.

279
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,087
Did you totally black out?

280
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,964
I think so…

281
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,384
Don't you remember, "Excuse me"?

282
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,220
"Excuse me"?

283
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,806
You kept saying, "Excuse me!"
and scolding Sang-hak.

284
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:13,975
I did?

285
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,479
Sang-hak's probably feeling super dejected
right about now.

286
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,983
I can't remember a thing. Could you…

287
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,072
Excuse me!

288
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,449
Never ever!

289
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,575
…look like a fool?

290
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,412
That guy? I'd never date him!

291
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,996
Never ever!

292
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,460
Oh my God.

293
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,881
What have I done?

294
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,926
Everyone I meet keeps saying, "Excuse me!"

295
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,303
You would have done the same.

296
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,515
When you first said, "Excuse me,"
everyone went silent.

297
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,016
Then we all burst out laughing.

298
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,895
You're such a hoot when you're drunk!

299
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:04,526
I remember saying, "Excuse me,"
but I don't remember why.

300
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,529
Why I said that to Sang-hak
in the first place.

301
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,989
Said what?

302
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,159
That I wouldn't date him.

303
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,246
That's because I was on a roll.

304
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,206
On a roll?

305
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,084
The treasurer and head of planning.

306
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,299
Hyeon-jin and beanie guy!

307
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,468
-Damn, how did you know?
-She's spot on.

308
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,928
Polka dot and that guy!

309
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,013
Yeah, we're dating!

310
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,851
Everyone was in awe that night
because I sniffed out every couple.

311
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,519
And lastly,

312
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,606
let me make a prediction.

313
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,399
Kim Sang-hak

314
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,817
and Eun-jung!

315
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,570
They'll be dating within a month!

316
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,246
Come on. Sang-hak just wanted her
to join the research team.

317
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,539
Want to bet 10,000 won?

318
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,210
Whether Eun-jung and Sang-hak
will be dating within a month?

319
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,377
Be honest with me, bro.

320
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,508
Do you think you'll date Tri-X or not?

321
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,646
Excuse me!

322
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,688
And excuse you!

323
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,733
Why are you all making me

324
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,277
look like a fool?

325
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm telling you now.

326
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,073
That guy?

327
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,701
I'd never ever date that guy!

328
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,039
I'm never dating him!

329
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,086
Why would I say that?

330
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,630
Oh, poor you.

331
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,850
SEOUL CAMERA SUPPLY
CAMERAS AND FILM PHOTOGRAPHY

332
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,480
Hello.

333
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,735
Looking for something?

334
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,365
I wanted to buy some film…

335
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,455
Could I please get three,
no, four rolls of Tri-X

336
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,458
and a 52 mm UV filter?

337
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,474
Need a bag?

338
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,852
No. I can carry it all in this.

339
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,649
It's 2,200 won for each roll
and 12,300 won for the UV filter,

340
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,359
so your total is 21,100 won.

341
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,208
I see we have a customer.

342
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,629
One second.

343
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,008
Here. 8,900 won change.

344
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,510
Thank you.

345
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,138
Bye.

346
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,765
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

347
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,643
-Do you know her?
-She's just a freshman.

348
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,155
"Just a freshman."

349
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,783
That meant

350
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,536
that I no longer meant anything to him.

351
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,331
That I was a nobody.

352
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,159
Despite my efforts to stop…

353
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,955
my eyes kept drifting to him.

354
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,102
Everything about him…

355
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,190
seemed to hold so much meaning.

356
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
-Eun-jung, I must ask.
-Yes?

357
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,131
Are you dating Sang-hak?

358
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,884
No.

359
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:25,054
Nice! Kim A-ra, give me 10,000 won.
It's been a month, and they're not dating.

360
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,225
Pay up.

361
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,065
-Give me the money.
-Seriously?

362
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,401
Jeez, read the room.

363
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,181
Yes, Su-mi.

364
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,269
I don't think I'll be able to make it.

365
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,314
Something's come up at home.

366
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,399
I'll join you next time.

367
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,447
I won't miss the next one. All right, bye.

368
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,537
Why use family matters as an excuse?
You even bought sneakers for the trip.

369
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,122
We have 40 kilograms' worth
of injeolmi orders.

370
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,209
Having Eun-jung help out
makes things easier.

371
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,670
Eun-jung's faster
at making these than you.

372
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,925
-Is my order ready?
-Yes, hey.

373
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,718
-Hello.
-Hello.

374
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,512
Eun-jung, you're here too.

375
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,724
You're even prettier
now that you're in university.

376
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,103
Eun-jung, do you like being in university?

377
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,648
It's better than being in high school.
No more late night classes.

378
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,278
You're so lucky.
It must be so nice to be 20!

379
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,032
It's such a wonderful age.
You're like a flower blooming.

380
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,205
I could have cried.

381
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,544
Because this isn't how I'd imagined

382
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,838
being 20 would be.

383
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,968
I imagined it to be

384
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,512
more exhilarating.

385
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,057
Super exciting.

386
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,814
Just as she had said…

387
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,192
blooming like a flower.

388
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,537
Sang-hak's not coming to Pohang either
because of you.

389
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,001
Why?

390
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,088
How would I know?
Why can't you guys just get over it?

391
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,175
If you're not dating, you're not.
Why miss the photography trip?

392
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,609
-Hello.
-Here to work on your photos?

393
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,528
Go on. No one's inside.

394
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,323
Sang-hak seonbae.

395
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,290
Are you really not going
on the photography trip because of me?

396
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,793
Because I'll find it uncomfortable?

397
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,092
If we'd both feel awkward…
it's only right that I don't go.

398
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,596
How would that be right?

399
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,517
I've already been there twice.
And I'm older than you.

400
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,770
But still…

401
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,896
If I'd known…

402
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,443
that I made you so uncomfortable,
I wouldn't have acted that way.

403
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,781
I've been meaning to tell you this.

404
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,575
I'm sorry for overstepping.

405
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,829
That won't happen again,

406
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,914
so just enjoy being in the club.

407
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,167
It would be a shame
to give up something you enjoy

408
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,628
over someone you dislike.

409
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,633
I don't dislike you.

410
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,429
You didn't do anything
for me to dislike you.

411
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,519
It's my fault, really.
I'm the one who feels uncomfortable.

412
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,571
All right, then. Let's hear it.

413
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,407
Why do I make you so uncomfortable?

414
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,786
It's just…

415
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,123
You said you disliked me
from the very start.

416
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,250
I said that?

417
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,668
Yes.

418
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,798
So tell me,

419
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,427
why do you hate Sang-hak so much?

420
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,347
Because he's Sang-hak.

421
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,059
Yeah, he's Sang-hak.

422
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,604
It may not seem like it, but he is
the most popular guy in our club.

423
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,397
Do you really not like him?

424
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,070
From the very first moment I saw him,

425
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,697
he's been Sang-hak.

426
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,326
Makes me so uncomfortable…

427
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,998
That…

428
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,627
was about your name.

429
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,757
That was about how you have the same name
as someone I used to know.

430
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,259
The same name?

431
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,433
Hold up.

432
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,356
How much of a jerk was he for you to…

433
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,526
What kind of person is he?
That Kim Sang-hak.

434
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
Just Sang-hak.

435
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,492
Not Kim Sang-hak.

436
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,915
Just Sang-hak oppa.

437
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,878
I had a crush on him,

438
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,507
and seeing you reminds me of him.

439
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,596
1/60th of a second.

440
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,268
It's him, isn't it? The one you mentioned
on your registration form.

441
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,859
Collecting time.

442
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,029
Did you bring up the dragonfly net
because you read that?

443
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,281
Of course.

444
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,786
I didn't know that and thought…

445
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:09,458
I was shocked you had the same name,
but you kept saying the same things.

446
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,128
He's actually the reason
I joined the club, but--

447
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,338
So I don't share a name with someone

448
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,299
who was a jerk to you, right?

449
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,634
I share it

450
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,012
with someone you like?

451
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,061
Then why do I make you so uncomfortable?

452
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,151
Because you're so nice to me.

453
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,946
You were nice to me for no reason.

454
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,949
-Seriously?
-And asked me to join the research team.

455
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,286
It's strange because I haven't done
anything to deserve it.

456
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,580
Why wouldn't you deserve it?

457
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,334
On the first day we met,
you made me laugh and run around campus.

458
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,380
And it's not like I was the only one
who wanted you on my team.

459
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,092
Jeong-seon wanted you to join planning,
and the others, they…

460
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,596
Man, I'm really telling you everything.

461
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:09,310
I played so much rock, paper, scissors
to bring you to the research team…

462
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,731
Anyways…

463
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,746
Come tomorrow. That place is great.

464
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,837
Is that a promise?

465
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,840
Okay.

466
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,135
If you come early,
I'll buy you a popsicle.

467
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,223
A popsicle?

468
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,058
Yes. A popsicle.

469
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,905
SANGBONG TERMINAL

470
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,825
A popsicle, huh?

471
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,329
A popsicle?

472
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,845
Eun-jung.

473
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,306
Hello.

474
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,058
You're here so early.
You do know it's the 6:50 bus, right?

475
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,476
Yes.

476
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,145
That reminds me.

477
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,606
-I'll pay you the club fee.
-Sure.

478
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,532
Chips, anyone?

479
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,367
Hi, guys!

480
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,287
-Hello.
-Stay seated, guys.

481
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,957
I need to pee. Don't you need to go?

482
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,125
Yeah, I'll go.

483
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,178
Everyone, the bus is here.

484
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,638
Please board by 6:45.

485
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,681
Okay.

486
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,395
You take the window seat.
I always pass out on buses.

487
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,814
-Sure. Why don't you get on first?
-Okay.

488
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,317
KIM SANG-HAK SEONBAE

489
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,236
Lee Ki-yeong, please come
to the lost and found center

490
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,237
on the second floor…

491
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,156
Stop it.

492
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,158
-I'm feeling sick.
-Can you get on the bus?

493
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,201
No.

494
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,872
Sang-hak said he'd come too.

495
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,248
He did, didn't he?

496
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,917
-Sang-hak's coming?
-Yes.

497
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,002
-I thought he couldn't?
-He said he would.

498
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,296
Get on the bus. I'll try calling him.

499
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,964
Let's go.

500
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,688
Hold on.

501
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,899
Didn't our head of research say
he'd come too?

502
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,194
He's not picking up,
so I guess he's sleeping in.

503
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,947
Don't worry about him.
He'll find his way there.

504
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,783
He's never been late for anything.

505
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,963
Hey. Is everything okay?

506
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,476
Everything was most definitely not okay.

507
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,021
Otherwise, he would be here.

508
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,152
For no reason,
my mind turned to Cheon Sang-hak…

509
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,530
and that smile of his.

510
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,453
That had been the last of him.

511
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,808
MUNGYEONG REST STOP

512
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,147
Sang-hak seonbae is just sleeping in.

513
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,734
He's not Sang-hak oppa.

514
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,321
He's asleep. That's all.

515
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,868
The view's gorgeous!

516
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,586
Dang, you scared me. Where were you?

517
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,962
Hey, Kim Sang-hak!

518
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,217
We thought you were still asleep at home.
How did you get here before us?

519
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,343
I flew here, okay?

520
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,220
And how exactly did you fly here?

521
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,056
How do you think? By plane, of course.

522
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,266
You rode a plane here?

523
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,394
Don't eat all the popsicles
in the freezer!

524
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,147
-Popsicles? There are popsicles!
-Where are they?

525
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,233
Guys, get inside. There are popsicles!

526
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,777
-Come inside.
-Where are they?

527
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,992
Ryu Eun-jung!

528
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,912
Eun-jung, take me with you!

529
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,124
Eun-jung.

530
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,423
Are you crying?

531
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,134
No.

532
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,512
Hey, come on. Were you worried?

533
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,974
That's why I took a plane here.

534
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,977
Do you know how much it cost me?

535
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,439
Honestly, I flew here
because I didn't want you to worry.

536
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,567
You'll laugh if I tell you.

537
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,944
I swear I left early this morning,

538
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:56,073
but my phone fell between the platforms
when I was transferring--

539
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,700
I thought you'd died.

540
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,079
Died?

541
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,791
Hey, come on, now…

542
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,895
I don't know why I cried so hard.

543
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,691
I thought it strange
even as the tears fell.

544
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,573
I had never cried so hard,
not even when Sang-hak died.

545
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,335
Sang-hak seonbae later told me
that seeing me cry explained a lot.

546
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,717
Including why I acted so strange
after hearing his name…

547
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,973
who owned the film roll I brought,
and what had happened to them.

548
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,379
Will you be my girlfriend?

549
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,511
I like you.

550
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,521
I like you too.

551
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,368
Guys!

552
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,370
What are you doing over there?

553
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,873
Hyeon-guk.

554
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,251
Give A-ra 10,000 won.

555
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,502
-What?
-Why?

556
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,713
We're dating!

557
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,516
Let's go eat popsicles.

558
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,313
Oh my God, they're actually dating!

559
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,107
Ryu Eun-jung!

560
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,407
I didn't even know you had taken these.

561
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,910
-Not one photo, but three.
-It's actually five.

562
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,079
-Five?
-Yeah.

563
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:49,997
SPRING OF 2002

564
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,249
Here. Look.

565
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,421
You made this contact print?

566
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,715
It's so pretty.

567
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,760
Are you calling yourself pretty?

568
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,429
Yeah.

569
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,434
So you liked me since then.

570
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,352
Why didn't you say so?

571
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,608
Back then, I just couldn't read your mind.

572
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,443
You had this mysterious charm.

573
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,528
Now you're…

574
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,572
An open book, aren't I?

575
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,618
I tell all before you get curious.

576
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,329
You know yourself well.

577
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,168
It seems like you've done
so many exhibitions.

578
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,337
I did start photography in middle school.

579
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,172
I'll go.

580
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,841
Welcome.

581
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,523
Thank you, ma'am. Have a good day!

582
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:00,818
What's that?

583
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,071
What exhibition was this?

584
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,574
It was with a club I was in
during my gap year.

585
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,492
Why?

586
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,036
Oh, it's nothing.

587
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,498
I thought it might be someone I know,

588
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,000
but I don't think it is.

589
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,045
Yeah, it's definitely not.

590
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,674
My uncle's here.

591
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,678
-I see Sang-hak's here.
-Hello, sir.

592
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,430
-You good?
-Yes.

593
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,474
How was the turnout?

594
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,352
A handful of freshmen took our leaflets,

595
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,856
but I only saw one person
fill out a registration form.

596
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,651
I see why freshmen are so rare.

597
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,362
That reminds me
of something funny from earlier.

598
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,364
-The one who filled out a form.
-Yeah?

599
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:51,243
They just showed up to our booth and asked
if broke people can take up photography.

600
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,911
MAGIC HOUR
29TH RECRUITMENT

601
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,830
Can I

602
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,418
learn photography even if I'm broke?

603
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:02,963
You can.

604
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,633
But you'd need a camera,
even if it's not an expensive one.

605
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,135
Do you have one?

606
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,931
That person then took a camera
out of a bag and showed it to me.

607
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:13,974
Guess what it was.

608
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,146
A Leica M3.

609
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,149
A Leica?

610
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,403
M3… Isn't that the model you want?

611
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,864
Yeah. It's the camera of my dreams.

612
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,657
Broke but has a Leica?

613
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,950
That's hilarious.

614
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,161
Right? The reason for joining
is even funnier.

615
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,623
We all cracked up after reading the form.

616
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,129
What is this?

617
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,050
"Can't say…"

618
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,802
-Huh?
-What the…

619
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,096
-What is…
-Is this really…

620
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,181
What is this?

621
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:02,731
REASON FOR JOINING:
CAN'T SAY

622
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,777
That's what was written? "Can't say"?

623
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,070
Yeah. Funny, isn't it?

624
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,738
How funny.

625
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,407
When is your mother being discharged?

626
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,659
The day after tomorrow.

627
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,912
That's good. So you can make it
to the newbie welcome party, right?

628
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,829
I guess so.

629
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,628
Hello. I broke up with my girlfriend
three months ago.

630
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,963
-Oh dear!
-Poor you.

631
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,549
I'm Kim Dae-kyu, a social science student.
Class of 2002.

632
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,679
I dream of walking this university campus
with a newfound love!

633
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,889
Blue jumper across from you.

634
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,572
Hello. I'm Cheon Sang-yeon.
Class of 2002. School of Engineering.

635
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,915
I should technically be a grade higher.
I didn't intend to take a gap year…

636
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,212
It was Sang-yeon.

637
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,340
I didn't really go to school.

638
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,259
I much preferred going out.

639
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,265
The "yeon" in my name means swallow,
so I'm quite the carefree bird.

640
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:24,896
I've never taken photos before,
but I figured it could be fun.

641
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,648
Do you have an older sister?

642
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,568
No, I don't have an older sister,

643
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,571
but I do have
a good-for-nothing older brother.

644
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,574
Thanks for the warm welcome!

645
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:48,576
