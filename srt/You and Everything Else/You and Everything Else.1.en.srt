174
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,975
is the best private school in Seoul.

175
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,686
Sang-yeon was one
of the top students there.

176
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,524
So we have here a very cool,
very smart new friend in our class.

177
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,568
Let's clap for her. [chuckling]

179
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,156
[young Eun-jung] <i>I think</i>
<i>Sang-yeon's a genius.</i>

180
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,824
Really? Why?

181
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,245
Because Kyeong-ho, our class president,
competed against Sang-yeon in math.

182
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,288
And Sang-yeon won.

183
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
- The problem was insane.
- What was it?

184
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,419
- One for sixth graders.
- A sixth-grade math problem?

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,339
At first, they competed
with a fourth-grade question, right?

186
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,217
[adult Eun-jung] <i>At school,</i>
<i>I was quiet and timid.</i>

187
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,929

<i>I had so much to say.</i>

188
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,431
They solved problems
made for fifth graders.

189
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,684
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

190
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,810
Bye, girls.

191
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, right. Did you have enough desks
in your class for all the new kids?

192
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,404
We needed three more. Your class?

193
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,739
We needed two more desks.

194
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,990
What'd they do?

195
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,869
It doesn't seem like
we have enough desks open.

196
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,206
Are any of the boys
willing to give up their seats?

197
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,460
When our teacher asked if any boys wanted
to give up their seats for the new kids,

198
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,962
Kim Kyeong-ho raised his hand.

199
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,380
- Yes, sir.
- I'll do it.

201
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,177

203
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,057
Then who shall we pick
to give up their seat?

204
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,853
Who will be the cool friend?
Who'll it be, who'll it be, who'll it be?

But Kim Kyeong-ho raised his hand first.

208
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,862
See what I mean?

209
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,822
I kinda expected it.

210
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,575
Kim Kyeong-ho wouldn't be made
to do that stuff.

211
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,244
My teacher always makes
our neighborhood kids do it.

212
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,663
What did they do without their desks?

213
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,250
[teacher 2] To read big numbers,
we group them in fours from left to right.

214
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,879
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine. See the group?

215
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,965
The numbers from the left are read
as thousands, hundreds, and tens.

which kids transferred out,

her brother having a nicer room.

341
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,307
- [chuckles] What grade is she in?
- Fourth grade.

342
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,725
Ilyeong Elementary?

343
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,645
- Yes, she transferred in last week.
- [gasps]

344
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,105
Don't tell me,
she's in Class Five, is she?

345
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,191
Why?

346
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,402
The homeroom teacher in that class is…

347
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,280
What? What is it?

348
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,200
He plays favorites based on
the kids' family background.

349
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,245
Apparently, the homeroom teacher
made the poorest kids give up their desks

350
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,539
because there weren't enough in the room
when they brought in the new students.

351
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,042
- The poor kids had to sit on the floor.
- Oh my…

352
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,171
And how… how do you know all of this?

353
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,548
My daughter told me about it.

354
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,343
I'm sure it must've been
really unfair to her.

355
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,429
You have a pretty smart daughter.
What's her name?

356
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
Eun-jung. Ryu Eun-jung.

357
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,731
Stop it.

358
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,778
Come on, quit.

359
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,823
Be quiet.

360
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,617
[clattering]

361
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,953
- Stop it. I said don't!
- [Sang-yeon] Hey, you.

362
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,330
Come up here.

363
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,917
I didn't… I wasn't…

364
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,628
Kim Hyeon-tae wouldn't stop
kicking my art project.

365
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,964
- Then you both come up here.
- [Hyeon-tae] Me?

366
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,590
But I didn't say anything.

367
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,768
I wasn't talking. I'm not lying.

368
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,646
- He kept kicking my art--
- [Kyeong-ho] Hey.

369
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,065
If the class president tells you
to go up, just go.

370
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
Are you gonna talk back
to the teacher too?

371
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,403
[children muttering]

372
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,363
[boy 3] She's definitely in trouble.

373
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,502
Give me your hands.

374
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,924
- You too.
- [Hyeon-tae] But I didn't say anything.

375
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,055
- [Hyeon-tae gasps] She hits really hard.
- [girl 3] So hard!

376
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,349
[girl 4] What the heck?

377
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,978
[Kyeong-ho] Hey, Ryu Eun-jung.

378
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,400
[pained yelp]

379
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,402
[breathing shakily]

380
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,071
[hands rubbing together]

381
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,536
[sniffles]

382
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,543
[sniffles]

383
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,505
[sniffles]

384
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,300
[sighs shakily]

385
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,968
[cartoon character chittering]

386
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,387
[giggling]

387
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,479
- [footsteps approaching]
- [door opens]

388
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,855
[mom] I'm home.

389
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,235
Did you have fun today?

390
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,953
[sighs] What's wrong?

391
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,454
Did something happen?

392
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,664
[sullenly] Nothing.

393
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,877
- [mom] Let me see.
- [Eun-jung snuffles]

394
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,797
[mom] Aw, something did happen today.

395
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,883
[sniffles] I said nothing happened.

396
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,137
Who was it? Who did this
to my precious Eun-jung? Huh?

397
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,639
Mom, at school…

398
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,517
remember that girl, Cheon Sang-yeon?

399
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,770
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I was so embarrassed</i>
<i>and upset by that incident</i>

400
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,148
<i>that I held a grudge against her</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

401
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,107
Over here!

402
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,444
<i>We were in different classes</i>
<i>when the new school year began,</i>

403
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,946
<i>but my anger reignited</i>
<i>every time I saw Sang-yeon.</i>

404
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,283
[girls] Oh!

405
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,162
[adult Eun-jung] <i>My grades got better in</i>
<i>fifth grade. I made a lot of new friends.</i>

406
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,080
<i>My personality changed as well.</i>

407
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,666
Hey, wait a minute. Time out.
You stepped on the line.

408
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,794
[adult Eun-jung] <i>In other words,</i>
<i>I became a know-it-all.</i>

409
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,963
- You're pretending you saw.
- Everybody saw.

410
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,465
- I did not.
- [girl 1] You're lying.

411
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,008
- [girl 2] I'm not!
- [girl 3] The heck?

412
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,093
- Come on, let's play.
- [girl 2] I didn't step on it.

413
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,303
Whatever, just play.

414
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,391
- What kinda throw was that?
- Hey, throw me the ball.

415
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,268
- Ugh!
- [girl 4] Over here, over here!

416
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,313
- Stay together!
- It's not--

417
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,772
- Hey, are you okay?
- You okay?

418
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,483
- Did you get hurt?
- [girl 4] Is she okay?

419
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,194
[girl 5] Hey, Eun-jung.
Why'd you hit her in the head?

420
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,906
- [girl 6] She did that on purpose.
- Why would I do it on purpose?

421
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,909
[girl 6] Because you did.
You've only been going after Sang-yeon.

422
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,913
Yeah, because Sang-yeon is a good player.
You all just went after Eun-jung.

423
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,165
She got hit playing dodgeball. So what?

424
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,668
But she got hit in the head.
I bet you don't even know much that hurts.

425
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,337
- I heard it.
- You could die from that.

426
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,255
- Nobody is dying!
- That's a bunch of lies.

427
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,215
[whistle blowing]

428
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,343
- [girl 7] The teacher's here.
- [teacher 2] Everyone, freeze.

429
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,180
What's going on? Are you brats
fighting during dodgeball? Huh?

430
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,644
[sighs softly]

431
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,397
[indistinct background chatter]

432
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,575
[teacher 2] Oh, you're here.

433
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,163
[door opens]

434
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,373
[door closes]

435
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,459
- [woman 1] Hello.
- [teacher 2] Oh, hi, Ms. Yoon

436
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,169
Hello, Eun-jung.

437
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,257
[teacher 2] Ah, this little incident
happened during dodgeball.

438
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,676
Eun-jung, you should apologize.

439
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,053
Both of you, shake hands and make up.

440
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,391
[Eun-jung] Sorry.

441
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,643
- [gentle music playing]
- [Sang-yeon scoffs]

442
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,817
Games between classes
can become easily competitive.

443
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,237
Sang-yeon, stop being a baby
and accept her apology.

444
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,532
[scoffs softly]

445
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,035
Admit you did it on purpose.

446
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,371
- I didn't.
- Liar!

447
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,874
I'm the only one you made your target.

448
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,211
You're making things up. I didn't mean it.

449
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,299
You're saying
that it wasn't intentional, right?

450
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,680
Yeah. I didn't mean it.
I made a mistake when I threw the ball.

451
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,725
- A mistake?!
- Cheon Sang-yeon.

452
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,644
[scoffs incredulously]
Why are you taking her side?

453
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,855
She aimed right for my head!

454
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,983
Cheon Sang-yeon.

455
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,905
[door opens, slams closed]

456
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,995
- Hey, Mom?
- [mom] Yes?

457
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,912
Earlier,

458
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,084
in PE class, during dodgeball,
I threw the ball at Sang-yeon.

459
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
But, the ball hit her head,
and she went to the nurse.

460
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,423
[mom] The nurse's office?
How hard did you hit her?

461
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,925
It wasn't on purpose.
That happens in dodgeball.

462
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,185
But it… was still pretty hard.

463
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,812
Sounds like it. Is she doing better now?

464
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:32,067
Uh-huh. She seemed like she was fine
right after it happened.

465
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,236
I'm not sure
if I did it on purpose or not.

466
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,824
If I told the teacher it wasn't on purpose
when I'm not sure about it,

467
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,660
would I be a liar?

468
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,037
I couldn't say.

469
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,831
[sighs]

470
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,125
Are you sure… you don't really know?

471
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,587
[sighs]

472
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,966
- [sighs]
- [mom] Hmm.

473
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,847
Mom, Ms. Yoon, our writing teacher,
was there in the nurse's office with us.

474
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,808
She said we have to make up.

475
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,310
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

476
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,021
I'm confused why she even showed up.

477
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,523
So then what happened next?

478
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,567
Well, next, Ms. Yoon said
for Sang-yeon to make up with me,

479
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,653
then Sang-yeon was rude
to me and Ms. Yoon.

480
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,698
She got up and left
'cause Ms. Yoon was taking my side.

481
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,659
Really? I'm surprised
she was mouthing off to the teacher.

482
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,868
I know!

483
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,745
[sighs deeply]

484
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,207
[groaning softly]

485
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,543
- Your leg's in my way.
- [boy] Hey, stop it.

486
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,129
It was weird.

487
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,797
So weird.

488
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,176
- [mom] Write about it in your diary.
- But I'm not even sure what was going on.

489
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,595
Write it was weird, or something.

490
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,434
Tomorrow's Wednesday.
It's special activity class day.

491
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,853
[Eun-jung sighs]

492
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,233
THEME: THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISE
I EVER MADE

493
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,318
[pensive music playing]

494
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,575
[adult Eun-jung] <i>For my special activity,</i>

495
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,327
<i>I was assigned</i>
<i>to Ms. Yoon's writing class.</i>

496
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,623
<i>I'm pretty sure that was the day</i>

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,877
<i>my personality changed.</i>

498
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,633
[teacher 2] Raise your hand
if you don't have a mom.

499
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,634
1 YEAR AGO

500
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,386
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I wanted to cry.</i>

501
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,473
<i>There was a family background check</i>
<i>that morning.</i>

502
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,016
[teacher 2] Nobody.

503
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,810
Raise your hand if you don't have a dad.

504
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,856
- Your dad's not around?
- No.

505
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,567
- [teacher 2] Name?
- Lee Han-jun, sir.

506
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,694
Hey, you better raise your hand.

507
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,697
He's only talking about
the transfer students.

508
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,077
- Is there anyone else with no dad?
- Eun-jung doesn't have a dad.

509
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,331
[teacher 2] She's an established student.

510
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,833
I was only talking about
the transfer students.

511
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,921
[pensive music continues]

512
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,842
[teacher 2] Moving on.
Next are your parents' education levels.

513
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,762
Whose parents stopped
at elementary school?

514
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,940
[Ms. Yoon] Eun-jung.

515
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,651
Hello.

516
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,280
These books are a little too heavy.
Could you please help me?

517
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,408
Okay.

518
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,538
Be careful.

519
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,248
This way.

520
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,087
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I was surprised</i>
<i>that Ms. Yoon actually knew who I was.</i>

521
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,298
<i>I was a quiet and invisible kid.</i>

522
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,968
<i>All of the other teachers</i>

523
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,470
<i>didn't even know my name.</i>

524
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,810
[Ms. Yoon clears throat]

525
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,816
Thanks a lot. [chuckles]

526
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,776
You worked hard. Shall we sit?

527
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,152
- Okay.
- [Ms. Yoon] Great.

528
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,495
[footsteps approaching]

529
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,707
Thanks for helping me.

530
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,417
[soda can opening]

531
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,214
That must be heavy.
Let's put it down for a minute.

532
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,133
Oh, please drink.

533
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,728
[Ms. Yoon chuckles softly]

534
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,238
Eun-jung.

535
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,367
Your dad's not with you anymore, right?

536
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,456
Yeah.

537
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,335
Are you surprised that I know that?

538
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,256
I was passing by your class
and happened to overhear it.

539
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,557
It happened to me too.
When I was young, my father passed away.

540
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,144
[pensive music playing]

541
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,563
He passed away when I was in sixth grade.

542
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,982
How old were you, Eun-jung?

543
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,736
I was eight.

544
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,698
[Ms. Yoon] I see.

545
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,910
That must've made you really sad.

546
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,914
I remember that feeling.

547
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:43,086
It was so hard for me to smile
when I thought about him.

548
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,631
Can you relate to that?

549
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,176
Yep.

550
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,971
[sobbing]

551
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,728
- [sniffles]
- Here.

552
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,907
Thank you, Ms. Yoon. [sniffles, sobs]

553
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,909
Can you blow your nose? [huffs]

554
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,578
[blowing nose]

555
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,341
Eun-jung,

556
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,176
Please listen to me.

557
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,638
There is something
that I really wanted to tell you.

558
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,185
Whether it's your father,
or your mother, or anyone.

559
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,399
there's always going to be that heartbreak
when you can't see someone you love.

560
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,945
Even though it wasn't my fault,

561
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,907
I was still embarrassed
that I didn't have a dad.

562
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,620
I didn't feel this way when I was alone,

563
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,372
but I became embarrassed

564
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,875
when others were around.

565
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,629
But now,

566
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,174
I'm feeling differently these days.

567
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,717
Mm…

568
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:16,929
Wait.

569
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,895
Hmm…

570
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,566
This box is
your special spot for your dad,

571
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,859
inside your heart.

572
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,989
Since your dad isn't physically here,
it seems a little bit sad, and all empty.

573
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,617
Mm-hmm. Yes.

574
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,245
[Ms. Yoon] But… what you choose
to fill this empty spot with

575
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,372
is something only you can decide.

576
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,251
If you fill this space with good things…

577
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,338
Oh. …like these,

578
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,716
this once empty space becomes full.

579
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,260
Just like that.

580
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,681
So when you become an adult, you can say…

581
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,476
"I am a person
that happened to have lost her dad,

582
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,979
but I filled his empty space
with these beautiful things,

583
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,108
and those things made me who I am today."

584
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,609
This will be you someday.

585
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:18,574
Your dad, he will be proud of you
when he looks down from above, right?

586
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,284
Yeah.

587
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,537
[sniffles]

588
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,625
[Ms. Yoon] On days when you're sad,
you can write in a diary.

589
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,254
Not the diary
that you have to show your teacher,

590
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,715
but the real one,
that you can write what you really feel.

591
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,843
Okay. [sniffles]

592
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,644
[Ms. Yoon sighs happily]

593
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,398
[chuckling softly]

594
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,776
[school bell chimes]

595
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,072
Hand in your notebooks when you're done.
You have until tomorrow if you need it.

596
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,409
Everyone who turned in your diaries,
come here and collect.

597
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,327
- [class] Yes, ma'am.
- Park Hyeon-jin.

598
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,371
- [indistinct chattering]
- [Ms. Yoon] Mm.

599
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,248
Eun-jung.

600
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,253
Next, Sang-hyeok.

601
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,422
[Sang-hyeok] Thank you.

602
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,094
See ya!

00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,890
TITLE: MY CONFUSED FEELINGS

604
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,060
[Ms. Yoon] <i>You're right.</i>
<i>Our feelings can be quite a puzzle.</i>

605
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,315
<i>But doing your best to figure out</i>
<i>how you're feeling is important.</i>

606
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,025
<i>And it can be fun too.</i>

00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:39,864
Unit 1203, a carton of 500.
Unit 904, a carton of 500. Unit--

608
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,241
Unit 804, a strawberry and plain milk.

609
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,869
Unit 403 has a carton
of 1,000 milliliters.

610
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,164
- For unit 804--
- I got it. Put it in the milk bag.

00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,126
- See you later.
- [Eun-jung] Okay.

00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,507
- Whoa.
- Oh no.

617
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,634
- [man] You came out of nowhere.
- I'm so sorry.

618
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,302
- I'm sorry.
- You should be careful.

619
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,221
- Dad, what happened?
- Are you okay?

620
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,764
- [Eun-jung] Yes.
- Oh?

621
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,606
[Sang-yeon's dad sighs]
A kid shouldn't be working.

622
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,901
You'll end up doing work like that
if you don't study.

623
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,199
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was a math day.</i>

624
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,704
<i>They divided all</i>
<i>of the math classes by grade,</i>

625
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,706
<i>and I was in Class A.</i>

626
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>Obviously, so was Cheon Sang-yeon.</i>

[sighs]

629
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,967
[teacher 4] What is a parallelogram?

630
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,761
If you look here,
there are two sides facing each other

631
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,972
that are parallel in a quadrilateral.

632
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,642
These two parallel sides
are called the baseline,

633
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,436
and the distance between them are…

634
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,316
[boy 1] Hey, Ryu Eun-jung.
I heard you deliver milk.

635
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,027
What?

636
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,903
[boy 2] Who delivers milk?

637
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,990
- [boy 1] Her. Eun-jung. She delivers milk.
- [boy 2 chuckles]

638
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,159
- [girl] Is that true?
- It's not.

639
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,036
I wasn't delivering.

640
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,455
- I was helping my mom.
- Yeah right, stop lying.

641
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,209
She said she was helping her mom.
Leave her alone.

642
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,172
Kim Seong-kwon.

643
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,176
- He's probably in class one.
- [girl] Yeah.

644
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,802
Why?

645
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,014
[adult Eun-jung] <i>I was positive</i>
<i>Sang-yeon had told him.</i>

646
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>She was in class one too.</i>

647
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,936
Why are you telling everybody
that I deliver milk?

648
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,938
- What?
- Admit it!

649
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,441
I'm helping my mom
because she hurt her leg.

650
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,235
Why're you spreading rumors
that I deliver milk?

651
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,321
I didn't spread any rumors

652
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,074
Everybody's talking about it.
Kim Seong-kwon from your class said--

653
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,951
How would I know
where he got that information?

654
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,412
- [spirited music playing]
- [sighs]

655
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,336
And what about you?
How come you're always jumping on me?

656
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,422
- About what?
- [Sang-yeon] Everything.

657
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,301
You only attacked me in dodgeball.
You even hit me in the head.

658
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,013
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- That made my head really sore.

659
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,475
- I bet you really wanted to hit me.
- Yeah, well, you hit me first!

660
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,393
[Sang-yeon] Me?

661
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,480
- When was that?
- When?

662
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,401
You told me I was talking, made me come up
and hit me with a stick! [sighs]

663
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,196
Wait, you were…

664
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,073
Yeah, I was! So what?

665
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,993
None of that was my fault.
Kim Hyeon-tae kept hitting my project.

666
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,455
And my mom says that a student
shouldn't be hitting other students!

667
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,832
[sighs]

668
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,585
Understood.

669
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,587
I get it.

670
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,382
If you feel that upset,
you can hit me too.

671
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,467
What?

672
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,011
I'll allow you. We'll make it even.

673
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,806
Hit me with this.

674
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,767
- [sighs]
- [Sang-yeon] Hit me.

675
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,854
- Do you think I'm not gonna do it?
- What're you waiting for?

676
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,772
- You little…
- Hit me. Do it!

677
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,733
[Eun-jung breathing shakily]

678
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,906
What… Are you crying?

679
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,076
- I'm not crying!
- Why didn't you hit me?

680
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,745
Did you even think about
how bad this would hurt?

681
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,249
It's a lot harder than wood.

682
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,931
You couldn't hit me. You better remember.

683
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,521
- It really wasn't you that told everybody?
- It wasn't.

684
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,816
- You swear?
- Okay, I swear.

685
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,949
Hey, Eun-jung.

686
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,208
You didn't hit me,
but I already got punished because of you,

687
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,587
I didn't realize it was you,

688
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,924
but my mom hit me because I hit you.

689
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,137
My mom is Ms. Yoon.

690
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,015
[pensive music playing]

691
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,392
- Ms. Yoon is your mom?
- Yeah.

692
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,042
[Eun-jung] Hey, Mom. Mom!

693
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,503
Cheon Sang-yeon is Ms. Yoon's daughter.

694
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,629
Is that right?

695
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,715
Yeah, so Ms. Yoon is
my special activity class teacher and--

696
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,677
Yeah. She teaches
your special activity class,

697
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,971
but last year she taught
the fourth-grade class next door.

698
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,640
Uh-huh, and I just found out
Ms. Yoon is Sang-yeon's mom.

699
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,600
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,685
[mom chuckles]

701
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,272
- [chuckling]
- Wait a minute.

702
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,607
You mean you already knew?

703
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,150
Yeah, I already knew.

704
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,610
How did you know about that?

705
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,737
I deliver their milk.

706
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,408
It's hot. Move your hand.

707
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,035
There.

708
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,665
[groans wearily]

709
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,333
- Mom?
- [mom] Hmm?

710
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,420
You told Ms. Yoon that I got hit
on my palms that one time, didn't you?

711
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,590
Mm-hmm. I went to collect the milk money,

712
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,634
and I mentioned my daughter was hit
by the class president.

713
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,677
She apologized.

714
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,513
She told me that her daughter
was your class president.

715
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,809
- But why didn't you tell me you knew?
- Well, she wanted to keep it a secret.

716
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:29,523
Since she's Sang-yeon's mom and a teacher,
she was hoping to keep those separate.

717
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,443
Promise me you won't
tell anybody about it.

718
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,444
[Eun-jung] Mm-hmm.

719
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,988
Oh, about being hit,

720
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:39,408
Sang-yeon told me she got hit
by Ms. Yoon for hitting me.

721
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,161
- She said that?
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,581
Hey, why don't you both make up

723
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,042
since Sang-yeon's transferring schools
next month anyway.

724
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,961
I can't believe you're telling me
to be friends with Sang-yeon.

725
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,046
[mom] Mm-hmm.

726
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,049
Mmm… this is so good.

727
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,136
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Being friends</i>
<i>with Sang-yeon felt utterly impossible.</i>

728
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,598

730
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,185

734
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,318

735
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,031
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>my desk partner was Son Jun-ho.</i>

736
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,700
[girl] Hey, Eun-jung.

737
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,620
Here.

738
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,167
[adult Eun-jung] <i>Son Jun-ho</i>
<i>was way too popular.</i>

739

[chuckles softly]

740
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,547
Help me, please.
You have to be honest with me, okay?

741
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,176
- Which one of us does Son Jun-ho like?
- [Eun-jung] Hmm.

742
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,680
Not sure, but I… know that it's not you.

743
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,397
Whatever. Can you give this to him?

744
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,284
- Na-mi wanted you to have this.
- [Jun-ho] Ko Na-mi?

745
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,635
[adult Eun-jung] <i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I liked Son Jun-ho too.</i>

746
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,474
Would you like to vote for desk partners?

747
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,270
You'll be saying goodbye
to each other soon. It's such a shame.

748
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,897
No-one wants to?

749
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,358
My class loved the idea.

750
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,694
[girl 1] No, we want to do it too.

751
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,155
- [girl 2] Yeah, me too.
- [girl 3] That sounds really good.

752
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,239
[teacher] Okay.

753
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,367
- [adult Eun-jung] <i>It was fairly simple.</i>
- Jeong-sik?

<i>When it was Jun-ho's turn,</i>

762

<i>Although, it was obvious</i>

- [children] Huh?

- [all] Ooh!

- [boy 1] Eun-jung!
- [laughter]

- [girl 5] Huh?
- [boy 2] Out of nowhere?

770
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,362
Why'd he pick Eun-jung?

771
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,282
- [teacher] Class dismissed.
- [all] Thank you!

[adult Eun-jung] <i>It felt like</i>
<i>everyone's focus turned towards me.</i>

- [girl 6] Like, what?
- [adult Eun-jung] <i>Except for one person.</i>

00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,956
- What is going on?
- You're cute together.

775
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,957
It's nothing.

[adult Eun-jung] <i>After that day,</i>

777
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,799
<i>Cheon Sang-yeon transferred</i>
<i>to the new school that had opened nearby.</i>

778
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,270
Come out a sec.

779
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,492
What? A love letter?

780
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,994
Yeah, the day before she transferred,

781
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,539
Jun-ho gave Sang-yeon
a handwritten love letter.

782
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,626
And Son Jun-ho cried
when he gave it to her.

783
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,336
He cried?

784
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,257
[Na-mi] Like he was in love with her,
and was never gonna see her again.

785
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,467
- Oh…
- [Na-mi] "Oh?"

786
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,680
Hey! Why are you pouting
and just sitting here like this?

787
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,265
What do you mean?

788
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,850
[lively music playing]

789
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,230
[Na-mi] Hey, Jun-ho.

790
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,191
Tell us the truth.

791
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,694
Did you really give a love letter
to Sang-yeon?

792
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,863
- [girl 6] Sang-yeon?
- [girl 7] Love letter?

793
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,489
- [girl 6] He did?
- [girl 7] Really?

794
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,700
- I don't know.
- Is it true or not?

795
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,368
[students murmuring]

796
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,622
- [Jun-ho] I don't have to tell you.
- [Na-mi] What the heck?! Uh, yeah you do.

797
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,875
Because if you gave
Sang-yeon a love letter,

798
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,918
that means that you really liked her.

799
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,421
So why'd you pick Eun-jung
for your desk partner?

800
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,923
Because I wanted to be her desk partner.

801
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,677
[Na-mi] Why would you be desk partners
with Eun-jung when you like someone else?

802
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,639
- Eun-jung likes you so much!
- When did I say that?

803
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,434
[Na-mi] You handwrote
Sang-yeon a love letter.

804
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,936
You're playing with
too many girls' feelings.

805
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,105
Two-timing, ever heard of that?

806
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,234
- Two-timing?
- Why come to our class to pick a fight?

807
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,403
- Not your business!
- Not my business?

808
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,072
What's the problem?
They're desk partners. So what?

809
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,991
[scoffs] You're so dense!

810
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,910
Why'd pick Eun-jung?

811
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,828
Because I was used to it.

812
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,789
It was the most comfortable
because we were already desk partners.

813
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,208
So you didn't choose her
because you liked her or anything?

814
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,795
Are you saying Eun-jung's a pushover?!

815
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,299
Yeah? So what if he did?
Why are you being so dramatic?

816
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,468
[girl 8] What did you say? "Dramatic"?

817
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,639
[Na-mi] Hey! Eun-jung's not just some toy!

818
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,817
- [girls] Hello.
- [Ms. Yoon] Mm-hmm.

819
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,111
- Hello.
- [Ms. Yoon] Hi, there.

00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,571

<i>I couldn't ever reach them.</i>

833

She wants to meet.
She has something to say.

I remember when
I pulled the mom card on you.

Back in those days, whenever you were mad,

892
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,512
I'd talk about my mom.

893
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,724
