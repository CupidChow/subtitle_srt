I think we should share our progress.

- Small meeting room in ten minutes?
- Okay.

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm going to make some tea.
Would you like any?

Oh, hey.

00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,880
- Oh, what! [chuckles]
- [Hee-jin and Yu-chan laugh]

20

- I'm sending the detailed budget plan now.
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,185
Oh, I've got a good feeling.

23
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,231
Considering they didn't even wanna meet,
it went so smoothly thanks to you.

24
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,565
[chuckles] That's great.

25
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,028
- [Kim] Hey, how do you know Gang Cheol?
- [man] Producer Cheon, are you two close?

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,489
I wouldn't say we're close. [chuckles]

27
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,492
[Hee-jin] <i>Wow. Her social skills</i>
<i>are genuinely impressive.</i>

28
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,162
We're the only ones still being cold
to her. Everyone else has warmed up.

29
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,914
She's changed.

30
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,500
She was never this social
back in our school days.

31
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,293
Now she's extremely social.

32
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,671
Why give her control over the sets?

33
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,048
I didn't give her control.

34
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,926
I'm just testing the waters
during preproduction.

35
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,720
And Director Gyeong probably
prefers having her around.

36
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,933
- The budget is still under my control.
- That's none of my concern.

37
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,811
- Who will I end up reporting to?
- Report to both of us.

38
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,772
But that's just for show.
Usually one ends up a figurehead. Right?

39
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,482
[Hee-jin] Yu-chan does have a point.

40
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,819
The most important thing you need to have
is someone influential backing you up,

41
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,529
like the director or maybe the lead actor.

42
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,699
- Then you'll be all set.
- All right, then. I'll be the figurehead.

43
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,451
Especially if the director
plans on supporting her.

44
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,536
She finally gets it.

45
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,372
She's messing with us.
Just look at her face.

46
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,833
You really think
she wants to be in charge?

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,169
- You're right.
- [Hee-jin chuckles]

48
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,045
I think she'd rather die instead.

49
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,173
- To Ryu Eun-jung. She's back!
- You know it.

50
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,133
- [Yu-chan] All right, cheers!
- [Hee-jin] Cheers.

Is that right?

53
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:05,018
For a producer to hand over their project,
after all that time and effort,

54
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,853
it's like giving your kid away.

55
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,983
- Well, I'm glad she stayed on the project.
- I am, too, to be honest.

56
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,360
But I worry about her, you know?

57
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,697
<i>Good Man </i>will be directed
by Gyeong Seung-ju.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,032
I didn't know.

59
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,534
Apparently, he forced
Producer Ryu to coproduce

60

with this producer Cheon Sang-yeon.

61
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,122
Cheon Sang-yeon?

62
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,667
[Hee-jin] Do you know why
he brought her over?

63
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,835
Hmm… No.

64
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,005
They're together.

65
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,551
- What?!
- Weren't you two close friends?

66
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,346
How have you not heard?
Everyone's talking about it.

67
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,389
Someone said they were seen
holding hands and stuff

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,183
two years ago at the Venice Film Festival.

69
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,143
[Hee-jin] Gyeong Seung-ju is a joke.

70
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,938
He's always declaring
his love for his wife so publicly

71
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,773
during his acceptance speeches.

72
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,567
- And then he messes around.
- [Yu-chan] I know, right?

73
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,863
[Eun-jung] Yikes.

[Sang-yeon] So, what's going on?
Aren't you leaving in ten minutes?

78

Lim Ju-ho has decided
to go with Choi Jang-hun.

79
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,507

I thought he had turned it down.

80
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,259

82
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,389
Mr. Jeong suggested
Shin Gyu-min as an option.

[scoffs] Shin Gyu-min? Are you serious?

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,644
[chuckles softly] Or Kim Sang-hak.

85
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,399
He was initially going to be
the cinematographer.

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,193
- On <i>Good Man</i>? He was?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,738
And he's not just a cinematographer.
He also draws storyboards.

88
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,242
Mr. Jeong showed me a few he had,
and… they're not half bad.

89
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,621
Well, I think we should keep looking.

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,041
Why? I assumed you'd be on board with it.

91
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961

I'm sensing there's more going with him.

94
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,681
[chuckles softly] He was in my college
photography club back in the day.

95
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,475
Was he some kind of bad guy?

96
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,062
Not at all. And he was
quite talented even back then.

97
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,565
Oh, yeah? What is it, then?

98
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,989
Let's just look a little more
and then choose.

99
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,746
[chuckles softly] What's with that look,
like you know what's going on?

100

[scoffs] What do you know?

102
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,796
You behaving like this
is the reason people are gossiping.

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,799
- What are they saying?
- That we're seeing each other.

104
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,926
They're not particularly wrong.

105

over the next week.

Nothing significant, but there are
a few elements I'd like to refine.

[Jeong clears throat] Of course.
As you should. [chuckles]

115

worked together as a team?

116

we meet each other?

117

What were you, 22 then?

118
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,393
[Sang-yeon] Winter of 2003.

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,686
[Seung-ju] I was an assistant director.

120
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,607
We were shooting in the middle of winter,
but there wasn't even a drop of snow!

121
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,443
That's right.
The CGI back then wasn't very good.

122
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,112
We had to throw salt all the time!

123
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,864
Exactly. We had to hire
four part-time PA's just for that.

124
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,699
One sprinkled the salt so well,

125
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,910
I introduced her
to the production company.

126
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
What about college?

127
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,872
I dropped out.

[Jeong] So, in other words,
Producer Cheon's a natural, huh?

131
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,888
I've decided that I'll meet
with Kim Sang-hak first.

132
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,394
I thought you decided
you were going with Lim Ju-ho instead?

he was talented even back in college.

was meant for the guy!

Why is he playing hard to get?

170
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,489
I'll look into other options.

171
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,577
[Jeong] Not yet.
Just get him to come here at least.

172
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,537
We'll let Gyeong Seung-ju deal with him.

173
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,206
If you can't even get a meeting,

174
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,667
how do you think that makes me look
to Director Gyeong?

175
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,336
I'll get him in.

176
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,176
[Sang-yeon] You have a minute?
I wanna discuss the budget.

177
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,637
Okay, I'll see you in there.
I just need to make a call.

178
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,599
[outgoing call ringing]

179
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,484
[voice mail]<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed is unavailable.</i>

180
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,241
[Sang-yeon] I hear
Sang-hak doesn't want the project.

181
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,869
Why?

182
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,038
Is he on another shoot?

183
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,626
He just, um… wants to take a break.

184
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,879
Did <i>he </i>say that?
Are you sure I'm not the reason?

185
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,513
[sighs softly]

186
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,476
Do you really

187
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,687
want him as our cinematographer?

188
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,316
[Sang-yeon] Mm-hmm.

189
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,109
He's good at it.

190
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,614
You always let your personal feelings
interfere with your work?

191
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,412
You wanted to talk about the budget?

192
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,539
[Sang-yeon sighs]

193
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,291
[papers rustling]

194
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,172
Is this your first time
doing budgeting, or…?

195
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,384
[tense music playing]

196
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,970
[scoffs] Why? Is there a problem with it?

197
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,180
More than just one.

198
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,433
I get you haven't had time to apply
the changes for the director switch,

199
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,726
but there are other issues.

200
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,936
For instance,

201
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,064
did you investigate unit costs
for equipment, labor, and VFX already?

202
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,985
Not specifically for this project,

203
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,905
but I did reference the budgets
of <i>The Rescue </i>and <i>The Strongest</i>--

204
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>The Rescue </i>was last year.
And <i>The Strongest, </i>a year earlier.

205
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,953
Do you have any clue
how much unit cost has risen?

206
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,416
Also, the costs for making the miniatures
and voice actors

207
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,042
weren't even in the budget.

208
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,391
- You're right.
- [sighs]

209
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,354
I've never worked
with a budget this large.

210
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,942
If there are more things I'm missing,
let me know.

211
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,195
Yeah, I've also noticed there are
only two cars for the crash scene--

212
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,073
- I'll make sure we have three.
- No, four, at least.

213
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,536
Your error was thinking car explosions
can be shot in just one take.

214
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,330
A scene of that magnitude
has too many variables.

215
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,999
So we have to plan accordingly.

216
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,710
The explosion alone
will need three of the four cars.

217
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,130
Also, your budget for VFX
was based on partnering with Aspect.

218
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,215
[voice fading] We won't actually
be using them.

219
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,887
[tense music fades]

220
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,474
[uneasy music playing]

221
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,063
[Eun-jung] <i>It's not like</i>
<i>I just threw it together.</i>

222
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,526
<i>It took me an entire week</i>
<i>to create this budget plan.</i>

223
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,324
<i>Even after all these years,</i>

224
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>I still don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever be able to beat you.</i>

225
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,708
[cell phone vibrating]

226
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,003
CINEMATOGRAPHER KIM SANG-HAK

227
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,217
Hey, Sang-hak. [clears throat]

228
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,970
Yeah.

229
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,766
[Sang-hak] <i>A meeting?</i>

230
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,897
Uh, yes, But, just try to think of it
as a casual outing instead.

231
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,191
Don't feel like
you have to take the project.

232
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,528
And you'd look bad if I didn't go, huh?

233
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,489
Well, um,

234
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,282
kinda.

235
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
Let's do Tuesday.

236
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,165
Okay, great. Thanks. I'll shoot you a text
once the location's been confirmed.

237
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,583
Okay.

238
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,254
Oh, by the way, apparently,
Sang-yeon will be there as well.

239
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,965
I just figured I should let you know.

240
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,717
I know. I heard you two are coproducing.

241
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>Director Joo already told me.</i>

242
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,933
Oh. Oh, I see.

243
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,188
[clears throat] Okay,
I'll see you at the meeting.

244
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,707
Oh. He's here.

245
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,837
I didn't realize you'd already be here.

246
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,381
There was no traffic.
I'm Gyeong Seung-ju. Good to meet you.

247
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,049
Nice to meet you, Kim Sang-hak.

248
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,678
It's been ages, Sang-hak.

249
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,139
Quite a while.

250
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,057
- Have a seat.
- Ah.

251
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,981
So, I hear you two were
in the same photography club.

252
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,232
Ah, yeah.

253
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,735
Producer Ryu Eun-jung was as well.

254
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,777
[Seung-ju] Really?

255
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,363
So you all know each other?

256
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
[knocking on door]

257
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,663
I wonder how Producer Ryu
is doing in her meeting.

258
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,833
If Kim Sang-hak turned down the position,

259
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,586
why did Mr. Jeong push them
to do this meeting today?

260
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,547
You don't want him to change his mind.

261
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,465
Huh?

262
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,383
- You heard me.
- Oh, whatever.

263
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,635
[elevator chimes]

264
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,971
Go after her while you still can.

265
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,432
Otherwise, you'll end up regretting it.

266
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,850
Regret? Yeah, right.

267
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,277
[Seung-ju] Loved what you did
on <i>Wasteland. </i>Amazing camera work.

268
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,612
[Sang-hak] Thank you, sir.

269
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,824
I saw the storyboards too.
They said that you drew those?

270
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,620
Oh. Well, I'm not really good at drawing,
but it's just easier for me.

271
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,747
[Seung-ju] I have so many questions,
but let's start

272
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,207
with that long car chase scene.

273
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,501
- How did you do it?
- [Sang-hak chuckles]

274
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,670
[Seung-ju] I must've watched that scene
a dozen times,

275
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,047
and still couldn't figure out
how it was accomplished.

276
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,132
- The storyboards were different.
- [Sang-hak# Yeah.

277
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,594
Basically, the director wanted
one continuous shot for the scene

278
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,596
from the very beginning, and so did I.

279
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,933
However, when it came to the storyboards,
I just couldn't…

280
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,852
I couldn't come up with a way
to film the entire thing all at once.

281
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,104
[Seung-ju] But…

282
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,899
[Eun-jung] <i>Sang-yeon's eyes</i>
<i>were completely fixated on him.</i>

283
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
<i>As if the conversation became</i>
<i>white noise in the background.</i>

284
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
[Sang-hak] So it was then that I began
exploring alternative approaches.

285
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,200
But the issue was
that there simply wasn't enough space

286
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,954
to position the camera, given
how compact the car interior was. So…

287
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,040
- [Seung-ju] You got rid of the hardtop?
- [Sang-hak] Exactly.

288
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,709
[Sang-hak and Seung-ju chuckle]

289
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,962
[Seung-ju] Looks like
I found my guy, yeah?

290
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,506
Look forward to working with you.

291
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,385
[Sang-hak] Director Gyeong…

292
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,268
So, why'd you refuse the offer?

293
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,063
I told you already.

294
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,817
I just feel a little burnt out.
That's really it.

295
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,362
But you would've been okay
with Director Joo?

296
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,322
[Sang-hak] Yeah, because…

297
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,287
Well… the script was
way too good to turn down.

298
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,710
Sang-hak?

299
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,297
Are you uncomfortable with Sang-yeon?

300
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,342
Well, it's not easy.

301
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,096
But… it's not about Sang-yeon.

302
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,973
It's just the situation.

303
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,562
- Taking a taxi?
- Mm-hmm. And you?

304
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,439
The bus.

305
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,900
Well, all right.
Let's head to the bus stop.

306
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,614
[Seung-ju] I just don't understand.

307
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,162
- I think it's because Director Lee--
- But he agreed to work with Joo.

308
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,624
So what's the reason?

309
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,004
If he didn't mention a reason,
there isn't one.

310
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
[car horn honks]

311
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,424
[car slowing]

312
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,134
[Eun-jung] Oh? It's Yu-chan.

313
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,518
- Did you work late?
- Uh-huh.

314
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,062
Oh.

315
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,773
This is Kim Sang-hak.
He's a cinematographer.

316
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm Song Yu-chan. JD Entertainment.

317
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,445
Nice to meet you. Kim Sang-hak.

318
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,744
That's an unusually long handshake.

319
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,164
- [Yu-chan] Do you have a ride?
- Taxi.

320
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,041
Ah. Oh, how lucky.

321
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
Taxi! Taxi!

322
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,589
Enjoy your ride, then.

323
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,634
Okay, thanks. Get home safe, all right?

324
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,804
Oh, she will.
I'm gonna take extra care of her.

325
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,860
- What was that?
- [Yu-chan] You heard me.

326
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,614
Please, get in.

327
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,952
[scoffs softly]
Why are you acting so weird?

328
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,413
Uh, Mok-dong Street.

329
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,958
[sighs]

330
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,711
[chuckles]

331
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,629
Yu-chan dropped you off at home?

332
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,923
He's such a weirdo! [chuckles]

333
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,343
- He said he was just going for a drive.
- [snickers] He said what?

334
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,971
- [both chuckle]
- Did he even work late yesterday?

335
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,807
There he is.
Ask him yourself. See ya later.

336
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,518
- [Yu-chan] Hi.
- I'm heading out.

337
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,937
- Where are you headed? I just got here.
- Budget planning.

338
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,481
[chuckles] What, again?
You're not taking a smoke break?

339
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,275
Hey, I could use a smoke break.

340
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,694
Yu-chan, come smoke
and have a little chat.

341
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,739
- Let's go up.
- [Yu-chan] Okay. Only today though.

342
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,033
[tense music playing]

343
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,621
So, basically,
Director Gyeong has expressed

344
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,456
he really wants to work with you.

345
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,667
Even more so
ever since he met you the other day.

346
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,467
Uh, and if you do work with him,

347
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,177
you'll see he's a good director.

348
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,386
Open-minded too.

349
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,057
I have a feeling
you would connect artistically.

350
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,393
You came here for nothing.

352
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,652
Well, is it

353
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,488
because I'm working on it?

354
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,824
Because you're uncomfortable with me?

355
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,537
Why bother denying it?
That's the only thing that changed.

356
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,041
Anyway, if that is the reason,
don't worry.

357
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,295
I'll make myself scarce…
and you can focus on shooting.

358
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,089
Why would you have to do that?

359
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,341
It's not like that.

360
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,386
I'd appreciate it
if you could tell director Gyeong

361
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,304
I hope to work together in the future.

362
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,266
[sighs heavily] Sang-hak--

363
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,559
[Sang-hak] I have to excuse myself
for another meeting.

364
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,938
[sighs] Good luck to you.

365
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,740

367
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,762
[Jeong] Come on, seriously?
How worn out can he be?

368
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,347
You sure he won't do it?

369
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,309
[sighs] Shin Gyu-min it is, then.
We have no other choice now.

370
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,019
I'll try to speak with the director.

371
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,687
[Jeong] It's like we can't catch a break.

372
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,940
[Cho sighs] These young guns
have some kinda balls.

373
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,320
Doesn't he realize turning us down
could put him on our blacklist?

374
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,117
[woman, muffled]
See you tomorrow.

375
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,577
[man, muffled] Have a good night.

376
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,413
Shin Gyu-min…

377
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,761
[page turning]

378
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,358
[Sang-hak] <i>It was important to me</i>
<i>to execute that scene well.</i>

379
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,694
<i>After all, it is my job</i>
<i>to bring the director's vision to life.</i>

380
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,656
<i>So, it was then that I began</i>
<i>exploring alternative approaches.</i>

381
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,355
What's going on? Why are you hesitating?

382
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,732
You wanted to talk, right?

383
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,532
Let's work on this project together.

384
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,287
I looked over your storyboard
for <i>Wasteland.</i>

385
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,915
I want <i>Good Man</i>

386
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,751
to have the best chance possible.

387
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,422
And I believe no other cinematographer
could capture its essence

388
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,673
as brilliantly as you.

389
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,467
I get that you want time off,

390
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,304
and that it might be uncomfortable
to see both me and Sang-yeon again.

391
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:55,100
But I… hope you'll reconsider
and take on this project.

392
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,604
Okay.

393
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,693
["Home" playing]

394
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,862
Yeah? Happy?

395
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,657
Yes.

396
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,034
[Sang-hak chuckles softly]

397
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,746
I'll give it all I've got, Producer Ryu.

[car horn honks]

402
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,158
[Seung-ju] As expected, Cheon Sang-yeon.

403
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,161
When someone needs convincing,
you're the best in the biz.

404
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,497
I didn't do it, actually.
It was Producer Ryu.

405
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,373
Oh yeah? Why didn't you go?

406
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,003
I did. And he wasn't biting at all, so…

407
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,966
Was he… closer to Producer Ryu
than you back in college?

408
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,515
- Where should storyboarding go down?
- Apparently so.

409
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,558
We don't have time! Where--

410
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,145
Clearly, we're doing it here.
Guess we'll see some fun interactions.

411
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,649
When should we do the script meeting?
When would you like?

412
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,317
[tense music playing]

413
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,198
[sighs]

414
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,659
It's that bad, huh?

415
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,956
Yeah, apparently, Director Gyeong thinks
we're shooting an action film here.

416
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,460
Why are you going over it again?

417
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,798
Put it down. It's time for lunch.
Come eat something.

418
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,925
[Eun-jung sighs]

419
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,593
[Hee-jin] Let's go.

420
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,973
[Yu-chan] Mmm!

421
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,684
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

422
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,731
You're pretty deep in thought
over your lunch there.

423
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,358
Two o'clock script meeting.

424
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,362
[Yu-chan] That's too much.
She's acting like she wrote this thing.

425
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,876
GOOD MAN
PRODUCTION OFFICE

426
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,254
- [Seung-ju] Come in, Producer Ryu.
- Good afternoon.

427
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,507
[Seung-ju] I heard that you convinced
Mr. Kim to come aboard. Nice work.

428
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,842
Oh, it's no big deal.

429
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,512
Well, how did you all feel
about the script?

430
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,599
I think the new draft definitely feels
more dynamic and fast-paced.

431
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,018
- Anything worth reviewing?
- Mm-mm. Not at all.

432
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,728
Producer Ryu?

433
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,356
Uh… I agree that the action scenes
are much more engaging now.

434
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,568
However, in reviewing
the scenes you decided to delete,

435
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:55,238
I do think we should perhaps consider
putting back the latter part of scenes.

436
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,782
Forty-five and seventy-two.
They're important.

437
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,994
Scene 45.

438
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,289
- Let's see, scene 45…
- [clears throat]

439
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,334
I think it slows down the overall plot.

440
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,918
Mm-hmm. I do too.

441
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,714
Uh… but I feel like
if we remove that scene,

442
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,925
it's possible the audience
won't be convinced as to why Su-jin

443
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,720
goes on to defy her superior
and team up with Tae-o.

444
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,474
Why wouldn't it convince them?

445
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,267
I think it's totally convincing.

446
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,270
Then how will you clarify
that Su-jin is actually Kyeong-eun,

447
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,439
and that when she was growing up
in the orphanage,

448
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,149
she and Tae-o depended on each other?

449
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,068
None of that shit matters to anyone.

450
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,990
[uneasy music playing]

451
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,078
What's important to you, then?

452
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,247
The fact that they were acquainted
in their childhood is irrelevant.

453
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,542
All that matters is
how they execute their revenge on K.

454
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,513
I think that what stays with the audience
in any film

455
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,390
are the emotions that are evoked.

456
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,560
Whether it be despair or happiness,
fear or catharsis,

457
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,979
the audience feels them vicariously
through the characters.

458
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,148
The audience will connect
with the protagonist

459
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,650
if the plot is plausible enough.

460
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,277
No. Emotional connections
need a proper buildup.

461
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,615
For example, the scene in <i>Titanic</i>
when Jack sacrifices his life for Rose.

462
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,659
To your point,
that moment would've been impactful

463
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,246
even if they were strangers,
as he demonstrates an act of selflessness.

464
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,624
To my point, the reason the audience
connects so empathetically to that scene

465
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,918
is because they've witnessed
the entire love story

466
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,002
between the two unfold.

467
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,003
Titanic's a romance.

468
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,589
According to your terms,
it's a disaster flick.

469
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,383
[uneasy music playing]

470
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,638
And it's the same principle
with this scene.

471
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,101
Think about the overwhelming sadness
Su-jin has when Tae-o dies at the end.

472
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,982
Can you still dismiss this scene
as unimportant, knowing all this?

473
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,113
Even if we shoot it,
it'll probably still be cut in the end.

474
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,407
Either way, it's just my opinion,

475
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,034
and the final call
is ultimately yours, Director.

476
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,122
That's my cue to speak.

477
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,961
Let's go with Producer Ryu's suggestion.
What was the other scene you mentioned?

478
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,505
Uh… scene 72.

479
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,090
[Seung-ju] Scene 72…

480
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,638
- ["Color Palette" playing]
- Uh!

481
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,266
I feel alive again! [laughs]

482
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,934
- Hey! You're the best!
- Ah!

483
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,395
I was so nervous,
I thought I'd die. [chuckling]

484
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,857
[chuckles] Sounds like it was brutal,
but your face says you won.

485
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,110
We weren't boxing or anything, all right?

486
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,238
There were no winners or losers.
And Gyeong Seung-ju's cool!

487
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,323
- Oh yeah?
- Who knew!

488
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,866
He's pretty fair and understanding!

489
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,118
[Seung-ju] She's smart, that one.

490
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,913
And that's why Mr. Jeong wants
to keep her on his team.

491
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,958
Why did you do that? You clearly thought
Producer Ryu was raising a good point.

492
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,670
Well, I thought
I made good sense too, sir.

493
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,755
So what happened there?

494
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,216
Did you have a falling out,
or were you always rivals?

495
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,635
[Sang-yeon] Our script meeting's
at 1:00 tomorrow.

496
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,850
[Eun-jung] <i>So, what's your asking price?</i>

497
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,186
Well, "a lot" would be great.

498
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,063
[chuckles softly] Set your price.

499
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,649
You go first.

500
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,609
[Eun-jung clears throat]

501
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,402
Okay, so, yeah.

502
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,031
Apparently, according to your contract,
you've done one low-budget feature and…

503

[Hee-jin inhales sharply]

504
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,159
Maybe I didn't read the room.

505
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,162
Not upset that I'm here, are you?

506
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,580
[chuckles] Not at all!

507
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,207
[Eun-jung] Don't worry about her.

508
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,585
She's messing with you because she knows
we went to college together.

509
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,045
So, are you single?

510
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,049
[chuckles] I don't have a girlfriend.

511
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:47,053
[Hee-jin] Hmm. I guess
I'm the only one who's spoken for here.

512
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,185
Oh! Mr. Kim, you're here early.

513
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,521
[Sang-hak] Just going over
my contract terms.

514
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,566
Ah. Land yourself a killer deal?
Negotiation's my forte.

- See you after lunch.
- Yeah. Enjoy, sir.

517
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,529
[Eun-jung] Have a good lunch.

518
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,536
So, then, do you have
a boyfriend, Producer Oh?

519
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,664
Yep, he's a director.
He's pretty big in the indie circuit.

520
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,999
[Seung-ju] I'll have <i>doganitang.</i>

521
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,210
[Eun-jung] Mm-hmm. But he's essentially
anonymous to the major studios.

522
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,130
Cinematographers are the exception though.
They actually earn good money.

523

[all chuckle]

524
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,094
[Eun-jung] I can't understand
his need to be so experimental. [giggling]

525
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,100
Why sit out here?
You could've waited in my office.

526
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,145
- [Sang-hak] Oh, that's okay!
- Oh, allow me to introduce you two.

527
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,272
Kim Sang-hak is our cinematographer.

528
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,649
And this is Producer Song,
he's one of our line producers.

529
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,777
I look forward
to working with you, Mr. Kim.

530
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,238
Likewise, Producer Song. Me too.

531
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,782

You finished the storyboard?

535
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,504
Only the opening scene.

536
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,423
I drew some of the moments
that came to mind.

537
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,382
[Seung-ju] Oh.

538
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,518
I like this idea, really great. Yeah.

544
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,513
I like you.

545
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,435
Is this a joke?

546
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,104
I mean, we're… we're at work!

547

I don't care where we are. I'm serious.

548

I've had feelings for you for a long time.

549

I like you.

550

You're insane.

551
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,668
I think we should finalize everything
before we share this.

552
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,627
Okay.

553
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,977

Wow, this director of photography…

558
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,254
[Jeong] Is he not working out?

559

This guy has fresh ideas every day.

560
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,051
I bet most directors
just lean on his expertise.

561
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,345
[Jeong] Oh wow! He's that good, huh?
How far into the script did he get?

562
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,723
[Seung-ju] He's finished
a third of it, I believe?

563
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,640
Yes.

564
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,434
[Jeong] He's a machine!

565
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,227
May I take a peek now?

566
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,563
[Seung-ju] No.
You can see it when we're done.

Where's the director? Is he gone?

569
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,160
He's out for dinner
with the production designer.

570
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,540
The director specifically told me
not to show anyone--

571

I'm your boss. Get outta here!

572

- Yes, he'll meet me at the parking lot.

[Seung-ju] Hmm?

Mm-hmm. College sweethearts.

- Yeah.

591
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,764
And I had crush on him.

[Sang-yeon] I did. Ambiguously.
