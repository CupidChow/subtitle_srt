[tense music playing]

00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,637
[Sang-yeon] Eun-jung…

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,018
you can live without him just fine.

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,358
And I have no one.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,277
So, please.

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,280
Could you not see him?

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,368
What's… with you?

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,329
Promise me you won't see him again.

9
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,211
You're acting really strange.

10
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,131
I've never seen you like this before.

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,552
- You're not being reason--
- I was interested in him first, Eun-jung.

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,059
[tearfully] If it hadn't been for you,
I would've approached him

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,352
whether he already had
a girlfriend or not.

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,440
But I just couldn't do that to you.

15
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,778
'Cause you were more important.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,326
It's been ten years.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,997
You've had plenty of time
to tell him how you feel.

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,502
After all this time…
you're still blaming me.

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,799
[sobs] Do you have any idea

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,384
what it took for me to hold off?

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,683
Then he's back in my life 'cause of you,
so why do you have to intervene now, huh?

22
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,810
Why?

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,479
You're doing this to yourself.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,817
Now, and back in college.

25
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,194
It was always you.

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,366
You were the one
who wanted us all to work together.

27
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,202
- It was your idea.
- [Sang-yeon] So?

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,458
Are you going to rekindle things?

29
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,710
I'm not answering that.

30
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,924
Eun-jung!

31
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,717
But you're a nice pers--

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,386
- I'm done being nice!
- [sobbing]

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,764
Why should I?

34
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,143
Is this your idea of being nice?

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,021
- Is that what you expect?
- Call it what you want.

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,235
I don't care if you do it out of pity,
just please don't see Sang-hak anymore.

37
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,362
Except, I don't pity you for a second.

38
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,826
What you're doing now, it's not love.

39
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,036
[Sang-yeon sniffles]

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,955
It's obsessive and borderline crazy.

41
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,001
[wails] I know I'm crazy, all right?
Everything you're saying is true.

42
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,880
So I'm begging you, please don't
rekindle your relationship. Please!

43
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,091
[sobbing]

[music softens]

45
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,729
Get it together, Cheon Sang-yeon.

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,943
Whatever Sang-hak and I decide…

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,739
is none of your business.

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,950

YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

[Eun-jung] <i>What you're doing now,</i>
<i>it's not love.</i>

61
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,993
It's obsessive and borderline crazy.

<i>You even have a loving mom.</i>

65
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,786
But I have nothing.

66
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,956
<i>So please,</i>

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>could you not see him?</i>

[music fades]

69
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,805
Sang-hak.

70
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,566
Listen…

71
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,196
I don't think I can do this.

72
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,172
I mean, I can understand why…

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,720
I also thought it would be nice

74
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,473
if our paths had crossed first.

75
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,270
At first I didn't want to admit to--

76
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,147
I almost said yes.

77
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,692
I'm sorry, but I can't.

78
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,818
[Sang-hak] Eun-jung.

79
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,241
You don't have to explain.

80
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,371
I completely understand.

81
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,417
[solemn music playing softly]

82
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,836
I already knew you would say that.

83
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,798
But I still have feelings for you,
and I may have…

84
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,011
put you in a difficult situation.

85
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,680
You didn't.

86
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,391
[tender music playing]

87
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,852
I am sorry about

88
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,230
having to turn you down. Really.

89
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,567
But I'm glad I said it. What a relief.

90
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,615
I feel like I can move on now, finally.

91
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,035
[Eun-jung] Mm-hmm.

92
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,082
- Where are you headed to now?
- To go check equipment.

93
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,168
- Headed back to the office?
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,003
[Sang-hak inhales slowly, sighs]

95
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,171
Producer Ryu,

96
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,133
I look forward to us
working together comfortably now.

97
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,385
[chuckles] Of course.

98
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm looking forward to it too, Mr. Kim.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,769
- Until then.
- See ya.

100
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,825
Producer Ryu, hello.

101
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,411
[Yu-chan] Hi.

102
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,082
- Where's Ho-cheol?
- [Hyeon-ju] He went to the restroom.

103
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,834
Should we start the simulation
meeting in ten minutes, then?

104
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,169
[Yu-chan] Sounds good.

105
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,213
[papers rustling]

106
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,386
- Are you good with that, Producer Cheon?
- Hello?

107
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,013
Ah, yes, hello.

108
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,182
- Yes.
- [Yu-chan] Did something happen?

109
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,398
So for the fifth day,
we've changed the standby location.

110
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,485
Hmm. The standby area
and the parking lot are kind of far apart.

111
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,071
No reason to worry.
A little distance is still better

112
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,448
than being in the public eye
while they're on break.

113
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,829
Did the assistant director say
when the actors' call time will be?

114
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,039
7:30, so we can shoot by 9:00.

115
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,958
7:00 for Seung-jae
since he's always late.

116
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,045
Hmm, but taking this approach from day one
could cause issues down the road.

117
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,883
I agree with that. Let's just have him
come in at 7:30.

118
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,884
Okay.

119
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,139
What time does the director
come to set, usually?

120
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,230
- Producer Cheon?
- Day six.

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,693
Can we move on?

122
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,489
- [Yu-chan] Okay so… day six, then?
- [Sang-yeon] Yes.

123
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,575
- [Yu-chan] Okay.
- [papers rustling]

124
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,953
Great work, everyone.

125
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,289
- [woman 1] Thank you.
- [woman 2] Great meeting.

126
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,708
Can we talk?

127
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,004
I have another meeting.

128
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,465
[sighs]

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,802
[father] I swear,

130
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,848
I never told that cheapskate
to invest his money.

131
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,268
He practically begged me to be included.

132
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,896
Things went south.
He's suing me for no reason.

133
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,482
How much did you scam him out of?

134
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,566
I didn't scam--

135
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,820
[father sighs]

136
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,282
120 million.

137
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,704
It's not like I need all of it.

138
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,791
Just 80 million.

139
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,543
[Sang-yeon sighs]

140
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,464
You're in a large company.

141
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,551
That should be easy for you to get, right?

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,015
It's not worth stressing over.
I'm stronger than you think.

143
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,352
I'll get back on my feet
and repay you in full, you'll see.

144
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,853
[slides paper onto table]

[solemn music playing]

147
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,007
Sure, okay.

148
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,593
In exchange…

149
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,889
I don't wanna see you ever again.

150
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,809
Of course. I mean,

151
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,270
this is the last time, I swear.

152
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,229
[clunking]

153
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,403
Sang-yeon.

154
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,781
- [groans] These shoes are new, damn it.
- [scoffs]

155
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey, Sang-yeon.

156
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,745
When can I expect the money?

157
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,791
[sighs] They're already scratched.

158
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,548
Where did you get the money
for your new shoes?

159
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,845
I'm surprised she didn't say anything.

160
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,808
She said that she was your coworker.
She had really light skin.

161
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,896
[Sang-yeon sighs]

162
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,815
And you took her money?

163
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,196
Tell me you didn't.

164
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,157
[father sniffles]

165
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,534
[Sang-yeon sighs heavily]

166
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,833
[music fades]

167
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,336
[Eun-jung] You're pretty busy in there.
What're you doing?

168
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,379
Oh, just thought I'd brew some tea.

169
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,048
- [tea pouring]
- [sets pot down]

170
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,134
Needed something to do.
But you're the one who looks busy.

171
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,805
Oh, but I brought you this coffee.

172
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,933
Oh, you know,
tea's really been growing on me.

173
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,268
[chuckles] I'll drink this instead.

174
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,564
- Oh.
- Did you say shooting starts in two days?

175
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,691
[uneasy music playing]

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,403
So, Yeong-seo met Jae-han
prior to Min-ju, from a music club

177
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,573
through a PC chat service
during her middle school years. Hmm.

178
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,580
- Director Joo…
- [Joo] Yes?

179
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,292
Did you meet with Producer Cheon?

180
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,006
Oh. Yeah, she came to me a few days ago.

181
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>I think she was worried that I wouldn't</i>
<i>attend the ritual.</i>

182
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,390
[chuckles] <i>Honestly, she was a lot nicer</i>
<i>than I was expecting.</i>

183
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>And she was full of ideas too.</i>

184
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,313
[music fades]

185
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,865
[car horn honks]

186
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,491
[turn signal clicking]

187
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,123
Here's a million won.

188
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,923
Why would you involve yourself

189
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,301
with my personal business?

190
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,012
You know how much I hate you doing that.

191
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,388
[uneasy music playing]

192
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,182
Going forward, stay out of my affairs.

193
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,312
Trust me, I was planning on it.

194
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,357
I heard you went to Director Joo's studio.

195
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,280
Did you read <i>Treatment</i>?

196
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,324
Yeah.

197
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,328
He e-mailed me, so I had a look at it.

198
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,373
- Without consulting me?
- Should I have done that?

199
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,128
Isn't it obvious?

200
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,131
Accessing a script underhandedly,

201
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,675
especially one that our team leader
hasn't approved of yet,

202
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,843
is crossing the line.

203
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,472
Since he couldn't attend the ritual,
I thought I should visit him,

204
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,182
and it just happened that way.

205
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,519
I wasn't trying to cross any lines.
I'll be more mindful.

206
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,897
[uneasy music intensifies]

207
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,530
[music fades]

208
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,164
- [Seung-ju] And cut!
- [man 1] Cut! Check playback.

209
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,541
- [Seung-ju] Come here a minute.
- [man 2] Checking the scene.

210
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,670
- [woman 1] Thank you.
- Clearly, 7:30 doesn't work for him.

211
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,464
Tell him tomorrow's call time
is seven o'clock.

212
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,299
- Okay.
- No, 30 minutes isn't enough.

213
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,469
- It was close to 8:30 when he got here.
- Ugh, this guy, I swear.

214
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,638
[indistinct muttering]

215
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,142
- [man 3] No photos, please.
- [man 2] No taking pictures!

216
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,441
[Eun-jung] It's an overnight shoot,
so I'll be home late.

217
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,568
[Ms. Jang] Are you going to set
every day now?

218
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,946
No, it's because
we're in the early stages.

219
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,407
Later on, they'll only need me there
for important scenes.

220
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,785
Did you resolve things with Sang-yeon?

221
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,870
[Eun-jung sighs]

222
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
What did you overhear?

223
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,334
Just a little. Through the wall.

224
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,630
You two should make up.
You're not kids anymore.

225
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,674
I have nothing to resolve with her.

226
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,427
People can be stubborn
when they're in trouble sometimes.

227
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,344
Mom!

228
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
Sang-yeon's not in trouble, okay?

229
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,270
You know what?
Don't even mention her around me.

230
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,023
- [door lock beeping]
- [door opens]

231
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,483
- [Ms. Jang sighs]
- [door closes]

232
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,943
[door lock beeping]

233
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,280
Does that mean I can't take out a loan?

234
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,157
You qualify for government-backed loans

235
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,492
like the Sunshine Loan
or Spore of New Hope Loan.

236
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,494
The Sunshine Loan offers
up to ten million won.

237
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,621
The Spore of New Hope, up to 20 million.

238
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,707
[man 1] I tried calling earlier.
I'll go check again.

239
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,459
- [Yu-chan] Okay.
- [man 1] Hi, Producer Ryu.

240
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,670
Is he still not here?

241
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,840
Don't get me started.
I wish I could just tell this guy off.

242
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,508
Is Su-a here?

243
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,137
Of course she is. She's fine,
but any other actress would've lost it.

244
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,056
[vehicle approaching]

245
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,060
Right on time.

246
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
[loud clicking]

247
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,696
- [Seung-ju] Cut. Okay.
- [man 2] Yes. Okay, let's break for lunch.

248
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,074
[man 3] Please have a lovely meal.
We'll come back by 2:00.

249
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,408
[man 4] Yes, sir.

250
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,952
- [man 4] Have a good lunch!
- You're not gonna eat?

251
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
Need to clear my head first.

252
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,253
I should just ask corporate
to reach out instead.

253
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,716
Ah, so this is… about tardiness?

254
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,260
Yeah, that's one thing,
and he booked a commercial

255
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,639
knowing all the villa scenes
are set to be shot back-to-back.

256
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,392
[sighs] I get it.

257
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,979
Well, can I at least… buy you lunch?

258
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,440
- [Seung-ju] No, it's fine.
- [cell phone buzzing]

259
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,275
- I'll leave you be, then.
- Okay.

260
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,693
Yes?

261
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,154
[Sang-yeon sighs]

262
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,073
Ten million won?

263
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,368
Yeah, okay, I'll take the loan, then.

264
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,079
Okay, thanks. You too.

265
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,414
[Seung-ju] That's not
to help your dad, is it?

266
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,794
The right thing to do
would be to cut off all contact.

267
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,673
He's no father if he can't even
buy his daughter a winter coat. [scoffs]

268
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,177
[Sang-yeon sighs]

269
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,304
[pensive music playing]

270
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,815
[Ho-cheol] Uh-huh, yeah. Okay.

271
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,610
- [Eun-jung] What did they say?
- He's coming.

272
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,239
They didn't even tell us the ETA.
Just said, "He's coming," and hung up.

273
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,158
- [scoffs]
- How many scenes today?

274
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,117
- Oh.
- Eight.

275
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,660
Su-a's taking off!

276
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,287
Uh, I'll get Director Gyeong.

277
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,164
- [car engine starting]
- Su-a!

278
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,416
Su-a! Wait, come back!

279
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,876
[tense music playing]

280
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,923
[car door opens, closes]

281
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,594
Excuse me,
Do you realize how late you are?

282
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,680
Who gave out the location address?

283
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,392
I said who the fuck gave out the address?

284
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
I did.

285
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,397
Hey, do you even know
how far I had to go because of you?

286
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,316
I went all the way to Ssangmun-dong.

287
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,318
But I sent a text about the changes.

288
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,530
- Did you not receive my text yesterday?
- So you're saying I'm the wrong one? Huh?

289
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,407
- [Ho-cheol] I clearly--
- You can talk to me.

290
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,076
- Oh, yeah? "Clearly"? Huh?
- Oh, no…

291
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,536
[concerned muttering]

292
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,081
Oh, you <i>clearly </i>did that for me.

293
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,334
So why the hell did I go to Ssangmun-dong?

294
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,294
Shit…

295
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,921
[chuckles nervously]

296
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,840
Did you just curse at me?

297
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,134
No, I didn't.

298
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,011
You little…

299
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,763
[shocked gasping, screaming]

300
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,849
Hit me back if you want.

301
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,976
Hit me back, I said!

302
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,813
[Ho-cheol] What did I do wrong, huh?

303
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,150
Seriously? You little shit!

304
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,276
[screams]

305
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,528
[shocked gasp]

306
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,200
What's this? Let go.

307
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,619
Let go!

308
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,956
What do you think you're doing, Mr. Kim?

309
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,918
[sighs] Let go of him.

310
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,590
You're not the only one
involved in this film.

311
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,801
You should apologize to Ho-cheol.

312
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,514
You gotta be kidding me. [chuckles]

313
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,559
I can't shoot this shit.
My arm fucking hurts.

314
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,021
I'm done for the fucking day, you shit!

315
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,443
You can keep your sorry-ass apology
to yourself, okay?

316
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,654
'Cause I won't forgive or forget.

317
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,786
[Sang-yeon sighs] Seung-jae, talk to me.

318
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,663
[Sang-hak sighs]

319
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,832
Seung-jae.

320
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750
[sighs]

321
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,253
[car engine starts]

322
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,515
[Eun-jung sighs wearily]

323
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,272
[Jeong] Lee Seung-jae's people are asking
for a new director of photography.

324
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,027
What did Director Gyeong say?

325
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,404
He said he won't allow it.

326
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,744
Upper management…
wants Mr. Kim to apologize personally.

327
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,621
But Mr. Kim will never do that.

328
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,958
He never explicitly said that.

329
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,879
He said he's willing to apologize
if Seung-jae apologizes first to Ho-cheol,

330
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,130
or else forget it.

331
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,798
That's basically what I said.

332
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
Lee Seung-jae's being stubborn.

333
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,432
But I'm sure he's feeling
as anxious as we are.

334
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,772
The best course of action would be to find
a… compelling reason to return to the set.

335
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,358
So how are we going to do that,
do you think?

336
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,610
We get Ho-cheol to apologize to him.

337
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,446
[uneasy music playing]

338
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,407
But Ho-cheol's the victim in this.

339
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,993
If he hadn't reacted
to Lee Seung-jae the way he did,

340
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,871
the whole situation
wouldn't have escalated this far.

341
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,333
- So we can find a justifiable reason.
- I won't agree to this.

342
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,253
The vast majority of our difficulties
on set stem from Lee Seung-jae's behavior.

343
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,632
He ignores call times
and just changes his schedule on a whim.

344
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,843
We need to use this opportunity
to address this before it gets worse.

345
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,846
Would he listen to us though?
We don't have enough time either.

346
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,307
Do we know if Ho-cheol
is willing to apologize?

347
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,894
- You can't be serious about this.
- Yes, he feels responsible.

348
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,399
Are you pressuring him
into feeling responsible?

349
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,568
We can't let him apologize,
even if he's willing to do it.

350
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,237
Most of the staff saw what happened.

351
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,614
How would it look to the crew
if Ho-cheol were to apologize,

352
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,950
when Lee Seung-jae
was the one who hit him?

353
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,034
[Sang-yeon] Producer Ryu.

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,832
Who is the most important person
on the payroll?

355
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,214
It's not me, nor you, Producer Ryu.

356
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,717
And in fact,
it isn't even Director Gyeong.

357
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,388
All of us are replaceable.

358
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,558
And Lee Seung-jae isn't.

359
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,229
Without him on the project,
the whole thing would collapse.

360
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,315
If he keeps this up,

361
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,610
he won't be able to finish filming
before going into the military.

362
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,532
Which is why
we gotta settle this right now.

363
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,993
So, uh… will his apology be enough?

364
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,662
- Mr. Jeong.
- [Sang-yeon] We have to make it work.

365
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,998
I'll try to

366
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,417
talk Lee Seung-jae into meeting.

367
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,800
[man 1] That rude bastard.

368
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,720
Let's call it a day.

369
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,597
Everything's canceled tomorrow,

370
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,390
and I don't know when
the next shoot will be.

371
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,475
[woman 1] Seriously?

372
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,937
Ho-cheol agreed to say he's sorry.
I'll keep you posted after it's done.

373
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,564
Wait, why would he apologize?

374
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,735
[Eun-jung] Ho-cheol.

375
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,989
Was it your idea to apologize?

376
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,829
What other choice is there?
I can't let the project get canceled--

377
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,458
Who told you that was going to happen?
It won't be canceled.

378
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,544
It's not your fault.

379
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,380
You're the one
who should be receiving an apology.

380
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,757
[pensive music playing]

381
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,845
[Ho-cheol sighs]

382
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,722
It's frustrating,
but you should get some rest.

383
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,308
I'll just do it.

384
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,394
It's the right thing to do.

385
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,687
Why would you say that?

386
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,691
Once the word gets out,
well… no one will hire me anymore.

387
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,109
I'll hire you.

388
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,113
And plus, there are
a lot of other film sets out there

389
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,241
that are going to need someone like you.

390
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,952
[cell phone buzzes]

391
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,333
[Jeong] <i>Mr. Kim says he'll apologize.</i>

392
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,878
[sighs]

393
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,922
Are you sure about this?

394
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,258
I prefer this over Ho-cheol apologizing.

395
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,387
I just don't think I could continue
working with Lee Seung-jae,

396
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,013
knowing Ho-cheol apologized.

397
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,224
I appreciate this.

398
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,892
[sighs] Don't mention it.

399
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,395
So where do I go tomorrow?

400
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,441
[Ho-cheol] Look at that damn fruit basket.

401
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,444
It's not fair that you're apologizing.
I'm pissed about this.

402
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,781
It's simply a gesture. I gotta go.
Check the equipment thoroughly.

403
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,491
[sighs] Shit…

404
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,706
Welcome, Mr. Kim.

405
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,376
Well, nothing comes easy, right?
[chuckles softly]

406
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,128
Let's go inside, hmm?

407
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,006
This way.

408
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,552
Lee Seung-jae…

409
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,053
Oh, yeah, it's here.

410
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,141
Please wait here for a moment.

411
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,767
Oh, and this…

412
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,103
Let's just say Mr. Kim bought this.

413
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
[chuckles awkwardly]

414
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,987
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

415
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,614
- [game music playing softly]
- [man] Oh.

416
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,952
[video game noises]

417
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,372
[Jeong] Seung-jae,

418
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,708
how's the healing process going?

419
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,712
[man] They want him hospitalized
for two weeks.

420
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,756
[Jeong] What a shame.

421
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,175
Your recovery is our top priority.

422
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,013
But from what I heard, it sounds like
there's been some miscommunication.

423
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,475
Mr. Kim really wants
to apologize, sincerely.

424
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,312
You said you'd have him fired.

425
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,022
[man] Come on, now.

426
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,941
Then you wouldn't wrap the film
before you're drafted.

427
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,860
[Seung-jae] Oh shit.

428
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,529
[tuts] Seeing his face
might be triggering, damn it!

429
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,824
[Jeong] Please just give him
the chance to apologize.

430
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,078
[video game noises continue]

431
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,247
[softly] Let's have him come in at least.

432
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,881
[fruit basket rustling]

433
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,884
[Jeong] Oh! Look at that!

434
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,387
Mr. Kim brought some fruit for ya here!

435
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,055
Oh wow, these look great!

436
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,599
He's gonna need vitamins
to make a quick recovery.

437
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,768
[man] Yeah, these are so ripe. Gorgeous.

438
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,190
[Sang-hak sighs heavily]

439
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,984
I'm sorry, Seung-jae.

440
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,654
I hope you can accept my apology.

441
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,037
[video game noises continue]

442
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,247
[sniffles]

443
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,960
Come on. Mr. Kim's apologizing.
What do you say? Huh?

444
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,089
[video game noises stop]

445
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,049
[sighs heavily]

446
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,678
[Sang-hak] Yes,
I'm sincerely… truly sorry.

447
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,352
- You don't seem sorry at all though.
- [chuckles]

448
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,939
You're laughing?

449
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,692
No, hey, he's just being cordial!
He's really sorry!

450
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,445
[Seung-jae] Who snickers like that
while giving an apology?

451
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,988
That's pretty… interesting.

452
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,450
Get out.

453
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,829
[Seung-jae sighs]

454
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,875
- Seung-jae…
- [footsteps approaching]

455
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,799
<i>Nuna.</i>

456
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,469
I should've been the first
to say sorry to you.

457
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,512
I apologize.

458
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,557
We gave you the wrong information.

459
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,310
Please forgive us.

460
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,771
[Seung-jae] No, you shouldn't be… [sighs]

461
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,150
[Seung-jae sighs]

462
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,070
Thank you for your hard work.

463
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,367
- Well, Mr. Kim, good work.
- Sure.

464
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,827
[Jeong] You too, Producer Cheon.

465
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,291
I'll, uh… catch a cab. Take the car.
You guys are going to the set right?

466
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,631
He said he'll return to set.
That's all that matters. All right?

467
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,967
Lighten up. Producer Ryu, please!
[softly] Start it up, Yu-chan.

468
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,053
Okay. Bye, guys. Good work!

469
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,097
[uneasy music playing]

470
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,016
[car door opening]

471
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,102
[Sang-hak sighs]

472
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,442
[Eun-jung sighs]

473
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,741
I need to speak with you.

474
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,251
Why'd you have to go that far in there?

475
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,878
You should thank me first,
don't you think?

476
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,090
- And why would I do that?
- Sang-hak would've had to if I hadn't.

477
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,134
You couldn't even stand
the idea of Ho-cheol apologizing,

478
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,137
- Could you handle Sang-hak doing it?
- Who apologized doesn't matter.

479
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,807
No one owed him an apology
in the first place!

480
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,102
Seung-jae should've apologized.
So why did you get on your knees?

481
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,186
[Sang-yeon scoffs]

482
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,731
You were okay
with Ho-cheol having to apologize,

483
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,151
but when Sang-hak
was going to apologize, you stepped in?

484
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,236
[Sang-yeon] Mm-hmm.

485
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,823
[tense music playing]

486
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,618
It's a bit unprofessional,
don't you think?

487
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,956
You can't act this way
for anyone's benefit, not even your own.

488
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,084
You need to keep
your feelings to yourself.

489
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,504
I'm not exactly sure what you're saying,
but at least I fix things.

490
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,883
While all you do is just… preach
what's right and wrong from the back.

491
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,634
What exactly did you fix?

492
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,097
What you gave him
was more than a reason to return to set.

493
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,516
You handed him a crown, Sang-yeon.

494
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,477
What you gave him was permission.

495
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,981
To act how he wants, show up late,
and be violent to others,

496
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,400
all without facing any repercussions--

497
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,651
'Cause he's the king.

498
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,570
He's right on top.

499
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,824
Think how much money we lose
every day shooting gets behind.

500
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,911
- [cell phone buzzing]
- [sighs wearily]

501
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,499
You're lucky to have time
to dwell on these trivial things.

502
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,543
Yes, Director Gyeong.

503
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,629
Yes, we're back.

504
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,551
[Seung-ju] Is he really that amazing?

505
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,637
I mean, why would…

506
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,765
Why would you do that
to help him save face?

507
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,104
[sighs heavily] Can't everyone… stop?

508
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,067
Can't you please drop it already?

509
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,069
[Seung-ju] I don't get
why the hell you'd do that.

510
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,780
Sang-yeon doesn't beg
to save her own life.

511
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,781
Precisely.

512
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,370
So maybe you could at least…
recognize the effort I put in?

513
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,248
[sighs]

514
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,336
- [clears throat]
- You don't see him as a man.

515
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,463
A woman who loves her man
would never do what you did.

516
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,756
This is an obsession.

517
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,136
- That's not why you called, is it?
- It's exactly why I called.

518
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,890
It should give you an idea
of how shocked I am. [scoffs]

519
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,562
Next time you see Seung-jae,

520
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,940
greet him with a smile, okay?

521
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,571
- [Seung-ju] A boycott?
- [Yu-chan] The whole crew's on strike.

522
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,992
They're demanding
that… Lee Seung-jae apologizes,

523
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,369
and Producer Cheon
drops out of the project.

524
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,663
[Seung-ju sighs]

525
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,499
They were furious she forced Ho-cheol
to say sorry to Lee Seung-jae

526
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,919
and that Mr. Kim had to step in
and apologize on his behalf.

527
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:25,962
[Seung-ju sighs]

528
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,965
They said first, Lee Seung-jae
should apologize to Ho-cheol.

529
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,051
- And after that, Producer Cheon--
- No, I don't… I don't need an apology.

530
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm sorry.

531
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,806
There's no reason to be sorry.

532
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,308
And… where is the crew right now?

533
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,354
- I can try to speak to them.
- I'll just quit now.

534
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,191
Then,

535
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,902
at least one issue's solved.

536
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,406
- [pensive music playing]
- [sighs] Wait, Producer Cheon!

537
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,449
I got it.

538
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,246
Why aren't you telling them the truth?

539
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,582
Everything would be resolved
if you told them you begged.

540
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,792
You think I want
the whole crew to know that?

541
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,796
I don't.

542
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,509
Just let this end.

543
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,970
And I'll withdraw.

544
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,434
[woman] Hey, hey! Are you really quitting?

545
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,520
- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

546
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,985
[Eun-jung sighs]

547
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,405
Ugh!

548
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,573
[Jeong sighs]

549
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,911
Management… is asking we resolve it
before any of the media catches on.

550
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,540
And since Lee Seung-jae is willing
to say he's sorry, let's let it go.

551
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,460
Make sure you communicate that
to the crew when you meet.

552
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,920
[heavy rain pattering]

553
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,421
And Producer Cheon?

554
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,550
She'll have to develop another script.

555
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:01,182
Don't feel bad for her. It's her fault
for suggesting that Ho-cheol apologize.

556
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,645
Right, sir, but you agreed to it as well.

557
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,313
[Jeong] Mm-hmm.

558
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,233
Look, I've got three kids.
Should I have quit?

559
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,486
This was your project from the start.

560
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,115
Just try to make it work,
and think of it as a blessing. Got it?

561
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,548
[pensive music continues]

562
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,931
Why are you clearing out your desk?

563
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,934
I just gave the division director
my letter of resignation.

564
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,980
Why would you do that?
Did they make you resign?

565
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,774
They didn't force it. I chose to resign.

566
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,569
But why?

567
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,030
I didn't want to be petty.

568
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,872
Well, this is good for you, isn't it?
You got lucky.

569
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,666
You get your project back now.

570
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,338
[sighs] You really believe that?

571
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,050
You think resolving issues is petty?

572
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,846
[sighs softly] That's just who I am.

573
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,977
How can you just give up like this?

574
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,647
Is your pride really that important?

575
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,692
[music fades]

576
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,943
Yes, it is.

577
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,114
It's more important than my life.

578
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,496
I don't see the point of that.

579
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,585
If you sacrifice everything
for your pride…

580
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,797
then that's all you have left.

581
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,555
You should at least stay on
for Director Gyeong's sake.

582
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,265
I'll try to persuade the crew.

583
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,852
[Sang-yeon sighs heavily]

584
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,646
You're just so full of it.

585
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,858
- [sighs]
- ["Weird Mirror" playing]

586
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,030
You really think you're a good person?

587
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,162
You just got very lucky, that's all.

588
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,547
It sounds like

589
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,802
you've convinced yourself
that you've always been unlucky.

590
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,723
You're the one who's shaped your own luck.

591
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,310
I hope you can finally understand,
just this once,

592
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,563
how it feels to be alone.

593
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,774
[Eun-jung] You're the one who walked away.

594
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,110
You abandoned everyone
who cared about you.

595
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,906
You did the same thing ten years ago.

596
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,994
You were so focused on
protecting your own pride.

597
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,624
Do you know who caused your loneliness?

598
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,585
You did.

599
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,478
[music fades]

600
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,048
I officially resigned.

601
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,133
What?

602
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,805
But the crew meeting just ended.

603
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,392
It's all put to rest,
so you can come back to work.

604
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,561
[car door closes]

605
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,731
- It's all "put to rest"?
- [Sang-hak] I didn't go into detail.

606
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,317
I just said
that you apologized on my behalf.

607
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,445
I think everyone's clear
on what happened now so…

608
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,655
so we're all good.

609
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,825
In other words, "Come back to set."

610
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
"You're graciously forgiven."

611
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,499
I didn't do anything wrong.

612
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,709
So tell the crew

613
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,796
I don't care if they understand it or not.

614
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,383
- Sang-yeon…
- It's already a done deal.

615
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,887
[gentle music playing]

616
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,058
Is there anything else?

617
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,903
[sighs] Just take care.

618
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,492
[Sang-yeon scoffs]

619
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,537
What do you mean? You think I won't?

620
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,081
[Sang-hak sighs]

621
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,168
I know what you're thinking about me.

622
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,879
You think I'm weird.

623
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,548
I never said you were weird.

624
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,385
But you should allow yourself
to be more open.

625
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,222
Take care of yourself
and find some stability.

626
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,143
Like Eun-jung?

627
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,936
[Sang-hak] Yes. At least Eun-jung

628
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,522
can protect herself on her own.

629
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,696
So your thoughts are the same as hers.

630
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,992
You guys think I walked out on you.

631
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,872
- Sang-yeon…
- [Sang-yeon] But I'll tell you one thing.

632
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,250
[sighs]

633
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,712
I really loved you, Sang-hak.

634
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,717
You were the one who walked away.

635
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,766
There's no one who ruins
their own life on purpose, you know.

636
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,524
If Eun-jung had my luck,
she'd feel the same.

637
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:32,948
Go on.

638
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,204
And I sincerely hope
we don't cross paths again.

639
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,708
At this point, you're just…

640
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,295
a stranger to me now.

641
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,015
<i>I know what you're thinking about me.</i>
<i>You think I'm weird.</i>

642
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,517
[Sang-hak] <i>At least Eun-jung</i>

643
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,769
<i>can protect herself on her own.</i>

644
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,437
[somber Korean ballad playing]

645
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,898
[Eun-jung] <i>You're the one</i>
<i>who shaped your own luck.</i>

646
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,984
<i>You're the one who walked away.</i>

647
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,947
<i>Do you know who caused your loneliness?</i>

648
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,157
<i>You did.</i>

649
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:26,460
[Hee-jin] Why do you look so concerned?
Everything is back to where it should be.

650
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,173
- Do you really think that?
- [Hee-jin] Of course.

651
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,968
Either way,
it all worked out in your favor.

652
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,597
Why don't I feel good, then?
[clicks tongue]

653
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,851
I wish that just one time,

654
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,439
I could understand what I did
to make her so upset.

655
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,403
I wish that I could crawl inside her mind
to know how she feels.

656
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:57,116
[sighs] That's just how she is.
There's no explaining people like her.

657
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,201
She didn't always used to be this way.

658
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,912
What do you mean?

659
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,293
When we were younger. [chuckles wryly]

660
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,753
Way back when.

661
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,050
[sighs] For some reason, my thoughts
are always a mess when it comes to her.

662
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,760
[Hee-jin sighs]

663
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,596
Ryu Eun-jung.

664
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,352
Just forget it. Hmm? Walk away.
There's a reason you're still at odds.

665
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,980
Why keep trying
to understand her at this point?

666
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,356
[Hee-jin puts glass down, sighs]

667
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,109
[Seung-ju] Bet you're relieved
you don't have to deal with me anymore.

668
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,193
[Sang-yeon snickers]

669
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,988
'Course I am.

670
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,657
Relieved as hell!

671
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,367
Just don't run too fast.

672
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,286
[Sang-yeon] Maybe you shouldn't run.

673
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,495
But I will.

674
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,207
I'm free!

675
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,002
You're unemployed.
What do you mean, "free"?

676
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,423
Well, I also quit…

677
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,635
Kim Sang-hak.

678
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,220
["Hope" playing]

679
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:02,931
You did?

680
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,689
I'm proud of you. [chuckles]

681
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,320
You didn't have to quit working too.
You're not made of money.

682
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,741
They weren't paying me enough.

683
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,661
Just you wait.

684
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,246
I'll…

685
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,837
I'll end up making a bunch of cash, okay?

686
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,005
[chuckles]
