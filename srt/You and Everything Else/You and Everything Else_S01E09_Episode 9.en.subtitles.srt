1
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,851
Can you move a bit? Let me come in.

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,610
What are you doing?

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,653
Bring that in.

4
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,576
I have cancer. It's too heavy for me.

5
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,286
What are you doing?

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,583
You've really

7
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,169
grown cold, haven't you?

8
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:49,966
Will you kick me out?

9
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
I'm not budging. Just shut the door.

10
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,975
I thought this was your studio,
but I guess you live here.

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,022
Is that a spare room?

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,238
What do you want?

13
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,449
Let me crash here for three days.

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,579
I heard you're griping about me
bothering you

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,290
when I wouldn't even face you
while I'm sick.

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,585
That's why I'm here. To show you.

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,463
I knew what you'd be thinking about me.

18
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,674
And what do I think about you?

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,052
That I'm an egotistical germaphobe

20
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:40,725
who's talking about Switzerland
and making a fuss long before my time.

21
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,644
If you know, then leave.

22
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,231
I'm so tired.

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm absolutely exhausted.

24
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,945
I could drop dead.

25
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,908
What are you even…

26
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,999
Am I a joke to you?

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,504
Who do you think you are…

28
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,221
to just walk all over me like this?

29
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,394
You're no joke. You scare me.

30
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,862
If I think about what I did to you,

31
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,989
I know I shouldn't be here.

32
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,581
Let's just say I've decided to take
a more shameless approach.

33
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,930
That's my alarm.
It's time to take my medicine.

34
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,516
Goodness me.

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,231
I need to eat this
before I can take the medicine.

36
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,612
Let's see.

37
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
How can I heat this up?

38
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,575
Using this?

39
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,329
What buttons do I press?

40
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,668
Maybe this?

41
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,340
Take your meds, then go.

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,009
I need a spoon too.

43
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,768
I bet you're thinking,
"She's eating just fine."

44
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,071
Is this for drinking?

45
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,490
Is it?

46
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,960
The closer I watched her,
the less unwell she seemed.

47
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,800
So where can I sleep?

48
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,516
Leaving now isn't an option.

49
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,397
My meds make me sleepy,
so I need to nap in 20 minutes.

50
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,485
Okay.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,780
Fine.

52
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,949
I'll leave after my nap. Happy now?

53
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,973
I'd be fine on the couch.

54
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm not letting you sleep in here
for your sake.

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,728
You're distracting.

56
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,479
Serves me right, doesn't it?

57
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,025
How things have turned out.

58
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,073
You're allowed to think that way.

59
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,412
I miss your mom's hand-torn noodles.

60
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,890
CHEON SANG-YEON

61
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,522
She was like this back then as well.

62
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,441
11 YEARS AGO, SPRING OF 2013

63
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,901
One day,

64
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,528
out of the blue…

65
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,863
Come take a seat.

66
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,914
We should never have

67
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,167
crossed paths again that day.

68
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,920
YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE

69
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:10,054
2 WEEKS BEFORE MEETING SANG-YEON

70
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,189
Producer Ryu!

71
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,193
Look who it is! Hello, Producer Oh.

72
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,528
Yes, hello to you too.

73
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,612
Good morning.

74
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,322
Good morning to you too.

75
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,163
You're looking peppy.

76
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,665
Should I tone it down?

77
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,212
Every morning, it felt like a slog
to wake up and get myself to work.

78
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,549
Nowadays, I wake up instantly
when my alarm goes off.

79
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,761
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

80
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,264
-Hello.
-Hello.

81
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,265
Morning.

82
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,726
He's late? That's a first.

83
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,021
Yu-chan took today and tomorrow off
for his mom's surgery.

84
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,439
I forgot about that.

85
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,359
How do you know everything
about Song Yu-chan?

86
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,154
I know everything about you too,
Producer Cho.

87
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,950
What the…

88
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,869
What would she know about me?

89
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,496
You're so oblivious.

90
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
She's clearly mocking you.

91
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,542
She really has a way
of getting under your skin.

92
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,253
It's no secret
she's got something going on with Yu-chan.

93
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,425
It's clear your success
is making them jealous.

94
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,427
They're always sneering at you.

95
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,638
I couldn't care less.

96
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,349
The office does feel quieter

97
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,268
without Yu-chan, don't you think?

98
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,897
Hey.

99
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,943
Are you sure
there's no spark between you two?

100
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,571
Even if he were the chairman's son,

101
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,573
I would never date a colleague.

102
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,158
Imagine the breakup.

103
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,870
Even I would say no to the chairman's son.

104
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,625
Hui-jin, guess what I'm doing today?

105
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,756
TO: JU DONG-HYANG
GOOD MAN DIRECTOR'S CONTRACT

106
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
MAIL SENT

107
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,846
Sir, I'm meeting Director Ju.
Do you have anything to tell him?

108
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,932
Tell him I appreciate all his hard work.

109
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,601
And that drinks are on me
after the investment review.

110
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,519
Sure.

111
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,195
What's so exciting
about meeting with the director?

112
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,998
Did you read the contract?

113
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,461
It's so moving
to finally sign on as the director.

114
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,255
On the day I sign the contract,

115
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,215
I'll treat us to some barbecue!

116
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,133
Korean beef?

117
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,720
Korean beef? Sure, why not?

118
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,929
Let's eat Korean beef.

119
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,474
We should be the ones treating you.

120
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,061
Mr. Jeong says he'll treat you
once the investment review is done.

121
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,526
Please take your time with the contract
until the investment review is done.

122
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,529
Has the investment review
still not been scheduled?

123
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,533
Our boss is on a business trip,
so it will be scheduled for next week.

124
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,868
I see.

125
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,620
You have nothing to worry about.

126
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,582
The script is solid,
and the Lee Seung-jae is on board.

127
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,335
Lee Seung-jae.

128
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,336
GOOD MAN CHARACTER MAP

129
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,587
I guess you're right.

130
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,467
For cinematography and art, are you set on
Park Sun-ho and Jeong Ji-yun?

131
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,677
For cinematography,

132
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,096
how about Kim Sang-hak?

133
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,059
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak?

134
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,895
Yes. You've seen the movie
Wasteland, right?

135
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,229
Yes.

136
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,523
But from what I hear,

137
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,487
Cinematographer Kim is currently working
on Director Lee Chan-seok's project.

138
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,490
-Over in South America--
-He got back two days ago.

139
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:02,328
He withdrew from the project
when they ditched Director Lee Chan-seok.

140
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,706
Is that so?

141
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,212
Why? Do you think he's a bad fit?

142
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,256
No, why would I think he's a bad fit?

143
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:20,638
I'll discuss this with my boss
then check his availability.

144
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,473
If he is open to joining us,

145
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,518
please prioritize meeting him
before others snatch him away.

146
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,853
-All right.
-Great.

147
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,980
Just know that my boss may object.

148
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,568
Why does it seem like you want him to?

149
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,986
Me?

150
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,279
Why, that's absurd.

151
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,614
Why would I?

152
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,802
Sir.

153
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,765
Do you have a minute?

154
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,475
The division head needs me.

155
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,354
The guy who withdrew
along with Director Lee Chan-seok?

156
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,481
Yes.

157
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,734
What are your thoughts?

158
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,030
I think he did a decent job on Wasteland.

159
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,290
If you're happy, I'll proceed.

160
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,755
But our movie's a CGI-heavy blockbuster.

161
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm not sure he has the experience.

162
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,305
Then again, considering that
the picky Director Lee chose him…

163
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,517
Okay. Let's go with him.

164
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,068
CINEMATOGRAPHER
KIM SANG-HAK

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,115
I can't believe
I still remember this number.

166
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,171
Hello. I'm calling for
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak…

167
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,011
Yes.

168
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,890
How have you… been?

169
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,440
Well, I'm only reaching out
about a project.

170
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,527
Would you be available tomorrow?

171
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Why…

172
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,284
It's been a while.

173
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,579
It has. Let's go inside.

174
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,671
I heard about
Director Lee Chan-seok's movie.

175
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,340
Word travels fast.

176
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,259
As it always does.

177
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,220
Do you have another project lined up?

178
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,138
Not yet.

179
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,432
If so, could you have
a look at one of ours?

180
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,729
The director wants to work with you.

181
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,065
He says he met you
at the Busan International Film Festival.

182
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,444
I see.

183
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,238
You're working
with Director Ju Dong-hyang.

184
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,156
Yes.

185
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,575
Have you ever seen this webtoon?

186
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,245
Good Man is a well-known webtoon
we're adapting.

187
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,914
We've cast Lee Seung-jae.

188
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,291
Wow, Lee Seung-jae? That's amazing.

189
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,920
Once investment is approved next week,
we'll begin pre-production.

190
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,672
Lee Seung-jae is due to enlist,

191
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,133
so filming must start by June
at the latest.

192
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,844
So I need to decide fast?

193
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,679
That would be helpful.

194
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,270
How's your mother?

195
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:40,981
Is she well?

196
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,527
She's well.

197
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,380
What is it?

198
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,967
I knew you were at JD,

199
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,803
so I thought
our paths would cross eventually.

200
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,182
But it's strange to be receiving
a work proposal from you.

201
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,689
What's there to feel strange about?
Just think of it as business.

202
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,692
I can't get used to
you addressing me formally.

203
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,486
Well, get used to it.

204
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,738
I'm here to see you for work.

205
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,453
Excuse me.

206
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,375
Hey, Yu-chan. I'm in a meeting.

207
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,087
No, we're done here.
I was just about to leave.

208
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,256
Yes.

209
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,634
I'll call you back shortly. Okay.

210
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,514
Have a look, and please let me know.

211
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,515
Okay.

212
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,644
Do you have a card?

213
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,104
Right.

214
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,160
Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak is that guy?

215
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,454
Photography club guy from university?

216
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,873
The protagonist of your grad film?

217
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,751
A film is just a film.

218
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,545
Okay, fiction it is.

219
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,923
Yu-chan's mother's surgery went well.

220
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,885
He seemed anxious
that the surgery ran long.

221
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,679
He'll be taken aback
when he hears about this.

222
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,973
-About what?
-Don't play coy.

223
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,476
That your ex may join you
as cinematographer.

224
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,312
We don't know yet. He could say no.

225
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,772
Who in their right mind

226
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,233
would say no to a 12-billion-won tentpole
starring Lee Seung-jae?

227
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,529
You sure you're okay with this?

228
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,741
Would you be okay?
Of course I'm uncomfortable.

229
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,951
Then why didn't you tell Mr. Jeong?

230
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,661
It's work.

231
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,664
I don't want to be petty
when it comes to business.

232
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,835
I admit I was anxious before meeting him,

233
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,505
but I felt nothing when I saw him.

234
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,885
Hey, the stew is getting cold.

235
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,355
The investment review's set for Wednesday.
God, I'm nervous.

236
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,774
What do I do?

237
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,949
You're that happy?

238
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
Absolutely.

239
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,248
It took two years to draft a report
with the director's name.

240
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,874
Don't ever forget

241
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,628
that even the nicest directors
turn into bastards once they're on set.

242
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,797
I know.

243
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,923
Of course you do.

244
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,597
DRAFT PRODUCTION SCHEDULE

245
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,399
How late?

246
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,194
Maybe 11:00?
I think I finished around 11:00 p.m.

247
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,447
Why finish work that's due tomorrow?

248
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,741
I know, but I just couldn't stop.

249
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,620
Gosh.

250
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,915
This sure tastes good.

251
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,877
I really should quit.

252
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,477
It's Kim Sang-hak.
He says he'll take the job.

253
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,148
He sure didn't take long
to make up his mind, did he?

254
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,150
I won't tell you if you tease.

255
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,861
Come on, it's all in good fun.

256
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,656
Do you really think I'd encourage you
to get back together with your ex?

257
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,492
Why revisit a messy breakup?

258
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,870
The breakup wasn't that messy.

259
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,916
When I think about it now,
it's understandable.

260
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,335
People are drawn to who they're drawn to.

261
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,880
So, if you could go back,
would you have stayed?

262
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,050
Not a chance.

263
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,594
I'd break up with him
a hundred times over.

264
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,972
Who's the jerk you'd break up with
a hundred times over?

265
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,057
Yu-chan!

266
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,227
Jeez, you uncivilized smokers.

267
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,610
-Where are you headed?
-A meeting.

268
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,945
Mr. Jeong.

269
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,821
Kim Sang-hak will sign on.

270
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,448
-I'll set up a meeting.
-Sure.

271
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,867
-I thought you could join--
-Yeah, okay.

272
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,288
Did something happen?
Why is he so out of it?

273
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,957
I don't know.

274
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,002
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Go on.

275
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,424
Hey.

276
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,973
Something has happened to you, actually.

277
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,890
To me?

278
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,519
-Know who she's setting up a meeting with?
-Who?

279
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,895
Her ex-boyfriend.

280
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,273
"Ex-boyfriend"?

281
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,525
This is Cinematographer Kim Sang-hak.

282
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,026
Glad to work with you.

283
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,486
-Likewise.
-Great.

284
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,824
And I'm Producer Ryu Eun-jung.
A pleasure to work with you.

285
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,329
Why didn't you tell me
that you two knew each other?

286
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,664
Sorry?

287
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,127
I hear you were in the same club.

288
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,213
You pretended not to know him
when I first mentioned him.

289
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,508
Did I?

290
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,343
And so what if I did?

291
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,098
You're acting even stranger.

292
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,351
-I was--
-I dropped out halfway through university.

293
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,604
And I joined the military.

294
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,814
I see.

295
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,650
-So you weren't there at the same time?
-Yes.

296
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,528
Producer Ryu dropped out
and went to film school,

297
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,572
while you went to the film academy?

298
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,489
Correct.

299
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,076
Even so, you two
were in the same club, so--

300
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,037
How did you like the script?

301
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,374
-I made a reservation at Takoharu.
-Really?

302
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,418
Congratulations, Director Ju.

303
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,961
Thank you, Producer Oh.

304
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,172
You clocking out?

305
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,298
We're having dinner.

306
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,675
-Well, I'll see you around.
-Yes.

307
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,593
Bye, then.

308
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,230
Come on! Dang it!

309
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,649
You should've come sooner!
He was just here.

310
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,236
Those scenes were obviously shot
because they were necessary.

311
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,322
I'm not saying they weren't necessary.

312
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,783
I'm merely suggesting

313
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,371
that it's not essential to show
exactly how the limbs were ripped apart.

314
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,539
It doesn't need to be so explicit.

315
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,377
That's true, but is that a valid reason
to hate the movie itself?

316
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,296
It's valid enough for me.
How is it any different from porn?

317
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,756
Pure primal stimulation.

318
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,883
How did you like the movie?

319
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,096
We always argue like this
when we talk about movies.

320
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,141
I agree that the scene
didn't have to be so explicit,

321
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,227
but I enjoyed the movie.

322
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,232
With such an extensive list of pet peeves,
how do you watch so many movies?

323
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,317
Because it's work.

324
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,694
I am a movie producer, after all.

325
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,656
Producer Ryu sees every movie
at the box office.

326
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,200
Are there any movies you liked?

327
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,245
There were lots.

328
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,873
In recent years,

329
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,792
I liked Moneyball.

330
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,004
And Mike Leigh's Another Year.

331
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,464
I also liked Still Walking.

332
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,718
Sure, it's great to find a gem of a movie,

333
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,263
but I usually focus on the production.

334
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,557
A great movie, to me,

335
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,059
is one that's well-planned
and breaks even.

336
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,853
So it's all about the money.

337
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,771
This goes beyond just money.

338
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:04,025
Whatever the movie may be,
it's the duty of a good producer

339
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,735
to help it break even.

340
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,322
Cheers.

341
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,791
-See you soon!
-Yes.

342
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,960
-Take care on your way home.
-All right.

343
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,003
Take care.

344
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,885
The next cab's yours, Director Kim.

345
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,971
After you, Producer Ryu.

346
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,057
No, I should see you off.

347
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,315
Production never leaves
before the filming crew.

348
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
Please get in.

349
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,364
Sir, can you go to Ilyeong?

350
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,741
I can. Please get in.

351
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
Still, you should go first today.

352
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,665
All right, then.

353
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,375
Take care.

354
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
GOOD MAN
PRODUCTION INVESTMENT MEETING

355
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,198
Is everything working?

356
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,783
I think so. Let me check.

357
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,626
I think that means we're all in agreement.

358
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,712
Great work, Mr. Jeong.

359
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,339
It wasn't me.

360
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,967
I have Producer Ryu to thank, really.

361
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,511
She's great at shaping scripts
and is our team's best.

362
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,763
Oh, no, it's nothing.

363
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,726
Our director, Ju Dong-hyang,
put his heart into writing the script.

364
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,189
Do we have an update
on Director Gyeong Seung-ju?

365
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,607
He's on board.

366
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,235
He seems to have enjoyed the script,

367
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:15,699
and Mr. Jeong tells me that
Director Gyeong was a fan of the webtoon.

368
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,950
Great.

369
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,453
Then let's approve investment
for Good Man on the condition

370
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,247
that Gyeong Seung-ju directs.

371
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,876
Director Gyeong Seung-ju, sir?

372
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,547
Producer Ryu.

373
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:32,841
Wait.

374
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,929
You're not suggesting
that we switch directors, are you?

375
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,807
Let's discuss this later.

376
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:48,815
Sir, this movie--

377
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,150
Producer Ryu.

378
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,402
I think we're done, sir.

379
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,738
I'll leave you all to it.

380
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,866
Let's make sure all departments
are fully prepared. Keep it up.

381
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,496
Great meeting, all.

382
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,792
From planning to the third manuscript,

383
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,004
it was all Director Ju. He did everything.

384
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,883
You know he's been paying his assistants
out of his own pocket!

385
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,305
The budget is a whopping 12 billion won.

386
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,849
A rookie director just won't cut it.

387
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,645
What can I do if they want someone
with a proven box office track record?

388
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,731
Frankly speaking, this isn't even
Director Ju's original script.

389
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,691
The source material is strong--

390
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,984
It was Director Ju

391
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,947
who suggested we acquire the copyright
when no one knew of the source material.

392
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,284
He's also the one
who insisted on casting Lee Seung-jae,

393
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,827
even when it took two years.

394
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,205
How could you hand the script
to another director

395
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,749
without even consulting me?

396
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,418
How could I when I knew
you'd react like this?

397
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,880
And why would Director Ju
be considered a rookie?

398
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,176
He's an experienced director
who has a debut feature.

399
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,886
And what, "box office hits"?

400
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,222
Director Gyeong's never had
a box office hit!

401
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,141
But actors love Director Gyeong.

402
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,894
Who do you think suggested him?

403
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,646
It was Lee Seung-jae.

404
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,525
Just tell him we'll give him full credit
for Good Man's script.

405
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,653
Then offer him Young Hearts.
You initially wanted him to--

406
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,365
I will address this personally
with the boss.

407
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,075
Producer Ryu.

408
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,993
Ryu Eun-jung.

409
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,123
Let's face it. We can't afford
to turn down Gyeong Seung-ju.

410
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,794
This is our team's first
investment opportunity in three years.

411
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,256
This isn't just about Good Man.
Our team's at stake.

412
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,426
Lose the attitude,

413
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,095
and deal with Director Ju.

414
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,201
What's up? Why's it so tense here?

415
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,663
What's this about Gyeong Seung-ju?

416
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,999
-Do you know?
-Hush.

417
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,584
Come on, what is it?

418
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,587
Why are you hushing me?

419
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,467
FROM DIRECTOR JU DONG-HYANG

420
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,801
How did the meeting go?

421
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,099
The contract has no clause

422
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,394
that guarantees Director Ju
a priority claim.

423
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,024
I would have insisted on it
if I'd seen this coming.

424
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,484
Like that would've worked.

425
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,653
JD never adds such clauses
for rookie directors.

426
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,864
What angers me most

427
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,118
is that I encouraged him
to sign such a contract.

428
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,748
What did you tell Director Ju?

429
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,375
I told him the review went well

430
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,629
and that I'll share the details
in person tomorrow.

431
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,883
The film industry sure is cruel.

432
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,255
When's the meeting?

433
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,882
At eleven o'clock.

434
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,093
When you meet Director Ju,

435
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,262
don't tell him
Gyeong Seung-ju got the job.

436
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,056
How could I not?

437
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:54,269
He'll find out sooner or later.
I have to be the one to tell him.

438
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,272
You might believe
that honesty is the best policy,

439
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,399
but it isn't
if you're on the receiving end.

440
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,234
It's the least you can do.

441
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,611
He'd be mortified if he knew

442
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,656
that Gyeong Seung-ju
was contacted behind his back.

443
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,366
But still…

444
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,826
Do as I say.

445
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,579
In this case,
being honest would be selfish.

446
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,298
It's Mr. Jeong.
He wants me in the division head's office.

447
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,595
Come take a seat.

448
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,023
Ryu Eun-jung.

449
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,276
Do you two know each other?

450
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,953
We're childhood friends.

451
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,667
Is that true?

452
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
I never knew.

453
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,673
Why are you standing there?
Take a seat, Producer Ryu.

454
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,189
So you two are friends? How convenient.

455
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,820
Producer Cheon Sang-yeon
will join you as of today.

456
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,243
What do you mean by "join"?

457
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,704
Exactly as it sounds.

458
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,915
She'll be co-producing Good Man.

459
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,130
Co-producing?

460
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,683
Can you give us a minute?

461
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,897
Producer Cheon,
you probably haven't even seen your desk.

462
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,816
Will you step out for a minute?

463
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,151
I'll show you to it.

464
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,486
This way.

465
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,699
Over there…

466
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,871
Can I please have an explanation?

467
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,751
Producer Cheon
joining as executive producer

468
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
is Director Gyeong's first condition.

469
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,423
Executive producer?

470
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,759
But Mr. Hwang here shut him down
and said that won't fly.

471
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,054
You should thank him for having your back.

472
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,182
You'll be co-producing,
so nothing will change for you.

473
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,436
So it's already decided. I understand.

474
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,688
Producer Ryu, come on now…

475
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,398
Producer Ryu.

476
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,452
Producer Cheon
joining as executive producer

477
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,662
is Director Gyeong's first condition.

478
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,134
I'm meeting Director Ju in half an hour.

479
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,096
If he agrees to do Young Hearts,
you must give him a director's contract.

480
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,223
Not an incremental contract

481
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,893
but a full one with incentive clauses.

482
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,352
Along with his assistants.

483
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,648
Sure. Well done for coming around.

484
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,193
Obviously, I intended to offer him--

485
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,778
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

486
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,491
-What is this?
-Remember what you told me when I started?

487
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,535
"As producers, it's all about the people."

488
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,163
"People are our pulse."

489
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:48,920
Producer Ryu.

490
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,926
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,472
After years in the industry,
I thought I'd experienced it all.

492
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,183
But JD is truly something else.

493
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,727
I am so sorry.

494
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,064
I have no words.

495
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,820
If I return the funds I received,
can you get me back my script?

496
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,365
You know the answer to that.

497
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,283
Due to the source material,

498
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,954
retrieving the script
won't grant you usage rights.

499
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,291
Is Mr. Jeong at the office?
How dare they treat creatives like shit--

500
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,417
Director Ju.

501
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,421
Please listen to everything
I have to say before you leave.

502
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,423
I won't stop you.

503
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,802
Go grab Mr. Jeong by the collar
or tear the company down.

504
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,762
Please just hear me out first.

505
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,231
So who is this brilliant director
they've chosen instead?

506
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,154
Director Ju.

507
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,451
I know you can't consider
anything else right now, but…

508
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,541
Good Man…

509
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,796
Forget all about it and do Young Hearts.

510
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,673
Hold on.

511
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,384
Did I hear you correctly?
This is not about getting--

512
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,677
I get it.

513
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,804
You must be devastated.

514
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,931
But still,

515
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,059
I have to tell you this today.

516
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,191
If you go on to sign another contract,

517
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,111
they probably won't raise
your director's fee.

518
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,365
So I suggest
you ask for 60 million for the script.

519
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,076
They will counter with 50 million.

520
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,082
Yes, I resigned from JD.

521
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,127
Wait, why would you?

522
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,588
I can't do this anymore.

523
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,841
As for the incentive--

524
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,177
Why are you the one quitting?

525
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,970
They're the ones who've done wrong.

526
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,555
I wrote that contract.

527
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,474
Seriously, that's enough!

528
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,976
I won't let Mr. Jeong get away with this.

529
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,784
PRODUCER OH HUI-JIN

530
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,908
At least eat something.

531
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,329
Good heavens. You sure drank a lot.

532
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,747
Did you call the office?

533
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,209
I took the day off.

534
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,044
My goodness.

535
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,218
I felt an overwhelming sense of despair.

536
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,223
I was worried about money, unemployment,

537
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,809
and my future.

538
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,563
Even so,

539
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,191
I had no desire to go back there.

540
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,943
I guess you've come back to life.

541
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,157
People don't die so easily.

542
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,001
Who is it?

543
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,960
It's me!

544
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,755
Who?

545
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,216
Oh my, Sang-yeon!

546
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,552
Oh my word! How long has it been?

547
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,179
Eun-jung, it's Sang-yeon!

548
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,096
How are you?

549
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,431
Good, of course.

550
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,725
Oh, you shouldn't have!

551
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,642
It's heavy.

552
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,311
Ow, my back.

553
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,855
You haven't had dinner, have you? Come in.

554
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,398
Let's talk outside.

555
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,319
I actually have something to discuss
with Eun-jung.

556
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,529
-Take care.
-Sure, okay.

557
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,782
-I'll visit you again soon.
-You do that.

558
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,991
Good night.

559
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,418
Do you feel better now that you've quit?

560
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,757
I really wasn't aware
that this was your project.

561
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,594
I thought everything
had been confirmed internally.

562
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,265
If you ask me
whether I cared enough to ask

563
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,061
how things were left with Director Ju,
who was originally attached to the movie,

564
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,647
I have nothing to say.

565
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,858
I've been pretty shameless.

566
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,361
If you know, finish your food and go.

567
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,451
Come back.

568
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,040
I heard you abandoned
all your other projects too.

569
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,962
You're not working with Director Ju
elsewhere. Why ditch your other projects?

570
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,844
Is this like when you kept sending me
rent money back then?

571
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,102
Spare me the mockery.

572
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,812
I just can't understand you.

573
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,480
And you never will.

574
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,280
I guess you're right.

575
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,077
The point is, I don't want to
take someone's spot like this.

576
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,122
If you simply can't bear it,
be the executive producer.

577
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,248
I'll support you.

578
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,713
Do you even know that my mom died?

579
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,885
What?

580
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,056
She died.

581
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,780
Ms. Yoon

582
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,408
passed away?

583
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,331
Sit down if you want to hear more.

584
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,174
When?

585
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,344
Why didn't you tell me?

586
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,429
I tried to.

587
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,475
But you didn't answer my call.

588
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,978
When?

589
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,523
When did you ever call me?

590
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,734
Before the last time we met.

591
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,244
The doctor said
she only had three months left,

592
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,080
so I called you,
thinking she'd want to see

593
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,959
her favorite student one last time.

594
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,881
But you ignored my call.

595
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,135
I did?

596
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,931
Yes, you did.

597
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,227
She didn't even last three months.

598
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,529
Why are you always so predictable?

599
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,492
Can't you see I'm using my mom
to make you reconsider?

600
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,161
You still should have called me.

601
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,420
I didn't want to.

602
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,926
Do you think
I would've wanted to contact you then?

603
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,598
How did you handle the funeral?

604
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,515
There wasn't one.

605
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,230
I just scattered her ashes in the sea.

606
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,736
You did cross my mind,

607
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:39,908
but it irritated me
that I was thinking about you.

608
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,828
So you scattered her ashes alone?

609
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,165
-Who else would I do it with?
-How can you be so--

610
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,584
Since I'm using my mom,

611
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,086
let me make it worthwhile.

612
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:53,964
Come back.

613
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm not doing this for your sake.

614
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,516
Your colleagues
won't even look me in the eye.

615
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,394
I know nothing about the company system,

616
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,647
and I'm being treated like an intruder.

617
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,234
Most importantly,
once Director Gyeong gets involved,

618
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,737
he'll tear into the script
with his red pen.

619
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,199
You should defend the script's integrity.

620
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,912
Because I'll likely side
with Gyeong Seung-ju.

621
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,342
Can't you see I'm using my mom
to make you reconsider?

622
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,972
Sang-yeon said she was using her mom.

623
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,101
Come back.

624
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,814
I received the deposit,

625
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,899
but something urgent came up.

626
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,070
Sorry I used some
without discussing it with you.

627
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,156
I called you to tell you this.

628
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,203
The urgent thing
you used the deposit for back then,

629
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,831
was it your mom's medical bills?

630
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,168
Yes.

631
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,594
Yet you still went out of your way…

632
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,181
to pay me back?

633
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,270
Yes.

634
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,774
How could you?

635
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,236
Your mom was dying.

636
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,279
That's just…

637
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,741
me.

638
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,412
You could never understand.

639
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,343
Man, this punk.

640
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,314
Producer Ryu.

641
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,649
-You owe me an apology.
-What?

642
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,152
Were you frustrated
that I ignored your calls?

643
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,530
Everyone has feelings, after all.

644
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,535
Yes, okay.

645
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,955
I admit I was a little too careless.

646
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,707
I'm really sorry.

647
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,501
Please call over Producer Cheon.

648
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,299
Producer Cheon.

649
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,351
You heard, didn't you?

650
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,939
Producer Cheon has decided to let you
take the executive producer role.

651
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,114
Did you say that you would let me
be the executive producer?

652
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,539
Technically, I'm not letting you.

653
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,168
It was your role to start with,
so I'm not letting you be anything.

654
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,672
I merely said that if you can't accept me,

655
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,843
I would meet you halfway and support you.
Isn't that right, Mr. Jeong?

656
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,556
Yes, that's what I meant.

657
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,395
Allow me to demonstrate
what meeting halfway looks like.

658
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,232
I'll co-produce with Producer Cheon.

659
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,442
We'll co-produce Good Man.

660
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,155
You said you were using your mom…

661
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,783
Let's give it our best shot,
Producer Cheon.

662
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,369
…but it won't work on me.

663
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,914
I choose to take your hand

664
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,209
solely for me and my work.

665
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,089
Because now you mean nothing to me.

666
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,800
