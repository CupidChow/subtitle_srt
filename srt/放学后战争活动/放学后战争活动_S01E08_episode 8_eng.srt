1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,980
   

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,980
What's going on? Why are they the only ones here?

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,090
Did the wardens really leave them behind?

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,980
There's no way of knowing what happened here.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,640
And we can't trust what they're saying either.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,310
As far as I know, petty criminals are freed

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,000
and felons are transported to Busan at times of war.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,520
Since they're still here,

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,510
could they be the worst offenders who were slated to be sent to fight?

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,710
You saw the red name tag earlier, right?

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,770
He's on death row. Doesn't that mean he's a serial killer or something?

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,930
Gosh, he looked so fucking scary.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,510
He's the boss of a gang who got locked up for wiping out a rival gang.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,770
Come on, bring it on.

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,260
Fuck off.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,590
 Kids, you're still there, right? 

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,340
 Please come over here and open the doors. 

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,880
 Fuck! I'm serious, you're all going to get yourselves killed! Hurry up and open the doors! 

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,450
 Please spare us. 

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,500
W-We're not bad people, Kids.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,020
- Just come here for a second. Just a second. 
  - Guys... 

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,590
Just come over here and hear us out.

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,200
We're absolutely not freeing them.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,160
- They're dangerous bastards. 
 - He's right.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,710
But they said they didn't even get to eat for days.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,200
- We should at least give them food... 
 - Are you insane?

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,120
Do we just leave them be then? Just ignore them?

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,590
If we leave them as is, they'll all die soon.

29
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,290
Why do you care about that?

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,290
Let's just get what we need and leave.

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,010
Yes, let's just leave them and go. It's not even our business.

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,990
 Fuck! Come over here and open the door, you assholes! 

33
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,610
 We're really just so hungry. 

34
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,750
What should we do?

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,220
 Just give me the key. 

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,500
Fucking hell...

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,470
Hey, I've been wondering for a while now.

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,580
You all look so young. What are you doing with guns in your hands?

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,140
And what's up with your getups?

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,410
Right now, there's a war going on outside.

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,270
A war? Is there a war?

42
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,780
Wait a minute. Did North Korea invade us?

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,760
See, you motherfuckers? What the fuck did I tell you?

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,270
I told you the North Korean fuckers invaded us, didn't I?

45
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,790
That's why those motherfucking wardens left us and took off. Those assholes.

46
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,310
Just they wait and see. I'll fuck those bastards up first thing when I get out.

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,380
- Those motherfuckers, I knew this was the case. 
 - Whoa, hey!

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,540
I finally feel like a living person again. Thank you.

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,420
Kids, the warden's office is right there around the corner.

50
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,060
The keys are there. Can you go and bring them to me, please?

51
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,700
We can't do that.

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,940
What? What are you saying right now, huh?

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,690
You motherfuckers!

54
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,720
Hey, Kids. Stop messing around.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,670
- And bring the keys right now, okay? 
 - The outside...

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,110
- is more dangerous right now, anyway, 
 - Dangerous, you say?

57
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,830
What the heck is going on outside?

58
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,790
Do you...

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,960
really not know anything at all?

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,110
Right now, there are...

61
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,700
What is it? Why are you stopping midway? What's going on?

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,350
Wh-What's wrong with outside right now?

63
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,540
Did the spheres in the sky fall to Earth or something?

64
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,160
Those purple balloon-like things, right?

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,400
That makes sense.

66
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,670
What the heck?

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,930
- Are you guys serious? 
 - Gosh, I'm about to lose it. Just talk!

68
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,900
No, no. You don't need to talk.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,150
We're actually not even curious.

70
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,910
Hey, just open the doors for us, please.

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,370
Thank you for the food. Open the doors, please.

72
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,220
Kids, we're really innocent, all right?

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,740
We were all wrongfully accused and framed. I swear.

74
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,490
He's right. We're not even guilty.

75
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,300
Right? We just got on the wardens' bad side.

76
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,360
Are you not going to eat?

77
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,740
Are you feeling sick?

78
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,500
Excuse me.

79
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,270
Open the doors right now!

80
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,250
Go get the key!

81
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,150
Gosh, that jerk. Why are you yelling at the kids?

82
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,430
Please, excuse him. It's because he's been locked up alone for a long time.

83
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,080
Hey.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,540
Student, I'm sorry, but could I ask you for a favor?

85
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,310
My mother...

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,310
She doesn't know that I'm here, all right?

87
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,250
I was supposed to admit her to a nursing home, but I ruined everything.

88
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,870
I just wanted to know if my mother is doing well.

89
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,980
 You fucking asshole! 

90
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,190
C-Could you just...

91
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,760
call this number and ask how she's doing?

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,850
I beg of you.

93
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,430
When I saw my mom the last time, she wasn't able to eat properly.

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm worried about whether she's having proper meals without me.

95
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,980
- But we're not able to call anyone either— 
 - P-Please, I...

96
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,850
T-Tell her not to worry because her s-son is doing well.

97
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,930
She doesn't need to worry, and I'm really sorry.

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,410
P-Please tell her that I l-love her.

99
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,750
I'm s-sorry for bothering you. I-I'm sorry.

100
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,270
 Just bring the keys. 

101
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,360
Please open the doors!

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,980
We'll return as soon as possible and report the situations here.

103
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,990
Please hang in there until then.

104
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,960
Open the fucking door! Fucking open it!

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,590
That's a load of bullshit.

106
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,510
Hey, are you kidding me?

107
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,930
- Let's go. 
 - H-Hey, where are you going?

108
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,730
Don't go. D-Don't go!

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,030
- We'll be back. 
 - Hey, stop right there. Hey—

110
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,320
Don't fucking go.

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Hey, you brats will be murdering us if you leave like this.

112
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,490
Then you'll be just the same as us felons.

113
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,510
Fuck!

114
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,560
Hey, Ae Seol!

115
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,600
 Where do you think you're going? Hey, come over here. 

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,350
 Come over here. 

117
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,630
 Come here, you fucking asshole! 

118
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,310
 Who is he to call us murderers? 

119
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,930
They fucking made me feel shitty with their bullshit...

120
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,590
This is the right thing to do, right?

121
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,290
What would Platoon Leader have done at times like this?

122
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,870
He probably would have done the same thing.

123
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,210
He's right. We can just report this place's situation once we get the radio transceiver fixed.

124
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,970
I need some nicotine.

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,910
By the way... the person in the last cell looked really ill.

126
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,220
He couldn't even eat the food we gave him.

127
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,450
Why are you getting all nosy again?

128
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,630
I think we'll need to help him a bit, if things go wrong...

129
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,300
Hey, No Ae Seol, what's wrong? I thought you were getting yourself together lately.

130
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,720
We decided altogether not to free them.

131
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,970
- At least his conditions— 
 - Just forget about him, Idiot.

132
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,960
- I'll— 
 - She's right, Ae Sol.

133
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,530
We're bothered, too, and feel unpleasant about it...

134
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,430
but I think our purpose in coming to the prison takes priority for now.

135
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,370
Let's look for the radio transceiver parts now,

136
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,930
get anything else we need and leave.

137
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,230
- Since it's a prison, they probably have protective gear and weapons too. 
 - Yes.

138
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,290
As I said before, we just need the circuit board.

139
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,310
- The card-looking... 
 - If we find the card-looking thing...

140
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,220
report to you and Yeong Sin. That's it, right?

141
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,610
All right, let's spread out and search.

142
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,720
Everyone be careful.

143
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,590
Let's go.

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,550
I just had to go to the bathroom.

161
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,490
Just how many times do you need to go?

162
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,660
- Aren't you slacking off? 
 - I'm not.

163
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,180
It's because I have an irritable bowel.

164
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,050
Also, you're the one who slacks off.

165
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,980
Gosh, I even let you go when you were pretending to be sick.

166
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,470
I was really sick and had a real fever before.

167
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,750
Hey!

168
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,080
Why are the two of you here?

169
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,350
What are you going to do if a sphere shows up all of a sudden?

170
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,220
There's none around here!

171
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,380
By the way, I didn't even see a cat around here,

172
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,170
let alone a sphere.

173
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,260
Stop overreacting.

174
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,530
Gosh, you little...

175
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,050
You were telling me to get some sleep,

176
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,150
but you're fooling around as a pair.

177
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,750
She's right. We have the detector here.

178
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,620
Why live so rigidly? Right?

179
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,220
It's cold outside. Let's take a break.

180
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,170
Look at you, now—

181
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,590
It's all done!

182
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,720
How is it?

183
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
It's so pretty.

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,400
Jun Hui, what... do you think?

185
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,090
- You look homeless, like totally. 
 - Gosh.

186
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,090
Why don't you add a flower like a crazy wench?

187
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,560
What's wrong? I totally look like an idol.

188
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,360
There she goes again.

189
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,770
♪ Pick me... Ha Na up ♪

190
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,690

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,550

198
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,890
All right! The one to take the honored

199
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,550
first place is... Trainee Yu Ha Na! 
  (T/N: In this context, idol trainee) 

200
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,440
My goodness! Thank you!

201
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,480
Thank you! Thank you!

202
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
- Yu Ha Na! Yu Ha Na! 
 - Thank you, Producers.

203
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,500
This is such a load of bullshit!

204
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,420
Hey, what's wrong with her?

205
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,880
It's because you said she looks homeless.

206
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,430
It's my fault? How is it my fault?

207
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,040
Gosh...

208
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,740
I wanted to debut before I turned twenty years old.

209
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,290
Hey...

210
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,850
I find it weird, no matter how I think about it.

211
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,190
What?

212
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,250
- What's weird? 
 - The voting.

213
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,290
Quite a lot of the people I asked said they voted against it.

214
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,720
- But why does the vote always go through in the end? 
 - Aigo.

215
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,450
They could have just lied to you when they voted for it.

216
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,000
- Just in case you blame them. 
 - Geez.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,620
Hey, do you think we're all crazy for extra credit like you and Guk Yeong Su?

218
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,590
Extra credit, my foot.

219
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,230
CSAT? Forget CSAT, I don't even know what will happen next week.

220
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,250
I saw you studying secretly at night.

221
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,520
- I saw her, too. 
 - Right?

222
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,010
I'm the right one here, Deok Jung, right?

223
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,140
You're 100% correct, Ha Na.

224
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,390
Totally.

225
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,860
She's just jealous.

226
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm telling you.

227
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,330
What Jun Hui is saying is...

228
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,390
Hey, be quiet for a second.

229
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,000
What you're saying is really...

230
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,870
Gosh, shut up for a second!

231
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,980
- What's gotten into you? 
 - Why?

232
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,130
Do you hear that?

233
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,340
- What the heck? 
 - You hear something, right?

234
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,050
Th-The gun, the gun!

235
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,630
The gun? The gun.

236
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,590
Jun Hui!

237
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,390
- Hey, why give this to me— 
 - Hey, shush. Be quiet.

238
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,320
- Be quiet. 
 - Okay.

239
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,810
One, two, three.

240
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,960
Shit, what the heck?

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,650
- Wh-What the heck? 
 - Who could they be?

242
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,400
Aren't those the reinforcements?

243
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,740
I'll—

244
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,720
Just stay put for a moment here.

245
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,900
- Gosh, why are we hiding? 
 - Be quiet.

246
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,570
We need to ask them about outside!

247
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,100
Hey, are you an idiot?

248
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,410
We don't know what kind of people they are.

249
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,670
What if they came to steal our stuff?

250
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,660
- Daebak. 
 - Gosh.

251
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,750
- Hey. 
 - What?

252
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,500
I'll go take a look.

253
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Stay right here.

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,130
- Stay put. 
 - Okay.

255
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,830
Why? Why? What's wrong?

256
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,450
H-He's right in front of us.

257
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,930
 Go! Go charge! 

258
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,490
Just stay still!

259
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,820
Hey, they got loads of food here!

260
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,470
- Wow, really? 
 - Really?

261
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,150
- Yes, there is! 
 - Nice.

262
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,940
Awesome!

263
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,040
Hey, there's some here too!

264
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,350
Wait, where are they going??

265
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,740
Gosh, that's my food. My food!

266
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,120
Hey, be quiet, for goodness sake!

267
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,260
- They can hear us! 
 - They're taking my food—

268
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,870
Chi Yeol.

269
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,160
What are you thinking about?

270
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,060
What?

271
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,490
Oh, it's nothing.

272
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,740
We don't have any...

273
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,670
clean sheets.

274
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,220
Seriously.

275
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,760
And we need to take blankets, too.

276
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,540
 Should I ask her out now, too? 

277
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,390
 Before Su Cheol takes the lead. 

278
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,470
 What do I do? 

279
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,200
By the way...

280
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,740
lately, I keep...

281
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,370
having anxious thoughts.

282
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,490
We've been on our own for a month now, already.

283
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,820
How would things be in Seoul and other places?

284
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,100
Would it be similar to us?

285
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,970
Our communications are down.

286
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,560
It has been a long time since I got contacted by my parents.

287
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,730
I can't help but imagine the worst.

288
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,460
Will we be able to...

289
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,880
go back to school?

290
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,900
 After the war... we'll return to school. 

291
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,480
Once we go back safely, will you go out with me?

292
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,190
Sorry. I must have

293
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,700
made you feel down as well.

294
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,430
When we're all in the same situation.

295
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,490
I don't think we'll find any here.

296
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,340
So let's try upstairs.

297
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,500
Hey, Na Ra...

298
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,740
by the way...

299
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,980
you know, last night...

300
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,370
Yes?

301
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,380
That night...

302
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,510
did you get a good sleep?

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,310
I mean...

304
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,570
You need to sleep and eat better at times like this to stay healthy.

305
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,340
Staying healthy is the most important thing.

306
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,790
It was a little hard since I couldn't sleep.

307
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,470
But I'm okay.

308
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,990
 The timing is now. 

309
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,360
 Kim Chi Yeol, ask her out. 

310
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,110
 Idiot! Go tell her. 

311
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,630
- Chi Yeol... 
 - Yes?

312
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,840
Thank you...

313
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,330
for worrying about me.

314
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,970
Don't mention it. It's a given.

315
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,710
We're friends.

316
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,390
True. Let's go.

317
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:36,880
   

318
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,550
I also wanted to go to med school.

319
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,670
My mother has been sick ever since I was young.

320
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,700
But my grades weren't good enough.

321
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,330
So I switched to nursing school.

322
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,150
But I'm not sure if I'll even make it in there.

323
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,970
My first preference was also med school when I was in second year.

324
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,380
You can go then. Aren't your grades more than good enough?

325
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,950
Well...

326
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,640
Med school costs too much and takes too long.

327
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,010
I think it would be better for me to just get a scholarship

328
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,960
at a regular college and take the public office exam later.

329
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,920
Hey, you need to think about the bigger picture.

330
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,090
Don't you know you make more money as a doctor?

331
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,790
My family can't afford to wait that long.

332
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,090
And I need to get a job as soon as possible

333
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,400
in order for my younger siblings to be able to afford college, too.

334
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,020
Oh...

335
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,930
That's a surprise.

336
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,770
What is?

337
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,870
You're a good son. Your parents must be proud of you.

338
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,580
It's nothing.

339
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,060
Guys! The dispensary is over here!

340
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,650
- Hurry up and come! 
 - Okay!

341
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,220
Let's go.

342
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,400
Gosh, this place is full of useful medicine. Look at this.

343
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,890
Thinking about wasting time in pharmacies so far annoys me.

344
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,550
Right, we need to bring antibiotics and blood thinners.

345
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,140
We can treat frostbites with those.

346
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,050
Really? Gosh, Jun Hui will be so happy.

347
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,570
Oh, and we also need cold meds and antifungals.

348
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,510
Okay.

349
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,060
Forget it. Let's just take everything here.

350
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,040
Yes, let's do that.

351
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,880
That's right.

352
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,730
S-So Yeon, So Yeon, I-I'll do it! I'll—

353
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,510
Hey, Yeong Su, this one too.

354
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,910
That too?`

355
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,780
Yeong Su, one second. This one too.

356
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,050
Th-This is...

357
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,270
 - H-Hey, hey!  
 - Are you okay?

358
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,110
Gosh... 
    

359
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,220
What am I doing?

360
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,700
Kim Chi Yeol, what are you doing?

361
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,330
Why regret now when you couldn't say a word before?

362
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,900
Gosh, you had the perfect chance earlier— Wow...

363
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,790
Oh, shit. This is crazy.

364
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,580
All right.

365
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,080
I haven't had chocolate bars in forever.

366
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,390
Thank you for the food.

367
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,320
Jackpot.

368
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,420
It fits, it fits. Nice!

369
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,740
All right, I found it. How many do I have here?

370
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,020
It'll easily last a month.

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,890
Gosh, please. Please.

372
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,240
Yes! Yes...

373
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,250
What a relief.

374
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,200
Just in case...

375
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,340
if by chance, I happen to die,

376
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,540
I wouldn't even get to ask you out, which is why I'm recording this.

377
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,090
Na Ra, from the moment I first saw you,

378
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,020
I have fallen—

379
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,300
fallen...

380
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,980
This isn't it.

381
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,710
If we ever go back to school, would you go—

382
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,730
g-go... Aigo.

383
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,280
I just l-like— Gosh!

384
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Aigo, shit! What a useless mouth I have.

385
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,840
Su Cheol was one brave asshole.

386
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,270
I'm this nervous just recording this by myself.

387
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,560
But he did it in front of Na Ra.

388
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,720
Kudos to you. I acknowledge you.

389
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,600
 What do you want to do then? Just go back like this?  

390
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,020
  Just give up everything at this point? 

391
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,080
 Do you want to just confess everything now? 

392
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,190
 Do you think they'll just go and understand me then? 

393
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,810
Gosh.

394
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,630
Hey, is anyone there?

395
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,800
Why?

396
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,730
Well, I just thought I heard something.

397
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,300
- Were you with someone?  
 - No, I was by myself.

398
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,770
Oh, really?

399
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,010
Why? What did you hear?

400
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,810
So the thing is...

401
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,300
Never mind. I must have been hearing things.

402
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,330
Why aren't you asking me about what happened yesterday?

403
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,980
Oh, yesterday?

404
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,230
How did it go?

405
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,390
Na Ra said yes. We're dating now.

406
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,770
- I'm kidding! 
 - Oh...

407
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,220
I told her to take her time.

408
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,650
However, I won't give up even if she rejects me.

409
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,320
I'll keep going at her until she accepts my feelings.

410
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,740
O-Oh... okay.

411
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,530
What's wrong?

412
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,270
Does it make you nervous to have a rival?

413
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,490
Hey, what are you saying?

414
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,950
I know you like Na Ra, too.

415
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,340
Wait, how would you know that?

416
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,500
You only look at Na Ra every day.

417
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,180
Am I wrong?

418
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,320
 - Guys, where are you? 
 - Chi Yeol! 

419
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey, they're looking for us.

420
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,310
Let's go.

421
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,680
   

422
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,360
Excuse me, Ajeossi.

423
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,330
Ajeossi, are you really sick?

424
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,250
Ajeossi...

425
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,350
You fucking bitch!

426
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,530
Cigarettes are nowhere to be found.

427
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,150
I guess people never leave cigarettes behind, no matter where they go.

428
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,340
Seriously.

429
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,420
Didn't you hear something just now?

430
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
- Where's No Ae Sol? 
 - What?

431
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,230
Where the heck is No Ae Sol?

432
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,260
Wasn't she with you?

433
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,510
Gosh.

434
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,830
Why didn't you open the door? Why?

435
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,900
Why don't you listen to me, you fucking bitch?

436
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,180
Why do you make me a bad person, you fucking wench?

437
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,910
I thought I was going to die, locked up in here.

438
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,350
You cute little thing.

439
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,250
Thank you.

440
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,010
What is he saying?

441
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,760
I don't know.

442
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,340
What are you doing? Hurry and come.

443
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,000
- You go ahead. 
 - Come on, I finished scanning.

444
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,730
You go on ahead!

445
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,890
Gosh, forget it.

446
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,380
Shit.

447
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,830
Gosh.

448
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,180
Map of Development Plan and Search Status?

449
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,780
Whoa, look at their works.

450
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,590
They were quite structured.

451
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,310
Hey, it looks like they don't even have a commander.

452
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,380
Seriously.

453
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,710
Are they just innocent or just fools?

454
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,830
It looks like they even took a vote.

455
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,930
Hey, I saw earlier how they saved a lot of food too.

456
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,650
Hey! Take a look at this.

457
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,290
They even saved a lot of the DU ammo.

458
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,250
- How many do they have? 
 - They have more than 800!

459
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,950
Hey, let's ask them to give us some.

460
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,290
N-No, I'm too shy.

461
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,020
I'll do the asking.

462
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,150
Gosh, you cutie.

463
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,680
Hey, hey, they've got a lot of female students!

464
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,200
Female students? Let me see.

465
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,780
Wow, how many are there?

466
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,120
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 

467
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,550
- There's ten of them! 
 - Hey!

468
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,960
- Are you happy? 
 - I'm very happy.

469
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,500
I'm not that happy.

470
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,470
I hope they're more lady-like, unlike you guys, right?

471
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,660
Seriously, I'm sure they're different from people who only have XX chromosomes.

472
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,310
- Gosh, that was good. 
 - And you just have an X face.

473
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,890
- Hey. 
 -  Wh-Whoa. 

474
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,450
I'll really kill you.

475
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,690
Hey, just shoot him.

476
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,890
Don't hesitate.

477
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,330
Hands in the air!

478
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,240
Hands in the air.

479
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,700
- You, move aside. 
 - Y-Yes.

480
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Hurry now. What are you doing?

481
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,440
- Hey, hands in the air! 
 - Put them up properly!

482
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,480
Science Tech High?

483
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,270
What the heck? They're third years like us.

484
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,100
I got scared for no reason.

485
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,770
Don't be scared.

486
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:32,380
Science Tech High means Science Technical High School, right?

487
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,950
What's wrong with her?

488
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,890
Yes, Science Technical High School.

489
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,890
But you didn't look that nerdy, so we misunderstood.

490
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,760
Oh, this.

491
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,700
I just did it because I'm normally not allowed.

492
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,860
Also, it's a stereotype to think everyone who's good at studying is a nerd.

493
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,850
I've never seen students from the Science Tech High before.

494
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,820
I guess you guys are really good at studying, right?

495
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,340
Well, we're not bad.

496
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,360
Hey, you're the last place in our class.

497
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,450
Who cares? There are three more below me.

498
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,950
Big whoops. Same shit.

499
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,710
I couldn't care less.

500
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,650
But why did you come here?

501
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,200
We were just passing by, and it looked like there were people in here.

502
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,850
By the way, is it just the th-three of you?

503
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,640
No, other kids went out on operations.

504
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,830
We're just guarding the base camp.

505
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,470
Gosh.

506
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,150
Hey, why would you tell them our info when we don't even know if they're friend or foe?

507
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,740
Are they spheres?

508
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,110
What foe are you talking about?

509
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,750
You don't know what kind of people they are.

510
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,190
Also, what's up with your speech?

511
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,820
What's wrong with my speech?

512
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,720
It's too cute!

513
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,020
Gosh, I always had a cute speech!

514
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,370
And why do you care about my speech?

515
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,490
- I'm just worried! 
 - Did I ask you to be?

516
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,870
My heart is the one. It's telling me to worry!

517
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,720
- Hey, you two are dating, are you? 
 - Well...

518
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,480
- Is it that obvious? 
 - It is.

519
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,390
Oh, it is?

520
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,520
Gosh!

521
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,500
Just forget about those two.

522
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,590
So where are you all headed?

523
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,530
- To Seoul. 
 - Seoul?

524
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,370
Yes, we're on our way to the Seoul Evacuation Camp.

525
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,790
Do you want to come with us?

526
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,110
To Seoul? Just by yourselves?

527
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,820
All right. Let's go together if you're going, too. What do you think?

528
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,200
- Hey, that sounds great. 
 - I'm down.

529
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,570
- Me, too. 
 - N-No...

530
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,500
we have to stay here. We agreed to move altogether.

531
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,710
That's how we were, too. But we agreed to go separate ways this time.

532
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,160
What?

533
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,890
What about the other kids?

534
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,590
They stayed behind and are still doing operations.

535
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,390
Aigo, even the CSAT got cancelled.

536
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,350
Why are they so stuck up like that?

537
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,030
Seriously.

538
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,630
What did you say just now?

539
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,860
I don't know why they are so stuck up like that.

540
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,890
N-No, before that.

541
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,480
CSAT got cancelled? Is that true?

542
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,210
Yes.

543
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,930
Hey...

544
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,390
did you guys not know?

545
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,710
W-Wait, CSAT really got cancelled?

546
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,700
How did you guys find out about that?

547
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,040
Each battalion was notified through their transceivers.

548
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,620
You guys didn't hear about it?

549
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,340
We didn't.

550
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,400
- Our transceiver has been broken. 
 - Wow...

551
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,990
Wait, then you guys have been operating on your own with a broken transceiver? Wow...

552
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,430
It must have been tough.

553
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,060
Hey, tell us more in detail.

554
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,050
Did CSAT really get cancelled? Are we all to retreat then?

555
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,820
Are we dismissed or what?

556
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,990
We're not dismissed. Although CSAT got cancelled,

557
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,510
they told us to keep operating as planned since we'll get extra credit on next year's CSAT.

558
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,120
He's right. But we had different opinions.

559
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,780
We couldn't trust what they were saying anymore,

560
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,850
and as you can see, we were all just too tired as well.

561
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,430
So you guys are retreating by yourselves.

562
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,860
No, I'm sure other schools all got the message, too.

563
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,150
We need to retreat to Seoul then.

564
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,680
Why stay here when CSAT got cancelled?

565
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,340
Let's tell the other kids when they come back and retreat.

566
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,420
- Did you... 
 - Jun Hui...

567
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,080
- Did you really get notified? 
 - let's go back to Seoul.

568
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,280
I just want to hear it directly. Couldn't you tell them about our battalion for us, please?

569
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,530
But our transceiver is with the guys who stayed behind.

570
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,140
Gosh.

571
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,750
Do you want us to fix your transceiver?

572
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,880
What? You can fix it?

573
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,910
No.

574
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,620
It's him, not me. I'm sure this guy can fix it.

575
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,590
He even competed and won at a science competition.

576
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,520
Really? Can you really fix it?

577
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,020
I'm not sure.

578
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,490
I'll need to take a look first.

579
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,190
- This is what it looks like, right? 
 - Daebak.

580
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,680
- It turns on, but you can't communicate, right? 
 - Yes.

581
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,000
Why? What's wrong?

582
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,020
- I don't think this can be fixed. 
 - Gosh.

583
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,530
You were all talk, huh. Aigo.

584
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,090
Listen. This is PRC-999K, all right?

585
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,970
If you look at the lower left corner of the front side from where you stand, there's something called a circuit board.

586
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,370
And that's what this is.

587
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,930
Dumb it down for us.

588
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,700
- Look over here. This square thing is what varies the frequency. 
 - Okay.

589
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,140
- But you're missing two of them. 
 - Really?

590
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,280
- Daebak. 
 - He's right!

591
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,570
- Gosh, what is he saying? 
 - I told you to dumb it down!

592
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,580
Aigo, seriously. I'm saying they're missing completely!

593
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:06,960
Wait, so you're saying it's not working because those things are missing.

594
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,920
- Did it come off from bumping into something? 
 - Is that it?

595
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,530
It's impossible for these to come off unless a person removes them intentionally.

596
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:24,480
He's saying it's not broken. Someone removed them intentionally.

597
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,110
- Intentionally removed them? 
 - Why?

598
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,920
   

599
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,700
What was that?

600
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,330
Who fired? Is there a sphere?

601
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,070
Gosh, what do we do?

602
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,320
That idiot...

603
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,700
- Hey, Yeon Bo Ra, where are you going? 
 - Hurry up and come!

604
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,610
- Gosh. 
 - Wait for us!

605
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,760
Wow, shit. It's real.

606
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,340
Gosh, you got me startled. Fuck.

607
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,440
It's a real gun.

608
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,260
Nice shot, Hyeongnim Myeol Chi.

609
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,010
- Hey, do I look cool? 
 - Yes.

610
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,370
I borrowed your mom's picture for a second, Ajeossi. You saved me.

611
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,880
- Gosh, who would have thought of using it like this? 
 - I got goosebumps here.

612
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,140
Hyeongnim, it's a salute to you.

613
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,280
Thank you very much.

614
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,960
Hey, it would have been better if you had let us out sooner.

615
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,050
Why did you force us to show you our true nature like this?

616
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,180
But we were fortunate that she's so naive.

617
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,410
- We were so close to just dying in here. 
 - Right.

618
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,620
Hey, look how soft her skin is.

619
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,110
- L-Let me touch, too. 
 - Please don't.

620
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,690
- Don't tremble. You're making me horny. 
 - Really?

621
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:16,490
All right, Cutie. What's going on outside right now?

622
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,960
Let's not waste our time and get out quickly.

623
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,080
Ajeossi, don't be so impatient like that. All right?

624
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,130
What if they got soldiers out there?

625
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,560
We need to find out what's going on first. Okay?

626
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,490
I don't know if you were the leader outside or not...

627
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,940
But here, you have to listen to us. Bang.

628
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,860
Wow, you're a good shooter.

629
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,020
All right. Tell this ajeossi here.

630
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,480
What are you hiding from us?

631
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,650
Are you not going to talk?

632
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,630
Please let me go.

633
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,830
Fuck! She's so fucking stubborn.

634
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,210
- Hey, let me see that. 
 - Oh, okay.

635
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,780
Guys, your friend is with us, all right?

636
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,440
Let's all have a meeting!

637
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,790
- Let's have a talk! 
 - Wow, cover your ears!

638
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,650
Shit.

639
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,890
   

640
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,620
There... There is regular ammunition and...

641
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,190
- over two boxes of DU ammunition too. 
 - Really?

642
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,540
Was this a car used to evacuate patients? Why did they just leave it here?

643
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,020
What if they were attacked by spheres?

644
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,670
What's there to complain about? There are a shit ton of DU ammunition.

645
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,800
Is today some special day? Is it our birthdays?

646
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,350
The kids would be happy to see this, right?

647
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,800
What? R-Right!

648
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,930
We even found medicine. I'm so happy.

649
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,710
Yeon Ju, why are you crying? You should smile.

650
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,240
Someone would think we found a gold mine.

651
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,980
Let's pack it up and go. I want to hurry up and see the others' faces.

652
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,450
- I'll pack the DU ammunitions then. 
 - I'll help.

653
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,270
Then the rest of us should go up and pack what we need.

654
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,650
Medicines, blankets, and other things we need.

655
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,840
Okay! Then we'll bring the water containers.

656
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,270
Twenty minutes is enough, right?

657
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,180
We'll meet back here.

658
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,210
- Okay. 
 - Okay!

659
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,040
The kids will be so surprised.

660
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,620
Hey, where's Su Cheol?

661
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,190
What?

662
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,400
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

663
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
Yes? Then take Su Cheol and bring the blankets.

664
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,700
Why should I...

665
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,670
Stop complaining and just do what you're told to do. Everyone else is doing it.

666
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,510
I'll just go instead.

667
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,060
Gosh, I almost had it.

668
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,650
I'll see you later then.

669
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,320
Who is he to order people around?

670
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,080
Your ears hurt, right?

671
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,810
- Aigo, you came so quickly, right? 
 - A-Aigo.

672
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,200
Your friends are here.

673
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,650
Jang Su.

674
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,080
- What are they doing? 
 - What the fuck are you doing?

675
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,640
- You assholes! 
 - What are they doing?

676
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,350
Hey, you motherfucker!

677
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,070
These assholes, do they not understand the situation?

678
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:54,290
Let's go together if we're at war. Say hi to your friends.

679
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,120
- Do you not understand your place, you assholes? 
 - Let her go first.

680
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,160
- Open the door first, you fucker. 
 - I'll open it if you let her go!

681
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,820
Hey, open it first then. Your friend will die otherwise. Okay?

682
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,320
She'll really die, okay?

683
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,940
Fuck, there she goes again.

684
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,920
Hey, kneel down.

685
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,670
She's going to die because of you.

686
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,720
Don't you care? Huh?

687
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,450
She'll really die, all right?

688
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,180
She's not a friend.

689
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,660
That fucking bitch, she better stays still.

690
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,220
- You guys pull up your guns, too. 
 - Bo Ra...

691
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,530
We have seven guns, while they only have one.

692
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,360
Don't you see how Ae Seol is being held hostage?

693
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,750
What the fuck is she doing?

694
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,650
Hey, do you want to see your friend being killed?

695
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,340
I told you she's not a friend.

696
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,540
What kind of friend does as she pleases to put her friends in danger.

697
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,280
Yeon Bo Ra, calm down first.

698
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,860
Bo Ra said the right thing.

699
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,860
There's no need to compromise with criminals.

700
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,190
Hey, we're going to get fucked up here. They got so many guns.

701
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,000
No, no. They're all bluffing. Don't you see their shaky hands?

702
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,660
Fuck...

703
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,920
Hey, you motherfuckers!

704
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,360
Open the door!

705
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,630
I must get the fuck out of there, right now.

706
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,300
If you open this door, no one will get hurt.

707
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,810
Let go of Ae Seol first.

708
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,330
Just go.

709
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,290
I'm also really sorry for causing this situation.

710
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,660
Shut up, you fucking bitch.

711
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,910
Fuck, this fucking junkie.

712
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,330
Why the fuck do you not know your place, you asshole?

713
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,230
It's your fault, you fucker!

714
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,230
- Fuck! 
 - Why can't this fucker understand the situation?

715
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,930
Guys, I-I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

716
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,360
It must hurt.

717
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,030
Gosh, that must hurt. Stand. It's okay.

718
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,610
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it!

719
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,100
- Please don't do it. 
 - Please stop it!

720
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,390
Children, it's time for sex education.

721
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,660
I'll show you how babies are made.

722
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,220
I told you not to do it! Fuck!

723
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,400
Stop!

724
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,330
I told you to stop!

725
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,410
Take your fucking hands off of her!

726
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,790
Should Oppa go first?

727
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,380
Nevermind.

728
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,290
Guys, I'll give you exactly 10 minutes. If you're even a second late...

729
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,400
Then I can't stop these ajeossis.

730
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,400
Gosh, the scent of a woman.

731
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,060
Bo Ra, got it?

732
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,940
Let's just let them out. We don't have a choice.

733
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,930
If we let them out, you think they'll just hand Ae Seol over?

734
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,230
Everyone will be in danger.

735
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,130
Then what should we do? Huh?

736
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,810
Fuck! Those assholes...

737
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,350
Wh-What's that? A sphere?

738
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,610
Where did it suddenly come from?

739
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,360
I know, right? They're getting closer.

740
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,460
What do we do? Do we have a sphere to worry about now too?

741
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,190
It will enter the building in a few minutes at that rate.

742
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,960
We don't have a choice.

743
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,750
Let's let them out.

744
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,520
Fuck, are you sure these kids didn't run away?

745
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,590
Are you sure we're not getting fucked by acting all relaxed?

746
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:41,320
Whether it's a war or whatnot, this means something is happening outside.

747
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:47,160
Then going outside without any preparation could be more dangerous.

748
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,210
Hey, did the spheres or whatever really fall from the sky and cause chaos outside?

749
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,230
Be honest. Where did you guys come from?

750
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,680
Speak up, you bitch!

751
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,280
We should have pressured them earlier. Why give them ten more minutes?

752
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,540
You don't think the kids ran away, do you? Not that I don't trust you, Hyeongnim.

753
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,210
They'll come back. Look at her.

754
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,080
She's young, but she's not even pleading for her life.

755
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,880
She's just covering herself.

756
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,860
Can't you just tell from that? And the way the kids looked at her too.

757
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,970
I won't question you.

758
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,520
- They're here. 
 - See?

759
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,180
Welcome back.

760
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,730
- It's good to see you. 
 - Welcome.

761
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,060
Good to see you.

762
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,640
Two of them aren't here.

763
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,410
Aigo, what's the problem? Maybe they ran away.

764
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,130
Everyone stay back and send over Ae Seol, first.

765
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,060
Come on, doors first.

766
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,590
Hurry and open it. We don't have time for this.

767
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,150
Okay, kids. Let's put down the guns. It's dangerous.

768
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,060
- Far away... 
 - Yes, put them down far away.

769
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,790
- Move them aside. 
 - Right.

770
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,010
Put it down, put it down. Come on.

771
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,620
Why are you so eager to fight?

772
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,570
Put it behind you.

773
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,970
- We don't have time. 
 - We won't hand her over. Yes? No?

774
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,340
Come on.

775
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,800
Hurry, hurry. Gosh.

776
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,910
Okay, open the doors now.

777
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,370
Open them.

778
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,560
- That's right. 
 - Let's hurry up.

779
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,210
Insert the key.

780
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,410
And if you turn it...

781
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,520
the doors will open.

782
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,230
You're smart. Good job.

783
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,740
You should receive an award.

784
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,210
Hand over Ae Seol, now.

785
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,390
Ae Seol? Who's Ae Seol?

786
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,860
Why so serious?

787
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,760
Hey, hey! You can go. Go on. Send her.

788
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,670
Ae Seol.

789
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,340
It's okay. Let's go.

790
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,700
Let's go.

791
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,580
- Ae Seol, you hung in there. 
 - It was brief, but we were sincere.

792
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,300
Go.

793
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,090
She's going now, Kids.

794
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,000
I think this is all of it.

795
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,950
I'm exhausted.

796
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,520
Why aren't the others coming?

797
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,300
What is that? What's that sound?

798
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,780
What's wrong? What—

799
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,050
Just kidding!

800
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,010
- We were kidding. 
 - Run!

801
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:48,060
Bang, bang, bang! One kill, two kill! What's three in English?

802
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,840
Shoot gently or they'll bleed!

803
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,380
We're finally getting out of here!

804
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,750
   

805
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,000
I have no choice, even if you criticize me.

806
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,890
I no longer know if my actions are right.

807
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,150
But...

808
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:10,550
I want to end everything.

809
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:28,460


810
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:31,470
