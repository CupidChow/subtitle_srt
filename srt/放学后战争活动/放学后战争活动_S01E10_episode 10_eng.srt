1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,280
   

2
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,070
   

3
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,850
I don't think I can walk anymore.

4
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
 (Map depicting route to Seoul) 

5
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,640
   

6
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,110
We've been walking two days straight, but we still have 100 kilometers to go?

7
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,190
Hey, are we even going the right way?

8
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,160
Yes, it's this way.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,270
I can't feel my feet.

10
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,730
I don't think I can walk anymore.

11
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,940
I'm so hungry.

12
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,730
We don't have much to eat anymore either.

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,730
Oh, there's a car over there.

14
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,110
Oh!

15
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,720
Why?

16
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,890
   

17
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,670
What's that?

18
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,820
   

19
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,810
Geez, the spheres got them.

20
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,860
Oh my gosh.

21
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,270
These guys...

22
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,600
What's wrong?

23
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,660
It's them, right?

24
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,630
These are the kids who came to our base.

25
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,250
The Science and Tech High School kids...

26
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,770
They were on their way to Seoul... but what the heck...

27
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,890
They all died here.

28
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,570
Oh, geez.

29
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,710
Oh, damn.

30
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,790
Guys!

31
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,010
We have to go back.

32
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,380
Hey, let's go!

33
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,890
Let's go and get our extra points.

34
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,020
The CSAT may not have been cancelled!

35
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,370
Go if you want to.

36
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,370
Hey, we...

37
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,820
we've suffered too much just to earn those scores.

38
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,930
We can't die a pointless death like they did!

39
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,840
Yeon Ju, try to stop them.

40
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,990
They're not listening to me now!

41
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,180
Shit, do you know how many spheres I caught so far?

42
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,350
Here, look!

43
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,210
Fuck! Thirty-seven of them!

44
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,400
Seriously, if we calculate all this,

45
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,320
I can go to Seoul National University!

46
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,100
Hey Guk Yeong Su, are you still going on about the points?

47
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,330
Just stop.

48
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,150
Guys.

49
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,930
Hey, are you guys going to die like them?

50
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,280
No, right?

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
Please convince them.

52
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,860
I beg you.

53
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeon Ju! Yeon Ju! Everybody, please come to your senses!

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
Fuck!

56
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,570
Let's go.

57
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,160
Jang Su, let's try to convince them. Please don't go.

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,560
Wait, no! I really can't die like this!

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,820
I want to live! I have to live.

60
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,880
   

61
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,680
   

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
   

63
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,580
   

64
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,440
   

65
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:07,040


66
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,980
   

67
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,600
- Sit down. 
 - Oh!

68
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,140
Let's rest here a while and eat something.

69
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,240
It's so cold.

70
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,560
Oh!

71
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,280
Found it!

72
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,870
Look, Jun Hui!

73
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,890
Oh, it's all gone bad.

74
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,240
- There's food here! 
 - Here too!

75
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,970
- Where? 
 - Here!

76
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,520
Oh, my gosh!

77
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,510
Put everything in there! Here!

78
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,140
- There's more. 
 - More?

79
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,870
This would be really good warmed up.

80
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,200
Yes, they did have a microwave inside.

81
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,180
At least we have this. Let's just eat.

82
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,800
I'll check if there's a generator.

83
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,110
- Be careful. 
 - I'll go with you.

84
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,870
Let's go.

85
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,130
Should we ask them to eat with us?

86
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,900
I don't want to.

87
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeon Ju.

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm still so angry.

89
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,210
I can't forgive them for deceiving us.

90
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,080
But those guys we saw earlier from the other group,

91
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,350
they also disagreed, so only eight of them were going to Seoul.

92
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,320
When I saw their dead bodies,

93
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,420
I felt that it could have been us if we had split up.

94
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,440
In the end, Yu Jeong and Jang Su weren't entirely wrong.

95
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,190
Right. At first,

96
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,020
I was so angry and felt betrayed, but

97
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,990
they tried their best in their own way.

98
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,520
We all know that.

99
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,230
Hey, Guys.

100
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,690
What?

101
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,810
Come here and eat. Don't just sit there staring.

102
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,520
Okay.

103
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,610
What are you doing? Hurry.

104
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,930
Hey, Tae Man.

105
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,860
Kwon Il Ha.

106
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,560
Hurry and come here.

107
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm sorry.

108
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,870
Eat.

109
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,310
Me, too.

111
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,570
Here.

112
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey, is it that good?

113
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,500
It's good.

114
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,850
By the way, it's been so long since I saw an amusement park.

115
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,990
It was fun when we went with the boys from the other class.

116
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,840
What do you mean? Don't you remember when your ex puked after riding the Viking?

117
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,340
Oh yes, that punk.

118
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,190
I should have just gone with my classmates before all this happened.

119
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:41,460
Oh yes, earlier in the semester, Su Cheol had said he wanted to go to the amusement park.

120
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,080
We weren't close then, so I flaked on him.

121
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,020
I should have come with him then.

122
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,630
What's going on?

123
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,170
It's lighting up.

124
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,040
What's going on?

125
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,200
- Hey, this eonni made it happen! 
 - Daebak!

126
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,390
- Daebak! 
 - I did.

127
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,690
I did.

128
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,580
What? Hey!

129
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,750
- Oh, my gosh, really. 
 - Really.

130
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,200
What are you doing?

131
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,550
Hey, let's just ride these!

132
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,830
- Really? 
 - Ride them?

133
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,350
- Yes, let's ride them! 
 - Really?

134
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,710
Hey, what if the spheres show up.

135
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,310
There aren't any in the area.

136
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,750
As long as we aren't too loud, shouldn't it be okay?

137
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,220
- Right. 
 - Yes.

138
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,730
- Let's ride! 
 - Yes.

139
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,700
Let's ride!

140
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,980
- Yes. 
 - Let's ride.

141
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,400
Shall we?

142
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,810
It's really pretty.

143
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,210
Let's try it.

144
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,930
♫  I play a game. If this is hell  ♫

151
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,940
♫  Will the ground that was soaked with rain turn into nourishment?  ♫

152
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,360

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,590
♫  New disc that won't shut me down  ♫

168
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,100
♫  Yes, I'll be the virus now  ♫

169
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,740
♫  I will reboot the new disc that won't shut me down  ♫

170
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,890
Now, this is the final play-off!

171
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,430
Who will be the best sharpshooter?

172
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,460
Na Ra!

173
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,580
 Lee Na Ra! Lee Na Ra! 

174
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,690
 Lee Na Ra! 

175
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,900
Now!

176
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,290
Bo Ra!

177
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,520
 - Yeon Bo Ra! Yeon Bo Ra! 
 - Boo! 

178
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,920
 - Boo! 
 - Yeon Bo Ra! Yeon Bo Ra! 

179
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,250
Shhh.

180
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,130
Get Ready.

181
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,060
Fire!

182
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,930
Go, go!

183
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,600
 -  Na Ra! Na Ra ! 
 - Bo Ra! Bo Ra! 

184
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,920
Are they little kids? Really, why are they so into a game?

185
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,180
So childish.

186
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,150
That's what I mean.

187
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,870
How do we look?

188
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,350
Hi, Guys!

189
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,330
Wow.

190
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,550
I can't tell who is more childish.

191
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,490
You guys are really something.

192
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,080
Fuck, this is not the time for this!

193
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,590
They're all crazy. They completely lost their minds.

194
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,110
It's been days since I last studied.

195
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,440
What if I forgot everything?

196
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,740
Wait a minute.

197
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,630
A square is B square plus C square minus...

198
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,460
2bc cosine...

199
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,960
Come on, try to remember!

200
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,280
B square is A square plus C square...

201
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,420
minus A...

202
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,770
Are you studying here too? Why aren't you having fun with the others?

203
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,800
Let's go and relieve some stress.

204
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,880
Fuck. You think now is the time? They're all dead.

205
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,660
We have to hurry and check if the CSAT has been cancelled or not.

206
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,520
I know you're frustrated, but you have to accept reality.

207
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,390
They'll probably have the CSAT next year.

208
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,820
Let's just think of this as our leave of absence.

209
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,590
Leave of absence? Bastard.

210
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,820
Only guys like you have a second chance.

211
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,290
Sure, you guys have after-school prep school and tutoring,

212
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,850
but not all of us can afford that.

213
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,110
- She lost. 
 - What did I do?

214
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,720
What do you mean?

215
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,240
- She's coming. 
 - Bo Ra.

216
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,180
Bo Ra, it's okay to lose. It happens!

217
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,010
Say something.

218
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,690
There's another game we can play.

219
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,300
What do you think? Do you want to go?

220
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,920
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

221
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,720
- Yes? 
 - No.

222
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,800
- What? 
 - Geez, why are you like that?

223
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,890
Bo Ra is pissed!

224
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,500
- Bo Ra! 
 - We'll go with you!

225
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,070
Let's try this.

226
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,800
 Yeon Bo Ra! Yeon Bo Ra! 

227
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,980
 - Yeon Bo Ra! 
 - Woohoo! 

228
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,520
 - You won last time, right? 
 - That's right. 

229
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,780
 One, two, three! 

230
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,590
I'm the one who fought with Su Cheol at the hospital.

231
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,020
What?

232
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,160
 Are you crazy? Why did you bring this all the way here? 

233
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,390
 You should have gotten rid of it! 

234
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,980
 I just forgot. 

235
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,870
 That's no excuse. What if the others find out we switched them? 

236
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,700
 Fuck. I can't keep up with this shit. 

237
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,850
 What? 

238
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,590
 I'm talking about lying to the others. I can't do it anymore. 

239
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,750
 Do you want to just confess everything now? 

240
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,900
 - Do you think they would be understanding? 
 - Fuck, I don't know! 

241
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,200
 But this is not it. 

242
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,630
 What do you want to do then? Just go back like this?  

243
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,190
 Just run away like this? 

244
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,550
 Hey. 

245
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,870
 You've really become a crazy asshole these days. 

246
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,840
 Get a hold of yourself. 

247
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,980
 Hey, is anyone there? 

248
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,120
 Why? 

249
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,000
 Well, I just thought I heard something. 

250
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,120
 Were you with someone? 

251
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,520
 No, I was by myself. 

252
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,670
 Oh, really? 

253
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,360
He died because of me.

254
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,650
Yeong Hun died because of me, too.

255
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,800
Do I bring bad luck to friends

256
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,120
because I'm a cursed asshole?

257
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,230
Hey.

258
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,260
Did you summon those too?

259
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,050
What?

260
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,860
Did you bring the spheres?

261
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,600
Did you make the spheres fight us?

262
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,810
No, right?

263
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,050
Yeong Hun and Su Cheol didn't die because of you.

264
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,510
It wasn't because of you or any of us.

265
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,910
Why did I live like such an idiot?

266
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,590
Fuck.

267
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,860
We're all idiots.

268
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,720
Even signing those consent forms because we were told to. Fuck.

269
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,350
Why are you hesitating? Just smash it and take what you want.

270
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,600
No one is going to know anyway.

271
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,310
It's so frustrating.

272
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,570
I was saving this one for when I'm returning home.

273
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,800
Don't tell anyone else, especially Kwon Il Ha.

274
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,620
The people I hated most in this world were those who inconvenience others.

275
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,360
Since my dad was like that.

276
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,010
That's why I got annoyed every time I saw you.

277
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,950
But I realized I was wrong. You're not a pest.

278
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,190
If you think about it, not being able to load your gun fast

279
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,850
and not being able to shoot is normal.

280
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,390
Freezing at the sight of monsters and trying to help others in trouble,

281
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,800
that are all obviously normal things to do.

282
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,700
Why? Am I stating the obvious?

283
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,170
I don't know what I'm saying.

284
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,190
I can shoot well now, too.

285
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,650
That's right, you do.

286
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,540
But you know I'm a little better, right?

287
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,440
Aigo.

288
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,870
Let's take a picture together!

289
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,850
It's not the same if you're not in it!

290
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,740
So let's go!

291
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,710
Wait up!

292
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,850
Shall we go, too?

293
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,600
Yes.

294
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,510
- Okay, let's take it. 
  - One, two, three! 

295
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,110
Hey!

296
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,530
Stop it!

297
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,320
It stinks!

298
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,840
It's great!

299
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,900
- Like this! 
 - Oh my gosh!

300
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,400
 One, two, three! 

301
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,950
What is this?

302
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,530
- What is this? 
 - This is better.

303
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,730
- Let me see. 
 - Wow, it came out well.

304
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,630
Daebak, you came out so pretty!

305
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,540
- Why did I come out like this? 
 - Look at this!

306
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,990
- Kim Deok Jung. 
 - His picture did come out cute.

307
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,230
Let's take one altogether!

308
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,270
- I like that! 
 - Oh, yes!

309
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,900
- Yes, that's a good idea! 
 - Yes, let's do that!

310
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,190
- Good, good! 
  - Let's take one! 

311
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,070
But we can't all fit, can we?

312
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,610
- Yeah, it is a little tight. 
 - That's true.

313
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,240
Chi Yeol, can't we take it with your camcorder?

314
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,160
- Oh yes, we can! 
 - That's a good idea!

315
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,740
- Can we take it? 
  - Oh, yes! 

316
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,170
Come on, come closer.

317
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,170
Everyone is here, right?

318
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,000
Where are Jang Su and So Yeon?

319
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,680
Yeong Su's not here, either.

320
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,780
Let's just go ahead and take one for now. They can come later.

321
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,280
Kimchi, ready?

322
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,030
- Okay, one two three! 
  - Kimchi! 

323
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,470
Wait, I need to put in the memory card.

324
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,100
 - Geez.  
 - Oh my gosh.

325
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,610
- My god. 
 - Hurry.

326
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,860
- Hey! 
 - Let's hurry.

327
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,320
- What's taking so long, my arms are going to fall off! 
 - Oh.

328
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,800
What is this?

329
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,570
What?

330
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,520
For now, I need to convince Mom.

331
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,610
Wait.

332
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,320
It wouldn't work even if I repeated a year.

333
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,300
I'm sure they'll catch up to me in no time.

334
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,430
Then I can't go to college and will be seen as a failure for the rest of my life.

335
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,260
In the end, I'll just be like Mom and Dad.

336
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,860
Oh, fuck.

337
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,390
   

338
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,600
I-It's not cancelled!

339
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,810
I need to let the others know!

340
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:13,730
See, I knew it! I knew it! There's no way it would be cancelled!

341
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,950
What are you doing here by yourself?

342
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,860
What about you? Standing there, guarding by yourself?

343
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,930
Do you want to look like a model student?

344
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:00,420
I guess I wanted to protect you guys like the platoon leader did.

346
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,420
As if I'm anything.

347
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,480
Hey.

348
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,440
We're still only students.

349
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,930
We don't have that kind of responsibility.

350
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,560
I'll be twenty in a month.

351
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,590
Do you think being twenty makes everyone an adult?

352
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,150
Then how old do you have to be to become an adult?

353
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,500
It's not about how old you are,

354
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,910
but about being responsible for your actions.

355
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,220
That would make someone an adult.

356
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,690
Like our platoon leader.

357
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,350
I miss him.

358
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,370
Me, too.

359
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,630
I miss him.

360
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,110
 What is this? Kim Chi is so clumsy, leaving this on. 

361
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,780
 What, he left without turning it off? 

362
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,480
 I'm sorry. I'm the one who broke the comms device. 

363
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,170
 You guys will be very surprised when you find out, 

364
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,290
 and probably angry. 

365
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:59,280
 When we were in school, I really hated preparing for college entrance exams 

366
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,360
 and going to after-school prep studies. 

367
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,720
 But... 

368
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,250
 now when I look back, 

369
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,640
 those were the good days. 

370
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,420
 I just want this war to be over 

371
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,930
 so we can hurry and go back to those days. 

372
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,260
 In order to do that, we have to get rid of all of them. 

373
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,950
 I'm going to get rid of all these bastards. 

374
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,720
 Especially the spheres that killed our platoon leader. 

375
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,670
 Oh! 

376
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,630
 Yeah, this way! 

377
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,480
 I got you! 

378
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,810
That's a relief.

379
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,080
I mean, what I'm saying is...

380
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,750
I know...

381
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,610
what you mean.

382
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,900
So Yeon! So Yeon!

383
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,920
You scared me! What are you doing here?

384
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,640
Look! They didn't cancel the entrance exams!

385
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,860
What are you talking about?

386
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,150
Look at this!

387
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,180
The guys are mistaken.

388
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,580
   

389
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,740
This means we need to make sure we still have the grades we earned before.

390
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,210
So quickly tell the others and—

391
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,430
Where are you going?

392
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,580
This is an old newspaper.

393
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,700
Get a hold of yourself.

394
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,050
What?

395
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,890
I-I'm sure I saw it right.

396
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,530
I read it earlier!

397
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,330
Hey, no matter how badly you want to go to college,

398
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,480
don't you think this is going too far?

399
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,260
No! I did see it earlier!

400
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,160
But maybe I dropped it on my way.

401
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,190
The entrance exams aren't cancelled. Really.

402
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,040
Let go.

403
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,950
You want to follow our platoon leader's orders, too.

404
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,320
He told us to complete the mission.

405
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,270
It hurts. I told you to let go.

406
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,930
Why do you keep avoiding me?

407
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,210
Why? Do I smell?

408
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,060
I'm better than Jo Jang Su.

409
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,760
When I go to a better university than Jo Jang Su, I'll treat you better than he can!

410
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Are you crazy?

411
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,650
What nonsense.

412
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,930
Don't you realize the serious situation we're in right now?

413
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,720
I saw you and Jo Jang Su kissing each other.

414
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,700
Is this a fucking time to be kissing?

415
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,950
What the hell are you talking about?

416
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,370
Let go. Let go of me, you crazy asshole!

417
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,700
So Yeon.

418
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,000
So Yeon.

419
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,780
So Yeon.

420
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,140
So Yeon. Oh!

421
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,220
So Yeon. So Yeon, wake up.

422
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,560
Open your eyes! So Yeon!

423
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,900
Oh, no!

424
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,840
So Yeon. I messed up, I'm sorry!

425
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,650
Open your eyes. So Yeon! So Yeon!

426
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,390
Hurry and open your eyes, So Yeon.

427
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,610
 Fucking pervert. 

428
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,910
 But what's this smell? 

429
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,660
 I've been smelling something similar to the spheres from earlier. 

430
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,180
 Their unique fishy smell. 

431
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,550
Fucking bitch.

432
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,790
You think you're that much better than me?

433
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,200
Ignoring me.

434
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,280
Why don't you believe me?

435
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,910
Hey.

436
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,470
So Yeon.

437
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,100
So Yeon.

438
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,850
Cha So Yeon.

439
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,010
Fuck, what are you doing...

440
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,860
Geez! Let's live properly now, Kwon Il Ha...

441
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,260
What is he doing?

442
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,870
Shit.

443
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,450
Hey, fucking asshole, are you out of your mind?

444
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,180
I saw everything since earlier, you motherfucker!

445
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,920
Fuck, are you really crazy?

446
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,050
Wh-What did you see?

447
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,780
She passed out, so I was just giving her CPR!

448
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,440
Cut the bullshit, you son of a bitch.

449
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,670
Fuck, what's wrong with you?

450
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,930
What's this? What's wrong with her? Did you do this?

451
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,970
- No, it's not me! 
 - Fuck...

452
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,500
Cha So Yeon, are you okay?

453
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,100
Hey, just open your eyes.

454
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,830
Fuck.

455
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,120
Why are you like this?

456
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,070
Shit. Hey, Cha So Yeon!

457
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,440
Shit. What do I do?

458
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,660
What should I do? Cha So Yeon!

459
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,310
Cha So Yeon!

460
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,300
What are you doing, you crazy bastard?

461
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,310
Are you going to tell?

462
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,290
Are you going to tell the others?

463
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,050
- What will you do if I do? 
 - Don't tell them!

464
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,670
If you do, I'll kill you.

465
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,280
If you tell them, my life is over.

466
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,390
I can't end my life like this.

467
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,300
- What? 
 - Fuck, don't say anything!

468
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,040
- Already because of you... 
 - Okay!

469
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,830
I won't say anything. Everything's fine as long as I don't say anything, right?

470
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,860
Really?

471
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,750
Yeah, really.

472
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,380
Fucking asshole!

473
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,110
Shit!

474
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,950
You shit!

475
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,670
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

476
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,690
Oh, Cha So Yeon. Are you awake now?

477
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,070
It's me, Il Ha. Open your eyes!

478
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,150
Cha So Yeon. Cha So Yeon!

479
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,410
Cha So Yeon! Cha So Yeon!

480
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,600
Cha So Yeon.

481
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,050
Fucking asshole!

482
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,750
Oh, fuck.

483
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,180
- Wow! 
 - It's so fun!

484
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,880
Don't you want to ride with us?

485
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,890
- Why aren't you riding? 
 - Come on, hurry!

486
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,780
- Why not? 
 - Hi, Jang Su!

487
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,200
- Hi, Jang Su! 
 - Come on, get on!

488
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,370
-  Jo Jang Su! 
 - Just get on!

489
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,370
- Get on! 
 - Oh geez.

490
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,010
This is so lame for our closing act.

491
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,710
Why? Horses are fine.

492
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,420
We are all going round and round, so we don't have to worry about

493
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,800
who's first or catching up to anyone.

494
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,500
- What are you talking about? 
 - Jo Yeong Sin, you make a good point.

495
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,960
Since we are going round and round,

496
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,390
there's no first place

497
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,640
or catching up to anyone.

498
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,950
- Hey! 
 - What!

499
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,750
Oh, shit.

500
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,210
No, I will catch up!

501
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,700
Let's go, Mustang! Yee-haw!

502
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,030
I can't fall behind. Yee-haw!

503
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,530
- Oh! 
 - What's that?

504
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,820
What's that sound?

505
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,640
- Was that a gun shot? 
 - Yes, it was.

506
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,180
What's going on?

507
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,560
- So Yeon! 
 - So Yeon!

508
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,570
So Yeon!

509
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,300
So Yeon! Wake up!

510
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,420
- Hey! 
 - Over there!

511
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,150
What happened to So Yeon? What's going on?

512
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,890
- Oh, what? 
 - Why?

513
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,990
- So Yeon! 
 - Oh my gosh!

514
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,090
- What do we do? 
 - So Yeon!

515
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,400
- Cha So Yeon! 
 - So Yeon!

516
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
So Yeon!

517
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,670
T-The sphere...

518
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,110
s-sphere...

519
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,540
the sphere...

520
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,990
Where did it go?

521
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,950
- What? 
 - That...

522
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,290
The sphere...

523
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,580
sphere... I mean...

524
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,510
All of a sudden, the sphere attacked us, and...

525
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,890
- Sphere? 
 - Where?

526
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,290
- Where? 
 - Where?

527
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,050
No! Be on guard!

528
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,560
So Yeon was attacked by a sphere?

529
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,470
No, no, I mean...

530
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,230
So Yeon fainted all of a sudden and

531
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,750
the... the sphere tried to take her, so

532
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,640
while I was trying to stop it, the sphere just

533
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,070
dragged him into the sea. Il Ha...

534
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,730
What the fuck are you saying? That doesn't make any sense!

535
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,260
Where is the sphere?

536
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,560
- The s-sphere is over there. 
 - Where did it go?

537
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,440
What? Are they coming?

538
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,870
- Oh! 
 - What?

539
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,740
Fuck, there are so many of them.

540
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,550
So Yeon. So Yeon.

541
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,330
- So Yeon, wake up. 
 - Try to get up.

542
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,850
- Open your eyes. 
 - What do we do?

543
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,140
Are they here because we were too loud?

544
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,650
Where are they?

545
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,790
- We have to move! 
 - But Il Ha!

546
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,310
But we can't save Il Ha. He's probably dead.

547
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,130
Hey, get it together and answer me!

548
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,740
- Where is Kwon Il Ha! 
 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I tried to catch it,

549
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,000
but it was too fast, so I couldn't. I'm really sorry!

550
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,580
What the hell are you saying? Fuck!

551
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,120
Kwon Il Ha!

552
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,360
Kwon Il Ha! Kwon Il Ha!

553
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,000
Il Ha!

554
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,470
I-I tried to save him, but...

555
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,060
but the water was too dark.

556
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,980
- Hey, Yeong Su. 
 - It was dark...

557
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,170
Slowly. One more time.

558
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,420
The water was too dark, so

559
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,930
I couldn't see anything, but it looked like Il Ha was there.

560
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,480
So I tried to grab Il Ha, but it was so slippery and—

561
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,400
Guys, hurry!

562
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,160
We have to go, quickly!

563
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,390
- So Yeon. So Yeon. 
 - Get up, get up.

564
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,150
So Yeon, get up!

565
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,020
- So Yeon! 
 - Oh my gosh.

566
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,740
- So Yeon. 
 - Is she up?

567
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,750
So Yeon, you can do it.

568
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,230
Come on, let's hurry.

569
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,710
- What are you doing? Hurry! 
 - So Yeon!

570
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,550
- Go, go! 
 - Hurry!

571
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,060
- Wait a minute. 
 - Oh my gosh!

572
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,830
Come on, let's go!

573
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,660
Oh, my gosh!

574
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,720
Come on, hurry up! Hurry!

575
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,510
Yeong Su. Guk Yeong Su!

576
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,140
Let's go! Come on! Hurry!

577
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,480
What do we do now?

578
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,380
Kwon Il Ha, that bastard.

579
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,870
We have to go.

580
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,680
So Yeon, are you okay?

581
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,150
Can you keep walking?

582
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,230
Yeah, I'm okay.

583
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,520
Hold on for a bit.

584
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,310
We still have to go a little further.

585
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:50,890
Don't you remember anything?

586
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,060
The incident earlier...

587
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,220
She must have a concussion. She needs to rest somewhere.

588
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,610
She'll get better in time, right?

589
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,450
It's nothing too serious, right?

590
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,150
I'm not sure.

591
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,380
If it's a light concussion, it should be okay.

592
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,300
So Yeon, let us know if it gets too difficult.

593
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,320
Guys, it will be too difficult to keep going in these conditions.

594
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,910
The detector isn't picking up on any more spheres,

595
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,430
So let's just sleep here tonight.

596
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,490
- Oh, my gosh. 
 - So Yeon, are you all right?

597
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,600
Oh, gosh.

598
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,350
Are you okay?

599
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:44,270
We definitely didn't see any spheres there.

600
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,450
Fuck.

601
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,420
We just left Kwon Il Ha behind like that.

602
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,390
Don't you think

603
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,020
he could swim and survive?

604
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,640
Don't you think he has at least a 0.1 percent

605
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,600
chance of being alive?

606
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,200
When the sun comes up, let's go look for him.

607
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,720
Right, we need to look for his body at least.

608
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,070
He could be floating.

609
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,460
 No, there's no way. 

610
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,850
 I weighed him down with rocks so he would sink. There's no way they can find him.  

611
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,530
Right, we can't go back like this.

612
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,480
What would we tell

613
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,270
Il Ha's parents?

614
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,260
 But what if he is floating? 

615
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,950
 If they see the gunshot wound, they will all find out I did it. 

616
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,650
Let's all stay together from now on.

617
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,300
Really.

618
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,650
I don't want to lose anyone else.

619
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,470
Fuck. What do I do?

620
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,050
Was I really wrong?

621
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,070
He tried to kill me first, so I defended myself.

622
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,740
If I hadn't killed him, I would have died.

623
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,590
Even if he lived, he would tell everyone

624
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,220
and ruin my life!

625
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,600
I just did it to survive. To survive!

626
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,260
Bastard.

627
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,460
He used to torment me before,

628
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,800
and we ended up in the same fucking class together for a year.

629
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,220
Fuck. It's not like we would see each other after graduation anyway!

630
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,380
Realistically, it's better that I live than

631
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,320
someone like him, who will barely go to college.

632
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,550
And Cha So Yeon, that fucking bitch.

633
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,460
That bitch is always ignoring me.

634
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,180
 Hey, Guk Yeong Su. 

635
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,970
Stay away!

636
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,440
Stay away, Asshole!

637
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,300
Stay away.

638
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,730
 How does it feel to be a murderer? 

639
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,550
 Now everyone will know. 

640
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,740
 Then you're done. 

641
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,140
 I fucking knew you would turn out that way. 

642
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,050
 You fucking idiot! 

643
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,940
Fuck.

644
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,760
What? Yeong Su did?

645
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,540
No, it can't be.

646
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,510
What's wrong?

647
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,200
What did you see?

648
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,000
Guk Yeong Su.

649
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,670
He was strange.

650
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,950
He kept rambling about university entrance exams not being cancelled.

651
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,270
I tried to avoid him.

652
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,450
 Let go. Let go of me, you crazy asshole! 

653
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,520
When I opened my eyes.

654
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,040
Il Ha was there.

655
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,520
 It's me, Il Ha. Open your eyes! 

656
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,940
That's all I remember.

657
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,720
When I woke up again,

658
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,050
you guys had arrived.

659
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,100
But... there were

660
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,020
no spheres.

661
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,460
What?

662
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,930
Are you sure?

663
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,300
I'm not sure of anything anymore!

664
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,550
So Yeon, I think you should rest first.

665
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,430
Get some rest and take your time

666
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,140
trying to remember.

667
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,880
And...

668
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,310
until then...

669
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,730
let's not suspect Yeong Su.

670
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,230
Do you understand?

671
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,350
Let's go.

672
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,090
   

673
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:45,480
Why did we come into the third year's classroom?

674
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,000
Whose idea was it?

675
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,070
Oh, really.

676
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,010
Now that I look around, everyone is sitting in their usual seats.

677
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,150
Oh yes, it didn't occur to me, but

678
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,460
I guess I found my seat without realizing.

679
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,020
Su Cheol sat in front of me.

680
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,410
In Hye was in front of me.

681
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,940
Yeong Hun was here.

682
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,110
Fuck. I'm by myself in the back.

683
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,150
It feels weird.

684
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:26,650
I feel like Kwon Il Ha will suddenly come through the door cursing.

685
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,990
Doesn't it feel like they just went home first?

686
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:37,390
In Hye, Wu Taek, Su Cheol and Il Ha.

687
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,360
It feels like they didn't die

688
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,570
and we would see them again at school later.

689
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,770
Yes, sitting here like this,

690
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,490
I feel like we're back at school.

691
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,150
I want to return to those days.

692
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,710
- I want to return to that time. 
 - Me, too.

693
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:03,450
Then... I'll try to invent a time machine!

694
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,160
- Oh, my gosh. 
 - What is he talking about?

695
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,220
What are you even saying?

696
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,760
I guess I'll need to go to KAIST university first.

697
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,990
Or Seoul National University? I guess that would be better.

698
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,020
- Fighting !
 - Fighting!

699
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,420
Then take the time machine to the past

700
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,680
and make sure we don't sign the consent forms.

701
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,810
- Me, too. I would never do it. 
 - Would you rip it up?

702
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,150
I would never sign it.

703
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,750
Definitely not!

704
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,640
Really.

705
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,840
 I remember. 

706
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,020
 What do you remember? 

707
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,430
 Yeong Su 

708
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,590
  - killed Il Ha. 
 - What? 

709
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,300
 And Yeong Su tried to sexually assault So Yeon. 

710
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,670
 - What? 
 - Oh my gosh! 

711
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,930
 - What? 
 - Is it true? 

712
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,180
- What? 
 - How could that happen?

713
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,860
 - That bastard! 
 - Unbelievable! 

714
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,250
 - Where is he? 
 - I can't believe he did that! 

715
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,230
 That bastard! 

716
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,180
 - Where is he? 
 - Shit. 

717
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,740
 - We have to kill that fucking asshole! 
 - What do we do? 

718
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,530
Fuck. What do I do?

719
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,860
Wh-Why?

720
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,190
I was just trying to stay alive.

721
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:34,860
Fuck. I should have just killed her.

722
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,970
Fucking bitch.

723
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,260
Oh, they're coming.

724
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,300
Oh, the spheres!

725
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,660
What do you all want to do when you get home?

726
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,350
I'm going to take a hot bath first

727
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,090
and scrub every inch of my body.

728
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,560
It will feel so good.

729
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,050
Then you'll clog the drainage from all that dead skin.

730
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,820
You'll have way more.

731
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,460
Enough to make an eraser out of it.

732
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,720
When I go home,

733
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,090
I'm going to do nothing and sleep first

734
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,020
I'm going to be good to my parents without complaining

735
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,670
Me, too.

736
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,610
They always scolded me for being on the phone.

737
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:08,250
But I realized I can live without a phone.

738
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,920
When I go home, I'm going to talk a lot with my parents.

739
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,410
That's nice.

740
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,660
I miss my mom.

741
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,530
What will happen when we return?

742
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,270
I wonder...

743
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,820
Would we be able to

744
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,030
return to how things were before?

745
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,140
Some things will be different.

746
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,900
Maybe our parents, too.

747
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,500
Won't they nag less about studying and going to university?

748
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,220
I doubt it.

749
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,210
I wanted to get my nose done before going to college.

750
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,920
- Hey! 
 - What?

751
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,180
So Yeon, the way I see it...

752
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:55,280
getting a nose job doesn't solve other problems.

753
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,950
What about you? Do you want a beating?

754
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,180
I'm too tired of this relationship.

755
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,160
I'm tired of it, too.

756
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,820
When I go to college, I'm not going to study for a few months and just play.

757
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:11,010
I'm just going to meet girls, do MT, take trips and

758
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,520
do everything I wanted to do!

759
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,880
Hey, there's no one who plays as much as you do as a high school senior.

760
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,630
Hey, seniors play because of their stress.

761
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:24,460
And college students play freely. That's a huge difference.

762
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,650
Hey, are you guys still talking about college?

763
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,830
Even after all that we have been through?

764
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,590
That's true.

765
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:35,350
Anyway, I want to go to Seoul soon.

766
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:41,060
I just want this horrendous war to be over.

767
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,980
- Oh, yes. 
 - Really.

768
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,460
When we return to Seoul,

769
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,710
no matter what happens,

770
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,310
let's support and protect each other.

771
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,760
Yes.

772
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,390
I'll be a better friend.

773
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,320
Me, too.

774
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,180
But where is Yeong Su?

775
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,240
- Did he go to the bathroom? 
 - Yeah, where did he go?

776
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,040
I haven't seen him in a while.

777
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,210
I'll go look for him. I also think we should take turns guarding now.

778
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,980
- Okay. 
 - Yes, we should.

779
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,680
- Guard again. 
 - Yes.

780
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,900
- I'll do that for you. 
 - It's all wet.

781
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,590
Jang Su!

782
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,530
- Sphere! Sphere! 
 - Oh my gosh!

783
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,980
- Gun! Gun! 
 - Get the gun!

784
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,600
Hey, Kimchi, did you sleep well?

785
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,560
- What about the other guys? 
 - What do you mean?

786
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,670
   

787
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,790
Oh, my! What should we do, what should we do?

788
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,420
- I picked this girl. 
 - What are you looking at?

789
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,190
What's that, what's that?

790
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,220
Hey, Kimchi, are you still asleep?

791
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,200
Why are you looking so spaced out?

792
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,550
Oh...

793
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,110
I must have dozed off.

794
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:10,390
Dozed off? Just wipe your drool.

795
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,720
This chip is super salty and savory.

796
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,050
Hey, what happened? What about the war?

797
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,350
Is it over?

798
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,890
What about the spheres?

799
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,060
Chi Yeol.

800
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

801
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,480
Oh, gosh.

802
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,190
I mean...

803
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,570
I had a strange dream.

804
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,610
What kind of strange dream?

805
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,940
A dream where the spheres killed all of us.

806
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,880
But...

807
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:53,390
I'm so glad we are all safe.

808
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:56,720
Oh, shit. I'm glad, too, man.

809
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,790
Seriously, shit...

810
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,040
Wu Taek, it's mine.

811
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,150
Oh, seriously!

812
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,730
- Im Wu Taek! 
 - Chi Yeol.

813
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,840
 Kim Chi Yeol. 

814
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,650
 Kim Chi Yeol. 

815
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,120
Chi Yeol, wake up!

816
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,780
Kim Chi Yeol!

817
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,280
Chi Yeol, wake up!

818
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:43,390
Kim Deok Jung... Deok Jung.

819
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,740
Deok Jung.

820
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:55,320
Wake up...

821
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,590
Wake up. Wake up...

822
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:04,340
Let's go. Let's go, please...

823
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,530
Deok Jung... Wake up...

824
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,910
- Jang Su! 
 - What's that?

825
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,910
Jang Su...

826
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,440
I'm sorry.

827
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,700
But I must go to college.

828
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,250
Jang Su!

829
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,520
It was you.

830
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,100
Chi Yeol!

831
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,640
Hurry!

832
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,390
Hey!

833
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:33,770
This motherfucker!

834
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,980
Chi Yeol, wake up.

835
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,370
Chi Yeol.

836
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,260
Run away. Run away quickly.

837
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,680
Hurry up and go, you fool.

838
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,500
Bo Ra, we should go.

839
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,950
Deok Jung.

840
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,720
Please wake up.

841
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,680
Wake up, Deok Jung.

842
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,850
Kim Deok Jung.

843
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,520
Bo Ra...

844
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,230
Bo Ra!

845
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,010
Yeong Su, please save me. Please save me.

846
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,300
This isn't how you usually behave.

847
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,360
I...  I...

848
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,360
Yes! Let's go back home together!

849
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,610
It's okay. Let's go back home together, Yeong Su...

850
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:17,240
Oh... Please don't.

851
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,160
Yeong Su! Yeong Su! Yeong Su!

852
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,110
Hey, why are you acting like this?

853
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,550
Huh? Please put the gun down.

854
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:30,460
Please... Please pull yourself together!

855
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,800
I didn't want to do this, either.

856
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,090
I wish I had

857
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:45,440
a future to dream of like you guys do.

858
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,560
I had no choice.

859
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,680
This damn war

860
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,410
has ruined my whole life.

861
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,600
It's completely ruined.

862
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,790
I'm done.

863
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,390
I'm sorry...

864
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,310
We made a promise...

865
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,520
I'm sorry...

866
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,680
I'm sorry, Guys.

867
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,660
I'm sorry...

868
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:54,420
   

869
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,370
 The university entrance exams have resumed after two years. 

870
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,720
 It is predicted to be the toughest exam year ever. 

871
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,520
 In addition, it's still unclear how students' 

872
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,280
 participation during the war will be assessed. 

873
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,040
 Concerned voices continue to spread throughout the nation. 

874
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,580
Fighting! Fighting!

875
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,580
Good luck!

876
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:18,670
   

877
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,380
   

878
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,560
 We oppose! 

879
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,260
 Abolish sphere privilege! 

880
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,520
 Abolish! Abolish! 

881
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,450
 You can do it! 

882
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,910
 Abolish! Abolish 

883
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,150
   

884
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:37,980
   

885
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,100
   

886
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:53,330
   

887
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:55,990
   

888
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:09,270
   

889
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:15,400
 Only two months after that incident, new weapons were developed 

890
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,940
 and shockingly, in a matter of seconds, 

891
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:25,010
 99% of the spheres we risked our lives to fight against were eliminated. 

892
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,550
 Right now, I'm 

893
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:34,900
 taking an exam that my friends weren't able to. 

894
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,900
   

895
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,390
   

896
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:13,950
   

897
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,430
 Why did Yeong Su lose his mind? 

898
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:23,600
 If it was a war that would end so absurdly, 

899
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,260
 why did we need to pick up guns in the first place? 

900
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:32,010
 Did I really need those points for university? 

901
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:36,150
 Why did I want to go to university? 

902
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,650
 Because everyone does. 

903
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:44,180
 And if I don't, will I become a failure? 

904
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:54,150
 The agonizing war taught me something that schools didn't. 

905
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,740
 In order to survive, we shouldn't beat our classmates. 

906
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:04,330
 We need to help and protect each other. 

907
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:10,210
 The most important thing in life is neither the entrance exam nor entering university. 

908
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:16,510
 It's the warm friendships with those by my side. 

909
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:24,810
 But in the end, the nineteen of us weren't able to protect each other. 

910
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:33,740
 Maybe what we really had to fight was not the spheres, 

911
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,110
 but something else. 

912
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,690
   

913
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,370
 If I could return to that day, 

914
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:47,260
 would I still sign the consent form? 

915
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,710
   

916
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,830
   

917
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,190
- Are you crazy? 
 - What?

918
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,920
- Hey! 
 - You!

919
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,140
- What are you doing? 
 - That's enough.

920
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,270
- No, I'm not done. 
 - That's not it.

921
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,640
- I don't know anymore. 
 - That's enough.

922
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,220
- This is the point. 
 - Here.

923
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,930
- Don't put too much. 
 - Do you think it's too much?

924
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,620
You're so pretty!

925
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,710
Seriously, you're so pretty!

926
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,460
- Doesn't she look like Blackpink? 
 - Oh! 
  (T/N: A popular Korean pop group) 

927
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,550
I totally agree!

928
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,770
- I'm Jennie! 
 - I'm Rose!

929
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:39,900
I'm Lisa!

930
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,760
I'm Jisoo!

931
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,940
- Oh, geez! 
 - Don't say anything.

932
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,090
What do you think? Am I pretty?

933
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,990
Hey, you're so pretty.

934
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:53,340
Hey, you look like Lee Hyori!

935
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,930
Hey, you look like IU!

936
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,870
IU?

937
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,420
Hey~

938
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,250
Perhaps, are you Song Hye Kyo?

939
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,500
Hey, oh my gosh!

940
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,260
- Then should I do this kind of hair and make-up from now on? 
 - Yeah.

941
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,020
Look at me.

942
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,680
Hey, who did your make-up?

943
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,920
My grandma.

944
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,960
It came out so well, that's why!

945
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,020
Yes, it's really pretty.

946
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,590
It's my grandma's favorite color.

947
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:27,380
Your grandma really knows your personal color!

948
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,320
Your skin tone is a shade brighter today.

949
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,310
Your future shade.

950
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:36,510
Ouch, it's so sharp. Like your nose.

951
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:39,550
Our graduation pictures better turn out well.

952
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,050
Don't worry, just focus on you.

953
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:44,810
- Oh my gosh. 
 - All this fuss.

954
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:50,580
Hey, did you guys see

955
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,470
the popularity voting poll I shared in our chatroom

956
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,680
for the girls in our class?

957
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,160
Hey, hey, don't be ridiculous.

958
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,900
If the girls find out, we'll be in big trouble.

959
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,750
That's why!

960
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:07,360
It will be our secret!

961
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,630
I did vote.

962
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,680
You did? Good.

963
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,000
I did, too, but...

964
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,210
Jang Su, you, too?

965
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,810
Me, too.

966
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,460
Oh, yes, Yeong Su!

967
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,920
Hey, Do Su Cheol!

968
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:26,080
You! You... Who did you vote for?

969
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,670
It's a secret, remember?

970
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,420
- It's so obvious you voted for Lee Na Ra. 
 - Hey!

971
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:33,090
- No Ae Seol. 
 - I didn't.

972
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,920
- No Ae Seol.
 - I didn't vote for her.

973
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,250
What about you?

974
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,510
I want to know.

975
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:41,170
Oh!

976
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:43,940
It's no use voting for them now.

977
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,100
Girls change drastically when they get into college.

978
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,060
How do you know?

979
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,990
- My nuna. 
 - Oh, right.

980
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,090
Your sister...

981
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,520
Let's go together!

982
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,540
Your lips! Hello Yeon Ju's mom!

983
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,940
Miss Korea!

984
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,800
You guys didn't fight, did you?

985
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,600
You guys, the makeup looks freaking awkward on you. Stop it.

986
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,910
What's with him?

987
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:17,170
You guys should be like Yu Jeong and just take pictures the way you normally look. That would be prettiest.

988
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,080
Right?

989
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,720
- What an idiot. 
 - Is he crazy?

990
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,030
Hey, be quiet.

991
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,600
Why?

992
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,810
Yu Jeong spent two hours on her hair and an hour on her makeup!

993
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:36,350
Just keep your mouth shut!

994
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,510
- Yu Jeong! 
 - Oh, no!

995
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:43,080
 - Yu Jeong...  
 - Shit...

996
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,190
Yu Jeong!

997
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,580
- Oh, man! 
 - You idiot!

998
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:51,380
Why are students putting on make-up?

999
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,630
Hurry and take the pictures!

1000
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,640
- We have to hide! 
 - Let's go!

1001
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,400
- Go, go! 
 - Hurry!

1002
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,760
- Move! 
 - Go!

1003
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,340

 - He's coming!

1004
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,320
- Everyone, hide! 
 - Oh, no!

1005
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,900
Just a moment!

1006
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,960
What are you doing in here? Let me in!

1007
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,570
Move out of the way! Sit down!

1008
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,990
- Sit down! 
 - There's nothing here.

1009
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,390
