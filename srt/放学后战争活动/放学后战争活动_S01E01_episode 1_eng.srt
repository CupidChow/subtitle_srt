1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,410
   

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,960
Let's go!

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,490
Stop him, stop him!

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,800
All right, pass.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,900
   

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,780
   

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,690
   

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,460
   

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,950
Hey, stop him! Hey!

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:50,990


11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,640
     

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,530
All right, let's go!

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,440
   

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,250
Come on! Stop him!

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,030
   

16
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,440
Stop squeezing them out!

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,160
It's because I'm going through puberty, Asshole.

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,350
Tae Man, Tae Man. The answer to 
the first short response question is minus one, right?

19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,980
- Right? 
 - Minus one is the answer.

20
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,490
All right, I got it. Hey!

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,900
Wait, not you.

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,320
Chi Yeol! Tae Man said minus one 
is the answer to the first short response question.

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
I got it.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,760
Hey, I heard the answer was 144.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,370
What? According to whom?

26
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,570
Ha Na said so.

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,130
Oh! So close.

28
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,300
- I don't think it was that close. 
 - It's over for me.

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,460
Are you still reading up on the spheres?

30
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,570
How long have they been there now?

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,800
Has it been about a year now?

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,970
 I'm heading out! 

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,640
Hello.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
Did something happen?

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,190
There are monsters over there.

36
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,250
There are so many.

37
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,640
When those things came, 
I thought something crazy was going to happen.

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,580
Hey, even if aliens invade us, 
nothing changes for high school seniors.

39
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
True.

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,920
Internet café?

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,890
I'd love to!

42
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,200
Yeong Hun, did you do well on the exam?

43
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,750
Yeong Hun? The exam...

44
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,230
   

45
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,590
Hey, why ask if he did well on the exam?

46
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,900
He's top of the class. So he'd obviously do well.

47
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,500
I just said whatever because it's awkward. 
You clueless idiot.

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,950
I'd feel defeated if I were bullied, 
but he's not like that at all.

49
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,200
Stop it.

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,930
   

51
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,330
Hey, stop it! What are you doing?

52
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,600
They will become lawyers and judges in the future.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,140
- We need to become friends. 
 - Even so, stop doing that.

54
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,550
- Wait for me! 
 - Come on!

55
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,680
Wait for me!

56
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,840
 Hello, YouTube! 

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
 All about the Spheres, A.S. 
This is the second episode of the series. 

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,060
 You know you need to watch the first one, right? 

59
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,380
 Those who haven't watched it, 
click this link here. 

60
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,280
 All right. What are those spheres, exactly? 

61
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,880
 I'll summarize it shortly for you! 

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
 One year ago, those spheres 
appeared everywhere, taking over the skies, 

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
 except in some parts of Russia 
and the polar regions. 

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,590
 Do you all remember 
when the spheres first appeared? 

65
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,490
 Back then, the entire world was screaming, 
saying it was the end. 

66
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,730
 I'm scared! 

67
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,230
 We'll all die at this rate! 

68
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,760
 All kinds of rumors went around 

69
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,610
 and chaos ensued in the streets globally. 

70
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,660
 However, we can't just sit and watch, right? 

71
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,810
 "We must strike first!" 

72
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,800
 "Commence assault!" 

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,830
 W-Wait, why are they increasing in numbers? 

74
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,070
 Wait. It was decided that 
if we uselessly provoked them,  

75
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,180
 the entire world might get covered 
in those f***ing– 

76
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,890
 They decided that it could be dangerous. 
   

77
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,630
 The assaults soon ceased. 
   

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,600
 While we were just looking at the skies anxiously, a new report was delivered.
      

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,170
 "We took multiple x-rays through the satellites and" 

80
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,910
 "analyzed the samples of spheres taken using drones." 

81
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,900
 "Nothing that may endanger humanity 
has been found yet." 

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,010
In other words, they're not dangerous 
as long as we don't mess with them.

83
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,730
They're telling us to just keep living on 
since there's no danger, right?

84
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,860
What the heck? Why can't he just say that instead?

85
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,460
 If anything has really changed, it would be 
that we take ships instead of airplanes now. 

86
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,470
 Well, new tourist attractions such as hot air balloon trips came out, 

87
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,990
 but we're still living our daily lives just as fine along with those round spheres. 

88
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,800
 However, upon closer look, don't those round things look like eyeballs waiting for their prey? 

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,360
 I mean, we never know when those things will attack us. 

90
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,470
 Of course, this thought might also be because I watched too many sci-fi movies. 

91
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,110

92

Oh, and also, the next episode will be more interesting so look forward to it.

93
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,460
Woof!

94
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,360
   

95
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,040
   

96
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,840
   

97
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,440
   

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,470
   

99
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,540
   

100
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,130
   

101
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,070
This pure air. This is what I wanted.

102
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,030
H-Hey, hey. The monitor we got last time was awesome.

103
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,640
Which seat was it?

104
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,720
You little— Hey!

105
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
Aigo!

106
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,540
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Wow!

108
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeong Hun! You play this game, too, right?

109
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,600
But why are you going that way when the blue zone is that way?

110
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,210
You need to go that way. Wait, no... The mansion.

111
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, you suck at games, don't you?

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,520
Y-You need to shoot there. Over there.

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,840
Aigo, I'll get him for you. Let me—

114
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,130
That little...

115
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,620
Gosh, I told you not to do it.

116
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,530
He's very annoying, isn't he?

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
Yeong Hun is a good guy at his core.

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,110
Is that how a good guy reacts? The world is so unfair.

119
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,240
We studied and came to the Internet café all the same.

120
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,090
But he's number one, and we're...

121
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,620
Would we be able to go to a college in Seoul?

122
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,870
Hey, "a college in Seoul"?

123
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,440
We need to be thankful for one in Gyeonggido!

124
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,300
That's true.

125
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,290
Although I failed the exam...

126
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,000
- I need to eat the chicken. 
 - I love chicken.

127
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,910
   

128
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,300
   

129
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,870
Do it gently. D-Do...

130
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,350
- D-Do it gently. 
 - I apologize!

131
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,370
Aigo, shit! Hey, get me up.

132
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,150
Hey, get me up. One, two, three.

133
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,500
- You bastards! 
 - I'm sorry!

134
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,530
- I apologize! 
 - Hey, get me up.

135
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,520
One, two...

136
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,990
Come over here. Come.

137
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,970
Are you stupid? Come here.

138
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,300
You did it on purpose, didn't you? Private Kim Geo Jin!

139
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,880
Turn around.

140
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,980
This is because you're not doing your job.

141
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,080
Why aren't you training the privates properly?

142
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,970
Why did it have to fall into our operation grounds 
among everywhere else in this big land?

143
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,090
But this was the first one 
to fall in the world, apparently.

144
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Are you happy that it's the first?

145
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,820
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,040
- Shouldn't we at least camouflage— 
 - Hey! What if the camouflage gets damaged?

147
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,610
- Will you take responsibility? 
 - No, Sir.

148
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's just wait for Division Commander's orders.

149
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,290
It's too hot today.

150
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,610
What are we supposed...

151
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,160
Wow! Company Commander.

152
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,840
Pull me out.

153
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Attention, salute!

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,910
 Loyalty! 

155
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,570
No injuries or accidents during duty!

156
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,800
You asshole!

157
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,850
What's with the false report? 
I know something is wrong.

158
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,880
P-Pardon me.

159
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,910
There's something... w-wrong during duty. Is there?

160
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,440
- Any confirmed information? 
 - Nothing, yet.

161
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,160
- Is it moving? 
 - No, it isn't.

162
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,600
We only confirmed it falling down.

163
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,630
- Size of the damage? 
 - The bean field

164
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,110
has been demolished where it fell.

165
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,020
Why did it have to fall on a bean field?

166
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,950
All right. What is the action being taken?

167
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,530
Well, I-I haven't received any orders yet.

168
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,410
You're seriously frustrating.

169
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,320
Hey, let me see that.

170
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,120
What's up with this asshole?

171
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,930
You hand it over just because I asked for it? 
A rifle at that?

172
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,790
- I'm sorry! 
 - He's a nutcase. How pathetic!

173
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,800
You asshole!

174
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,540
Hey! All of you, get out of the way!

175
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,660
Move, all of you!

176
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,360
Move, you idiots! Hurry and move!

177
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,770
That idiot! What the heck is he doing?

178
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,210
What's up with that idiot?

179
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,200
Get out the way!

180
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,590
Orders, you say?

181
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,030
This is what an order looks like.

182
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,180
- What the hell? 
 - There was no reaction.

183
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,390
It must be empty inside.

184
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,720
Wow, this fucker.

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,070
It's kindling my sleeping fighting spirit.

186

Hey! Bring me the panzer!

187

Hey, the panzer!

188
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,040
- Did you call me? 
 - H-Hey, you idiot! Hey!

189
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,850
- This asshole! Put it down. 
 - Put it down!

190
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,370
- Lower it down! 
 - Hey, you idiot!

191
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,770
- Hurry up and lower it! 
 - I'm sorry. I apologize!

192
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,240
Gosh, this fucking idiot.

193
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,930
Fire.

194
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,440
Pardon?

195
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,110
Fire it, you punk!

196
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,410
Hey, fire. Just fire it now.

197

- Fire. 
 - Yes, I'll fire.

198
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,290
Hit it right in the center.

199
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,240
Yes, I got it.

200

 - Where are you touching?

324
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,760
Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,340
Wait a second.

326
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,340
That's right.

327
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,530
I smoked them all yesterday.

328
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,040
Gosh, seriously.

329
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,590
Sorry.

330
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,230
Bo Ra.

331
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,140
Oh! Don't touch, don't touch.

332
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,300
I got it.

333
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,220
I'll look for it.

334
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,630
Your lowly servant still has two cigarettes.

335
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,330
I'm deeply thankful.

336
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,680
Yes, thank you.

337
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,100
Shit...

338
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,470
 Gosh! 

339
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,490
Do you want to die?

340
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,410
Gosh, why isn't he coming?

341
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,710
You know how he's always a little slow.

342
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,300
Gosh. I'm about to get indigestion.

343
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,070
Oh! Bo Ra.

344
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,070
Bo Ra, here's the portable charger.

345
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,080
Hey, I told you not to call my name, didn't I?

346
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,050
Am I your friend?

347
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,570
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,090
- Leave. 
 - Pardon?

349
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,160
- What the hell are you doing? 
 - Ae Seol!

350
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,520
Ae Seol, get going.

351
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,030
Get going now.

352
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,480
What's wrong with you?

353
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,940
 Ae Seol, bye! 

354
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,920
Gosh, you mean bitches.

355
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,510
- You should treat her better. 
 - What did you say?

356
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,650
Ms. Park!

357
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,770
Hello.

358
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,130
Hello.

359
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,860
Hurry and go inside.

360
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,500
Aigo.

361
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,720
Settle down!

362
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,510
- Is it delicious? 
 - My goodness!

363
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,380
Attention.

364
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,480
- Quiet, everyone! 
 - Attention!

365
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,550
I have a gift for all of you today.

366
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,300
Mock exam results from September.

367
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,450
 Gosh. 

368
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,680
There is one more gift. 
I'll hand it out according to the score.

369
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
- What? 
 - Ms. Park!

370
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,700
That's too harsh!

371
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,770
You can't do that!

372
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,700
Silence, silence. Silence!

373
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,370
Come out one by one when I call your name.

374
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,610
First off...

375
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,950
first place in our class and our school...

376
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,700
Yeong Hun.

377
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,440
Round of applause!

378
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,800
Second place is Yeong Su.

379
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,730
- Looking good. 
 - Wow...

380
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,980
Third place is Yu Jeong.

381
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,780
Yeong Shin!

382
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,780
- Thank you. 
 - Yeon Ju!

383
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,010
Hey, hey!

384
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,270
 Jang Su! 

385
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,360
 You did well. Na Ra! 

386
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,140
   

387
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,760
All right. Two last places tied. The grand finale.

388
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,640
Gosh, let's protect the last placers!

389
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
- He's right! 
 - Protect what? They're just these two.

390
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,650
Il Ha and Hui Rak, hurry and come forward.

391
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,430
Applaud!

392
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,320
Gosh, what's there to clap for?

393
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,800
Aigo!

394
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,990
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

395
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,380
Let's do better next time.

396
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,480
 Yes. 

397
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,490
Hey, the two of you!

398
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,590
 To all teachers inside the school building, 

399
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,210
 everyone, please come 
to the Administration Office. 

400
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,160
 Repeating one more time. 

401
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,510
 To all teachers inside the school building, 

402
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,230
 - come to the Administration Office.  
 - Dismissed.

403
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,480
Make sure to get ready for classes.

404
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,040
Everyone, turn in your phones!

405
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,030
Gosh! What do I...

406
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,700
Hurry and turn in your phones!

407
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,620
- Hey, Kimchi. 
 - What?

408
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,700
Go to the Administration Office 
and see what's happening.

409
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,730
Th-The Administration Office?

410
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,180
Me?

411
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,130
Excuse me. There.

412
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,380
You'd better run.

413
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,490
Okay, okay.

414
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,240
Why? Are you guilty of something?

415
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,680
I have a bad feeling today.

416
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,810
It doesn't feel right.

417
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,220
Wait, how can you say that out of nowhere?

418
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,340
Also, male students will...

419
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,810
Ms. Park, Ms. Park—

420
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,170
Oh, I-I'm...

421
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,370
M-Ms. Park.

422
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,360
- I-I was... 
 - Let's go back to class.

423
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,840
Chi Yeol...

424
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,550
What? Isn't it first period?

425
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,000
That stupid asshole.

426
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,410
Everyone.

427
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,440
- It looks like this year's early admissions will be canceled. 
 - Pardon?

428
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,760
- What does that mean? 
 - What kind of nonsense is that?

429
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,630
- Wait. 
 - What's early admission?

430
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,910
M-Ms. Park, is that true?

431
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,040
Ms. Park, what's the matter?

432
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,720
Are you really sure?

433
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,710
Is it also canceled for other schools?

434
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,430
What about people who applied for early admissions?

435
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,800
- No way! 
 - Why no early admission?

436
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,690
Yes, that's great!

437
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,090
No, wait. Early admissions isn't the only thing.

438
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,750
Shouldn't the entire CSAT be canceled?

439
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,370
CSAT needs to be gone.

440
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,010
Listen to what I'm saying first!

441
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,980
Only early admission will be canceled, and

442
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,620
CSATs will be taken as scheduled.

443
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,510
Also!

444
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,670
Regular admissions still exists?

445
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,030
I'll explain slowly, so can you all look here?

446
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,040
 Minister of Defense 
will soon give the national conference on 

447
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,000
 enlistment of students into the military. 

448
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,290
 We'll hear the specifics from our reporter 
who's at the scene. 

449
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,870
 Reporter Oh Eun Ji, please. 

450
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,610
 Yes, I'm at the Ministry of Defense's 
briefing room right now. 

451
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,520
 Emergency national conference 
will be starting soon. 

452
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,980
Minister of Defense Park Sang Man 
took the podium just now.

453
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,900
Let's listen to what he'll be saying.

454
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,610
I'm the Minister of Defense.

455
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,030
Dear citizens,

456
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,580
almost a year has passed 
since the appearance of unidentified spheres worldwide.

457
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,630
 As of now, we can't confirm their risks, 
but they can... 

458
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,050
- Isn't the Minister of Defense rather high up? 
 - He's all the way up there.

459
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,870
 In order to prepare for such events, 

460
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,490
 please understand the issuance 
of National Mobilization Law. 

461
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,970
- N-National what? 
 - What is he issuing?

462
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,700
 Besides active duty soldiers, 
enlisted candidates, reserve force... 

463
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,550
all male and female adults 
over twenty-four years old...

464
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,370
and...

465
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,700
the current high school seniors 
will also be drafted.

466
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,730
- Seniors? 
 - We? 
 - W-We?

467
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,860
- Hey, why would we... 
 - Seniors?

468
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,220
- Hey, what is he saying? 
 - What is happening to us?

469
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,100
- Be quiet for a second! 
 -  Without exception... 

470
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,350
 collection order will be ordered 
at each student's current school. 

471
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,920
 Therefore, inevitably, 

472
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,770
 2023 early admissions for college 

473
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,470
 were all decided to be canceled. 

474
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,690
- Canceled? 
 - I guess it's really happening.

475
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,570
- New comments are coming in by the second. 
 - But to maintain as much normalcy as possible in our schools,

476
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,030
the following changes will apply to third-grade high school students only.

477
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,890
For these students, there will be military training and their usual classes at the same time.

478
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,120
As such, the government decided to reward students, who agree to military training,

479
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,980
with extra credit for college admissions.

480
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,040
    
 What is he saying?

481
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,930
 Regarding extra credit, after discussing with the Department of Education— 

482
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,640
Military training and classes at the same time?

483
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,090
What's military training, and what's the extra credit for?

484
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,770
Does this mean we have to take the CSAT no matter what?

485
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,070
It just means we're doomed!

486
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,050
This doesn't make sense.

487
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,390
Silence!

488
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,640
Quiet down.

489
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,520
Just as he said,

490
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,440
it means you'll be having both military training and school classes at the same time.

491
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,700
The government said third grade high school students are only...

492
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,060
enlistment candidates, so...

493
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,330
let's not worry too much.

494
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,400
Yu Jeong, hand these out, please.

495
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes.

496
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,720
Hey, this really must be happening.

497
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,160
Hey, pass it over quickly!

498
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,860
Hurry.

499
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,400
    

500
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,490
They're military training agreements.

501
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,110
Take them home, and show them to your parents.

502
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,840
- Is this for real? 
 - This is crazy.

503
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Ms. Park! Are we going to live together?

504
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,580
What happens to people who don't consent?

505
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,550
It's not certain, 
but you'll most likely be taking remote classes.

506
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,290
How much extra credit do we get?

507
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,080
Are there different amounts 
of extra credit you can get?

508
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,510
More details will be released later.

509
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,500
I'll share it with you as soon as 
the Department of Education's policy comes out.

510
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,130
What's certain is that extra credit

511
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,740
is only given to those who took the training.

512
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,560
Make sure to get them signed if you'll participate.

513
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,990
Ms. Park! What about the acting and film majors?

514
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,380
Does that mean we're going to war?

515
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,960
Ms. Park, what about people 
who won't go to college?

516
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,480
- Ms. Park, how long is the training? 
 - What if we drop out in the middle?

517
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Where will the training take place?

518
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm sure you're all surprised and startled.

519
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,420
It's the same for me.

520
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,330
However...

521
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,870
let's not worry.

522
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,830
You just continue your studies and keep doing

523
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,300
what you were doing as you train.

524
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,380
We can't forget the years of effort you put in 
to go to a good college.

525
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,300
All right?

526
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,920
Pay attention in your classes today!

527
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,080
- What? Ms. Park! 
 - You can't be leaving like this!

528
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,220
- Ms. Park! 
 - You need to answer our questions.

529
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,310
Ms. Park!

530
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,940
Hey, look at this.

531
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,080
"An unprecedented national defense crisis."

532
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,720
This means there will be a war!

533
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,430
No way!

534
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,150
Hey, but why does it have to be the third grade?

535
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,340
What about the first and second years?

536
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,890
I know. Shouldn't we be exempt 
since we're taking the CSAT?

537
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,550
That's right! Honestly.

538
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,400
College admission is everything for the third year.

539
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,650
If extra credit on CSAT is promised, 
how hard would we work?

540
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,010
That's why they picked the third graders.

541
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,720
Tae Man, this is the first time 
I'm convinced by your words.

542
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,970
A sudden war wouldn't break out, would it?

543
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,420
- Against whom? 
 - Against them.

544
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,210
- "Against them"? 
 - Yes.

545
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,070
- Come on. It's embarrassing to fight against balloons. 
 - Is that so?

546
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm telling you, it's true!

547
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,720
What? Did you guys get it, too?

548
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,390
Really?

549
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,460
I don't know, Idiot. 
I guess we're fighting the balloons.

550
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,670
Okay, hang up.

551
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,790
Okay, shut up. No, you're wrong.

552
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,750
Okay, bye.

553
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,440
Wow, I guess this is fucking happening.

554
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,390
Hey.

555
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,380
If you're done talking, go back to your fucking seat.

556
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,410
I don't want to.

557
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,320
You'll get points deducted 
if you don't turn in your phone.

558
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,820
If I beat the shit out of you,

559
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,880
how many points off is that?

560
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,760
Why? Are you scared?

561
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,330
Gosh, this fucking bastard.

562
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,060
Hey, stop them!

563
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
You go stop them!

564
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,350
- This fucking— 
 - You motherfucker!

565
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,630
Come here, you fucker!

566
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,440
Hurry and stop them!

567
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,450
Why the fuck are those two always fighting?

568
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,980
Come here, you son of a bitch!

569
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,930
- Come here! 
 - You motherfucker!

570
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,520
Hey! Let go!

571
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,970
What, you fucking asshole?

572
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,520
What?

573
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,310
It's the military.

574
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,690
Guys...

575
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,870
Why did the military come here?

576
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,310
- I don't know. 
 - It must be that thing.

577
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,790
No personnel or firearm abnormalities detected.

578
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,080
Unload the firearms first.

579
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,920
Remaining personnel moves into the building.

580
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,620
Gosh, we're fucked.

581
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,990
I think I need to call Mom quickly.

582
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,460
This is crazy, right?

583
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,690
What the heck?

584
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,220
Why did they come here?

585
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,740
No way. They couldn't be here for us.

586
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,380
   

587
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,770
Are you okay?

588
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,400
What do you mean?

589
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,840
The fight... you had earlier.

590
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,060
Hey...

591
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,750
once you get to know them, 
our classmates are good kids.

592
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,490
You might even become friends if you—

593
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,920
I have no interest in making friends.

594
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,850
I'm just passing by them anyway.

595
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,430
When you get out in the world, 
people of similar levels become friends.

596
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,730
That's more comfortable.

597
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,970
We don't need to care about each other 
or be considerate.

598
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,790
People who will be of use to me in the end.

599
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,740
That's what friends are.

600
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,400
Well...

601
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,230
Is that so?

602
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,770
Are you going to sign 
the military training agreement?

603
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,700
Am I the one signing?

604
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,540
My parents are the signers.

605
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,450
 Take care. 

606
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,350
Mom!

607
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,620
If you live at the camp, 
what about your younger siblings?

608
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,640
Your dad and I need to come to work 
early in the morning.

609
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,820
Can't you just study at home?

610
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,420
All the others will get extra credit.

611
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,230
A difference of one or two points 
changes your accepting college.

612
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,020
It's also way more advantageous for me 
that early admissions are gone.

613
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,730
I'm saying this because of your siblings.

614
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,390
Why do I always need to sacrifice 
because of them?

615
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,700
Hurry and sign it for me.

616
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,650
Okay, okay.

617
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,120
Didn't you say you'd be late, Mom?

618
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,910
Yes. I just came home early.

619
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,260
You said you wanted 
to be a webtoon artist or something.

620
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,620
You don't need to go to college, do you?

621
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,650
Gosh, it's boring when I'm at home.

622
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,530
I'd rather be with other kids.

623
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,820
You can do that if you want.

624
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,700
Don't stay out just because I'm not here.

625
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,270
Cut back on those nightclub outings too.

626
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,120
Daughter, it's my life, okay?

627
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,950
Cheers.

628
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,310
   

629
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,630
I said I don't want to!

630
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,490
I can't even go to college anyway, 
so why would I do this?

631
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,410
Whether you go to college or not,

632
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,320
I just can't stand to see you 
loitering around at home.

633
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,930
One more bottle of soju, please.

634
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,870
Yes, right on the way.

635
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,490
I'll be taking online classes instead.

636
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,860
You don't even study at school.

637
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,770
Yes, right, you'd study at home, wouldn't you?

638
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,950
Just go, no matter what!

639
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,130
Be tenacious.

640
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,400
Do whatever it takes 
to get the extra credit if it's available.

641
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,570
Also, raise your hand 
and volunteer with the training stuff.

642
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,290
Do you understand?

643
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,020
All the Specialized High School students will apply

644
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,270
for regular admissions 
since early admissions are gone.

645
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,750
I won't tolerate failing to get into Seoul National University 
over a point or two.

646
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,640
Gosh. Okay.

647
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,280
Aigo. Going around and fighting 
when it's such an important time.

648
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,850
I told you it's from falling.

649
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,160
- Give it. 
 - Wait...

650
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,230
Y-Yes.

651
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,650
Rest for a bit and study. Okay?

652
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,970
Okay, Private Ryan.

653
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,270
Aigo, what else would he be doing? 
He's packing his stuff in joy.

654
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,130
Hey, why are you taking this?

655
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,210
Mom, this is the most precious thing to me.

656
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,910
You really embarrass me with these, seriously.

657
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,550
No, it's nothing. Of course, I'm worried.

658
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,060
But what can we do?

659
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,980
They said students are only enlistment candidates.

660
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,180
Okay.

661
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes.

662
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,580
They said the school is safer, 
so we have no choice but to believe that.

663
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,570
All right. Take care.

664
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,090
All of these things are necessary during training.

665
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,480
The more the better.

666
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,190
They said it will only be four weeks.

667
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,740
When will I use all of them?

668
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,940
By the way, Dad, what do you do during training?

669
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,110
What do you mean? You learn how to march,

670
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,610
pack your rucksack, and shoot guns.

671
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,260
Hey, Buddy. Don't worry.

672
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,750
You'll do well since you take after me.

673
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,320
When I was in the military,

674
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,330
I was a specialist and an exemplary squad leader.

675
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:02,190
But Mom said you were in the state forces.

676
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,940
What are you doing? Hurry and pack. Come on.

677
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,150
You're going with all of your friends,

678
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,180
so make sure to listen to the soldiers.

679
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,520
And make sure not to skip your meals.

680
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,170
And don't get hurt.

681
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,980
Are you crying?

682
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,550
Gosh, why are you crying?

683
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,700
Chi Yeol, mind your health, okay?

684
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,350
You just need to come back healthy. All right?

685
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,990
Gosh, I told you not to worry.

686
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,580
Gosh, just sign this for me. Okay?

687
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,170
 Why are you crying? 
It's not like our boy's going to die. 

688
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,350
 I just can't help it. 

689
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,790
It's not like I'll die.

690
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,200
Why are they making me anxious?

691
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,990
   

692
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,580
♫  Welcome to the K-Mars  ♫

693
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,930
♫  It's colorful every night  ♫

694
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,340
♫  Those demons are always asking me 
how much I can endure  ♫

695
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,850
♫  Welcome to the K-Mars  ♫

696
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,970
♫  It's suffocating, there's no air  ♫

697
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,980
♫  Where should I get off first?  ♫

698
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,890
- Hurry and take the picture. 
 - Hey, stop it.

699
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,850
Victory!

700
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,630
Hey, Jang Su!

701
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,010
- Did you get it signed? 
 - Of course!

702
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,630
Wow, daebak.

703
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,380
Hey, Do Yun, did you get it signed, too?

704
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,350
Daebak, shit.

705
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:02,550
Hey, I'm coming for your mom's kimchi jjigae 
after we're done, okay?

706
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,870
Good morning!

707
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,400
Hey, Hey, just do it!

708
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,370
- One. 
  - One, two, three! 

709
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,630
Do you need that much luggage?

710
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,780
It looks like everyone in our class 
still got it signed, right?

711
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,200
Gosh, my mom must hate the idea of her child failing college 
more than getting training.

712
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,360
Hey, seriously. I was totally shocked, too.

713
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,280
Hey, Yu Ha Na, are you emigrating?

714
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,680
Why did you bring two bags?

715
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,960
Hey, I barely got it down to this much.

716
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,110
I couldn't bring even half of my cosmetics.

717
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,630
Hey, Wang Tae Man, are you selling gum?

718
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:36,820
Yes.

719
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,720
To chew them after meals?

720
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,000
It feels stale after.

721
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,720
Do you want one?

722
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,340
 Hey, just brush your teeth! 

723
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,450
- Aigo! 
 - So disgusting, seriously.

724
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,300
Hey, get away!

725
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,830
What are you doing, 
looking like a puppy that needs to poop?

726
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,580
It's nothing. I just...

727
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,310
Oh, Hello, Na Ra.

728
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,850
You!

729
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,310
You?

730
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,920
- What now? 
 - Your face became red.

731
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,120
What do you mean?

732
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,560
- Na Ra— 
 - H-Hey, hey!

733
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,540
Cut it out.

734
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,300
Everyone, take your seat!

735
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,960
Kwon Il Ha!

736
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,380
Did you sleep well?

737
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,250
All right. I have someone to introduce to you all.

738
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,200
Loyalty.

739
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,410
Nice to meet you.

740
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,790
I'm First Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho, 
who will be Class 3-2's platoon leader.

741
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,940
First Lieutenant Lee will explain the training.

742
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,440
Hey, he has a diamond on his forehead.

743
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,990
You'll be assigned to the Second Platoon 
of the Seongjin Division Combat Unit,

744
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,190
and I'll be your platoon leader.

745
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,530
Most of the training will take place after school,

746
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,120
when your regular classes are over.

747
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,900
- What? 
 - After school?

748
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,540
We'll be tired, though.

749
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,150
On days when you have schedules,

750
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,720
training will take priority over classes.

751
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,770
So don't get confused later.

752
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,450
Class President.

753
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,860
Yes?

754
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,350
You're the senior trainee starting today.

755
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,960
- Sorry? 
 - What's a senior?

756
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,240
I don't know.

757
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,530
- Do you know? 
 - What is a senior trainee?

758
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,090
Next up is assigning the role of record keeper 
who will be recording

759
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,840
the process of your training 
and the video for your parents.

760
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,120
Any volunteers?

761
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,790
Hey, don't look up.

762
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,170
- You should do it. 
 - Why would I?

763
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,230
- Don't do it. 
 - I'll never.

764
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,970
No volunteers?

765
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,500
Broadcast Club.

766
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,610
All right then. Your attendance numbers.

767
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,050
Platoon Leader Teacher, 
could I recommend a student?

768
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,120
Yeong Hun. Do you want to give it a try?

769
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,000
Me?

770
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yes, in my opinion, 
you'll have a lot to learn from it.

771
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,580
What do I need to learn?

772
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,130
Jang Yeong Hun, just do it. It's nothing major.

773
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,430
You can do it if it's nothing major.

774
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,600
Well, why don't you try first, 
and I'll change it for you if you don't like it.

775
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,110
I need to study.

776
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,340
I don't want to waste my time.

777
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,800
What a rude punk...

778
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,150
It's fine.

779
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,950
That son of a bitch...

780
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm telling you, he's weird.

781
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,030
Over there. Trainee.

782
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,080
You idiot. He means you.

783
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,610
Wait, m-me?

784
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,510
You're now the record keeper.

785
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,560
Any objections?

786
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,600
No, I don't.

787
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,990
Instead, three reward points.

788
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,560
What?

789
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,670
Same goes for Senior Trainee. What?

790
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,390
- Wait, that's— 
 - Why are you just telling us that?

791
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,490
There's a reward point system 
separate from CSAT extra credits.

792
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,940
You get rewarded 
according to your training results and attitude.

793
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,170
Ten reward points become one CSAT extra credit.

794
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:45,170
On the other hand, 
thirty demerit points will get you discharged.

795
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,540
You'll also lose all your CSAT extra credits.

796
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,930
- What's this? 
 - That makes no sense.

797
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,490
Ten points?

798
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,420
All right then. To your barracks at once.

799
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,080
- Barracks? 
 - Where is that?

800
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,790
- What is he saying? 
 - Barracks?

801
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,610
Is there such a thing here?

802
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,230
- I said you should do it! 
 - No you didn't.

803
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,610
I said it's not.

804
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,550
Go, you asshole.

805
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,930
- Go inside. 
 - Hurry.

806
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,770
I told you to hurry!

807
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,890
Your names are written at the top of your locker.

808
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,490
That's where you'll be living.

809
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,680
Move to your places quickly.

810
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,380
- How do you do, Sir? 
 - Hey, hey. Quickly, he said!

811
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,440
- For the brains! 
 - The brains.

812
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,760
Hey, hey!

813
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,840
We're next to each other!

814
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,060
Gosh, I can't sleep well if the mattress is bad.

815
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,230
Give me a break.

816
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,450
You always drool in sleep on your desk.

817
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,720
Hey, doesn't it feel like we're shooting Real Men?
  (T/N: variety about military life experience) 

818
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,640
Hey, this totally feels like that.

819
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,290
- Private Wu Hui Rak! 
 - Private First Class Wang Tae Man!

820
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,030
- Kim Deok Jung! 
 - Loyalty!

821
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,970
Attention!

822
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,530
What do we do...

823
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,590
Promptly finish unpacking.

824
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,960
Gather in exactly thirty minutes

825
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,280
at the field for personal firearms handling.

826
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,090
Understood?

827
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,600
Yes, I understand! Loyalty, loyalty!

828
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,020
- Sure, sure. 
 - Hey—

829
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,240
Dismissed.

830
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,570
Shit...

831
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,600
Please take care.

832
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,720
Gather in thirty minutes. Move!

833
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,740
Did you see that asshole's name?

834
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,410
It's Won Bin!

835
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,400
Why is he so tanned, though?

836
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,810
Was it always this big?

837
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:58,510
- Hey, I got this. 
 - I brought one, too.

838
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,230
Gosh, I knew it. 
How many pairs of pants did you bring?

839
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,450
- I packed a ton of it. 
 - Me, too.

840
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,090
- Gosh, we should eat them at times like this. 
 - Of course.

841
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,110
Mom won't let me.

842
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,890
Girls, what did you all bring?

843
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,130
I brought perfume.

844
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,860
- Wow, really? Let me see. 
 - It has a really nice fragrance.

845
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,760
- Wow! 
 - How is it?

846
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,780
- Gosh, it's amazing! 
 - Wow!

847
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,750
- Right? 
 - It's amazing!

848
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,360
Hey, let me have some, too.

849
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,560
- No more, no more. 
 - I brought a camera to take pictures. Ta-da!

850
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,620
Take one of us.

851
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,180
- Okay, go stand. 
 - Gosh, that's great.

852
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,790
All right, get together.

853
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,780
One, two, three!

854
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,020
- Wait, this— 
 - You can't show your hand.

855
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,040
- You can't show it. 
 - You need to keep it to yourself.

856
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,020
What's this, by the way?

857
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,250
That's Ddong. Ddong counts double blood. 
  (T/N: Traditional Go-Stop card game) 

858
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,000
It's my grandma's favorite one.

859
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,580
It goes with this one.

860
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,400
Same picture.

861
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,160
Liar.

862
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,860
You played before, haven't you?

863
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,450
Hurry up, it's your turn.

864
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,730
Hey, hey. Everyone...

865
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,380
what are personal firearms, by the way?

866
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,930
- I don't know. 
 - I don't know.

867
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,830
Your own gun, you idiot.

868
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,740
Oh, she said they're guns.

869
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,200
- Whoa... 
 - It came out really nice.

870
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,540
I'll take lots of pictures for you.

871
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,170
Attention.

872
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,220
- It's the best thing I brought. 
 - That's what I'm saying!

873
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,460
Attention!

874
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,250
You little brats, 
do you think you're on a camping trip?

875
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,440
Listen carefully.

876
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,580
Submit all items not needed in the barracks

877
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,340
to the front right this moment.

878
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,900
What's this?

879
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,860
Straightener, toys, lipstick, foundation,

880
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,080
perfumes... Perfume?

881
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,040
Foundation, lipstick!

882
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,950
These brats!

883
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,470
Cigarette?

884
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,010
Hurry, you brats!

885
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,920
Move it!

886
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,380
   realized it right at that moment. 
   

887
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,390
 "Gosh! Something is definitely wrong here." 

888
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,060
 Should I withdraw the agreement now? 

889
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,350
 What? No one asked for it? 

890
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,860
 Shit! 

891
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,100
Mind the headcount when giving out the firearms.

892
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,900
Yes, Sir.

893
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,300
 After finalizing the number of students... 

894
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,840
- Hurry and come down! 
 - Class 3-2!

895
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,860
Stand in a single column 
in front of your platoon leader!

896
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,760
Hurry and come down!

897
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,840
- Class 3-4, over here. 
 - Don't chat.

898
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,180
Promptly! Stand in a single column!

899
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,510
- What class are you? 
 - I'm Class 3-2.

900
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,220
Class 3-2 is over here.

901
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:56,240
You'll be getting 
your personal firearm now, so pay attention!

902
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,500
Yeong Hun, do you

903
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,300
want to be the record keeper?

904
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,490
Having extra credit 
doesn't make any difference for me.

905
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,650
But each point matters to you, right?

906
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,840
Well...

907
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,740
- Well— 
 - Hey, Kimchi.

908
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,220
Platoon Leader told you to do it.

909
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,060
Stop bothering him and just do it yourself.

910
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,350
Oh...

911
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,120
Okay.

912
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,520
Shout out your firearm number when you get yours.

913
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,280
Understood?

914
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,690
I'll ask one more time. Understood?

915
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,920
 Yes! 

916
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,300
Trainee No. 4, Kim Yu Jeong.

917
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,300
Mine is 701404.

918
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,410
Trainee No. 3, Kim Deok Jung!

919
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,790
Received Firearm 701303!

920
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,270
Next.

921
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,840
This weight isn't so bad.

922
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,820
Who said you could fool around with a firearm?

923
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,500
I'm sorry.

924
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,700
How can they trust us and give us guns?

925
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,320
I know.

926
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,510
Trainee No. 6, Kim Chi Yeol! Received...

927
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,060
Firearm 701406!

928
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,510
Next.

929
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:43,500
Gosh, do we have 
to carry this heavy thing every day?

930
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,060
Gosh, that's what I'm saying.

931
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,290
If we lose it, we get discharged 
and have to pay a fine.

932
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,510
Hey, but doesn't this look like 
the ones from the games?

933
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,900
But we don't use M16s even in the games.

934
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,100
The recoil is bad, and the noise is bad too.

935
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,490
Does M16 use 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm?

936
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,750
Are you an idiot? What were 
those thousands of hours of games for?

937
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,080
It's 5.56 mm.

938
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,710
That's the goddess of PUBG. 
  (T/N: "PUBG: Battlegrounds," a battle royal game) 

939
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,940
Gosh, they should have given me Kar 98k, 
my specialty.

940
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,390
Hey...

941
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,670
shut up and run.

942
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,880
I don't want to.

943
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,910
- Run, you punk. 
 - Run!

944
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,000
Hey, wait a moment. Just two seconds then.

945
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,750
- Bang! 
 - Come on, you have to run!

946
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,170
- Bang, bang! 
 - Let's get him!

947
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,860
- What are you doing? 
 - Please help.

948
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,710
Hey, what's wrong... What are you doing?

949
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:31,260
- You little brats— 
 - Hey, wait! Hey!

950
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,270
Hey, come... Hey!

951
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,160
Sit back down, you punk!

952
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,290
Break is over. Gather.

953
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,690
Hey, all of you gather, too.

954
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,110
Hurry and come down.

955
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,810
You guys quit it, too, and gather!

956
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,970
Excuse me, Ajeossi!

957
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,850
Ajeossi? I'm not an ajeossi!

958
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,050
I'm...

959
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,540
twenty-one years old.

960
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,010
I'm only two years older than you lot.

961
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,200
He's twenty-one...

962
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,670
Did someone say something? 
He looks like a twenty-one-year-old.

963
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,370
- Excuse me, Ajeossi. 
 - What?

964
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,130
Could you give me a clean gun instead?

965
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,540
I think someone used it before.

966
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,250
All the guns were used by someone before.

967
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,990
Hurry and come down!

968
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,880
Hey, you guys, stop it and gather!

969
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,320
Gosh, come down!

970
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,130
- My goodness. 
 - To positions!

971
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,090
Go to your positions! Didn't you hear?

972
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,900
To your positions right now.

973
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,440
- Don't you hear me? 
 - What are you all doing right now?

974
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,950
To positions!

975
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,100
Get up and move!

976
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,940
Hurry and come down.

977
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,200
Quickly.

978
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,390
Move it.

979
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,830
The personal firearms you have

980
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:08,060
could either save your lives...

981
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,800
or take them during battle.

982
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,640
The only thing to trust in a time of crisis 
isn't your friend or comrade!

983
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,000
It's the personal firearm that you have.

984
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,520
Now, should you really be...

985
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,140
treating such personal firearms recklessly?

986
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,680
Platoon Leader is asking you.

987
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,190
 W-We shouldn't. 

988
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,830
You see the goalpost there, right?

989
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,910
First three only.

990
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,100
What does he mean?

991
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,550
Hey...

992
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,700
Run.

993
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,010
- Don't run. 
 - Hey, don't run.

994
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,260
- Don't run. 
 - You better not.

995
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,520
Don't run.

996
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,500
- Hey, hey. What's he doing? 
 - Hey.

997
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,100
- Hey. 
 - Gosh!

998
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,100
Hey!

999
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,780
- Hey! 
 - Gosh, I hate this!

1000
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,100
Hey!

1001
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,590
You better run faster!

1002
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,630
Rest of you, come over there.

1003
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,480
Come over here, I said! Run faster!

1004
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,800
You better run faster!

1005
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,380
Next up is first five only. Hurry and run!

1006
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,560
Run faster!

1007
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,140
Run faster! Five people.

1008
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,950
Hey! Hurry and run.

1009
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,790
I think I'll die! This is too tough!

1010
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,380
I think I'm going to vomit.

1011
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,000
- I'm really going to die. 
 - Hey...

1012
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,190
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1013
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,330
- I think I'm going to die. 
 - Me, too.

1014
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,680
I think I'll die from Platoon Leader's coolness.

1015
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,060
He's completely my type.

1016
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,050
Hey, what about Su Cheol 
whom you said is ingeniously handsome?

1017
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,770
He doesn't have... How do I say this?

1018
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,530
He lacks mature charms.

1019
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:11,210
Look at all this! I got rashes, didn't I?

1020
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,170
I get like this with just a bit of sun!

1021
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,530
What about me? What about me?

1022
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,710
Yeon Bo Ra, I told you, right? Look at this.

1023
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:21,420
Gosh, you're so loud. 
I'm about to puke, so be quiet.

1024
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,000
Gosh, what about me?

1025
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,130
Hey, your face is red over here.

1026
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:27,260
- Is it peeling? 
 - Yes.

1027
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,230
Gosh, it hurts.

1028
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,400
Why do I need to suffer like this?

1029
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,350
Shit! That asshole is making me mad!

1030
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,010
That asshole is a nutcase.

1031
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,530
Gosh, I'm so pissed off.

1032
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,100
This can't be happening.

1033
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,690
Gosh, there she goes again.

1034
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,090
Sun Yi is crying again! Again!

1035
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,340
My goodness, please!

1036
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,800
Everyone, give your guns here. 
Don't just leave them anywhere.

1037
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,750
It's the sun allergy. Gosh, what about here?

1038
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,090
Please! Seriously...

1039
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,580
Hey!

1040
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,370
Do you want to do the goalpost run again?

1041
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,640
Organize your guns here.

1042
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,860
Quickly.

1043
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,630
 Mom... 
   

1044
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,090
 Mom... 
   

1045
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:24,430
 I think I was scammed. 
   

1046
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,860
 They said to think of it as camping. 
   

1047
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,910
 This is just the same as the army here! 
   

1048
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,980
 Mom and Dad, don't worry about me. 
   

1049
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,900
 My platoon leader is really handsome and cool. 
   

1050
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,990
 I'll only listen to him and follow him around. 
   

1051
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,300
 Wow, it's hot. 
   

1052
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,600
   

1053
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,190
   

1054
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,220
  I'll do a good job. 
   

1055
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,460
 Wait, is that it? 
   

1056
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,980
 Yes, that's it. 
   

1057
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,480
 After this is over... 
   

1058
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,650
 you're really buying me a motorbike, okay? 
   

1059
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:58,480
 Grandma, don't skip your meals. 
   

1060
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,060
 And don't forget to take your meds. 
   

1061
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,740
 I wrote down the orders yesterday. 
   

1062
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,590
 Don't leave any out, and take them as we promised. 
   

1063
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,330
 Okay? 
   

1064
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:21,410
Hey, big news!

1065
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,080
- Come, gather around. 
 - Wh-Why?

1066
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,850
What's up?

1067
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,500
- What is it? 
 - What's the matter?

1068
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,850
Hey, look at this.

1069
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,190
 What are you doing? 

1070
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:42,350
 Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

1071
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,660
Wow, fuck. Are you sure this isn't fake?

1072
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,930
Seriously.

1073
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,570
Why would the military kill animals?

1074
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,430
It totally looks fake.

1075
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,070
No, it isn't.

1076
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,480
I think I saw this somewhere.

1077
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,570
Before a war breaks out,

1078
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,130
one of the things the government does is

1079
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,710
killing the animals in the zoo.

1080
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:09,850
Tigers! Lions! Elephants!

1081
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:13,170
They kill dangerous animals like those.

1082
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,110
Why?

1083
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,400
Because if they escape with a hungry stomach,

1084
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,490
they'll hunt down and eat humans.

1085
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,300
What about animals that are not as dangerous?

1086
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:27,330
Well...

1087
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,180
they let them starve to death.

1088
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,860
You go starve to death, Idiot.

1089
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,450
- Come on, let's share the snacks— 
 - Wait.

1090
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,490
According to what Deok Jung said,

1091
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,790
it means there's a war.

1092
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,820
It comes down to that.

1093
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,130
Or it means a war is about to break out.

1094
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,590
Come on. There's no way.

1095
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,950
Deok Jung, where did you hear this from?

1096
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,180
What?

1097
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,990
Where did you hear it from?

1098
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,680
It's called "Gunparade March."

1099
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,950
It's an anime.

1100
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,880
It's a classic.

1101
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,510
Aigo.

1102
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,830
You need a beating, you asshole!

1103
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:11,500
Hey, get him!

1104
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,600
What's up with all the noise?

1105
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,280
Where are you going?

1106
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,980
To study.

1107
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,720
Individual actions are prohibited.

1108
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,170
If you want to study, do it here.

1109
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,860
It's too loud for me to focus.

1110
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,400
Because Kwon Il Ha over there has a phone.

1111
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,920
Phones are prohibited.

1112
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,480
Don't you know?

1113
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,890
Bring it here.

1114
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,680
Hurry and go.

1115
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,260
Violation of Regulations on Phone Possession.

1116
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,960
Three demerit points.

1117
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,740
Sure.

1118
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,300
Hey. Come see me later.

1119
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,180
I'm free right now.

1120
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,690
Gosh, that fucking prick.

1121
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,010
- Hey— 
 - What do you think you're doing?

1122
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,490
Both of you, follow me out.

1123
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,960
It's your fault, Idiot.

1124
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,430
- It's your fault. 
 - Gosh.

1125
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:59,660
- Stand up. 
 - What a man. Stand up.

1126
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,320
Gosh!

1127
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,850
Hold it properly, you punk. It's spilling.

1128
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,650
This is why you have no friends.

1129
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,700
Fucking idiot.

1130
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,850
This fucking asshole!

1131
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,760
Hey.

1132
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,850
- Hey! 
 - What, Fucker? What do you want?

1133
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,450
Shit!

1134
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,120
This motherfucker is really getting on my nerve.

1135
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,500
Hey, do you really want to die today?

1136
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,080
Shit, again?

1137
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,990
Hey.

1138
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,790
Do you know that 
everyone thinks you're annoying, you loser?

1139
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:40,250
Not any worse than you, you bully.

1140
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,680
You scumbag.

1141
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,080
Your family must be happy.

1142
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,490
There's less trash at home now.

1143
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:48,880
This motherfucking...

1144
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,020
Hey, hey... H-Hey!

1145
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,180
- Shit. 
 - Hey, what's the matter with you guys?

1146
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,840
Hey, hey! Please! I'm sorry.

1147
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,490
- Please, please! 
 - Let go.

1148
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,890
- Let go, fuck! 
 - Please—

1149
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,380
- I told you to let go! You fucker! 
 - Please calm down!

1150
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,550
- Please, please. 
 - Shit...

1151
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,890
H-Hey...

1152
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,720
Wh-What is this? What?

1153
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:44,530
Can't you tell, you idiot?

1154
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,890
It's the sphere.

1155
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,160
Wow, fuck. I've never seen it so close up.

1156
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,500
Hey, wait. Wait a second.

1157
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,050
Gosh, what?

1158
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,170
You can't. Okay?

1159
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:56,670
It might be dangerous.

1160
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,790
Gosh!

1161
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,280
That asshole got my phone taken.

1162
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,720
I could have gotten so many followers.

1163
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,250
Gosh, how unfortunate.

1164
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,570
Really?

1165
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,410
Why don't you upload your bullying, then?

1166
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:20,050
I'm sure that would be crazy too.

1167
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,720
You piece of garbage.

1168
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,470
Hey! Yeong Hun...

1169
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,820
- Hey, hey. Please. 
 - Let go.

1170
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,260
- Please! 
 - Fuck!

1171
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,590
- My fucking goodness. 
 - Please...

1172
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,390
You're a piece of garbage.

1173
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:38,750
You just get angry...

1174
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,660
when things don't go your way and use your fist.

1175
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,380
   

1176
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,470
 Okay, got it. 

1177
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,100
 Well... 

1178
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,630
 your class, name, 

1179
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:57,370
 what you want to tell your parents, 
and your friends... 

1180
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,480
 Just say... 

1181
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,120
 what you want to tell your parents. 

1182
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,910
 Well... 

1183
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:13,320
 is Cyber-Pia Internet Cafe still there? 

1184
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,120
 Where we used to play PUBG in middle school. 

1185
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,100
 Oh, th-that place? 

1186
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,820
 - So suddenly? 
 - Why? 

1187
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,250
 Did it go out of business? 

1188
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,500
 No. 

1189
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,380
 It's still there. 

1190
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,230
 Does that place still cook Jin Ramen? 

1191
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,130
 - Yes. 
 - What about the egg yolk? 

1192
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,980
 - They pop it for you. 
 - Gosh. 

1193
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,560
 Still? 

1194
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,230
 I told them not to pop the egg for Jin Ramen. 

1195
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,030
 The owner always forgets. 

1196
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,120
 Do you... 

1197
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,720
 still have my ID as a friend on PUBG? 

1198
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,430
 Well... 

1199
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:02,060
 Of course. 

1200
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:06,740
 Let's go and play together next time. 

1201
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:15,490
   

1202
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,690
 Okay. 
   

1203
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,580
 After the CSAT... 
   

1204
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:26,920
   

1205
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,620
   

1206
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:41,070
