1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,240
   

2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,250
What the heck?

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,770
Gosh, that surprised me.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,400
- What was that? 
 - I heard something.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm sorry, Yeon Ju!

6
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,710
Yeong Hun...

7
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,130
Yeong Hun.

8
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,880
It's dangerous!

9
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,360
Trainee Kim Chi Yeol, are you okay?

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,370
Trainee Kim Chi Yeol.

11
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,560
   

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
   

13
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,240
   

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,110
   

15
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,230
   

16
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:52,050


17
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,860
   

18
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,830
Yes. Understood.

19
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,780
They clearly said those spheres weren't dangerous.

20
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,040
They said it was safe at the school.

21
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,210
Nothing would happen, they said.

22
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,350
But... how could Yeong Hun...

23
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,030
We also didn't expect Trainee Jang Yeong Hun's death.

24
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,520
Yeong Hun isn't a trainee.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
He's a student.

26
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,920
What do we do about my students now?

27
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,370
Shouldn't we be sending them back home now?

28
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,970
For now, please keep it a secret.

29
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,650
- Pardon? 
 - In order to prevent a nationwide chaos,

30
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,020
the government ordered us not to disclose any information about the falling spheres.

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,190
We're currently working on a plan to minimize the chaos this information would create.

32
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,160
A student died!

33
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
When such dangerous things are present, how could we keep the students here—

34
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,340
The students already belong to the military.

35
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,500
All matters will be taken care of according to the military law.

36
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,870
Wait...

37
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,950
I'll be the one to tell the students.

38
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,990
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

39
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,680
It's okay, it's okay.

40
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,740
It wasn't your fault.

41
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,660
It was an accident,

42
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,590
so let's not think too deeply about this.

43
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,800
If it gets hard, come to me and during class...

44
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,090
Right. It would be better for you to take a break for a few days. Do you want to do that?

45
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm sorry. I'm also...

46
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,600
Are you really okay?

47
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,450
Let's say Yeong Hun got injured and was sent home.

48
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,850
Your classmates will be confused and

49
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,710
I'll break the news to them when the time comes.

50
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,750
I hope you'll keep it a secret from the others.

51
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,820
Do you think you can do that for me?

52
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,090
Yes.

53
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,990
You, too, Chi Yeol.

54
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,560
Hey, Kimchi. Kimchi!

55
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,630
Hey, you heard Ms. Park, right?

56
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,070
Don't run your mouth in front of others.

57
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,600
You also saw it.

58
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,990
He was the one to start the fight.

59
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,230
Technically, it isn't my fault, either.

60
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,320
Jang Yeong Hun, that asshole, just got unlucky.

61
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,530
So act accordingly.

62
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,270
Unless you want to turn out like that asshole.

63
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,700
 First Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho, how did the sphere attack? 

64
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,090
 "It split"? Do you mean it split into multiple parts? 

65
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,670
 Don't you hear me? First Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho! 

66
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,510
 Help me! Please, save me! 

67
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,870
 I don't want to die! 

68
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,100
 No! 

69
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,530
 Platoon Leader! 

70
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,520
Aigo, shit.

71
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,370
- Gosh. 
 - Okay, okay.

72
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,230
Exit!

73
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,640
Hey, I heard something heavy drop earlier.

74
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,040
Was there a car accident?

75
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,480
Fuck!

76
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,690
Hey, are you able to study in this situation right now?

77
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,390
It's fine, it's fine. Just go on.

78
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,980
All right. I'm going.

79
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,390
- It's my turn. 
 - All right then.

80
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,280
Let's go.

81
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,790
Chi Yeol, didn't you guys hear anything outside?

82
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,120
But why are you two the only ones back? Where's Yeong Hun?

83
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,650
Oh...

84
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,350
Well... he got a little injured, so he went home.

85
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,150
"He got injured"? Where?

86
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,000
Just here and there.

87
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,210
How did he get injured?

88
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,250
He just got injured, I said.

89
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,770
It must've been bad if they sent him back home.

90
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,620
Is he coming back?

91
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,050
I don't think he is.

92
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,170
That punk is always by himself anyway.

93
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,430
Come on. There's no way.

94
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,580
Would Jang Yeong Hun give up extra credit on the CSAT?

95
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,500
What? Are you smiling?

96
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,980
No.

97
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,070
I'm glad it was that punk.

98
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,950
I would have felt so bad

99
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,730
if someone close to me got hurt and was discharged. Right?

100
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,800
That's true.

101
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,310
You must be happy, Guk Yeong Su. You're first place if Yeong Hun isn't here.

102
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,310
Is he finally living up to his name? Studying hard with a focus on Korean, English, and math...

103
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,960
 Guk Yeong Su. 
 (T/N: Abbreviation. Guk: Korean, Yeong: English, Su: Math) 

104
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,480
- No, not at all. 
 -  Not at all? 

105
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,730
He's trying not to smile.

106
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,120
- N-No, I'm not. 
 -  Huh? 

107
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,220
What do you mean you're not? You're dying of joy.

108
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,300
- No, I'm not. I'm really not. 
 - Hey, Yeong Su.

109
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,750
- What's wrong? 
 - What are you trying to become, studying so hard? A doctor?

110
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,070
You've got a terrible expression on your face.

111
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,760
Did something happen?

112
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,330
It's nothing.

113
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,400
 Starting yesterday, all high schools across the country 

114
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,560
 have begun to combine regular classes with military training. 

115
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,050
- Please show me your ID. 
 -  The Department of Education emphasized 

116
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,690
 the need to pay special attention to prevent accidents. 

117
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,070
 Following news. Spheres fell in Seoul and throughout the country last night. 

118
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,610
 According to the government, about thirty spheres have fallen and 

119
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,840
 - there is no accurate report on the damages yet.  
 - Ms. Park.

120
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,690
- Ms. Park! 
  - The government requested that you don't go 

121
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,820
- Yes. 
  - near fallen spheres or touch them. 

122
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,410
- Take care. 
  - And to report to the nearest military base or police station. 

123
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,050
Loyalty.

124
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,180
   

125
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
Hey, hey. Does that mean last night's noise was from the sphere falling?

126
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,780
- Gosh, shit. 
 - Class 3-3's kids said the gym building was destroyed.

127
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,940
That's it.

128
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,960
Hey, if it's enough to destroy a building, doesn't it mean the shock from it is crazy?

129
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,130
- Whoa! 
 - Gosh, what the hell!

130
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,570
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - Hey.

131
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,040
- You're so annoying! 
 - Daebak!

132
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,440
Hey, change seats with me!

133
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,420
Fuckng idiot!

134
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,640
- Did Yeong Hun get hurt because of the spheres? 
 - What?

135
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,460
I mean, the timing is just right.

136
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,120
That's true. That would make sense.

137
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,910
- It's so hot! 
 - Hey, it fucking hurts! It got so red!

138
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,520
- Hey, am I red here? 
 - Yes, it's really red.

139
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,610
 Hey! Hey. 

140
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,800
- Loyalty! 
 - It's fine, it's fine.

141
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,270
- Did you make the report? 
 - Yes.

142
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,330
We got a reply, right?

143
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,310
- We're working on it right now. 
 - My goodness.

144
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,950
No one said those things would attack their surroundings, right? Shit.

145
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,720
Wh-What do we need to do now?

146
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,980
Last night's accident happened all too suddenly.

147
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,190
The students aren't ready—

148
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,630
But we'll still need to train them, right?

149
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,700
- Hurry and get them the shooting training, okay? 
  - Yes, Sir. 

150
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,400
Isn't it too early?

151
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,930
Hey, you idiot. They might be taken to battle any time now.

152
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,140
We need to teach them how to shoot a gun at least!

153
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,940
Hurry and teach them!

154
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,860
If you shoot a monkey hanging on a tree with a gun,

155
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,860
the startled monkey will let go and start a free fall movement.

156
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,590
In that case, will the bullet be able to hit the monkey?

157
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,630
Is no one going to answer?

158
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,080
Try to guess at least. Aigo.

159
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,650
Gosh, how many times does that make? It's so freaking loud.

160
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,300
You're the loudest one.

161
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,380
Everyone, close the windows.

162
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,900
- Gosh, Mr. Nam! It's too hot! 
 - Mr. Nam, it's hot.

163
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,700
Turn on the A.C. then, okay?

164
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,430
Oh? Is there another one?

165
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,370
Gosh, seriously.

166
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,020
Hey... doesn't it sound like they're saying that?

167
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,530
- Saying what? 
 - Kill, save, kill...

168
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,290
What are you all doing? The ones by the windows, hurry and close them.

169
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,410
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

170
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,810
V of y is...

171
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,710
Guys.

172
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,150
Listen to what I'm saying, okay?

173
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,800
I said this earlier, right?

174
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,050
No one will help you with your life.

175
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,310
Therefore, you need to study hard

176
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,770
and do the training just as hard.

177
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,500
Understood? Just as hard!

178
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,860
 - Yes.  
 - Just as hard!

179
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,690
- Move faster. 
 - Hurry!

180
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,410
Hold on more tightly.

181
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,620
Move quickly and promptly.

182
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,230
Grab the silencer and the helmet with your left hand!

183
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,340
It hurts!

184
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,570
Move quickly!

185
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,670
- Hurry and come out! 
 - Hold the firearm with left hand.

186
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,620
What are you doing right now?

187
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,070
- Move quickly. Hurry! 
 - Whoa, okay.

188
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,000
There! Hurry and go!

189
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,510
Look at you, move. Do it right!

190
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,070
Move quickly. To the left.

191
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,120
Hold it properly!

192
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,250
Move quickly!

193
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,090
Who said you can stand still? Run!

194
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,270
All trainees, assume assault firing position!

195
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,850
 To position! 

196
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,510
Prone position, shooting by steps. Step one!

197
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,920
 Step one! 

198
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,800
- Step two! 
  - Step two! 

199
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,480
- Step three! 
  - Step three! 

200
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,350
Standing up by steps. Step one!

201
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,440
 Step one! 

202
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,360
- Step two! 
  - Step two! 

203
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't make eye contact with your platoon leader.

204
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,460
Why are you watching me?

205
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,390
Raise your body. Properly!

206
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,710
Muzzles forward!

207
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,660
Who the hell said you could plant the muzzles?

208
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,850
Muzzles front! Face forward!

209
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,940
 Isn't this way too hard? 
   

210
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,480
 Mom... 
   

211
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,500
 Of course, I want to give up everything and go home. 
   

212
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:26,410
 But then I won't get the extra credit everyone else is getting. 
   

213
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,160
 That just makes me anxious. 
   

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,870
All trainees, focus as not to drop the Go stones when firing.

215
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,950
Relax your bodies, hold your breath, and focus.

216
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,690
Fire.

217
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,650
Hey, you can do it. Why are you so—

218
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,990
- Shaky hands, you asshole? 
 - Guk Yeong Su...

219
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,860
Study shooting like you study other stuff.

220
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,920
Gosh, fucking seriously!

221
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,010
- Shit. 
 -  Platoon Leader is looking. Hurry up and do it.

222
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,050
All right!

223
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,780
Hurry and come out.

224
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,800
Stand up. Move quickly to the next station.

225
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,250
- Hold your helmet properly. 
 - Move faster.

226
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,560
 You're an idiot if you're serious about the training. 
   

227
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,050
 Studying is the best thing to do in free time. 
   

228
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,030
 I just hope none of our classmates get hurt. 
   

229
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,230
Fuck! I'm not eating this.

230
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,420
Gosh, looks like someone moved in.

231
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,400
- It's rotten. 
 - I think it really did go bad. Try it.

232
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,010
Group One will start disassembly of firearms first.

233
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,590
Starting with Group One, start disassembling of firearms.

234
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,920
- Start! 
  - Start! 

235
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,770
When you're done with the disassembly,

236
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,090
raise your hand to get it checked by the assistant instructors.

237
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,310
Hey, you need to place it on top before I can start!

238
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm sorry.

239
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,320
Gosh, this bitch...

240
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,840
- Try firing. 
 - What are you doing?

241
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,650
Try firing.

242
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,760
♫  Can't find it, I'm here  ♫

243
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,950
You can't even fire when it's placed right.

244
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,700
 I'm trying to do my best... 
   

245
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,260
 but this thing keeps falling off my shoulders. 
   

246
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,190
 Does yours not fall down? 
   

247
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,930
- Are you okay? 
 - Check for breathing!

248
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,430
- Wake up, please! 
  - Check for breathing! 

249
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,550
- All right. There's no breathing. Commence chest compression! 
  - Commence chest compression! 

250
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,600
Gosh, I'm so tired.

251
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,650
Kimchi, drink some water.

252
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,190
Yes.

253
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,280
Hey, drink water.

254
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,390
What's the matter?

255
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,590
Dude.

256
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,660
Hey.

257
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,300
 How do you think I'm doing, Idiot? It's fucking terrible. 
   

258
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,350
 Hey, stop fucking recording me and record someone else. 
   

259
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh...

260
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,740
- Guys. 
 - What?

261
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,400
- Yu Jeong, let them be. Let's do self-study. 
 - Okay.

262
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,200
 Anyhow, there are more kids who stayed than those who left. 
   

263
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,150
 In times like this, following the majority is safer. 
   

264
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,730
- Damn, you're fast. 
 - Gosh, this is great.

265
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,750
I have only worn this for five days.

266
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,630
- Should I just keep it for later? 
 - Five days?

267
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,220
Let me see.

268
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,060
Why the hell would you smell that, you idiot?

269
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,780
I mean, he said he only wore it for five days.

270
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,930
- Shit! 
 - Wang Tae Man, that bastard!

271
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,960
 When you're on night watch duty, 
   

272
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,290
 it's kind of nice chatting with the girls. 
   

273
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,270
 It would be really nice to be on duty with Ha Na! 
   

274
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,790
Please draw me exceptionally pretty.

275
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,210
Gosh, I want to date a British man, too.

276
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,440
"British men"? Na Ra knows well about them.

277
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,280
We need to dry our underwear here

278
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,410
when those beasts are outside?

279
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,170
Gosh, seriously! They might steal.

280
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,780
That's what I'm saying. Gosh.

281
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,330
Complainer One and Two. How are you two so alike?

282
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,470
Hey, this girl and I?

283
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,560
- I should be the offended one— 
 - I'm more offended. Just hang your laundry!

284
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,020
- Gosh, why are you throwing it at me? 
 - Whoa!

285
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,560
Is he looking at me right now?

286
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,430
That fucking pervert! People like him come out on the news later.

287
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,750
What a fucking nutcase!

288
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,140
- He's such a pervert. 
 - I'm grossed out.

289
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,540
- Why are they smiling? 
 - Fucking lunatics.

290
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,590
Hey, Wang Tae Man, do some laundry!

291
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,940
- You smell like feet! 
 - D-Do you want some?

292
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,570
This is ridiculous.

293
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,500
 I took a shower just now, but the smell is not going away. 
   

294
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,960
 Yu Ha Na, come smell me. 
   

295
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,510
 - You don't smell. 
 - I don't? 

296
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,240
 What about me? Smell me, too. 
   

297
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,450
 Do I smell? Try again. There's no way. 
   

298
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,070
 No, no. I think I'll throw up. 
   

299
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,200
 - No way. Smell me again. 
 - My nose is about to get fucked up! 

300
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
 No way! 
   

301
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,320
Keep trying until you don't drop the Go stone.

302
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,840
It keeps shaking. You need to hold your breath.

303
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,110
Trainee Cha So Yeon.

304
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,650
Bring your elbows together.

305
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,850
Relax your left hand.

306
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,860
Hold your breath.

307
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,770
Focus.

308
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,920
Fire.

309
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,770
 The hardest thing for me? 
   

310
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,930
 I don't have one yet. 
    

311
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,420
Daebak!

312
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,510
Na Ra did it!

313
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,370
Yu Jeong also did it.

314
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,380
I did it! I got it!

315
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,820
- I got it! 
 - Did you see that?

316
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,620
Frontal deterrence!

317
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,840
Hurry and come out!

318
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Quickly, run to the next obstacle.

319
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,520
Move quickly!

320
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,580
- Run faster. Come back. Come here. 
 - Run!

321
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,590
- Run! 
 - Run!

322
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,850
Where is your answer?

323
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,100
- Prone position, shooting by steps. Step one! 
 -  Step one! 

324
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,840
- Step two! 
  - Step two! 

325
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,690
- Step three! 
  - Step three! 

326
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,570
I just can't help but feel worried.

327
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,630
I-I really didn't tell anyone!

328
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,680
See what I'm saying? It's dangerous.

329
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,930
I really won't tell. Okay?

330
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,930
- I'll take it to my grave. 
 - Really?

331
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,270
I'll see if you'll really take it to your grave then.

332
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,470
Wh-Whoa!

333
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,760
You fucking asshole! Come here!

334
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,790
Where the fuck did this son of a bitch go?

335
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,470
W-Wait.

336
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,300
   

337
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,670
Kim Chi Yeol...

338
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,410
where are you going?

339
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,510
I-I'm going to the bathroom.

340
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,460
Make it quick.

341
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,040
Na Ra...

342
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,890
what are you doing here?

343
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,950
I couldn't go back to sleep after night watch duty.

344
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,220
What about you?

345
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,760
I just...

346
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,000
woke up.

347
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,450
   

348
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,380
They must be the names of ones who left.

349
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,170
   

350
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,550
If I'd known this would happen, I should have been more friendly with them.

351
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,950
- Did Yeong Hun get hurt badly? 
 - What?

352
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,270
No.

353
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,120
He just...

354
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
got a little injured.

355
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,630
   

356
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,900
- Wait, it's supposed to be better— 
 - What?

357
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,600
What was that?

358
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,330
No, nothing.

359
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,400
Na Ra, you said you used to live in England, right? 
    

360
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,740
Yes.

361
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,470
Why?

362
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,070
Just asking.

363
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,850
   

364
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,360
Chi Yeol, were you close with Yeong Hun?

365
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,000
We were born and raised in the same neighborhood.

366
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,190
Then you must have been close.

367
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,930
Yes.

368
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,330
I'll be going now then.

369
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:18,130
 

370
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,820
You'll be given one minute to disassemble and reassemble your firearms.

371
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,980
If you fail to do it properly in one minute, you'll be punished.

372
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,020
 What? Punishment? 

373
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,400
Who was that just now? Come out.

374
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,150
Ahem.

375
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,680
Group One, commence disassembly and reassembly of firearms.

376
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,670
 Understood! 

377
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,260
Hey, So Yeon, do you still think he's cool?

378
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,520
So Yeon?

379
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,460
Yes. He's so cool, whatever he does.

380
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,090
- Disassembly complete. 
 - Cool?

381
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,160
Whom? Me?

382
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,280
Disassembly complete!

383
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,900
- Disassembly complete! 
 - Shut up, Squidward.

384
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
Squidward?

385
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,760
   

386
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,080
Assembly complete.

387
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,480
Assembly complete.

388
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,630
 Assembly complete! 

389
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,750
Assembly complete.

390
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,740
Group Two, switch.

391
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,630
- Assembly complete. 
 - Assembly complete!

392
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,900
- Assembly complete. 
 - Assembly complete!

393
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,620
Group Three, come forward.

394
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,070
There.

395
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,320
- Assembly complete! 
 - Assembly complete.

396
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,050
Assembly complete. Gosh...

397
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,370
Start.

398
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,390
- Assembly complete. 
 -  Wow... 

399
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,630
Assembly complete.

400
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,780
She's good.

401
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,280
- Assembly complete. 
  - Wow. 

402
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,340
- Assembly complete! 
 - Assembly complete.

403
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,890
Time's up.

404
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,300
One minute passed.

405
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,330
Reassemble your rifle.

406
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,180
Trainee No Ae Seol, reassemble your rifle.

407
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,820
Yes.

408
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,470
Again.

409
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,460
- Again. 
 - Gosh.

410
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,680
- Again. 
 - Did it take her this long?

411
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,260
Again.

412
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,260
How long do we need to wait?

413
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,360
She's taking so long.

414
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,390
Again.

415
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,540
You just take that and—

416
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,280
What is she doing?

417
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,000
- Again. 
 - Gosh.

418
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,600
 Gosh. 

419
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,980
- Ae Seol, please hurry! 
 - I'm so hungry.

420
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,700
- When is she done? 
 - I'm starving.

421
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,320
Ae Seol...

422
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,340
- Gosh. 
 - Seriously.

423
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,910
Ae Seol, I'm hungry.

424
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:07,320
That's what I'm saying. Excuse me, can you hear me?

425
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,100
Shit.

426
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,530
Second Platoon, attention.

427
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,430
Attention.

428
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,080
In this training site, you don't exist as an individual.

429
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,010
There's only us.

430
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,100
However, criticizing your friend's mistake

431
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,870
and mocking her...

432
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,310
If this were an actual situation, you would all be dead already.

433
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,000
In that sense, until the one last person succeeds,

434
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,850
- there's no dinner today. 
 - What?

435
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,450
- Wait, that's... 
 - Come on...

436
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,910
- That's too much! 
 - I'm so hungry.

437
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,940
So annyoing.

438
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,300
Trainee No Ae Seol.

439
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,560
Start.

440
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,590
Thanks, You-Know-Who, for this amazing dinner.

441
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,150
What an amazing dinner.

442
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,040
Hey.

443
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,380
Hey!

444
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,460
You know we're eating this trash because of you, right?

445
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm sorry.

446
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,760
What are you going to do about it?

447
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,490
I'm sorry.

448
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,850
Hey!

449
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,650
Stop it. Ae Seol is eating right now.

450
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,020
Hey, is this the first time?

451
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,690
- I wouldn't say anything even if this was the second time. 
 - Still, say it after she's done eating.

452
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,740
Oh, are you her boyfriend or something?

453
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,510
Am I allowed to say this if I'm the boyfriend? Then I am.

454
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,540
Has he gone crazy? What's wrong with that idiot?

455
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,330
- This is insane. 
 - Are those two dating?

456
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,810
Are they really dating?

457
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,160
I lost my appetite.

458
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,840
Go ahead and eat.

459
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,170
Hey, hey. Hey! It's big news.

460
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,900
What is this? Gosh, this reaction is upsetting.

461
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,770
Eat your dinner.

462
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,730
Okay. I won't talk anymore.

463
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,840
It's big news.

464
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,680
What? What is it?

465
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,800
This is the reaction I'm talking about.

466
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,370
- We're shooting with real bullets tomorrow. 
 - Wow!

467
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,620
- I also know. 
 - What?

468
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,420
- Everyone knows, Dude. 
 - How?

469
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,980
It's written in the training schedule in front of the classroom that we're using real bullets tomorrow.

470
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,800
Well, you're a genius, aren't you?

471
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,250
I finished checking the itinerary for the shooting range for tomorrow.

472
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,770
- Good job, Won Bin. 
 - Thank you.

473
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,830
- Prepare DU ammunition too. 
 - That too? 
  (T/N: From Depleted Uranium, used in armor-piercing projectiles) 

474
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,060
- I heard it's still under development. 
 - We don't know if something will happen.

475
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,030
Take care of the ammunition so there won't be any accidents.

476
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,830
Understood.

477
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,350
But when you look at it like this, it's quite pretty.

478
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,420
The sphere, that is.

479
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,800
One, two...

480
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,520
- Stop fooling around. 
 - Gosh.

481
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Gosh, seriously!

482
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,420
Thank you. Cover it up.

483
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,510
Hey, I almost died.

484
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,730
Hey, you're late. Hurry and go.

485
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,250
- Ms. Park, Ms. Park. 
 - Are you coming with us to the real bullet shooting?

486
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,660
Of course, I'm coming. Don't worry.

487
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,040
Just get the training properly.

488
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,110
- Is it good? 
 - Second Platoon's headcount is complete.

489
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,460
- How is he so handsome? 
 - Cut it out.

490
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,650
Please stay still, for goodness’ sake.

491
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,930
Stop fooling around.

492
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,100
I'm here!

493
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,580
All preparations are complete.

494
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,770
- Wait, not yet. 
 - Gosh, it's so tight.

495
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,380
Second Platoon, attention!

496
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,210
 Attention! 

497
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,380
Make sure to follow us to the shooting range so as not to have any deserters. Understood?

498
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,570
 Yes, Sir! 

499
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,710
Second Platoon, depart.

500
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,750
 Understood! 

501
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,520
   

502
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,480
   

503
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,750
   

504
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,400
- W-Wow, hey! 
 - Gosh, you startled me!

505
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,280
- Wow! 
 - Gosh.

506
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
What is this? Why are the streets so empty?

507
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,280
- That's true. All the stores are closed too. 
 - Wow...

508
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,080
It looks like the world has ended.

509
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,640
Shit.

510
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,210
How is there not a single person?

511
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,250
There's not a single rat roaming around.

512
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,040
I don't hear any of the firetrucks from yesterday.

513
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,790
Right, Kimchi?

514
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,330
- Do you need to poop? 
 - Oh my gosh.

515
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,580
Why are you asking him if he needs to poop when you're the one who wants to poop?

516
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,760
- Hey, so nasty. 
 - Second Platoon.

517
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,510
The walk to the shooting range will be in silence.

518
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,280
Silence! No chatting!

519
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,650
Come on, hurry.

520
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,380
Run.

521
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,120
One!

522
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,020
Two!

523
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,000
- One! 
 - Sit down and shoot!

524
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Two! 
  - Sit down and shoot! 

525
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,630
- One! 
 - Look at them.

526
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,370
- Stand up and shoot! 
 - Loyalty.

527
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,450
- There is nothing out of the ordinary to report.
  - Stand up and shoot! 

528
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,260
Class 3-2, line up in front of Platoon Sergeant!

529
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,220
 Line up. 

530
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,610
- I'm right in front of you! 
 - Aren't they from Cheongmun High?

531
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,330
- Wow! 
 - Hey.

532
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,850
No chatting!

533
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,450
Sun Yi.

534
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,580
- Line up! 
 - Hey, get up.

535
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,740
Get up!

536
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,540
Whoa.

537
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,750
 The gunfire was really... really loud. 
   

538
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,550
 Never mind piss, I almost shit myself. 
   

539
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,230
 And Deok Jung actually shit himself. 
   

540
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,610
 The poop just keeps coming. 
   

541
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,120
Commence firing, starting with

542
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,310
the prepared marksman.

543
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,100
 Start shooting! 

544
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,000
First shot.

545
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,750
- First shot! 
 - Second shot.

546
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,840
- Second shot! 
 - Second shot.

547
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,360
Second shot.

548
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,600
- Second shot! 
 - Second shot!

549
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,590
  I'm just thinking... It would be scary if a war broke out. 
   

550
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,850
 I just want to go home. 
   

551
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,540
 By the way, isn't Kwon Il Ha a bit weird these days? 
   

552
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,150
 He keeps spacing out, even when he smokes. 
   

553
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,630
 He always was a nutcase. 
   

554
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,020
 Don't tell Il Ha. 
   

555
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,720
 First shot! 

556
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,570
 Left side finished shooting, the right side finished shooting. 

557
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,930
 All shooting, complete. Gunner, verify the target. 

558
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,630
 Verify the target! 

559
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,450
Kim Chi Yeol.

560
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,150
- Kim Chi Yeol. 
 - What?

561
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,100
Are you okay?

562
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,170
Your face is red.

563
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,680
M-My face?

564
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,340
Where?

565
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,690
Here.

566
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,890
Are you okay? It looks like a bruise.

567
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,510
Oh, this is from that.

568
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,570
When I was holding the gun just now,

569
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,290
I put it right next to my nose to take aim.

570
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,440
But because of the recoil...

571
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,090
You should be careful, too. The recoil is really something.

572
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,950
Okay, thank you.

573
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,850
- Kim Chi Yeol! 
 - Yes.

574
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,270
- What? 
 - Aren't you going to check?

575
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,840
Run!

576
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,020
- You brat. Are you dating? What were you doing? 
 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

577
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,400
- Whoa. 
 - How did you do?

578
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,760
Hey, you...

579
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,570
I was shooting like a pro.

580
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,320
Hey, I saw everything.

581
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,750
Attention, Second Platoon.

582
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,190
 Attention! 

583
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,300
Trainee No. 3.

584
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,200
Trainee No. 3, Kim Deok Jung.

585
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,460
I gave you three bullets,

586
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,620
but why is there only one hole?

587
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,990
With my outstanding shooting skills, I shot all three bullets

588
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,510
in the bullseye.

589
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,380
- Wow, daebak. 
 - Really?

590
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,040
 Whoa. 

591
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,320
 - So cool.  
 - He's incredible.

592
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,940
- Get down. 
 - Get down.

593
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,780
Who's just making a new hole in their target right now?

594
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,150
Trainee No. 12, Wang Tae Man.

595
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,410
Wang Tae Man, get down.

596
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,440
Get down.

597
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,270
What the hell are you doing, man?

598
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,330
He's such a doofus.

599
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,700
Trainee No. 8.

600
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,290
Sir. Trainee No. 8, Do Su Cheol.

601
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,020
Why do you have eight holes? Is it the solar system?

602
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,810
Including the people next to Trainee No. 8,

603
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,680
everyone get down.

604
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,650
- I'm sorry! 
  - I'm sorry! 

605
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,990
Senior Trainee.

606
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,350
Trainee No. 4, Kim Yu Jeong.

607
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,410
- This is yours. 
 - Wow.

608
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,650
She sucks.

609
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,400
What's that? Were you even looking?

610
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,700
Where was she looking?

611
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,130
My hand, my hand!

612
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,480
Be quiet.

613
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,760
- This is actually a good shot. 
 - What?

614
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,490
- How... 
 - It missed the target,

615
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,670
but all three shots landed in one place, forming a great shot group.

616
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:53,330
In this case, if the caliper's is adjusted, she could hit whatever target she wants.

617
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,960
 Whoa. 

618
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,400
 Whoa. 

619
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,240
 Whoa. 

620
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,990
Here's a very good shooter. Trainee No. 15.

621
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,140
Trainee No. 15, Lee Na Ra.

622
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,150
It's perfect.

623
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,400
All three bullets hit the bullseye.

624
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,590
All right. Adjust your calipers according to your shot groups.

625
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,200
- And begin shooting again. 
  - Gosh... 

626
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,310
- I don't want to. 
 - My stomach hurts.

627
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,090
Kim Deok Jung is going to shit again.

628
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,920
There will be reward points for those who do well,

629
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,930
so may you focus and shoot. Understood?

630
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,980
How many reward points?

631
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,090
Three reward points.

632
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,770
Hey, go on.

633
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,620
First shot.

634
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,930
Second shot.

635
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,620
Third shot.

636
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,760
Holy...

637
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,110
My shots improved from the solar system.

638
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,200
Improved? Improved how?

639
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,220
- Bbq chicken, scallion chicken. I like it all— 
 - Damn it.

640
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,210
So cranky.

641
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,770
My ear hurts.

642
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,440
Be quiet. I'll do better next time.

643
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,790
You didn't? I already gave up.

644
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,210
What's wrong with you?

645
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,700
You didn't give up. You just can't.

646
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,250
Look forward.

647
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,990
Stop!

648
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,590
Second Platoon, stop.

649
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,490
Stop!

650
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,250
We'll take a ten-minute rest in our current location.

651
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,890
Ten-minute rest.

652
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,250
Guys, let's take a rest on the side.

653
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,690
Rest up.

654
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,540
Take a seat.

655
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,550
Don't go far.

656
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,060
That's from earlier.

657
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,640
Why is this here?

658
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,460
Take it. Take it.

659
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,380
Should we?

660
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,850
Is something wrong?

661
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,160
Hey.

662
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,700
- What? 
 - Don't you want something refreshing?

663
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,640
Totally. I crave something sweet too.

664
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,380
Right?

665
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,450
Do you want to go to that convenience store?

666
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,820
Okay.

667
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,830
It's better to be safe, so I'll go ahead and take a look.

668
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,150
Have the trainees on standby and keep them out of trouble.

669
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,570
Understood.

670
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,280
Confirm DU ammunition.

671
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,650
DU ammunition?

672
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,970
- Check that side. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

673
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,010
Excuse me.

674
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,770
Hello?

675
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,480
What the...

676
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,170
Is no one here?

677
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,560
The doors aren't locked...

678
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,100
and everything is scattered everywhere.

679
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,550
I'm so hungry.

680
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,240
You're fucking quick.

681
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,420
- Wang Tae Man, gum! 
 - Gum?

682
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,260
Military food was fucking nasty. I should pack everything.

683
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,310
Gum.

684
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,790
Fuck! Cigarettes!

685
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,090
You fucking lucky bastard!

686
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,690
This one is for me.

687
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,790
There's cash too.

688
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,350
Right? This is a bit overboard, right?

689
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,800
Okay.

690
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,460
Whoa.

691
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,830
- Yeon Ju, you'll do well. 
 - Yes, you'll improve.

692
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,640
- I'm hungry. 
 - Me, too.

693
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,170
Ms. Park, I'm hungry.

694
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,430
I think we'll eat when we get back.

695
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,830
- But where did Tae Man and Hui Rak go? 
  - What? 

696
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,780
Hold on.

697
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,860
Yu Jeong, have you seen Tae Man and Hui Rak?

698
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,870
They were right there just moments ago.

699
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,100
Where did they go?

700
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,610
These boys...

701
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,320
- Platoon Sergeant. 
 - Yes?

702
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,600
I don't see two of the boys, Tae Man and Hui Rak.

703
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,750
What? Since when?

704
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,290
They were here just now, but...

705
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,330
Corporal Park.

706
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,750
Two male students broke away. Check over there.

707
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,070
I'll check this side.

708
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,750
Stay right here with the students and don't move.

709
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,410
All right.

710
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,780
These boys know no fear.

711
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,710
Have you guys not seen Tae Man and Hui Rak?

712
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,050
 No. 

713
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,530
- We haven't seen them. 
 - You didn't see them, right?

714
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,680
- Was no one with them? 
 - Hey.

715
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,670
What if we get punished as a group because of them?

716
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,600
Come on, don't say something so horrible.

717
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,730
I'm going to kill him.

718
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,840
Ms. Park, well...

719
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,550
they said something about a convenience store.

720
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,880
- What? 
 - Huh?

721
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,950
- A convenience store? 
 - They went to a convenience store?

722
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,850
Idiots!

723
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,510
Where is the convenience store?

724
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,180
Class President, let's look for them together.

725
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,330
Who left a personal firearm here?

726
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,570
They'll get in trouble if they leave it here.

727
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,550
Isn't that Kim Yu Jeong?

728
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,060
Where are you going?

729
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,780
- What's wrong with her? 
 - Where are you going?

730
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,940
Hey, let's follow them.

731
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,840
Isn't this...

732
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,260
the trace of a fallen, medium-sized sphere?

733
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,300
But why isn't anything here?

734
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,340
- Hey, what is it? 
 - Shit!

735
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,760
Ah!

736
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,680
That's someone's hand!

737
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,540
- Why... 
 - It's real.

738
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,760
What happened?

739
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,570
It's not real.

740
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,920
Why is that here?

741
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,160
Why...

742
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,990
What is this?

743
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,370
What happened?

744
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,130
- Is it real? 
 - Don't touch it.

745
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,090
I want to go home.

746
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,420
Ms. Park!

747
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,490
Don't go. I have a bad feeling.

748
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,560
No, Chi Yeol. I need to check it out.

749
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,180
Stay here, okay?

750
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,890
Ms. Park. Ms. Eun Yeong!

751
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:19,740
Don't go. What if it's a sphere?

752
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,870
Yeong Hun died because of the sphere, too!

753
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,630
- "Yeong Hun died"? 
 - Why?

754
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,180
What is he saying?

755
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,800
Hey, Kwon Il Ha. What is he saying?

756
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,640
- Do you know something? 
 - Il Ha, what is it?

757
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,090
- What is he fucking saying? 
 - I don't fucking know!

758
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,770
Guys, run away!

759
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,900
- Gross! 
 - That's disgusting!

760
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,310
What is that?

761
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,550
Ms. Park...

762
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,590
What the hell is that?

763
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,590
Take cover!

764
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,680
Take cover—

765
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,070
I said, go!

766
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,480
Ow, ow, ow!

767
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,270
Come here!

768
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,360
Fuck, what are those things?

769
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,630
Kim Yu Jeong, what are you doing?

770
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,400
Yu Jeong! Yu Jeong!

771
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,240
Are you okay?

772
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:07,580
Save me. Please save me.

773
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,640
Save me.

774
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,770
Please save me.

775
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,630
- Don't go. 
 - Fuck, what happened to you?

776
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,480
Are you okay?

777
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,310
Well, I...

778
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,460
Platoon Leader...

779
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,460
What about the others?

780
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,140
What about the others?

781
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,920
Guys, get it together!

782
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,550
Run that way! Hurry!

783
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,090
Hey, come on!

784
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,430
Let's go.

785
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,050
Get up!

786
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,680
Ow!

787
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,310
What the hell are those things?

788
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,370
What about the others?

789
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,050
Shit, I don't know.

790
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,050
I don't see them.

791
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,870
What the fuck are those things?

792
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,230
Shut up and run!

793
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,170
Run!

794
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,530
Hurry, hurry!

795
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,790
- What the hell? 
 - Hey, this way!

796
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,810
This way!

797
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,940
What the hell?

798
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,340
Bo Ra!

799
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,820
Yu Ha Na!

800
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,880
Ha Na!

801
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,860
You guys need to gather your wits!

802
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,580
All right?

803
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,200
Hey, Yu Ha Na!

804
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,210
Open the door!

805
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:28,110
Hey, open the door!

806
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,220
Hey, come on!

807
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,090
Hey!

808
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,000
Open it!

809
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:48,030
Please! Please!

810
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:51,850
Oh, my gosh.

811
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,850
Oh, my gosh!

812
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,740
Fuck!

813
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,450
Hey, that way!

814
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,120
What do we do?

815
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,700
Over there.

816
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,630
What's going on?

817
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,350
What about Ms. Park?

818
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,290
What about Ms. Park?

819
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:27,590
The other kids... The other kids...

820
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,710
Darn it. Seriously!

821
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,540
Platoon Leader.

822
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,540
Go up.

823
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,850
- Yu Jeong. 
 - Are you okay?

824
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,750
Hey, are you okay?

825
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,330
Sun Yi was...

826
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,150
Sun Yi.

827
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,520
Platoon... Leader...

828
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,860
What about the rest?

829
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:50,260
Bo Ra!

830
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,400
   

831
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,210
Bo Ra, I'm scared.

832
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,010
I think we're okay.

833
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:59,190


834
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,370
   

835
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,270
 All right, all right! 
   

836
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,950
 - All right, all right. 
 - Please say a word. 

837
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,530
 - You guys don't get hurt. 
 - Okay! 

838
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,730
 - Safety first. 
 - Safety! 

839
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,770
 And what must you do after today? 
   

840
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,550
 Study! 
   

841
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,190
 Ms. Park, studying is out of the question. 
   

842
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,370
- Go away. 
 - Gosh.

843
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,710
 Get to shooting practice. 
   

844
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,020
- That's enough. 
 - Come on, Ms. Park.

845
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,790
 Say a few more words. 
   

846
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,420
 Come on, Ms. Park! 
   

847
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,990
   

848
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,240
♫  It's colorful every night  ♫

849
