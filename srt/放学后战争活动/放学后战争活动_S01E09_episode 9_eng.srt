1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,770
   

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,060
Well done!

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,510
We're leaving!

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,490
We should grab the girls and have a chat with them.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,700
Got it, Hyeongnim.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,250
They can't have gone far. Split up and look for them.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,870
Do you don't think they ran away?

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,750
I don't know what they're plotting,

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,840
but they definitely didn't run away and leave her behind.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,660
They seem to have a special relationship.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,400
I have no idea what kind of kids they are.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,940
I know.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,650
Let's go our separate ways now. I opened the door and there's no issue.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,410
Ajeossi! Seriously!

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,700
Can't you fucking think?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,780
You need to find out what's going on out there first!

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,190
- I'm not interested. 
 - Is that so?

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,600
If so, you should hurry and get going.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,950
It would be heartbreaking if you went to the nursing home and your mother wasn't there.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,970
I just asked the kids outside to take good care of your mother—

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,900
Don't you dare try to touch her. Crazy bastard.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,390
Fuck! That's why I'm saying we should help each other out!

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,330
Seriously, fuck! You're scaring me!

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,850
Why are you staring at me?

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:38,380


27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,250
After I bring the kids to you, we'll have no reason to deal with each other ever again.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,490
All right! Fine.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,270
Hey, we don't need the boys. Just kill them all and only bring the girls.

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,070
- Yes. 
 - Especially... what was her name?

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,790
Bo Ra, Bo Ra, Bo Ra! Make sure she doesn't get hurt at all.

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,780
I'm going to have to tame her.

33
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,990
I was getting excited because I haven't seen one in a while.

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,540
Shit! Gosh...

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,200
Honestly, the four-eyed one is more of my type.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
- Do you like the four-eyed one? 
 - Yes.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,320
Go ahead! You can take her as a hostage.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,720
- She's too well-behaved. It's not fun anymore. 
 - Okay.

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,160
Get up. Get up!

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,270
Hey.

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,040
Get moving.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,790
Did I lose weight because I didn't eat for a day? My pants are falling down.

43
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,160
- We don't all have to go. 
 - I'll eat the four eyed girl

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,370
and eat food too!

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,810
It's nice to come out, but the fine particle pollution is... Geez.

46
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,360
Will you really do it alone?

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,560
Stupid bastard.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,470
Hey, Hairy!

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,890
Hey! Come with me, Hairy!

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,750
Hey...

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,510
 Ready or not, here I come... 

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,050
I can see your hair!

53
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,230
Where are you guys?

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,280
Let's play!

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,840
There you are!

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,800
Shit. Kill the...

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,820
boys!

58
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,790
And for girls...

59
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,820
There you are.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,740
Stop.

61
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,780
   

62
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,840
Hey, shouldn't you finish what we were doing?

63
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,830
Shall we try switching clothes?

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,800
This bitch shows no reaction. What a stupid bitch.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,140
 Guys! 

66
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,940
Where are you going?

67
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,560
I've been in here for years.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,870
I know this place as well as I know the back of my own hand.

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,660
Fuck, there's no one here!

70
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,880
Why aren't they here? Fuck.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,570
Motherfuckers.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,020
♪ Ready or not, here I come ♪

73
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,940
♪ I can see your hair peeking out ♪

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,250
Fuck! You fucking bitches! How dare you?

75
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,330
Come out right now! Fuck!

76
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
What the fuck?

77
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,790
Come here...

78
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,360
Fuck!

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
You fucking bitch!

80
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,440
Come here you bitch! Fuck!

81
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,190
You fucking bitch! Fuck!

82
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,260
Come here! You fucking bitch.

83
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,980
Look at this bitch.

84
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,570
Hey! Don't waste your energy. Come out!

85
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,540
Are you're not going to open it?

86
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,230
You fucking stupid bitch!

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,700
Fucking come out!

88
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,170
Fucking bitch. Come out!

89
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,290
What's this?

90
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,650
What the fuck?

91
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,030
Fuck! Fuck!

92
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,610
Fuck!

93
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,170
Geez!

94
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,700
That bastard screams when he has an orgasm.

95
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,100
Stupid bastards! They couldn't catch a single kid! Fuck!

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,780
Fuck!

97
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,440
It started.

98
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,240
What should we do?

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,490
Will Ae Seol be okay?

100
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,320
Hang in there, No Ae Seol.

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,140
What is it? Is it a sphere?

102
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,340
Where did it come from all of a sudden?

103
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,710
- I know, right? They're getting closer. 
 - What are we going to do?

104
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,840
At that rate, they'll come inside the building in a few minutes.

105
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,260
We have no choice. Let's let them out.

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,820
Hold on.

107
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,750
This might be the way to save Ae Seol.

108
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,150
We'll go to Ae Seol. You should lure the spheres. Be careful.

109
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,980
Is this okay? This puts all of us in danger.

110
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,690
There's nothing else we can do now.

111
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,140
It will work out.

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,720
Ae Seol is stronger than you think.

113
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,070
Let's open the door now.

114
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,470
Hurry, hurry. Will you open it?

115
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,920
- Open it. 
 - Let's hurry!

116
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,290
That's right.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,120
If you turn that,

118
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,740
the door will open.

119
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,900
Did we succeed? We need to put the rest of them inside.

120
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,270
Hey, Bastards!

121
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,870
Here's one!

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,680
I didn't think we would play tag with them!

123
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,690
Just try not to get caught!

124
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,410
Aren't you getting horny?

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
What a fucking joke.

126
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,680
There's no one, you bastard.

127
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,600
I think that four-eyed bitch likes white stuff.

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,280
Just like my white hair.

129
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,030
What? Bastard. I have a gun, too!

130
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,280
What? I'm shooting. Do you really want me to?

131
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,830
Anyway, I think that four-eyed bitch likes white stuff.

132
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,320
Just like my white hair.

133
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,050
Where are you going?

134
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,220
If you act on your own, I won't give you the shorty.

135
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,870
What is this?

136
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,120
- Did they do this? 
 - I think there's something else.

137
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,340
S-Something's strange. This is no good. We need to get out of here.

138
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,490
What the fuck is this...

139
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,440
No!

140
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,150
Fuck!

141
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,490
Help me! My gosh!

142
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,140
Son of a bitch.

143
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,890
Bo Ra! Did you have to move on your own because you couldn't wait a second?

144
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,610
No Ae Seol, that idiot, is all alone.

145
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,310
Sons of bitches.

146
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,960
Let's go.

147
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,580
- We need to get out right now! 
 - Why, why? What happened?

148
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,280
Everyone got killed.

149
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,830
Did those little bastards do that?

150
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,520
It wasn't the kids.

151
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,060
Who else did it then?

152
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,370
I don't know. I think it's some kind of monster.

153
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,420
A monster?

154
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,000
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,130
Son of a bitch! You killed them, didn't you?

156
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,240
I saw it with my own eyes.

157
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,830
We need to get out quickly if we want to survive.

158
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,020
What the fuck are you talking about? Fuck!

159
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,550
Hey, what's that?

160
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,010
Hey!

161
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,830
Hey, what the hell is this?

162
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,360
Hey! Hey, hey!

163
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,520
Hey, hey! Fuck!

164
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,630
Why isn't this thing dying?

165
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,640
Come over here!

166
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,630
What is this thing?

167
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,690
What the fuck is this?

168
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,880
You reap what you sow.

169
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,230
Let's hurry and find Ae Seol so we can get out of here.

170
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,450
No Ae...

171
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,690
Didn't you find her?

172
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,300
Shit! Where is she?

173
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,170
By chance...

174
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,520
-  No Ae Seol!  
 - Shit!

175
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,570
Ae Seol!

176
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,570
 No Ae Seol! 

177
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,390
No Ae Seol!

178
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,670
- Bo Ra. 
 - Are you okay?

179
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,840
No Ae Seol! Ae Seol!

180
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,370
Y-You're okay, right?

181
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,580
Yes, I'm okay.

182
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,930
How about the other guys?

183
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,250
They're okay. Let's leave first.

184
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,970
Let's go.

185
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,010
Get out of here!

186
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,030
Jo Yeong Sin!

187
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,260
There's another one!

188
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,300
I told you, we shouldn't do this! Fuck!

189
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,970
Run!

190
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,450
Seriously!

191
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,580
Hui Rak!

192
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,390
There was another one!

193
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,300
Get down!

194
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,390
I'm screwed! Fuck!

195
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,860
Seriously!

196
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,430
You fucking bitch!

197
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,130
What is it, what is it?

198
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,770
Come here.

199
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,500
Fucking bitch!

200
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,010
It's all ruined because of you!

201
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,630
Fuck! Seriously!

202
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,510
I hated you the moment I saw you. Come here.

203
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,500
I need to put a hole in your head. Come here.

204
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,050
Come here. Give me your head! Come on!

205
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,380
What a joke.

206
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,220
Are you acting nice, you bitch?

207
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,740
You fucking bitch!

208
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,710
Fuck!

209
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,770
You fucking bitch!

210
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,470
You fucking bitch! I'm going to kill you, you bitch!

211
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,730
Yes, shoot them all! Kill all of them! Fucking bitches!

212
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,050
Fuck! Seriously!

213
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,750
Why aren't you firing, you stupid bastard?

214
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,690
Shoot them! Shoot them if you want to see your mom! You stupid bastard.

215
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,410
Shoot! Fuck!

216
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,780
What are you doing? Shit...

217
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,950
I was curious why they showed up all of a sudden.

218
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,190
But I think I know why.

219
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,090
Because we humans are truly trash.

220
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,190
So they came to clean things up.

221
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,250
Are you okay?

222
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,740
Bo Ra, the blood...

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,350
Bo Ra, you're bleeding.

224
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,960
Fucking bastards!

225
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm okay.

226
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,810
   

227
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,820
   

228
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,550
   

229
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,370
   

230
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,940
   

231
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,080
   

232
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,150
   

233
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,070
   

234
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,590
What should we do with...

235
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,750
Su Cheol? Should we bury him?

236
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,180
We should take him with us. We can't leave him here.

237
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,620
Su Cheol!

238
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,740
No!

239
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,050
How did he end up falling?

240
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,780
What was up with the sound of gunfire earlier?

241
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,910
There wasn't a sphere.

242
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,380
First of all, we should return with Su Cheol before it gets darker.

243
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,920
T-Take a look at this.

244
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,140
What is it?

245
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,440
That—

246
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,940
It's a voting paper.

247
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,620
Why is this here...

248
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,290
This is mine.

249
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,940
I wrote this one!

250
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,320
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

251
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,620
This was my vote from yesterday!

252
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,530
This is definitely the one I wrote on.

253
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,860
But what's that doing here?

254
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,410
   

255
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,000
We'll get going now. You should better change your minds quickly, too.

256
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,220
Even the college entrance exam got canceled. There's no reason to stay here like this.

257
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,670
I'll try talking to the guys when they come.

258
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,470
Okay. Take care of yourselves then.

259
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,950
Let's see each other alive again.

260
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,580
- We'll get going. 
 - Take care.

261
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,860
- Be careful— 
 - E-Excuse me!

262
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,720
About the communication device.

263
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,190
You thought someone broke it intentionally.

264
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,100
Are you sure you weren't mistaken. Is there even a 1% chance?

265
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,040
- What are you talking about— 
 - Yes.

266
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,840
I guess we could have been mistaken.

267
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,080
We'll get going now.

268
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,460
- Bye. 
 - What does he mean, mistaken...

269
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,180
- Bye. 
 - Well...

270
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,340
We need to tell them. Are we just leaving like this?

271
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,640
Without even saying anything?

272
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,230
If it makes them feel more comfortable to think

273
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,250
we were mistaken, we should just go with that.

274
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,140
What are you talking about?

275
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,210
Things will get more difficult once people start doubting each other.

276
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's just go.

277
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,800
It makes no sense!

278
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,680
Why would Do Su Cheol manipulate the votes?

279
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,870
Of course, it doesn't make sense. But what is this, anyway?

280
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,310
It means he's been manipulating our votes!

281
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,460
Don't jump to conclusions.

282
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,820
Even after seeing this?

283
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,310
Hey, how does that make any sense?

284
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,860
What happened anyway?

285
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,720
Only Su Cheol knows why he did it.

286
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,030
That means we've been suffering unnecessarily because of Do Su Cheol.

287
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,920
Hey, you crazy bitch. How could you say that in front of his body?

288
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,700
What the fuck is this then?

289
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,740
That's enough! I can't think because you're so loud!

290
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,700
Wasn't Su Cheol kind of strange lately?

291
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,880
He didn't talk much either.

292
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,450
By chance, could he have killed himself because he was tormented?

293
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,440
Someone committed suicide because of depression at the camp too.

294
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,270
No, it was definitely not suicide.

295
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,540
 I told her to take her time responding. 

296
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,750
 But I won't give up even if she rejects me.&lt;+o&gt; 

297
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,380
 I'll pursue her until she accepts me. 

298
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,820
There's no way he would have killed himself.

299
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,040
Why did he die then?

300
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,390
 Do you want to just confess everything now? 

301
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,670
 Do you think they would be understanding? 

302
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,880
 Hey, is anyone there? 

303
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,410
 Why? 

304
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,550
I definitely...

305
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,580
 By chance... 

306
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,940
 No, there's no way. 

307
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,680
No way!

308
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,850
Just think about it. How could anyone break it intentionally?

309
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,120
What if it's true?

310
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,410
If that were true, who could have done that?

311
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm going crazy. Geez!

312
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,580
- I think they're here! 
 - Hey.

313
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,960
Let's just keep this between us for now.

314
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,480
- Why? 
 - Hey!

315
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,780
What if we bring it up in front of everyone and create unnecessary division?

316
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,440
Let's just talk to Yu Jeong about it later, okay?

317
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,790
Yes.

318
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,660
We don't even know what happened to the communication device yet, right?

319
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,310
Fine!

320
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,920
Geez.

321
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,370
 But is Bo Ra injured badly? 

322
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,280
I thought we were done for.

323
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,880
Now there are also criminals. As if the spheres weren't enough!

324
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,500
Hey, we could easily end up like them.

325
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,180
Don't even say that!

326
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,930
Gosh! Yeon Bo Ra, are you okay?

327
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,050
What?

328
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,800
You're so noisy. Stop creating a fuss.

329
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,250
Yeon Ju isn't here. What should we do?

330
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,720
Let me get the first aid kit! First aid kit!

331
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,210
Bo Ra, let's go over there.

332
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,420
I said I can manage it myself!

333
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,370
Bo Ra, just let them treat you.

334
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,970
Let go. I can walk myself.

335
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,180
- Tae Man! 
 - Gosh, whatever!

336
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,840
Did something happen?

337
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,350
How did Bo Ra get injured? Were there a lot of spheres?

338
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,700
It wasn't a sphere.

339
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,420
What? If it wasn't a sphere...

340
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,410
By the way, what were you doing inside instead of guarding?

341
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,700
- What? 
 - Well...

342
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,410
The thing is, something happened.

343
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,350
Right! Did you get the part for the communication device by any chance?

344
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,780
No, we couldn't find it.

345
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,660
You said you could find it! You were so confident about it!

346
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,770
Why are you nagging?

347
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,140
- Hey! Is it our fault that it wasn't there? We almost died there! 
 - Shit!

348
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,700
Seriously...

349
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,110
What's wrong, Guys? What happened anyway?

350
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,460
Forget it. I'm so tired right now.

351
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,060
I don't even have the energy to talk.

352
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,620
We were supposed to keep it just between us.

353
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,380
Fine.

354
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,420
I'll apply the ointment now.

355
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,990
Thank you. And I'm sorry for going off on my own.

356
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,250
It was just my body responding.

357
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,660
So don't try to get close to me because of it.

358
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,950
I couldn't just leave that ajeossi behind.

359
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:56,180
My parents left me with my grandma because they didn't want me after the divorce.

360
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,450
Who said I'm interested to hear about stuff like that?

361
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,700
I'm just making an excuse because I feel so bad.

362
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,940
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

363
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,540
Didn't I hurt my ear?

364
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,850
I'm sorry, let me redo it!

365
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,390
It's okay. I'll ask Yeon Ju to do it later.

366
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,830
Also you...

367
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,560
Never mind.

368
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,050
What's with that face?

369
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,020
- Are you okay? 
 - Do you think I'm okay? I got shot.

370
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,710
Bo Ra, the reason why Ae Seol did that at the prison is—

371
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,190
You don't have to explain it. I already know.

372
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,130
Well, Bo Ra...

373
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
You really scared me earlier.

374
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,280
It's okay. I didn't die. What are you, my boyfriend?

375
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,420
Why would you get scared, anyway?

376
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,380
Why? Do you wish I were your boyfriend?

377
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,160
What are you saying?

378
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,140
The guys are here. Let's hurry.

379
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,480
Well done. Yes.

380
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,380
You came!

381
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,890
- Sun Yi! 
 - Thank you for the hard work.

382
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,820
Sun Yi. Yeon Ju.

383
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeon Ju, what's wrong?

384
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,820
- Yeon Ju. 
 - What is it? What is it?

385
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,050
What's wrong with them?

386
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,450
What?

387
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,530
What is this?

388
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,160
What's this?

389
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,340
Hey, what is this about?

390
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,110
Wh-Where's Su Cheol?

391
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,690
H-Hey, answer us!

392
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,970
Why won't you say anything? You're making me nervous!

393
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,140
Kwon Il Ha. Why won't you say anything?

394
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,780
Chi Yeol.

395
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,240
What happened?

396
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,130
Say something!

397
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,990
Su Cheol...

398
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,220
Su Cheol...

399
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,240
Su Cheol... My gosh...

400
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,800
Su Cheol...

401
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,850
Su Cheol...

402
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,230
Su Cheol...

403
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,070
What is this?

404
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,040
It's a voting paper Su Cheol had.

405
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,200
They are three "no" votes.

406
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,150
Please tell us why

407
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,840
Su Cheol had these.

408
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,260
Wh-What is this?

409
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,640
Why are the "no" votes here?

410
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,260
This is definitely the "no" vote I wrote yesterday.

411
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,330
The fact that he was hiding these means

412
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,200
he fooled us and made it look like there were more "yes" votes.

413
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,080
Who fooled us? Do you mean Su Cheol did that?

414
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,130
What are you talking about?

415
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,410
I asked Su Cheol to destroy the old votes. I think that's why he had them.

416
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,630
Why did he only have "no" votes? He even had three of them.

417
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,390
Isn't this evidence that the voting was corrupted?

418
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,030
Don't jump to conclusions. Su Cheol had no reason to do that.

419
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,810
What is all this nonsense?

420
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,790
Hey, talk clearly!

421
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,120
Hold on, Guys.

422
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,250
Why are we speculating? This would only cause misunderstanding.

423
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,830
Then we can find the truth right now.

424
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,770
If it wasn't manipulated, the result would be the same as it was yesterday.

425
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,250
Who are the ones who voted "no"? Raise your hands.

426
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,070
Hey, we shouldn't just do this carelessly—

427
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,670
Why won't you let us?

428
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,700
Wang Tae Man. You're acting suspicious.

429
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,100
What?

430
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,160
All you were doing was getting excited earlier. Just shut the fuck up for a second!

431
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,700
- Fuck? 
 - Yes, fuck!

432
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,660
- Hey! 
 - What? 
 - Do you think I don't know how to swear?

433
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,980
Go ahead then! Hey!

434
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,440
Stop! Stop!

435
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,110
Seriously...

436
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,030
Don't get worked up. Let's sort things out.

437
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,920
Su Cheol...

438
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,110
Why did he die, anyway?

439
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,850
Second Squad, don't you really know anything?

440
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,240
Say something!

441
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,240
I heard...

442
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,380
Su Cheol arguing with someone before he died.

443
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,900
- What? 
 - What?

444
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,960
If...

445
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,840
- he didn't die from an accident— 
 - Hey, Kim Chi Yeol. What are you talking about suddenly?

446
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,460
Who did he argue with?

447
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,780
Are you sure? Why are you mentioning this now? You didn't say anything earlier!

448
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,870
I couldn't think of it because I was so shocked earlier.

449
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,550
That's why I didn't mention it.

450
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,080
I don't know what going on...

451
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,930
First of all, we need to find out who he was arguing with at the hospital.

452
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,020
Let's all talk about

453
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,190
what everyone was

454
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,170
doing and where.

455
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,010
What? Are you doubting us right now?

456
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,160
Hey, are you crazy? What do you mean, what we were doing?

457
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,090
Where were you then? How are we supposed to trust you?

458
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,150
I'm not suggesting doubting each other. We should at least find out how Su Cheol died!

459
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:45,560
So... So to put it simply,

460
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,420
one of you must have...

461
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,140
- killed Su Cheol! 
 - What?

462
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,690
Hey, Yu Ha Na. Watch your mouth. Don't just run your mouth.

463
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,520
If Su Cheol didn't fall by accident,

464
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,190
it means someone killed him!

465
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,400
Stop talking nonsense!

466
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,210
Stop! My head is about to explode!

467
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,200
Let's check what we can first.

468
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,390
We found evidence that the voting was manipulated.

469
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,310
Let's look into that first.

470
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,930
Hey, Kim Yu Jeong. Say something.

471
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,920
You must know.

472
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,760
Why won't you speak? Say something!

473
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,710
Don't push her too much!

474
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,340
Jo Jang Su, you did it with her. Aren't you on her side, too?

475
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,410
Hey, are we creating division now?

476
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,570
Wang Tae Man, why are you defending him?

477
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,020
- Aren't you an accomplice, too? 
 - Accomplice?

478
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,680
Hey, enough is enough. Do you think you can just say whatever the fuck you want?

479
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Guys, let's calm down—

480
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,370
Yes, everyone is too upset right now.

481
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,510
How could we not get upset?

482
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,550
We almost died today!

483
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,820
Why don't you explain then?

484
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,110
Say something! Hey!

485
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,820
- That's enough, you bastard! 
 - Fuck! Let go!

486
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,110
Wang Tae Man, you're being suspiciously sensitive.

487
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,310
You really are a fucking accomplice, aren't you?

488
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,770
You son of a bitch.

489
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,510
Let go.

490
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,250
What are you doing, you son of a bitch?

491
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,760
Hey!

492
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,070
You son of a bitch!

493
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,270
You fucking bastard!

494
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,940
That's enough!

495
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,670
You son of a bitch!

496
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,680
Kwon Il Ha.

497
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,380
It was me.

498
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Su Cheol and I...

499
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,900
have been manipulating the votes.

500
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:03,390
What are you talking about? Is it true?

501
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,040
Both Su Cheol and I...

502
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,900
were scared at first, too, and wanted to avoid it.

503
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,940
But the more scared I was, the angrier I felt.

504
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,080
I wanted to kill all the spheres!

505
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,840
You feel that way, too!

506
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,560
What? You fooled us because you wanted to catch the spheres?

507
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,310
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

508
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,080
I can see why you're angry, but—

509
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,460
Hey, Kwon Il Ha. Are you crazy?

510
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,690
Hey, how could you two...

511
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,190
It's not something you and Su Cheol could manipulate alone.

512
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,100
It's...

513
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,930
It's all my fault. I suggested doing that.

514
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,190
Crazy bastard!

515
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,930
Answer me. Answer me, you son of a bitch!

516
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,880
Who was it? Who was it, you fucking bastard!

517
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,190
Please answer me! Please!

518
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,420
Guys! I'm sorry.

519
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,740
Kim Yu Jeong...

520
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,990
Jo Jang Su, you...

521
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,320
What is it?

522
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,390
Why did you guys...

523
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,530
Were you all in on this together?

524
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,270
Kim Yu Jeong. Jo Jang Su. I didn't think you would do this!

525
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,950
Is this why you wanted to vote?

526
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,910
No, there's no way! Right?

527
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,100
Tell us, Yu Jeong! Tell us!

528
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,070
Why can't you talk? Tell us why you fooled us! Right now!

529
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,110
Tell us!

530
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,270
I couldn't put all of us in danger!

531
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,920
What are you talking about?

532
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,910
Did you guys really fool us?

533
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,160
No way!

534
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,930
No.

535
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,760
Why would you?

536
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
That's...

537
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,810
That's because...

538
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,220
Because the college entrance exam got canceled.

539
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,200
What?

540
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,380
Kim Deok Jung.

541
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,100
Well...

542
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,270
Kim Deok Jung.

543
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,730
What are you talking about? Why did the college entrance exam get canceled?

544
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,190
It's true. It got canceled.

545
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,910
I guess the other units got the radio message.

546
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,580
Don't lie! You're lying, aren't you?

547
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,550
It's true.

548
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,580
Fuck! I knew it!

549
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,820
Fuck, seriously...

550
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,220
No.

551
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,030
You're lying, right?

552
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,400
There's no way the college entrance exam would get canceled!

553
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,520
Yeong Su, calm down.

554
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,230
Come on and tell me it's not true!

555
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,620
Guk Yeong Su! The college entrance exam

556
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,820
was already over when the spheres fell.

557
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,630
- Does that matter right now? 
 - Fuck! It matters more than my life right now!

558
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,270
Do you know why I've been living like this

559
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,950
for all my life?

560
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,030
Hey, stop lying!

561
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,640
Stop lying!

562
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,730
Deok Jung. Deok Jung, please!

563
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:07,050
Tell me it's not true, please! Deok Jung.

564
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,240
Deok Jung, please! Deok Jung...

565
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,710
Deok Jung! Deok Jung, please...

566
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,930
Is it true the college entrance exam got canceled?

567
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,650
We don't even get radio signals. Where did you hear that from?

568
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,400
   

569
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,030
The students from the science and technology high school stopped by today.

570
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,590
They said they were on the way to Seoul after getting the

571
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,350
message that the exam is canceled this year.

572
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,310
I said we didn't hear about it because our communications device is broken and...

573
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,320
And?

574
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,630
They opened it to fix it for us.

575
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,510
And they said someone broke it intentionally.

576
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,630
What are you talking about? Is that true?

577
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,930
Someone took out what was attached to the circuit board intentionally.

578
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,820
What?

579
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,040
Geez, fuck!

580
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,420
Why would they?

581
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,180
Who did that?

582
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,310
Hey. Hey!

583
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,800
Did you guys do this too?

584
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,560
Try explaining it!

585
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,830
Did you break the comms to hide the fact that the exam got canceled?

586
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,780
Did you manipulate the votes too?

587
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,830
This is fucking unbelievable. It just won't end.

588
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,190
Anything else? Tell us if there was anything else.

589
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,670
Tell us, for fuck's sake!

590
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,230
We worked so hard trying to fix the comms.

591
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,890
You saw all that. Why? Why would you?

592
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,540
Did you do it because you wanted us to die together?

593
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,840
Tell us right now! Why?

594
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,420
The exam wasn't canceled.

595
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,140
No.

596
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,760
When I heard about the comms, I couldn't believe it.

597
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,940
I didn't want to believe it even if it were true.

598
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,470
Why did you fool us?

599
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,080
Did it matter more to kill another sphere

600
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,480
even if it would cost our lives?

601
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,180
Are you out of your minds? Are you insane?

602
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,020
Explain this situation right now.

603
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,900
What's all of this nonsense about?

604
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,440
The day we got the message about the exam,

605
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,750
Su Cheol and I...

606
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,300
were on guard duty. And...

607
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,960
- What did you say? 
  - I told you! 

608
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,220
 The college entrance exam is canceled this year. 

609
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,960
 The bonus points you got so far will be applied to the next year's exam. 

610
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,490
 So make sure to continue on with the mission without anyone leaving. Over. 

611
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,980
 H-H-Hold on! Hello? 

612
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,110
 Hello? Wild Goose, this is Seagull! 

613
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,590
 Wild Goose! Wild Goose! Come on! 

614
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,890
 What kind of fucking nonsense is this? 

615
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,930
 The exam got canceled, but they want us to continue with the mission? 

616
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,300
 Countless kids have been killed all this time. 

617
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,350
 Now the exam is canceled? 

618
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,950
 They held onto us using the bonus credits. These fuckers do whatever they please! 

619
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,570
 They think we're a joke, don't they? 

620
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,180
 Huh? Fuck. 

621
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,570
 Fuck! 

622
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,610
 Where are you going? 

623
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:16,090
 What do you mean, where? We need to let everyone know. 

624
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,740
 Hold on. 

625
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,300
 Let's do this. 

626
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,520
 Can we really do this? 

627
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,290
 If they found out, they would insist on going to Seoul right now. 

628
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,170
 Going to Seoul right now makes no sense. 

629
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,990
 - Still... 
 - Tell me. 

630
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,810
 Were you out here because of the exam, Il Ha? 

631
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,810
 No. You didn't give a fuck about the bonus points. 

632
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,160
 Then why did you stay back? 

633
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,830
 We won't listen to the adults this time. 

634
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,300
 It's our decision. 

635
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,440
 I need to end this war now. 

636
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,010
 I want to kill all the spheres 

637
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,110
 and go back to school. 

638
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,360
 That's why we broke the comms device. 

639
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,320
 We wanted to keep this a secret between us, but... 

640
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,640
 There's only one vote against it. 

641
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,690
 At this rate, more people would end up insisting on going to Seoul. 

642
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,500
 That's what we promised to do from the beginning. 

643
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,250
 It would be dangerous to leave like this. You know that, too. 

644
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,230
 We don't even get the radio signals anymore. 

645
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,460
 What's the point of continuing with the mission? 

646
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,860
 No. 

647
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,210
 We need to follow the protocol before we get the signal back. 

648
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,750
 The number of spheres will grow if we go to Seoul. 

649
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,920
 It's better to stay here, since we're used to it. 

650
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,920
 We have some food left and everyone mostly adjusted too. 

651
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:27,010
 If we end up failing to join the rest by getting out of the mission zone, 

652
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,480
 we'll be in serious trouble. 

653
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,130
 It's true, but... 

654
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,820
 Why don't we... 

655
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,510
 create "yes" votes in advance for the next voting. 

656
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,110
 Do you want to manipulate the votes? 

657
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,260
 Only until we get the comms fixed. 

658
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,850
 We can't just leave when we don't even know the safe areas. 

659
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,770
 All of us would be put in danger then. 

660
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,360
 I no longer want to see 

661
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,540
 any of us dying. 

662
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,510
 Okay. 

663
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,680
 Only until we fix the comms. 

664
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,470
 Just until then. 

665
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,680
 What are you doing awake at this hour? 

666
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,400
 I agree with manipulating votes. 

667
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,250
 But it would be difficult just for the two of you. We'll help you. 

668
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,050
 Well, Guys... 

669
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,020
 The comms device... 

670
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,840
 I broke it. 

671
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,230
 What? What are you talking about? 

672
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,950
 Are you crazy? 

673
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,710
 Hold on. 

674
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,780
 We need to be able to be reached so they can find us! 

675
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,750
 - They won't come. 
 - How do you know that? 

676
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,040
 - The college entrance exam got canceled.  
 - What? 

677
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,110
 We were told to continue with the mission even though the exam was canceled. 

678
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,030
 You know what I'm trying to say, right? 

679
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,310
 The adults just think of us as tools. 

680
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,110
 They're not interested in helping us. 

681
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,810
 Not at all. 

682
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,460
 I don't care if we're tools or not. 

683
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,680
 I won't go to Seoul. If we went right now, 

684
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,960
 I would feel too guilty toward the ones who died. 

685
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,160
 I thought it was ridiculous at first, too. 

686
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,040
But just think about it.

687
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,670
This place is still safer. It's too dangerous to go to Seoul!

688
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,750
So do you think it's safe to stay here forever?

689
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,210
There are fewer spheres here

690
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,860
- and we have some food left too! 
 - Stop lying!

691
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,520
Hey.

692
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,770
What are you trying to do?

693
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,590
What's the reason you want us to stay here?

694
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,610
I mean,

695
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,710
you could have just been honest with us from the beginning!

696
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,960
I was worried you would get agitated if you found out

697
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,600
the exam was canceled.

698
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,310
The exam?

699
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,970
Who cares if it got canceled?

700
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,590
Why does that matter at this point?

701
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,770
Do you think we lived like this just because of the exam?

702
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,680
Why didn't you even ask our opinions?

703
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,830
Why would you do that?

704
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,920
Who do you think you are?

705
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,130
I'm sorry.

706
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,070
Fuck.

707
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,730
I can't trust you guys anymore.

708
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,730
Su Cheol tried to reveal the truth.

709
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:03,950
You killed him because of that, didn't you?

710
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,430
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yes, we're crazy!

711
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,430
We're going crazy because of you guys!

712
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,200
You saw everything today.

713
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,610
That people are scarier than the spheres.

714
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,320
You guys...

715
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,380
are just like those criminals.

716
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,940
I really...

717
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,340
thought about it hundreds and thousands of times.

718
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,320
In order to keep all of us together...

719
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:46,860
the platoon leader told us to protect each other!

720
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,410
That way, we can survive until the end!

721
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,780
But I thought you guys would go your separate ways

722
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,140
if you heard the exam was canceled.

723
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,450
I guess that's why I used the exam as an excuse to hold onto you.

724
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,230
I'm sorry.

725
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,330
I thought we need to stay together even if it comes to this.

726
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,000
Guys.

727
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,860
We...

728
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,290
We need to stay alive!

729
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm sorry.

730
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,890
We didn't intend to deceive you from the beginning.

731
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,350
You should have...

732
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,940
You should have told us that from the beginning.

733
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,490
You should have...

734
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,470
discussed it with all of us.

735
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,780
But it's too late now.

736
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,270
What...

737
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,160
should we do now?

738
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,290
We should go to the shelter where our parents are.

739
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,120
How would you know where they are?

740
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,530
We should look into it.

741
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,530
Do you think...

742
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,110
Su Cheol's death was really an accident?

743
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,170
What could have happened?

744
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,210
I don't know.

745
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,530
Only Su Cheol would know.

746
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,920
But why...

747
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,720
Who was it?

748
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,150
There's no evidence at all.

749
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,440
If you suspect someone,

750
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,570
you might end up regretting it.

751
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,500
Why did the adults...

752
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,220
give us guns?

753
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,350
They should have prevented us from ever picking up a gun.

754
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,730
Shit...

755
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,880
 From when we first grabbed guns... 

756
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,530
 How much do you think we 

757
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,240
 changed since then? 

758
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,880
 All we did was survive day by day. 

759
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,920
 But we ended up on the edge of nineteen somehow. 

760
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,470
 What could be awaiting us at the end of this path? 

761
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,210
 If we return home safely, 

762
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,550
 can we go back to the time before we grabbed guns? 

763
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,130
 That day, 

764
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,790
 we shouldn't have left the service area. 

765
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,050
   

766
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,690
Aren't you tired?

767
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,160
Of course, I am. But we didn't come here to have fun.

768
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,540
It's our duty to kill the spheres. We can't return until we finish.

769
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,460
I know, but since the platoon leader died,

770
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,390
everyone is so exhausted.

771
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,160
We just need to follow the training.

772
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,650
 Also, I'm sure all the high school seniors in 
   

773
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,750
 the country collected similar amounts of bonus points. 
   

774
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,860
 If so, what would be the point of having them? 
   

775
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,350
We should get way ahead of them by finishing the mission.

776
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,700
Don't think of the bonus points lightly.

777
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,590
I'm sure it will make a difference later.

778
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,600
Won't you go to college by taking the entrance exam after this?

779
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,970
Well... I guess.

780
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,310
By the way,

781
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:41,220
Yeong Su, why are you so obsessed with going to college?

782
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,140
Well...

783
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,730
You know how people say, "I want"

784
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,630
"my family to always stay the same."

785
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,740
But I want the opposite to happen.

786
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,110
What do you mean by that?

787
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:03,740
My mom and dad work from dawn until night.

788
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:08,110
When they come home, they go to bed without having a conversation or anything.

789
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,670
And at dawn,

790
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:16,170
I study wearing earplugs because of the pained noises they make.

791
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,160
War is horrific,

792
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,120
but do you know what's even worse?

793
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,820
Poverty.

794
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,300
You guys don't know what it means to be really poor.

795
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,990
Well...

796
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,750
Unless...

797
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,950
we suddenly win first place in the lottery,

798
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,640
my family can never escape poverty.

799
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,380
For my younger siblings to go to college

800
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:58,230
and talk about everyday life and do mundane things

801
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,300
that everyone takes for granted,

802
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,500
I need to go to a good college

803
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,620
and get a good job.

804
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:25,260
Could you delete this footage?

805
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,500
I think I said too many unnecessary things.

806
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,940
Let's do the interview again some other time.

807
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:52,340


808
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,230
   

809
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:04,810
♫  I thought everybody wanna live peaceful. So I fought for equal rights and inner peace  ♫

810

♫  The book of fairy tale is closed, only thing in front of me is the reality, wake up, uh!  ♫

819
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:40,080
♫  I thought it was only in the movies, but in quiet moments  ♫

820
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,800
♫ Hell already exists in the comments section ♫

821
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,170
♫ The world is yours but war's going on outside ♫

822
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:49,470
♫  No man is safe from. It's either death or survival  ♫

823
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:53,260
♫  It's time to put that little boy inside you to rest and awaken beast mode  ♫

824
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,630
♫  If you don't take it away, it will be taken away from you   ♫

825
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,140
♫  Get a hold of yourself  ♫

826
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,400
♫  If you let go, you lose not only yourself but also your friends  ♫

827
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,010
♫  A crisis is a crisis because it comes suddenly. Wake up and get yourself together   ♫

828
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:08,450
♫  Miracles do not exist in reality. Gather strength and get selfish. It ain't joke   ♫

829
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:13,160
♫ It's a war. Gotta open your eyes yay-yea  ♫

830
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,440
♫  Nowhere to hide yay-yea  ♫

831
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,620
♫  Nothing is right, ain't it  ♫

832
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:23,950
♫  The war's on outside, every day  ♫

833
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,010
♫  Get your ass, get your ass, get your ass   ♫

834
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,270
♫  Get your ass up. In a game of taking or getting taken, the winner tells the history   ♫

835
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,690
♫  A crisis is an opportunity for learning. Pull it all, we never asked. That's Seoul's Code of Conduct. ♫

836
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,290
♫  Masquerade ball. I know that not everyone who is laughing is actually happy, okay ♫

837
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,480
♫  As tension sets in, my brain becomes addicted to that feeling  ♫

838
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,510
♫  I'm a slave for that, no cancelled. The timer has started, and the bowstring is pulled back ♫

839
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:49,180
♫  I keep pulling twice as fast. If I can't stop anyway, I'll pull even more. I'ma go get the bag ♫

840
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,710
♫  Before everyone runs out of breath, they think the stages are easy to see ♫

841
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:56,640
♫  I wake up from sleep hundreds of times and say it. I've put everything on the line. You better have something to pay 

842
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,390
♫  You'll be an adult, too, at a blink of an eye  ♫

843
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,860
♫  Friends will leave, and it will repeat again  ♫

844
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,860
♫ Without time to be sad ♫

845
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,900
♫  Today's sun is blinding  ♫

846
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,420
♫  You forget your purpose and move like you're drifting in a tide  ♫
