1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,980
   

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:17,000


3
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,490
What should we do?

4
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,540
Oh!

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,510
Guys, can't we just stay in the truck?

6
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,490
Hurry!

7
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,330
Hurry, Guys.

8
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,150
What's that? Isn't it car No.1?

9
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,880
Yu Jeong, you move with me. The rest of you, search the area.

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,820
Get in position.

11
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,640
What's going on? Weren't they all eaten up by the spheres?

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,860
Hey, don't jinx us!

13
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,460
It's because I'm scared.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,890
What about the others?

15
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,020
What the fuck is going on?

16
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,210
Oh?

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,840
What?

18
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,510
Platoon Leader!

19
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,310
Over here.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,340
I think they all managed to get away.

21
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,000
They must not have gone far.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,650
Deok Jung and Il Ha. Go down the road and be on guard.

23
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,910
Bo Ra and Na Ra, please guard the right.

24
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,180
Ae Seol, Ha Na and Yu Jeong.

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,260
You're with me.

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,240
- Go back to your positions. 
 - Yes, Sir.

27
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm so scared. Oh, gosh. I'm scared.

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,030
What's that?

29
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,100
What do you mean, you punk?

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,980
That fluttering thing over there.

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,330
Oh, fuck. Damn!

32
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,150
Platoon Leader! Spheres are here! Spheres!

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,540
Everyone, ready to fire!

34
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,080
What do we do?

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,890
What...

36
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
Fire!

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,490
You motherfuckers!

38
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,150
Oh, right!

39
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,600
You motherfucker!

40
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,590
- Get in the car now! Hurry! 
 - Damn it!

41
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,710
Jun Hui, can you reach it?

42
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,640
Fuckers!

43
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,570
Shit.

44
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,280
Jun Hui, can you reach it?

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Hui Rak, hop on now!

46
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,570
A little more. Hey, can't you get it?

47
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,020
- Hey, hey, hurry up! 
 - Get on now!

48
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,110
Hey!

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,710
Hey, everyone is on.

50
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,170
Okay, let's go!

51
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,360
I'll start the car!

52
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Hold on tight!

53
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,010
Jang Su...

54
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,030
What are we going to do?

55
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,830
What about Hui Rak?

56
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,730
Damn it!

57
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,970
Damn it!

58
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,120
Oh, fuck!

59
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,120
You motherfucker!

60
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,030
Fucking Idiot. He pretended to be strong.

61
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,590
I remembered how weak this fucker was against the cold.

62
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,220
I don't know. I wasn't sure but...

63
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,520
Are you laughing?

64
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,980
Hey.

65
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Oh, Fucking Idiot.

66
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,170
Did you think I was going to hold your hand?

67
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,600
Let's go!

68
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,620
What a fucking asshole. I'm the one who saved you. Why are you acting cool? What a bastard...

69
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,240
Hey!

70
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,330
By the way, why did you do that earlier?

71
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,810
What?

72
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,340
Just cut the act, Asshole.

73
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,800
I have no idea.

74
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,290
Anyway, we really don't vibe.

75
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,430
I thought I'd never see you again!

76
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,800
Do you want some water?

77
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
♫  Welcome to the K-Mars, it's colorful every night  ♫

78
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
♫  Those demons are always  ♫

79
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,800
Hey, I really thought something happened to you.

80
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,220
You don't even know the half of it. We barely managed to survive.

81
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,750
Hey, we didn't have it easy, either.

82
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,580
- Right, Kim Deok Jung? 
 - It was legendary.

83
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,490
Hey, hey. It's not enough to talk about our story for two nights and three days.

84
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,200
Jo Jang Su.

85
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,670
Am I wrong?

86
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,260
Three nights and four days.

87
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,680
- What's with him? 
 - What's wrong with him? All of a sudden?

88
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,210
 That's lame. 

89
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,730
Jo Jang Su is so fricking boring.

90
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,610
 Hey, we missed you. 

91
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,520
- Why, why? 
 - Please go wash.

92
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,540
I took a shower... four days ago.

93
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,550
Why?

94
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,450
If there was water...

95
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,630
- It's because of the water. 
 - You got to manage to survive.

96
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,020
What?

97
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,830
What's wrong with you?

98
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,300
You, too.

99
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,820
What is with you?

100
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,970
What's this? Isn't this Tae Man's?

101
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,650
I got hurt.

102
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,830
Not really! She's just exaggerating.

103
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,440
- Right! 
  - Don't get hurt. 

104
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,560
How is your injury?

105
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,750
I'm okay.

106
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,860
Let's go get some treatment right away.

107
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,210
What about you? Are you okay?

108
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,020
Do you have any injuries?

109
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,290
No, I'm fine...

110
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,890
That's a relief. I was so worried.

111
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,300
What?

112
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,350
I'm so glad that...

113
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,530
everyone's okay.

114
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,220
Ah, yes.

115
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,730
I know, right?

116
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,600
Thank you so much...

117
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,530
for coming.

118
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,550
♫  I broke down at the unfamiliar sight of the bleeding  ♫

119

- Hyeong! 
 - Hey!

123
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,380
- Guys! 
 - Hyeong!

124
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,880
  Hyeong! Hyeong!  

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,090
 Hey, is everyone okay? 

126
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,450
 Didn't you get hurt? 

127
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,660
 - I didn't. 
 - Are you okay? 

128
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,040
 Hyeong, you look much older than before. 

129
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,960
I got older while waiting for you guys.

130
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,190
- Are you all right, everyone? 
 - Yes.

131
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,840
Oh! Guk Yeong Su?

132
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,220
- You're back. 
 - Hey!

133
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,510
Then were you hoping we wouldn't come back?

134
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,530
What a selfish punk.

135
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,230
This punk would have clapped if we hadn't made it.

136
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,460
He'd rather have thought that there were fewer competitors left.

137
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,270
Stop it.

138
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,370
Yeong Su!

139
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,160
Did you clean up everything alone for the other kids?

140
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,220
Thank you for your hard work.

141
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,120
Yeong Su was...

142
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,100
worried about you, too. So please don't resent him.

143
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,400
Attention!

144
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Good job coming back alive!

145
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,510
This is the male barracks and that is the female barracks. Go back to your positions!

146
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,600
Are we going to rest here?

147
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,430
Even though we barely survived?

148
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,360
You can't help it, even though it's uncomfortable.

149
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,790
Placement is... on a first-come, first-served basis.

150
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,650
Go back to your positions!

151
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,930
  What did he say? 

152
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,030
Damn, that sly punk!

153
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,580
 Hurry! 

154
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,100
Thank you.

155
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,110
Daebak. It's so comfy.

156
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,970
  I really wanted to take a shower. We have everything here.  

157
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,500
Loyalty!

158
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,570
Loyalty!

159
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,020
You did a good job.

160
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,960
Go to the headquarters.

161
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,850
Hey, look at this!

162
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,640
Hey!

163
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,270
Why?

164
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,800
- Stop it! 
 - Give it here!

165
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,810
Hey, I said I don't like that.

166
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,450
- Hey, get him! Get him! 
 - What, you punk?

167
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,080
Come here!

168
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,630
I said stop!

169
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,960
Hey, throw it! Throw it!

170
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,810
 You deserve a wartime death penalty! 

171
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,010
Leaving without permission, using unauthorized equipment, and disobeying orders.

172
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,230
Is it not enough?

173
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,310
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,910
Sorry?

175
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,410
Is that the face of a person who is actually apologetic?

176
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,220
- I'll just...! 
 - Lieutenant Colonel!

177
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,140
Next time, you'll be just shot to death.

178
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,900
Anyway, you managed to bring the kids safely.

179
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,690
At least we have something to report in front of the superiors and parents.

180
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,080
Thank you.

181
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,570
You crazy punk.

182
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,780
Get out.

183
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,670
  That stupid punk. I can't even send him to a military prison. 

184
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,630
 Shall we send him to a military prison? 

185
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,830
 What are you talking about, you punk? 

186
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,570
 Just try doing half as much as him! 

187
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,560
   

188
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,500
   

189
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,720
   

190
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,360
   

191
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,570
   

192
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,060
   

193
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,030
He looks like a real ajeossi!

194
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,140
And you guys are ajummas.

195
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,700
 Take a video of this. 

196
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
 Hey, stop filming, you punk! 

197
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,270
 At least you recognize good looks. 

198
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,930
 This is better than I thought. 

199
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,410
 Sun, how do I look? 

200
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,760
  He said this is the biggest size.  

201
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,100
 Stop filming, Fucking Asshole! 

202
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,590
  You guys look good.  

203
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,270
 I love it, love it. 

204
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,610
They look pretty.

205
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,740
I'm jealous.

206
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,130
 They say we're no longer trainees. 
   

207
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,040
 We're recruits now. 
   

208
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,300
 But it feels weird... 
   

209
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,830
 now that I'm wearing a military uniform. 
   

210
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,570
 The memorial service is done now. 
   

211
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,360
 A lot of people couldn't come back. 
   

212
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,710
 Wu Taek and In Hye... 
   

213
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,260
 I still can't believe that 
   

214
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,060
 they are not here with us anymore. 
   

215
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,270
 We should shave this part well so that 

216
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,180
 your face shape looks different. 

217
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,200
It's torn here.

218
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,860
Let me show you.

219
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,340
Look at this. What should I do?

220
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,560
- What are you doing?

221
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

222
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
You pervert punk!

223
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,560
Why, why, why?

224
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,780
 Why, why? Is something wrong with my face? 

225
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,570
 I'm sorry! 
   

226
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,280
- Ugh, my period just started! 
 - The thin one, the thin one.

227
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,870
 How's your feeling, So Yeon? Are you okay? 
   

228
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,740
 Yes, I'm completely healed. 
   

229
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,340
 You all almost died because of me at that time. 
   

230
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,920
 I also almost died because I was so sorry. 
   

231
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,820
 But what if the scar doesn't disappear? 
   

232
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,940
 Wow! You're so cool! 

233
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,170
 Don't mention it! 

234
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,400
 - Isn't it heavy, Su Cheol? 
 - No, it's not. 

235
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,260
Su Cheol, you must be so strong.

236
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,640
This is nothing.

237
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,570
 Fighting, Yeong Su! 

238
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,570
 Fighting! 

239
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,440
 Oh! Yeong Su! 

240
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,460
 You should do some work, too. 

241
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,900
 Hey, how long have we been here? 
   

242
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,670
 I don't know, you punk. Hurry up! 
   

243
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,790
 When I first came here, I thought, "Fuck yes, I'm saved" 
   

244
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,400
 But this just turned out to be another place to do military training. 
   

245
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,290
 Put it in properly! 

246
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,560
 Would this happen if you helped it properly? 

247
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,020
 But aren't they just making us shovel too fucking much? 

248
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,980
 Digging drainage channels, digging trenches, 

249
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,220
 and digging fucking much for the encampment construction. 

250
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,240
 Damn, what the fuck. That's fucking screwed. 

251
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,300
 Hey, Sun Yi! I ate dirt. Sun Yi! 

252
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,830
 But Chi Yeol... 
   

253
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,720
 We'll be taken to the shelter before we take the college entrance exam, right? 
   

254
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,000
 Then we don't have much time left. 
   

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
 I didn't even start Math 2. 
   

256
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,120
 Can you study this situation? What the... 

257
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,850
 - Hey, it's gone. 
 - What? 

258
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,020
 My undies! 

259
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,770
 Oh, gosh! Hey, you guys took them, right? 

260
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,470
 - Oh, it's not me. It's really not me. 
 - Stop lying! 

261
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,410
 Such pervert punks! 

262
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,560
 Hey, here it is. It's so dirty! 

263
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,830
 I heard we're going to be discharged soon. 

264
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,870
 Is it true? Yes? 

265
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,790
 - Oh, Yu Jeong! 
 - Yes? 

266
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,590
 Did you hear anything? 

267
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,970
 Everyone is asking me, but I have no idea. 

268
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,780
 Yu Jeong. 

269
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,340
 You look really tired. 

270
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,700
 I'm fine. 

271
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,950
 Class President! Class President! 

272
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,470
 What are the side dishes for dinner? 

273
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,180
- Class President! 
 - Yes.

274
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,000
Hey, Deok Jung. Are you playing over there?

275
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,540
- Are you holding it? 
 - Yes, but is this how we do it?

276
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,430
Geez, three people sleep in this small place?

277
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,060
I think it will be even too tight for two people.

278
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,990
Hey, hey, hey!

279
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,520
This is not a tent, but a rag.

280
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,510
Damn it! We're screwed, man. Wang Tae Man will alone take this entire tent.

281
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,830
Hey, hey, stop complaining.

282
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,940
Compared to other training, this is fun.

283
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,600
Think positively as if we're camping.

284
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, shit!

285
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,800
This is not going in! Fuck! What a piece of shit! Damn!

286
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,920
If it doesn't look good after opening up, then you will get to disassemble and reinstall it again.

287
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,100
It's a tent where we will sleep for real. So don't play around, okay?

288
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,240
Do it right!

289
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,070
- Sun Yi, since we're done with this, please watch out not to trip over it. 
 - Oka...

290
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,810
Hey! Lee Sun Yi! Hey! Class President!

291
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,980
Please come here. I don't want to be in the same group as her. Please change my group.

292
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,330
Wow, it's good that at least she's not asking her to breastfeed her.

293
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,850
Geez. Come on. Get in there.

294
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,760
The boys from Yongnong High School looked handsome.

295
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,980
They asked me for my number.

296
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,630
But you don't even have a cell phone.

297
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,500
How about the boy in Class 1 whom you dated before?

298
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,140
We're done already. He's not in the training.

299
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,880
How can I meet a guy who hasn't even fired a gun?

300
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,970
Men who haven't gotten military training aren't even men in my eyes anymore.

301
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,200
What a bullshit. Hey!

302
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,270
You do it. I can't do it anymore.

303
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,440
Hey, if you can't, how can I do it?

304
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,490
- Oh, gosh. 
 - Let me try.

305
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,230
Wow, Lee Na Ra!

306
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,220
 - Hey, No Ae. Hold it tight! 
 - Wait, wait.  

307
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,850
Oh, gosh. What's wrong with this?

308
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,690
One! Hey! What are you doing now? Seriously?

309
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,600
S-Sorry, sorry.

310
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,540
Hold it properly! Oh gosh!

311
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,760
Hi, Bo Ra.

312
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,520
Hey, No Ae.

313
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,010
Why don't you just leave?

314
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,400
- Why? 
 - I'm saying this for you, Idiot.

315
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,980
What's good for you if you stay here?

316
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,300
Are you crazy about college, too?

317
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,480
No, right? Whether it is college or whatever.

318
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,970
It could be dangerous if you're here.

319
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,870
I'm not going to leave.

320
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,250
All of my friends are here.

321
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,330
You don't have any friends!

322
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,920
Ae Seol does have a friend.

323
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,770
Gosh.

324
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,420
Forget it. I shouldn't even...

325
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,430
Don't be nosy. Know when to join.

326
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,240
What does nosy mean?

327
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,340
Hey, Lee Na Ra. Do you think you're something since you shoot well?

328
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,230
What is it to you what I say to No Ae Seol?

329
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,520
Since only to Ae Seol, you...

330
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
You must think you'll do fine on your own.

331
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,670
But do you think you'll still be fine if there's someone around dragging you down?

332
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,920
You don't even know any shit.

333
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,630
But you don't know, either.

334
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,320
It's not easy for me to do it well, either.

335
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,490
- What? 
 -  It's hard for everyone, but they are all trying hard.

336
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,150
Ae Seol is trying, too.

337
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,050
As you can see, most of the mid-sized spheres, except for some, have fallen.

338
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,400
It appears that only about 20% of the mini sphere fragments have been neutralized.

339
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,410
And unfortunately, about 50% of our military forces

340
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,580
were sacrificed in this process.

341
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,320
Currently, most of these spheres are concentrated in the city center.

342
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,850
In the outskirts of this area, relatively low numbers are distributed.

343
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,850
It seems that this is because this sphere is eating people as food.

344
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,180
So since they eat people,

345
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,250
there are a lot of these concentrated in a crowded place, right?

346
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,300
Yes, you are right.

347
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,870
And after it was discovered that this sphere was vulnerable to cold,

348
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,190
it is said that the U.N. is currently developing cryogenic lethal weapons

349
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,980
in addition to the existing DU ammunition.

350
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,290
How long are we just supposed to wait?

351
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,580
We're low on personnel.

352
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,740
It will get cold soon, so wait until then...

353
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Then if the large sphere falls this time, we will all die.

354
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,940
We'll have to stop those monsters somehow

355
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,460
until the main force finishes clearing the spheres.

356
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,490
Hey.

357
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,830
What are we going to do with student reserve forces?

358
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,730
The military and the people are

359
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,580
well aware of your hard work.

360
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,690
Many sacrifices have been made, but

361
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,370
you are the proud sons and daughters of the Republic of Korea,

362
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,280
who are protecting this country from the threat of strange creatures.

363
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,150
So, please be proud of yourself.

364
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,090
- Hey. 
   - To end this war faster...  

365
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,390
What's he trying to tell us with that long introduction, huh?

366
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,620
By any chance, are they going to send us home?

367
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,690
- Really? 
 - No way.

368
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm nervous about this.

369
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,150
We will deliver important operational details now.

370
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,740
At 07:00 on the ensuing day

371
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,170
the 2nd platoon recruits of Seongjin High School 3-2

372
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,770
will carry out an operation to remove the sphere in Iri-eup.

373
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,530
- What? 
 - Operation?

374
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,410
What's this? Is he saying we're going to war?

375
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,310
- No Way! 
 - They said they'll send us home.

376
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,700
What does the ensuing day mean?

377
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,420
Tomorrow.

378
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,560
Be silent, everyone!

379
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,570
Second Platoon Leader.

380
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,650
Our second platoon will leave the current area at 7'o clock a.m. the following day.

381
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,900
We will join the first Battalion of the 3rd Brigade in the Iri-eup area and

382
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,190
be scheduled to be deployed in...

383
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
the operation to remove the sphere.

384
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,860
The goal of this operation is to move from Iri-eup

385
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,910
to Maesong-si through nearby densely populated areas and remove...

386
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,460
as many spheres as possible.

387
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,270
As you know, the situation isn't good.

388
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,340
Most of the nation's infrastructure has already collapsed and

389
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,230
the loss of troops is so great that

390
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,820
riflemen are desperately needed.

391
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Don't forget that you're a soldier, too.

392
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,160
Excuse me, what about the college entrance exam?

393
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,460
I really need to take the college entrance exam.

394
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,080
Is he crazy?

395
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Once we're done with the operation, everything will be on schedule.

396
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,330
If the operation is completed successfully,

397
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,770
not only you will receive extra points for the college entrance exam,

398
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,220
but everyone will also return to their family's arms.

399
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,520
You are dismissed!

400
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,190
Fuck. The vibe did feel off for some reason.

401
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,060
I asked the other kids.

402
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,220
They said we have the most people in our class, so we go out first.

403
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,500
So annoying...

404
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,420
Who were the bitches who were excited about being discharged?

405
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,710
I can't swallow the rice.

406
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,740
This is my first time seeing you not eating.

407
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,750
Well, it would be weird to have a good appetite in this situation.

408
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,260
Do you mean the final letters?

409
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,230
How can I deliver this to kids who

410
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,550
are already scared...

411
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,180
I will deliver it to them.

412
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,880
Just leave it.

413
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,040
If you do this, you'll be in trouble again, Platoon Leader.

414
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,160
Platoon Leader.

415
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,420
   

416
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,970
   

417
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,000
It's just because... everyone writes these before they go off for a mission.

418
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,490
And cut a little of your nails or hair and put it here.

419
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,190
This is...

420
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,770
for a funeral in case they can't retrieve our bodies.

421
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,310
W-W-What?

422
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,780
So it means we're going to die?

423
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,270
No, it's not that...

424
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,660
Why are they being so scary?

425
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,550
It's just a formality.

426
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,470
So why are they asking us to do something formal?

427
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,980
They're asking for this because it's dangerous.

428
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,340
Aren't we going to be discharged?

429
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,540
Why are they sending us out for the operation again?

430
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,300
I also have no idea, but...

431
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,540
Hey! If you don't know, ask them again.

432
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,160
Ask them if we have to go on the operation.

433
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,460
- Yu Ha Na. 
 - She's the class president, isn't she?

434
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,560
As Class President, why don't you even ask them about it?

435
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,900
And fuck! How could you just accept this just because they give it to you?

436
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,060
Hey! Why are you fucking yelling at the class president?

437
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,370
You couldn't even say a fucking word in front of Lieutenant Colonel earlier, you punk.

438
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,480
What, Fucker? She's the head.

439
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,440
Then she has to act on our behalf.

440
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,790
Are you fucking trying to get extra points on the college entrance exam or what? What the fuck!

441
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,190
- Just do it by yourself. 
 - Fucker, what did you say just now?

442
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,550
Let go of me. This motherfucker!

443
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,640
Shit!

444
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,920
Stop fighting!

445
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,990
Hurry and explain!

446
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,280
This motherfucker!

447
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,050
Hey, Kim Yu Jeong. Doesn't this bother you?

448
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,110
Aren't you scared?

449
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,240
Oh, fuck. This is bullshit!

450
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,220
Class President, I don't think this is right, either.

451
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,360
Fuck...

452
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,940
Jang Su. Actually, I became a class president

453
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,540
for the student record.

454
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,170
At first, I had no

455
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,470
sense of duty or responsibility.

456
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,940
You're the class president and

457
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,170
I'm the vice president because of a difference of one vote.

458
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,950
Did you know that?

459
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,520
It makes me feel relieved.

460
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,430
I don't think I could have done it like you.

461
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,860
Hey, Kimchi, are you sleeping?

462
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,350
No, I can't sleep.

463
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,500
Do you remember when we made a popularity ranking

464
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,570
for girls at the beginning of our school?

465
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,930
Yes, I remember that.

466
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,960
Was the number one Cha So Yeon back then?

467
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,840
And the number two was Ha Na?

468
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,770
Hey, after the girls found out later, they all got angry and went crazy.

469
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,450
I was fucking scared for real.

470
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,000
Right.

471
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,520
Hey, but these days, they don't wash and wear makeup.

472
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,820
So I can clearly see how they've changed.

473
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,620
Wow, I think this is the real fear of war.

474
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,930
Oh, I'm scared.

475
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,460
There are also some girls who haven't changed.

476
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,110
- Kimchi. 
 - What again?

477
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,050
At that time, we just had class,

478
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,730
went to a game room, and played around.

479
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,030
Every day went by without thinking.

480
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,670
I didn't even imagine that we'd be like this.

481
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,640
You crazy punks, you are so talkative. I can't sleep.

482
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,180
Oh, did we wake you up? Sorry. I'm so sorry.

483
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,060
Who can sleep right now?

484
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,070
It's hard to fall asleep because I think I need to sleep.

485
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,350
Hi!

486
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,450
Hey, you're not sleepy either, right?

487
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,800
Isn't it too cruel?

488
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,700
Our kids...

489
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,520
Oh, where did it go?

490
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,100
Everyone is here.

491
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,530
How can we sleep?

492
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,130
It's tomorrow. What should we do?

493
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,950
Oh, damn! I'm fucking scared.

494
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,110
It's on the outskirts, so it won't be too dangerous.

495
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,560
Hey, why would they ask us to write a goodbye letter if it's not dangerous?

496
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,380
But they said they'll let us go if it's done safely.

497
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,050
Fuck. We just have to trust them and go.

498
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,470
If we can make it through this safely...

499
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,790
I miss my mom and dad.

500
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,620
Me, too.

501
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,800
Oh, fuck!

502
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,920
Mom.

503
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,750
I want to eat my mom's kimchi jjigae.

504
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,190
Mom...

505
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,010
I miss my mom.

506
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,160
- I miss my mom. 
 - Shh!

507
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,140
Hey, hey, hey.

508
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,150
- Oh, it's hot. 
 - Aigo.

509
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,090
Hey!

510
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,690
Kim Deok Jung.

511
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,180
You guys...

512
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,250
I'm sorry.

513
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,380
We couldn't sleep. We'll go back to our place right away.

514
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,980
I should go to sleep. Please.

515
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,110
Guys...

516
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,950
I heard you didn't even eat dinner.

517
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,700
Sergeant Kim.

518
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,260
Yes.

519
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,320
Go bring them all here.

520
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,990
Yes, Sir.

521
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,190
- What's this? 
 - What's this?

522
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,240
- I don't know. 
 - It's bread.

523
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,390
♫  I play game, if this is hell, then let's say I came here on a school field trip  ♫

524
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,730
♫  After running around happily  ♫

525
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,470
♫  Travel voucher to take as a souvenir. The worst of worst. After enduring it  ♫

526
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,680
♫  I'll invite you to our graduation ceremony  ♫

527
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,220
♫  After all this time passes  ♫

528
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,460
♫  Will the ground that was soaked with rain turn into nourishment? Or will it bloom into flowers   ♫

529
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,850
♫  I already miss the blackboard with names of friends  ♫

530
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,260
The magic of hardtack becoming a cupcake.

531
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,840
 Wow! 

532
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,750
♫  I've never seen beyond the school gates  ♫

533

♫  No matter how much I think about it, there is no answer  ♫

534
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh, Platoon Leader. Here!

535
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,280
 Wow! 

536
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,040
The smell alone is something else.

537
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,460
You must have been very hungry.

538
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,030
♫  But I didn't think I could do that in college  ♫

539
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,540
Catch!

540
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,110
But was the hardtack this delicious? I always threw it away because it was so dry.

541
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,060
- Tell me about it. 
 - The hardtack mountain is daebak, too.

542
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,240
Now, just looking at the hardtack will make me salivate like Pavlov's dog.

543
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,950
Hey, it's the dog of Flanders.

544
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,990
Or was his name Patrasche?

545
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,810
You should just be a dog.

546
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,310
Not Jo Jang Su!

547
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,140
Hey...

548
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,600
Oh, my gosh...

549
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,740
Hey!

550
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,990
 Look at them! 

551
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,780
- Hey! Who's playing with food? 
 - I don't know, Ajeossi!

552
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,560
Hey.

553
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,270
Hey.

554
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,900
Hey! You can't pick up on the mood, can you?

555
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,670
- What? 
 - Won Bin...

556
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,550
Let go of me!

557
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,770
Kim Won Bin.

558
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,010
♫  Welcome to the K-Mars, it's colorful every night  ♫

559
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:49,270
♫  Those demons are always asking me how much I can take  ♫

560
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,330
♫  I can't sleep because of the sun  ♫

561
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:06,400
♫  Where is the face I can rely on no matter where I am?  ♫

562
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,570
♫  I can't find it right here where I am  ♫

563
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,560
♫  I want to shout out to you in this chaos  ♫

564
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,620
♫  I saw a heart that seemed too damaged (I saw it)  ♫

565
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,900
♫  I broke down at the unfamiliar sight of the bleeding  ♫

566
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,120
- We're a mess. 
 - I'm covered in it.

567
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,220
- Look at you. 
 - You look worse.

568
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,910
Aren't you too childish, Platoon Leader?

569
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,150
You look like you're having even more fun than we are.

570
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,880
- You're too much. 
 - That's right.

571
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,680
What did you do before you came here, Platoon Leader?

572
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,020
I was in a combat unit.

573
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,610
No, I mean before that.

574
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,280
Were you in college?

575
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,350
Do you have a girlfriend?

576
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,410
You guys...

577
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,520
I won't answer any questions that have nothing to do with training. Okay?

578
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,680
The platoon leader has a girlfriend.

579
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,350
- No, he doesn't! 
 - Wow.

580
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,160
What's your plan after this war is over and

581
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,780
we all return? Are you going back to college?

582
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,290
I said I'm not answering questions that have nothing to do with training.

583
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,210
It has to do with training.

584
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,830
If we know more about you,

585
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,470
our platoon members will become more efficient.

586
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,020
- Yes. Just tell us. 
 - Tell us.

587
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,030
Tell us.

588
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,100
 Tell us! Tell us! 

589
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,010
 Tell us! 

590
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,290
 Tell us! Tell us! 

591
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,510
 Tell us! Tell us! 

592
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,010
You guys!

593
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,350
I was in the ROTC, so I came here after graduating from college. 
  (T/N: Reserve Officer Training Corps - A college program to recruit and train military officers) 

594
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:37,900
I still have about a year left in my service period. But I'm not sure if

595
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,830
I'll just get discharged or apply for an extension.

596
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,850
That's it!

597
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,640
Extension? Why would you do more of something like this?

598
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,010
That's what I'm saying. Isn't it too tough?

599
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,860
- It's definitely better to go out into society. 
 - True, true.

600
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,750
Society is tough too, Guys.

601
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,390
Since I'm also still young, I don't know too much, but

602
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,090
even going out into society is like going to war.

603
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:06,290
If the entrance exam is a local war, then is society a world war?

604
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,210
This moment...This is the happiest moment...

605
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,950
Excuse me...

606
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,070
When will this war end?

607
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,990
Will we...

608
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,160
be able to go back home?

609
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,820
They said they'd let us go home if we complete this operation.

610
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,160
Can we believe that?

611
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,490
Please don't think we don't know anything since we are kids.

612
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:56,500
- Please tell us the truth. 
 - What if we trust them and get betrayed again?

613
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,150
I don't know when this war will end,

614
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,850
but you all just have to keep one thing in mind.

615
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,370
We will definitely survive until the end.

616
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,010
I can't end this war,

617
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,860
but I'll help you finish it well,

618
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,170
without anyone getting hurt.

619
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,890
I can promise you that.

620
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,990
First Squad. Shooter. Jo Jang Su.

621
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,320
Assistant Shooter. Guk Yeong Su.

622
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,080
Second Squad. Shooter. Kim Yu Jeong.

623
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,530
Assistant Shooter. Wang Tae Man.

624
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,400
Search Team. Jo Yeong Sin. Kwon Il Ha.

625
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,020
Sniper. Lee Na Ra. Observer. Do Su Cheol.

626
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,170
After arriving in the operation area, the assault team will be on alert.

627
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,360
During the movement, the two people in the search teams act as advance guards at the forefront.

628
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,160
 Yes, Sir! 

629
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,010
This is a sphere detector.

630
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,740
Sphere detector?

631
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,650
Is it detecting spheres?

632
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,440
Hey, it's called a sphere detector. What could it be for?

633
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,270
Is it a prototype?

634
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,670
- What's that? 
 - It's a product that hasn't been fully developed yet.

635
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,520
That's right. Since it's not perfect yet,

636
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,780
you should not rely too much on the sphere detector.

637
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,950
What is the detection radius?

638
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:12,180
It's one kilometer in undeveloped land.

639
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,030
In the case of the city center or town,

640
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,730
the detection radius will be 500 to 700 m.

641
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,460
So...

642
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,610
Always be alert.

643
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,210
 Yes, Sir! 

644
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,760
That's it!

645
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,630
Let's see. Let's see.

646
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,870
It looks like the higher ups aren't just sitting around doing nothing after all.

647
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,060
Tell me about it. Why didn't they give this to us earlier?

648
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,840
Class President, look!

649
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,340
Oh, what's this? Why can't I get any signal?

650
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,280
Because there are no spheres!

651
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,200
This idiot. Oh, gosh.

652
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,240
Three minutes to go! 2nd Platoon!

653
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,580
Get in the vehicles in squads! Implement!

654
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,820
 Implement! 

655
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,330
Hey, Deok Jung!

656
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,570
Oh, yes.

657
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,420
Platoon Leader.

658
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,360
We need equipment to clean this up.

659
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,600
Let's search the area first.

660
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,310
Hey! Walk properly.

661
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,840
How does this work?

662
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,560
Nerds are different.

663
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,510
Most of us just say this is fucking interesting.

664
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,840
We don't care how it works.

665
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,370
It's not because I'm a nerd, it's because of my family's genes.

666
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,140
It's a good gene.

667
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,190
Boom!

668
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,010
Gosh! Just go first.

669
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,120
You go first!

670
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,930
Did you set the fire selector to safe?

671
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,360
What?

672
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,200
Yes, I did.

673
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,090
Don't shoot me in the back of the head.

674
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,360
To set the fire selector to safe, you just have to turn this a little bit.

675
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,320
- I'm scared. 
 - I'm scared, too.

676
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,790
Hey, No Ae. Hurry!

677
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,340
Okay.

678
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,070
Class President. Why do you keep looking back?

679
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,480
We need to be on the rear guard.

680
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,210
Hey, then just walk backward.

681
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,160
Would that be better?

682
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,870
Are you okay?

683
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,440
Oh, geez.

684
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,800
Thank you.

685
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,770
Are you really walking backward because I said so?

686
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,650
You're more foolish than I expected, Class President.

687
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,810
Wow.

688
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,740
I don't feel well.

689
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,940
What's with me?

690
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,380
Let's see.

691
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,640
I know well about women.

692
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,510
Hey, Yeong Su, you should not do that.

693
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,120
Then what should I do?

694
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,640
To do well...

695
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,070
be manly and cool.

696
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,680
Na Ra, be careful.

697
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,230
Okay.

698
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,560
Ha Na, be careful.

699
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,500
Fuck off!

700
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,290
She told me to fuck off.

701
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,030
Are you anxious?

702
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,370
For what?

703
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,300
That couple shot.

704
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,430
Feeling like a romantic drama.

705
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,570
And a man who's just watching from here.

706
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,380
Hey. Just be quiet.

707
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,150
I'm already disturbed enough.

708
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,180
Hey, since we're going like this,

709
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,050
doesn't it feel like we're on some kind of operation?

710
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:33,020
Hey, hey, hey. We're on a real operation right now. Focus!

711
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,860
Show yourself, spheres!

712
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,090
- Oh! Get out of my way! 
 - Oh! My goodness! My goodness!

713
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,920
Wu Hui Rak. What's going on?

714
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,440
It's n-nothing.

715
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,000
Platoon Leader.

716
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
What's that?

717
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,540
- Oh, fuck! 
 - Oh! Daebak!

718
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,260
 It's coke! Let me have a sip! 

719
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,830
I'm going to save it, so don't even think about it and go!

720
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:23,390
 You're petty! Please share! 

721
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,270
You can't shake the coke.

722
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,260
But this is mine, so I can shake it.

723
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,870
 Oh, shit! 

724
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,540
I love it.

725
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,170
 Oh, shit! We won't drink it since it's dirty. 

726
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,650
Oh! Platoon Leader!

727
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,430
Kwon Il Ha.

728
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,040
Locate it.

729
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,420
It is 300 m southwest.

730
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,250
Oh, shit. Hey, why did you come here? What's with you?

731
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,450
What's that?

732
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,220
Platoon Leader!

733
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,720
- Platoon Leader! 
 - Here are the spheres. Hurry!

734
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,920
  - Platoon Leader!   
 - Aren't those spheres?

735
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,440
 Shoot! Hurry!  

736
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,330
Shoot! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

737
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,720
I don't think I can.

738
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,430
Hold!

739
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,300
Second Platoon! Fire!

740
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,630
Hey! Left side! Left side!

741
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,600
One, two, three!

742
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,860
- Shoot. 
 - Got it.

743
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,460
Where is it?

744
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,100
Position yourself, aim, and fire!

745
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,220
- Die. 
 - Die.

746
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,180
Hey, No Ae. Do it properly!

747
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,950
What should I do? Let me change the magazine and shoot it again.

748
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,660
Oh, it's hot.

749
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,730
Geez! Why are you touching it with your hands, Idiot?

750
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,940
Guk Yeong Su! Lee Sun Yi!

751
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,830
- Support on the right! 
 - Yes, Sir.

752
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,590
- Jo Jang Su! Wang Tae Man! 
 - Yes, Sir!

753
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,140
- Hey, what are you doing? 
 - Sorry.

754
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,170
Hey! This way!

755
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,110
Oh, shit! I can't fucking aim right.

756
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:55,160
No, No! Wang Tae Man!

757
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,450
Run away, Wang Tae Man! Wang Tae Man, hurry up!

758
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,360
It's fucking not aiming right. Jang Su! Jang Su!

759
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,650
Jo Jang Su, please help!

760
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,800
Save the DU ammo!

761
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,160
Fuck! Where are they? Where are they? Where, Class President?

762
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,000
Guys, over there!

763
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,770
Oh, fuck! Hey, I don't have a magazine.

764
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,680
Hui Rak, give me magazine. Hurry, hurry!

765
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,170
- What the fuck are you doing? 
 - Fuck! Fuck! What's this?

766
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,820
Why aren't they coming out?

767
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,840
That's what I'm saying.

768
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,690
Cover!

769
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,270
 What's going on? 

770
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,150
 I don't see it. 

771
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,890
What's going on?

772
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,740
No more spheres?

773
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,760
They all seem to be hiding.

774
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,300
- Where are you going? 
 - I'll go find and get rid of them.

775
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,880
Hey!

776
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,160
- What are you going to do by yourself? 
 - Let go of me!

777
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,760
What?

778
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,790
- Are they still here? 
 - What?

779
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,110
 Come over here. 

780
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,020
Hey! Behind you! Spheres are behind you!

781
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,560
Spheres!

782
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,050
It's coming.

783
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,900
Where did it come from?

784
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,430
Are you okay?

785
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,540
What are you doing?

786
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,700
Position yourself and guard your surroundings.

787
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,810
- Go back to your positions! 
 - Back to our positions.

788
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,880
Back to our positions.

789
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,140
Jo Yeong Sin.

790
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,320
Jo Yeong Sin! Locate the sphere.

791
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,690
Fuck!

792
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,860
What should we do now?

793
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,590
Find all of them and remove them.

794
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,260
Yes, Sir.

795
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:50,120
One, two, three!

796
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,050
Lady first.

797
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,180
You go first.

798
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,020
Oh, shit. Ouch!

799
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,970
Shit!

800
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,830
Hey! Sphere!

801
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:12,170
Hey, wait! Fuck!

802
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,620
Oh, shit!

803
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,900
Damn it!

804
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,300
What happened?

805
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,580
We removed three.

806
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,980
We just missed one.

807
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,970
Get out the way!

808
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,050
Oh, gosh!

809
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,290
Ha Na!

810
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,660
Let's go!

811
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,140
Let's go! Hurry!

812
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:30,930
I shouldn't have saved them.

813
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,200
Oh, shit!

814
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,830
Shit!

815
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,250
What the fuck!

816
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,580
Hey, you go to the left! And Kim Chi Yeol!

817
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,520
You follow me!

818
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,150
Oh, fuck!

819
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:39,560
- Na Ra! 
 - Stop crying!

820
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,340
 Fuck! 

821
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,560
Hey, stop crying!

822
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,150
Hey!

823
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,960
It's too dark. Shall we just not go in?

824
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,700
No. A sphere is detected. We have to get it.

825
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,880
- Oh, shit. 
 - Hey, just get the lantern out.

826
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,730
Okay.

827
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:11,180
Oh, fuck. Why do I always go first?

828
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,120
- Oh, shit. 
 - Oh, sorry!

829
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,940
Gosh! Hey!

830
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,900
Put it away!

831
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,560
I don't think they're here.

832
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,710
- Cha So Yeon. 
 - Yes.

833
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,700
Okay.

834
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,530
Oh, shit!

835
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:56,620
- There it is. 
  - Kill it.

836
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:00,860
I can't see it. I can't see it.

837
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,450
Kim Deok Jung!

838
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,600
Hey!

839
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,820
Deok Jung!

840
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:17,480
Are you okay?

841
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,210
Oh, I'm alive.

842
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,830
- I'm alive. 
 - You're fine.

843
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,830
- You surprise me. 
 - Is he okay?

844
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,330
Yes, he looks fine.

845
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,420
Oh, gosh. Hey!

846
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,560
Shh.

847
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:44,080


848
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:49,430
   

849
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,060
♫  I thought everybody wanna live peaceful. So I fought for equal rights and inner peace  ♫

850
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,830
♫  But ain't nobody equal, and this is the sequel. Don't sell it. Since not even one memory is worth anything. Respawn   ♫

851
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,830
♫  Rebirth, reborn. No matter what you say, the important thing is the basics  ♫

852
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,940
♫  There is no mercy for those who cannot keep it. You're on the list, ho   ♫

853
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,370
♫  Blood splatter on my soul. It is a luxury to hope that no scars are left behind   ♫

854
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,780
♫ Now, even in front of a grave, it feels more natural for me to be calm, huh  ♫

855
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,440
♫ The world is not easy, but it doesn't rest either. Time is ticking. I ain't got no time for sleeping  ♫

856
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,880
♫ So, I cannot rest and must stay awake. If you don't get it, then forget it. If you get it, then get it, ah ♫

857
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,830
♫  Santa Claus is dead  ♫

858
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:27,450
♫  The book of fairytale is closed, only thing in front of me is the reality, wake up, uh!  ♫

859
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,220
♫  I thought it was only in the movies, but in peace  ♫

860
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,970
♫ Hell already exists in the comments section ♫

861
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,190
♫ The world is yours but war's going on outside ♫

862
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,720
♫  No man is safe from. It's either death or survival  ♫

863
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,390
♫  Save the time to wake up the boy in you. Turn on beast mode  ♫

864
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,680
♫  If you don't take it away, you'll be taken away  ♫

865
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,350
♫  Get a hold of your mind  ♫

866
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,790
♫  If you miss it, you lose not only yourself but also your friends  ♫

867
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:56,150
♫  A crisis is a crisis because it comes suddenly. Wake up and get yourself together   ♫

868
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:59,590
♫  Miracles do not exist in reality. Even with gathered strength, it is selfish. It ain't joke   ♫

869
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:04,690
♫ It's a war. Gotta open your eyes yay-yea  ♫

870
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,690
♫  Nowhere to hide yay-yea  ♫

871
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,990
♫  Nothing is right, ain't it  ♫

872
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:15,500
♫  The war's on outside, everyday  ♫

873
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,100
♫  Get your as, get your ass, get your ass   ♫

874
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,390
♫  Get your ass up. In a game of snatching and holding back, the spoils go to the winner  ♫

875
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:25,770
♫  A crisis is an opportunity for learning. Pull it all, we never asked. That's Seoul's Code of Conduct. ♫

876
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:29,660
♫  Masquerade ball. I know that not everyone who is laughing is actually happy, okay ♫

877
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,550
♫  As tension sets in, my brain becomes addicted to that feeling  ♫

878
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:36,680
♫  I'm a slave for that, no cancelled. Time has already been pulled, and the bowstring has been placed  ♫

879
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,330
♫  I keep pulling twice as fast. If I can't stop anyway, I'll pull even more. I'ma go get the bag ♫

880
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,890
♫  Before everyone's breath becomes short, they think stages easily ♫

881
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:47,810
♫  I wake up from sleep hundreds of times and say it. I've put everything on the line. You better have something to pay ♫

882
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:50,470
♫  You'll be an adult at a blink of an eye  ♫

883
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,970
♫  Friends will leave, and it will repeat again  ♫

884
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:57,020
♫ Without time to be sad ♫

885
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,070
♫  Today's sun is blinding  ♫

886
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:03,040
♫  You forget your purpose and move like you're drifting in a tide  ♫

887
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,580
♫  When you look behind...  ♫
