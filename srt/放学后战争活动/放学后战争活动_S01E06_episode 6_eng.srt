1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,020
   

2
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,990
It's okay.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,490
All the spheres have been eliminated.

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,010
What happened?

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:34,040


6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,660
Is this a dream?

7
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,360
Is it?

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,430
There must be survivors over there too.

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,260
It's a boy...

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,290
Two people?

11
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,120
Don't step on him.

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,830
Don't step on him!

13
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,780
Hey...

14
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,920
Don't step on my friend!

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,120
Don't step on him...

17
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,430
My friend...

18
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,400
My friend... Don't step on him...

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,950
Don't step on him!

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,420
Don't step on him!

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Hey, what happened?

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,110
I don't know.

23
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,040
   

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,200
   

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,950
   

26
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,750
Anything?

27
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,920
Fuck...

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,220
Excuse me...

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,110
Excuse me?

30
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,960
Platoon Leader!

31
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,380
It's not reacting to any spheres.

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,880
This way.

33
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,650
   

34
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,570
The smell...

35
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,630
Any survivors?

36
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,550
Everyone here must be dead.

37
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,700
I don't think there are any survivors.

38
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,620
I wonder if Mom and Dad are okay.

39
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,480
Guys, check over here.

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,590
This must've been the residence hall.

41
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,800
Are you guys the only survivors?

42
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,620
They said all we had to do is deliver the supplies to the shelter.

43
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,320
But when we arrived...

44
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,340
How about the commander?

45
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,100
I don't know. He disappeared.

46
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,060
Why did you guys stay here without a commander?

47
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,960
Because they told us to wait.

48
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,260
So we waited. We did what we were told.

49
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,430
But why...

50
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,100
I know it's tough, but please calm yourself down...

51
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,840
and let's talk after we wrap things up here.

52
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,990
Yu Jeong, take care of your new friends.

53
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,030
Aren't you guys hungry?

54
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,200
Do you want to eat something?

55
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,980
There...

56
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,760
Hamil High School, third grade, Kim Dong Hun.

57
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,340
Ae Seol, Hamil High School, third grade, Kim Dong Hun.

58
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,050
   

59
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,190
Jang Sun Yeong.

60
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,190
Jang Sun Yeong...

61
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,440
Did you see her eyes earlier?

62
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,440
They weren't focused. They looked empty.

63
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,570
This is horrific.

64
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,070
Had I been left alone, I wonder if I would've ended up like them.

65
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,990
Do you think we could survive?

66
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,860
It's a small shelter, but it's been completely demolished as if they were attacked by surprise.

67
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,340
The shelters are located in the outskirts, where there aren't any spheres.

68
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,580
And there are no traces of the spheres that have fallen outside.

69
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,130
I wonder how the small spheres attacked this place.

70
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,380
The spheres looking for food must have come here in droves.

71
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,370
How did they know that there was a shelter here?

72
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,230
Platoon Leader.

73
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,620
No Ae Seol is going to cause a major issue later on!

74
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,790
She was always weird, but she's really weird now.

75
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,970
She will cause a terrible accident if this continues.

76
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,480
You don't have to worry about Ae Seol.

77
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,830
She's doing very well, and she will continue to do so.

78
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,130
How much do you know about No Ae Seol anyway?

79
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,700
Just don't regret it later.

80
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,360
Because of that bitch...

81
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,990
Bo Ra...

82
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,490
No spheres, no spheres, no spheres...

83
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,560
No spheres, no spheres, no spheres...

84
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,610
But seriously, what are we going to do?

85
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,070
I heard their commander ran away.

86
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm glad we have the platoon leader and Oppa Won Bin.

87
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,710
Right?

88
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,720
You guys must be starving. Hurry and eat.

89
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,290
What are you doing?

90
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,370
Why the gun...

91
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,860
What are you doing?

92
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,580
I...

93
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,350
ran away.

94
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,440
My friends...

95
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,300
My friends begged me to save them...

96
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,380
But I ran away...

97
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
by myself.

98
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,070
That's...

99
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,380
They all died.

100
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,380
No...

101
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,480
It's not your fault.

102
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,110
I did the same thing. When my friends died,

103
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,460
I was busy running away.

104
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,470
It's not your fault at all.

105
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,870
Please... put the gun down.

106
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,910
It's dangerous.

107
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,230
Yun Seo...

108
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,470
Please put the gun down...

109
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't come closer!

110
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,240
Yun Seo.

111
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,830
That's your name, right?

112
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,170
I know it was tough...

113
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,630
and scary.

114
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,250
From now on,

115
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
we will protect you.

116
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,230
So put that...

117
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,720
gun down.

118
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,860
Yun Seo, please put the gun down.

119
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,590
Please...

120
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,750
You said we would be okay.

121
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,620
You said we just had to do as we were told.

122
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,470
You told us to wait.

123
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,890
And then you'll run away again anyway.

124
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,720
Yun Seo!

125
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,660
Extra credit points?

126
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,310
Who the hell cares about all that?

127
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,850
What the hell!

128
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,450
I don't believe you anymore. Because of all you guys,

129
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,690
because of you grownups, they all died.

130
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,400
My friends all died...

131
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,120
You guys killed them all! You guys killed them!

132
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,870
No!

133
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,860
- What was that? 
 - Shit!

134
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,960
What was that?

135
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,190
Wasn't that a gunshot?

136
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,200
Where? Where?

137
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm so sorry...

138
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,220
Won Bin...

139
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
Oh, no...

140
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,720
Wake up! Kim Won Bin!

141
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,500
- Oh, no... 
 - Bring me the hemostatic! 
  (T/N: A substance used to stop bleeding after injuries) 

142
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,270
Bring us the hemostatic! Hurry!

143
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,280
Fuck!

144
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,780
Won Bin...

145
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,130
No...

146
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,430
It's not my fault...

147
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,220
The grownups...

148
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,010
It's all the grownups' fault.

149
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,360
It's not my fault.

150
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,660
It's not my fault...

151
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,910
It's not my fault...

152
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,590
It's not...

153
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,370
   

154
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,460
   

155
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,420
   

156
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,510
   

157
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,970
   

158
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,820
   

159
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,560
 Wild Goose, this is Seagull. 

160
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,080
 Over. 

161
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,040
Wild Goose, this is Seagull.

162
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,500
Over.

163
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,040
I—

164
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,090
Will Hyeong be okay?

165
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,930
Fortunately, the bullet went through his shoulder.

166
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,100
- It's not life-threatening. 
 - Seriously...

167
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,840
But we still need to treat him quickly.

168
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm fine. So don't worry too much.

169
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,730
- Hyeong! Are you okay? 
 - Geez...

170
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,980
I told you I'm okay.

171
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,140
Just stay down.

172
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,280
Thank you.

173
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,580
You guys can go now.

174
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,860
Deok Jung, what time is it?

175
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,640
Ten o'clock.

176
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,210
It's time for his painkiller.

177
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,710
I'll give it to him. Good work.

178
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,670
I won't go. I want to stay with him.

179
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,930
- Come on. 
 - Why...

180
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,060
- Hurry and come. 
 - Are you sure he's okay?

181
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,600
He will be okay!

182
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,130
Aigo.

183
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,220
P-P-Platoon Leader...

184
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,910
P-Please be gentle...

185
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,750
I want to punch you, but I'm holding back.

186
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,040
Who the hell do you think you are to put yourself there?

187
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,440
If something happens to you, what will happen to the kids?

188
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm not confident that I could do it.

189
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,920
That female student... Don't blame her too much.

190
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,690
She must be so confused and afraid.

191
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,340
She must feel so betrayed by the grownups

192
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,820
whom she trusted would protect her.

193
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
And I'm one of those grownups.

194
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,530
So where do we go from here?

195
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,440
I will have to do my very best.

196
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,300
How is Ajeossi?

197
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
He's okay.

198
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,170
What a relief.

199
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,930
Hey, what if those guys shoot at us, too?

200
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,230
Hey! Be quiet!

201
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,460
They could hear you.

202
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm just nervous about it!

203
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
- That, that mouth of yours! 
 - Shit!

204
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,650
But you know, I do understand her.

205
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,930
I felt like she was saying out loud what was in my head.

206
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,240
Platoon Leader wants all of us to gather.

207
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,080
We will retreat first thing in the morning and return to the base camp.

208
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Can we go back? How about our mission?

209
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,960
I can't guarantee your safety here.

210
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,530
While I can't even determine how many spheres are out there,

211
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,610
and if they were to attack us all at once,

212
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,390
I don't think we could handle them.

213
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,180
Platoon Leader, including what happened last time,

214
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,990
wouldn't you be in big trouble if you keep disobeying the command?

215
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,840
I have determined that your safety comes first at the moment.

216
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,600
I'll take responsibility.

217
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,960
So you guys don't have to worry.

218
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,320
Sentinels, be sure to stand guard securely. The rest of you, go to sleep.

219
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,940
We'll be on the move as soon as the sun rises in the morning.

220
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,650
That's all.

221
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,100
Is that what's going to happen?

222
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,580
What's going on here?

223
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,530
It's going to be really tough for him.

224
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,220
It's so sudden.

225
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,180
Are we really returning?

226
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,770
Let's just go for now.

227
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,670
If this is what a shelter looks like,

228
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,010
I wonder what our school is like right now.

229
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,270
But if we return, wouldn't Platoon Leader be disciplined?

230
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,930
What if he goes to the military prison?

231
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,040
Military prison?

232
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,270
This is punishable by execution.

233
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,550
Execution?

234
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,630
No way...

235
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,180
Hey. Don't say such an ominous thing.

236
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,310
Now that I think about it, Platoon Leader sure is a rebel, isn't he?

237
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,530
He's doing that because of us.

238
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,790
But you know...

239
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,660
- What happens to our extra credit points if we fail our mission? 
 - What the fuck?

240
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,130
We can only get our points if we succeed in our mission.

241
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,770
Fuck, that asshole sure likes to blabber bullshit so consistently.

242
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,530
But still, what if they don't send us back to our parents for not completing our mission?

243
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,330
Hey. Someone might face execution. Do you really want to worry about that?

244
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,600
No, I mean, I'm just...

245
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,810
Let's think positively.

246
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,180
Although it could be dangerous, we're returning. That's a good thing.

247
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,280
The culprit is ultimately at the crime scene.

248
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,520
My cola!

249
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,220
Fuck, I definitely put it here!

250
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,790
- Park So Yun. 
 - What?

251
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,800
- It was you, right? 
 -  What the hell? Don't accuse an innocent person!

252
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,970
What are you staring at? Shit!

253
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,220
I think he drank it already. Shit...

254
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,200
Fuck! Who took it!

255
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,580
Hey! Shit!

256
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,180
What are you doing?

257
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,430
Move! Move!

258
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,130
That's enough, Asshole!

259
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,120
Hey, did you see it? Did you?

260
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,220
Where are you going?

261
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,620
Cha So Yeon.

262
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,700
It's bedtime. Why aren't you sleeping?

263
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,000
W-Well, I just...

264
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,070
I was just worried about returning.

265
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,630
It's not something you guys should worry about.

266
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,790
Did you come here to say that?

267
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,340
Excuse me?

268
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,110
Actually...

269
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,760
I wanted to say something to you, Platoon Leader.

270
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,340
To say something?

271
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,510
Platoon Leader,

272
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,300
I actually...

273
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,200
Platoon Leader...

274
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,650
- Kim Deok Jung. 
 - Gosh, you scared me!

275
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,010
What's going on?

276
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,940
T-To the restroom...

277
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,180
- Go ahead. 
 - Thank you.

278
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,950
Why don't you hurry and go?

279
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,390
You need an amazing amount of focus to do that...

280
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,390
What did you want to say?

281
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,830
It's nothing. Goodnight.

282
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,290
   

283
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,650
Wu Hui Rak?

284
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,410
I wonder what happened.

285
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,920
That Kim Deok Jung, Shithead.

286
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,900
She's back.

287
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,220
So annoying...

288
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,860
Hey, did you confess to him?

289
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,750
No. I don't think it's time.

290
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,990
Seriously...

291
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,820
I'll do it when we return.

292
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,370
What's so attractive about the platoon leader?

293
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,620
The love in the midst of war is meant to be beautiful.

294
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,990
What the hell? Crazy Bitch.

295
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,740
Na Ra, you don't have to be so intense about it.

296
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,460
Okay?

297
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,410
Yeah, right.

298
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,230
I'll stand guard. Why don't you rest for a little while?

299
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,150
I'm okay.

300
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,560
I guess she's okay.

301
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,730
Should I tell her?

302
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,410
No, I'd be a psycho if I told her at a time like this.

303
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,730
But still...

304
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,780
wouldn't it be my chance to tell her when we're alone?

305
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,210
Hey, you know...

306
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,790
Huh?

307
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,890
Well...

308
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,070
by chance, do you...

309
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,370
do you like...

310
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,110
d-do you like...

311
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,050
Do you have a celebrity you like?

312
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,960
It's a sphere.

313
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,430
What?

314
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,090
The detector isn't responding, though.

315
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,190
It's outside of the detector's perimeter.

316
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,540
It's about 2 km away from here.

317
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,890
 Do you mean there was an exchange of signals? 

318
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,340
I can't be certain, but I saw a light flash from a large sphere in the sky.

319
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,410
The sphere that looked like the leader lit up, too.

320
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,810
And after that, they started moving toward somewhere.

321
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,020
It looked like they were communicating with each other.

322
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,000
If that's the case,

323
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,420
they exchange signals and

324
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,720
a few of them would go off somewhere and come back.

325
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,310
That would be the pattern, right?

326
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,570
Do you think they're looking for something?

327
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,980
- By chance... 
 - Reconnaissance.

328
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,180
That's right. It's as if they're doing reconnaissance.

329
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,210
They're watching to see where we're moving to.

330
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,240
They're much more intelligent than we give them credit for.

331
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,580
They went as far as this area.

332
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,530
I wonder what's there.

333
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,880
I heard there's a shelter there as well.

334
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,560
Our platoon leader said that.

335
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,500
That there's a small shelter there too.

336
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,370
Wait a minute. If so,

337
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,230
they received their order from the large ones in the sky,

338
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,770
and they decided their next target would be the shelter in the area.

339
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,750
Gosh, that makes no sense.

340
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,620
Because there is...

341
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,530
-  a lot of food for them there. 
 - Pardon?

342
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,720
A shelter that's supposed to be a safe hiding place

343
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,210
has just become a place where their prey congregates.

344
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,370
To make it easier for the spheres to find them.

345
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,020
Geez...

346
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,570
We have to notify the troops who are in that shelter.

347
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,850
But our communication line has been cut off.

348
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,970
So what do we do?

349
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,710
As for us...

350
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,790
we'll make our retreat in the morning as planned.

351
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,830
- How about that shelter? 
 - We can't handle that many.

352
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,050
Let's return as quickly as possible and find another solution there.

353
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,240
But what if the spheres attack them before then?

354
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,590
At their speed, it will be too late even if the support troops show up.

355
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,260
What are you guys talking about? What do you want us to do?

356
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,150
That's right! It's an order, so we have no choice.

357
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,090
Don't we get to go home only if we kill all the spheres?

358
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,640
Didn't you see the Hamil High kids? Do you all want to die?

359
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,350
He's right! It's too dangerous.

360
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,970
Sun Yi, you're scared, too, right?

361
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,660
I'm scared.

362
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,290
But I'm sure someone's parents must be over there.

363
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,330
Who will protect them?

364
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,140
If we leave, they'll just send other kids.

365
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,960
Seongjin High came after Hamil High,

366
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,620
and another school would just follow after that.

367
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,380
From how I read the room, I think it's been decided.

368
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:35,990
   

369
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,530
Thank you.

370
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,060
I get to laugh thanks to you.

371
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,130
For some reason, doesn't it seem like the kids have matured drastically?

372
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,560
Wow! I'm so proud of them.

373
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,530
Is this how a parent feels watching their children grow up?

374
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,620
How old are you, seriously?

375
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,710
I'm forty-one years old.

376
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,290
The pain traveled.

377
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,460
It's going to be hectic from now on. So stay alert.

378
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,050
What are you talking about? I'm a patient.

379
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,620
You're not exempt.

380
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,600
Platoon Leader, isn't that too much?

381
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,100
- I said no exemptions. 
 - But I got shot! Seriously...

382
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,010
Attention, everyone.

383
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,550
To seek out and eliminate every single sphere

384
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,050
spread out all over the town is too dangerous.

385
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,380
That's right.

386
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,370
So we will gather

387
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,070
all the spheres in Mesong City College here

388
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,920
and eliminate them in one blow.

389
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,030
- But how? 
 - In one blow? How?

390
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,440
Eliminate them in one blow?

391
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,740
- How, how? 
 - Is that possible?

392
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,060
Everyone,

393
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,000
listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

394
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,030
   

395
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,550
Be careful.

396
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,420
    
 Oh, that!

397
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,430
Why, why, why?

398
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,110
Hey, this is it, right?

399
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,770
I think this is it.

400
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,290
 First, combine the DU ammunition and the dynamite 

401
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,730
 to make DU explosives. 

402
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,390
Gently, gently...

403
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,260
Hey, be careful!

404
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,420
Be careful.

405
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,300
Careful.

406
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,170
Shit...

407
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,940
It's okay.

408
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,330
- Platoon 2, attention! 
  - Attention! 

409
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,610
Find each assigned installation spot and install the explosives carefully.

410
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,230
After the installation is completed,

411
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,350
quickly make your way up to Seolbonggwan rooftop and stand by.

412
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,000
- Do you understand? 
  - Yes, Sir! 

413
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,090
Each unit, to your position.

414
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,250
 Loyalty! 

415
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:42,750
 Unit 1, restore power in the mechanical room. 

416
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,060
   

417
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,550
   

418
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,290
Once all the power is restored, everyone else

419
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,500
will install DU explosives in the main building.

420
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,000
 Unit 6, until the DU explosives are installed, 

421
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,850
 observe the spheres' movements, 

422
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,310
and signal the units, so they could complete their mission.

423
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,110
If the spheres show even the slightest unusual movements during the mission,

424
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,330
report to me immediately.

425
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,780
Su Cheol, what are they telling us to do after making the explosives?

426
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,310
What were you doing, not listening to Platoon Leader?

427
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,040
My nail broke. So I was distracted with that.

428
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,470
Install the explosives, then lure the spheres, and then...

429
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,290
And then?

430
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,410
That's simple!

431
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,570
Do you think that's simple?

432
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,290
If we fail to install the explosives, we die.

433
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,750
If we can't lure the spheres, we die.

434
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,430
If we can't kill them all in one-blow, we die.

435
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,820
And if we get distracted during the mission like you, we die.

436
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,770
How about it? Is it simple?

437
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,540
Where? Where do I need to stand guard?

438
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,910
Deok Jung.

439
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,140
- Kim Deok Jung! 
 - Wait a minute!

440
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,620
- Leave me alone. 
 - Take it!

441
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,850
- Jun Hui. 
 - So Yeon, hold this.

442
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,480
Geez, what did you learn?

443
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,190
Do you think this is easy? Shit...

444
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,660
 Once we're done installing all the DU explosives in the main building, 

445
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,160
 we'll close off all the doors to the outside. 

446
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,290
 Then quickly move to Seolbonggwan rooftop and stand by. 

447
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,460
We have to put the explosives here, right?

448
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,980
Yes. Give it to me. I'll do it.

449
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,090
But what's this smell?

450
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,130
I've been smelling something similar to the spheres from earlier.

451
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,010
The spheres' smell?

452
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,160
Their unique fishy smell.

453
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,710
What's with this atmosphere?

454
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,630
Guk Yeong Su, do you like Cha So Yeon?

455
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,950
What do you mean? No.

456
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,000
Look at this punk. You really must like her.

457
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,410
Hey. Stop it.

458
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:07,170
Hey, Cha So Yeon, how can you say the guy who likes you stinks?

459
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,030
That would hurt his feelings so fucking badly. Isn't that right?

460
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,950
Stop it.

461
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,890
Hey, what the... I don't smell anything.

462
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,710
Cha So Yeon, smell him again.

463
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,650
Fuck it! Stop it!

464
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,370
You motherfucker, you're insane.

465
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,820
- Hey. 
 - Is now the time for this?

466
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,830
Are you guys out of your mind?

467
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,620
Hey. I'll see you later, you fucker.

468
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,620
After we lure all the spheres and lock all the doors,

469
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,020
we'll detonate the DU explosives and eliminate all the spheres.

470
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,820
The spheres started moving!

471
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,420
What?

472
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,100
Where?

473
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,030
Hold it.

474
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,240
Platoon Leader, the spheres are acting weird.

475
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,630
I think they're about to move.

476
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,940
Are they already moving?

477
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,500
Fuck.

478
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,600
Hey. Let's hurry.

479
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,590
The others.

480
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,200
How about everyone?

481
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,670
They're not done installing the explosives.

482
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,680
How about the others?

483
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,880
- Hey, did you hear the radio? 
 - Yes, I heard.

484
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,100
How could they be here so quickly?

485
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,460
What do you mean? We just have to do it faster!

486
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,600
Hey, go, go, go!

487
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,830
Are they already on the move?

488
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,180
This is weird...

489
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,150
What are you doing? Run!

490
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:08,070
Before the spheres arrive at the shelter, we have to make them come toward us.

491
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,940
How many more to go?

492
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,940
We still have quite a few left.

493
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,340
If we don't lure them now, the shelter will be attacked. They could probably cover this distance in 10 minutes.

494
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,000
Ten minutes...

495
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,120
We will wrap this up in ten minutes and move out.

496
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,080
Platoon 2, begin luring the spheres.

497
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,590
Yeong Su, can you do it?

498
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,200
Yes, I think it's possible.

499
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,330
We'll now begin Operation "Lure the Spheres."

500
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:55,340
 Everyone, wrap up what you're doing in 10 minutes and go to Seolbonggwan. 

501
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,180
What is he saying?

502
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,470
Shit!

503
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,920
Move, move! I'll do it!

504
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,630
Hurry!

505
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,480
We don't have time.

506
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,750
One, two, three.

507
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,590
Fuck! It's too loud!

508
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,000
Hey, my hands are trembling. This isn't working!

509
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,330
Hey, let me try!

510
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,350
Help me.

511
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,770
Is it not done yet? We have to go now.

512
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,420
Done, done!

513
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,880
- Hey, is it done? 
 - Yes.

514
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,760
Do I really do it?

515
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,340
- Do it! 
 - Shit!

516
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,670
What are you doing? Hurry up and break it!

517
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,070
They're almost here! Hurry!

518
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,580
Hey, where are the others?

519
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
We have to go!

520
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,510
Let's go! We have to go! Let's go!

521
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,240
Let's go!

522
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,230
Platoon Leader, we have to leave now.

523
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,080
I have to connect everything. I'm almost there.

524
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,810
We'll do the rest.

525
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,330
Wrap up the hall area.

526
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,900
Let's go.

527
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,350
I'll help you.

528
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,750
They started to swarm over this way.

529
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,680
Why aren't they coming?

530
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,650
- Bo Ra! 
 - Guys, where are the others?

531
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,610
Where? Where?

532
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,830
There are so freaking many!

533
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,670
We're fucked.

534
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,700
Platoon Leader, you have to leave now!

535
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,610
Run!

536
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,270
You guys go ahead.

537
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,570
Sergeant Kim!

538
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,030
I'll be right behind you. Be careful.

539
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,370
Class President, what are you doing? Hurry.

540
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,710
How many more to go?

541
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,580
We have a few more.

542
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,760
Fuck it...

543
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,080
We don't have time! Finish it now!

544
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,940
Hey, they went toward the main building, right?

545
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,830
I can't see them!

546
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,590
Hey, let's go down for now.

547
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,120
Seriously!

548
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,680
- What do we do? 
 - They can't be coming so fast like this.

549
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,950
Guys, come down!

550
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,580
Hey, what? What's going on?

551
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,940
Shit!

552
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,710
Go this way for now!

553
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,780
That way?

554
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,530
- Hey, what? 
 - What? Why are they going that way?

555
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,320
- Hey, just do this. Hurry. 
 - Shit!

556
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,980
Platoon Leader,

557
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,880
the spheres are nearby.

558
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,020
I'll wrap this up. Go to Seolbonggwan.

559
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,080
I'll help you.

560
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,000
The kids' safety comes first.

561
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,660
Take the kids. Hurry.

562
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,500
Please hurry up and come out.

563
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,350
Guys, let's go down first.

564
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,190
I don't want to. I won't go.

565
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,940
- Hurry and go. 
 - I don't want to.

566
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,030
Hurry!

567
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,980
I don't want to go!

568
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,180
Hurry and go!

569
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,040
I don't want to go!

570
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,610
Shit! Go! Go!

571
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,950
Hurry and go!

572
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,860
Hurry and go!

573
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,650
Shit. How many are there exactly?

574
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,000
Why are there so many?

575
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,640
More are coming.

576
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,050
Where is everyone else?

577
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,740
Oh?

578
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,750
Guys...

579
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,260
Let's go.

580
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,800
Let's go.

581
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,850
First of all, we get there safely.

582
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,940
Let's go.

583
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,950
Shit!

584
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,470
They should be here by now...

585
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,720
- Why aren't they here yet? 
 - Hey, hey, they're here!

586
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,680
Yeong Sin! Over here!

587
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,800
Yeong Sin...

588
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,520
Why is it only the two of you? How about the rest?

589
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,240
How about the rest of you? The rest...

590
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,290
Shit! What the hell?

591
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,310
Jo Jang Su, set up the computer.

592
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,320
How about Platoon Leader? Where is the platoon leader?

593
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,280
What happened?

594
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,240
Everyone...

595
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,200
until we hear from Platoon Leader,

596
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,750
we stand by here.

597
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,670
Why?

598
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,680
So Yeon, what happened?

599
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,550
So Yeon, where is the platoon leader?

600
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,400
Why isn't he coming?

601
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,490
Cha So Yeon.

602
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,850
Hey, what? What?

603
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,550
   

604
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,700
   

605
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,540
Platoon 2 of Seongjin High. This is your platoon leader speaking.

606
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,450
Platoon Leader.

607
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,530
 Begin... 

608
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,830
the detonation now.

609
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,060
What?

610
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,150
But you haven't left yet, Platoon Leader!

611
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm out. So detonate now.

612
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,180
You must detonate now to eliminate the spheres.

613
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:39,120
Platoon Leader, no. Get out now! Now!

614
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,120
Platoon Leader, I'll be right there.

615
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,360
 Do you all want to die now? 

616
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,130
 Kim Won Bin, come to your senses now. 

617
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,540
If you don't detonate now,

618
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,420
we all die.

619
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:04,560
No... No, Platoon Leader...

620
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:10,050
Please hurry and leave now! Please!

621
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,880
 Detonate now, Kim Won Bin. 

622
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,670
I can't get out of here anyway. Are you going to have me die in vain?

623
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,330
This is an order. Detonate now.

624
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,240
It looks like the spheres will leave the building soon.

625
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,810
At this rate, it's really going to be...

626
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,020
No...

627
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,920
 There is no other way. 

628
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,640
But you promised...

629
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,680
You said you'd protect us to the end.

630
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,600
 So, please hurry and get out of there!  

631
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,380
 Please! 

632
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,070
I'm sorry.

633
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:47,030
 For not keeping my promise  

634
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,090
 of keeping you safe to the end... 

635
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,110
 And... 

636
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:57,430
 for dragging you guys into this war as a grownup... 

637
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:10,710
I thought you guys were just a bunch of kids who wouldn't listen to me.

638
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,060
But now that I think about it,

639
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,870
I'm so grateful to you,

640
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,110
and I'm proud of you.

641
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,060
 Thanks to you guys, 

642
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,260
 I wasn't afraid of this war, 

643
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,840
 despite the fact that it seemed endless to me at times. 

644
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,790
 So trust and rely on friends who are next to you 

645
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,750
 to the very end, 

646
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,560
 and I hope you protect each other. 

647
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,290
And...

648
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,570
don't die.

649
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,810
That's my last command as your platoon leader.

650
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,910
Begin the detonation.

651
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,920
That's all.

652
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:48,910
Platoon Leader. Platoon Leader! Platoon Leader!

653
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:54,090
No! No... This isn't happening. No! No...

654
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,770
- Give it to me. 
 - No...

655
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,590
Let go of me!

656
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,260
Platoon Leader!

657
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,890
Platoon Leader...

658
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,570
What do we do now?

659
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,280
Please answer me.

660
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,420
Platoon Leader!

661
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,760
- Don't... 
 - Please don't

662
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,930
Don't!

663
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:24,040
- Don't! 
 - Fuck! Fuck!

664
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,590
   

665
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,820
