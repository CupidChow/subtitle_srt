1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,150
   

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:24,140


3
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,900
 What is this?  

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,080
 Things started falling all of a sudden. 

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,700
 And... and what happened? 

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,760
 Geez... 

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,190
 Oh, yes, did Deok Jung arrive all right? 

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,880
 What about Na Ra? 

9
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,890
Fuck, why are there no other trucks?

10
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,540
Geez, we can't be the only ones who escaped, right?

11
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,980
No way. The rest are probably following us.

12
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,860
I wonder if the shelters are okay.

13
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,260
Our parents are there.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,630
Mom...

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,410
Mom...

16
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,110
- Mom... 
 - Hey!

17
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,440
Hey, stop crying!

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,500
I can't stand it...

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,040
The others probably managed 
to get on the other trucks, right?

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
Sergeant Kim Won Bin, too.

21
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,250
Yes, they're probably all right.

22
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,030
They're probably all right.

23
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,870
I must be going crazy.

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm scared as shit. But I'm so sleepy.

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,930
Yes. Me, too.

26
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,420
Maybe it's because the tension is gone now.

27
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,970
 If I sleep and wake up, 

28
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,910
 I wish it would all turn out to be a dream. 

29
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,250
 What the hell! 

30
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,970
 What the heck? 

31
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,690
 Guys, get out! 

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,350
 Stop, it's dangerous! 

33
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,120
 Stop it, get out! 

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,260
- Shoot straight!  
 - Hurry!

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh my gosh!

36
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,910
My gosh!

37
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,050
Oh, gosh! Are you guys okay?

38
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,060
Is everyone all right?

39
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,260
Hey, what about So Yeon?

40
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,130
So Yeon!

41
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,340
So Yeon! Are you all right?

42
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,610
Get up slowly.

43
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,810
Hey, be careful.

44
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,390
Hold on to me. Carefully.

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,500
Sit here.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,630
- Are you okay? 
 - Let's see.

47
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,450
Oh my gosh!

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,560
You scared me!

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,140
It hurts! What do I do?

50
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,270
I think something's wrong with my leg.

51
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,220
- Let me see. 
 - It's bad, isn't it?

52
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,940
- Don't make such a fuss. 
 - It's only a graze.

53
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,090
It hurts though.

54
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,560
Will So Yeon be all right?

55
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,300
   

56
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,140
   

57
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,300
   

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,080
   

59
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,080
   

60
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,140
   

61
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,960
I don't have any, either.

62
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,610
- How about you? 
 - No, I don't, either.

63
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
Ouch, it hurts!

64
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,080
- I think she has a fever. 
 - Oh, no, what do we do?

65
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,330
Just bear with it for a little longer.

66
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,580
Hey, Jang Su.

67
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,440
How about the soldiers?

68
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,710
- They're dead. 
 - What?

69
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,530
Shit.

70
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,950
- What do we do? 
 - Then what do we do now?

71
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,630
What do you mean? 
We have to return to Seoul.

72
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,440
Hey, are you crazy?

73
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,850
You know we ran out of bullets! 
Do you want us to die?

74
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,530
What else can we do?

75
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,490
Where was the closest city? 
Shouldn't we head there?

76
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,690
- Seoraksan. 
 - Yes, Seoraksan.

77
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,240
There are soldiers there. 
It should be safer than Seoul.

78
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,580
Hey, Yeong Sin, how long will it take to Seoraksan?

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,460
We are about here. And we need to go there.

80
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,480
From here, it's about twenty kilometers away.

81
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,300
- Twenty kilometers? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

82
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,860
Shit!

83
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,150
Are you crazy? In this scorching heat? 
No way we can walk twenty kilometers!

84
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,450
Instead of getting lost on the way, 
we should just wait for the rescue team.

85
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,030
Yes, Guys, let's just wait.

86
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,670
Hey, so what if we get attacked while waiting?

87
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,510
What's the difference 
if we get attacked while walking?

88
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,610
And look, compared to Seoul, 
there aren't many of them out here.

89
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,930
There are no hints of fallen spheres here either.

90
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,910
What's going on? How come Seoul has them 
and this place doesn't?

91
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,290
Is it because people don't live here?

92
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,350
- I wonder why. 
 - I can't go. I'll wait here.

93
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,770
Hey, Guys, when we were coming earlier,

94
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,910
there wasn't a single car on the road. 
Wouldn't it be better for us to just go to Seoraksan?

95
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,400
Man, you guys are so stupid! 
Just stay here, idiots!

96
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,720
Shit! Hey, if the rescue team doesn't show up, 
what are you going to do then?

97
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,100
- That fucking— 
 - Guys, I think we have to go somewhere we can rest.

98
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,600
- So Yeon doesn't look too good. 
 - Fuck.

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,740
Hey, look around you! Where can we rest?

100
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,820
It's okay, I can walk. Let's go.

101
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,420
- Hey! 
 - Oh, no!

102
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,280
I dressed her wound, but it's pretty bad. 
She needs treatment soon.

103
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,740
- Then on the way we can look for— 
 - Fuck!

104
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,750
Hey! Do you guys only know 
what you learned in the books?

105
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,230
Do you even know what's in the area?

106
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,550
Are you just going to roam around?

107
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,030
Yes.

108
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,900
Hui Rak is right. There's no specific town 
indicated on the map, and

109
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,150
it's better to stay put when we don't know anything.

110
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,690
That's right. Only Yeong Sin gets it.

111
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,550
Just stay put, Shitheads!

112
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,610
We saw today

113
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,890
what happened to our friends.

114
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,100
I don't want any of us to be in danger.

115
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,540
I don't want to lose anyone.

116
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,390
For now, let's search the area.

117
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,470
Starting now, let's just look for thirty minutes,

118
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,560
and if there's nothing,

119
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,490
let's make a decision then.

120
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,920
All right, then I'll go over there first.

121
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,650
- Then I'm going over there. 
 - Yes? I'll go here.

122
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,240
- I'll look with Tae Man. 
 - Hey, I'll go with you.

123
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,920
Hey! Since when did you all work together as a team?

124
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,970
Okay, you and Yeong Sin stay here to guard the area.

125
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,750
- What's going on? 
 - It looks like the first truck hasn't arrived yet.

126
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,560
Is everyone all right?

127
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,710
What about the first truck? 
Didn't they leave before us?

128
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,260
Did you see?

129
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,590
Why aren't they here yet?

130
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,530
You don't think something happened, do you?

131
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,400
They should have all arrived by now.

132
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,440
Something must have happened to them.

133
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,810
Can't be... They'll probably arrive soon.

134
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,700
- You saw it, too. While getting on— 
 - Hey!

135
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,460
Yu Ha Na!

136
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,680
From this point, you will remain in your encampment 
until there's a special order.

137
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,520
What about the others?

138
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,280
We don't have any news yet.

139
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,570
What do you mean, no news? 
They should have arrived by now!

140
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,830
Nothing probably happened, so don't worry. 
Let's just wait a bit longer.

141
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,280
- How much longer? 
 - Hey!

142
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,700
You should have fucking let us go 
when we asked to go.

143
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,860
- Fuck! 
 - Kwon Il Ha!

144
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,060
- What? 
 - Hey, that's enough.

145
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,450
If it wasn't for Platoon Leader,

146
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,410
we would not have survived this far.

147
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,970
Platoon Leader,

148
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:37,410
please make sure the others arrive safely.

149
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,740
Please.

150
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,900
Everyone, rest up.

151
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,270
Fuck!

152
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,590
I'm hungry and tired.

153
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,870
I really hate everything. Hate everything!

154
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,910
- There's nothing. 
 - Nothing here either.

155
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,930
Guys!

156
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,350
Is there anything?

157
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,330
Yes, there is.

158
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,920
Where?

159
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,460
There.

160
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,040
- Hey! Really?

161
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,720
Are you okay?

162
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,710
I'll carry So Yeon.

163
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm fine. I can walk on my own.

164
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,320
Your wound will get worse. Let him carry you.

165
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm okay.

166
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,160
I'll walk as much as I can.

167
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,940
I'll leave her to you.

168
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,430
- I'll help. 
 - Hold her on your side.

169
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,060
Let's go.

170
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,430
Wait a second.

171
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,910
- Aren't you coming? 
 - I want to, but...

172
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,260
It hurts too much to walk.

173
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,180
Hey! Stop whining.

174
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,710
I'm serious. It really hurts.

175
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,700
Then I'll carry Sun Yi.

176
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,030
Hey, a scrawny guy like you can't carry her.

177
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,800
Ouch...

178
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,180
Okay, get on.

179
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,650
Thank you.

180
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm a little heavy.

181
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,450
Let's go.

182
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,100
Going?

183
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,310
Hey, are we going?

184
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,100
Those crazy bastards.

185
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,620
Hey!

186
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,960
You're going to stay here, right?

187
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,030
Hey, I'm going with you!

188
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,340
No, we absolutely cannot do that!

189
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,120
It's wartime right now!

190
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,640
Transportation vehicles during wartime 
are just as valuable as soldiers.

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
We can't make exceptions 
due to personal reasons.

192
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,800
It's not personal.

193
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,700
Our platoon members seem to be missing.

194
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,280
I ask for permission to look for them.

195
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,900
First Lieutenant Lee, take a look outside.

196
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,320
It's not just your platoon. 
There are countless student reserve forces

197
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,980
that haven't arrived yet.

198
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,920
None of the Jeonnong High kids made it here.

199
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,230
Rather than risking more lives, 
just take care of the ones that are here.

200
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,850
I'm certain they are alive!

201
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,740
Please.

202
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,510
I beg you.

203
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,640
Later, you will thank me.

204
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,730
How did it go?

205
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,390
Then what should we do?

206
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,260
- Won Bin... 
 - Yes.

207
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,420
How much do you trust me?

208
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,290
I trust you even if you told me you could make a great hamburger out of nothing.

209
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,510
Thank you.

210
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,670
- I have a difficult favor to ask of you. 
 - I told you I trust you.

211
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,490
Not a favor.

212
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,190
Just give me the command.

213
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,480
Ouch...

214
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,370
Geez, this sucks!

215
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,470
Kim Chi Yeol! Fuck! Where is it?

216
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,840
Did you even see it?

217
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,610
Definitely. It's around here somewhere.

218
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,890
Yes, so where is it, you idiot?

219
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,660
Well, I ran back earlier, but

220
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,990
I'm sure it's around here.

221
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,220
Oh, that fucking idiot! 
We shouldn't have listened to him!

222
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,700
Wu Hui Rak, that's enough. We are all tired.

223
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,330
Yes, that's what I'm saying, Dummies!

224
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,300
We would have been fine if we just stayed put!

225
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,690
If you had listened to me, 
we would have been rescued by now!

226
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,010
Fuck!

227
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,410
It's there!

228
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,970
- Where? 
 - Over there!

229
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,620
There!

230
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,410
Oh, my gosh, we're safe!

231
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,610
What a relief!

232
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,200
Thank goodness!

233
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,180
Guys, there are rooms here, 
so we can have So Yeon lie down.

234
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,920
We're here.

235
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,180
Be careful on the stairs.

236
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,840
For now, lie down here.

237
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,070
Take this.

238
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,290
I'll help her.

239
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,400
So Yeon, just a moment.

240
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you.

241
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,900
It's nothing.

242
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,390
What?

243
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,350
She's got high fever.

244
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,610
Bring me clean water 
and something to dress her wound.

245
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,040
I'll go.

246
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,600
Me, too.

247
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Oh, and see if there's any disinfectant 
or fever medicine too. Anything you find.

248
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,960
Okay. I'll look for them.

249
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,820
Let's see if there are any food 
or other items we can use.

250
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,420
Yes.

251
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Liquid nitrogen.

252
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,800
   

253
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,580
Why do I have to do this?

254
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,620
It's just full of junk here.

255
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,210
Do you think the others arrived safely?

256
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,800
I hope we can see them soon.

257
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,750
Hey, Su Cheol, you've been quiet for a while.

258
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,380
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

259
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,310
The others should be alive, right?

260
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,530
Hey, of course! Why do you ask such a question?

261
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,780
Wu Taek.

262
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,580
What?

263
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,560
We couldn't save Wu Taek.

264
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,360
What do you mean? Wasn't he in the second truck?

265
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,140
Wu Taek...

266
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,100
We just left him there.

267
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,360
No way.

268
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,370
Wu Taek is dead?

269
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,020
Oh, come on!

270
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,720
There must be something.

271
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,170
Hey! Did you find anything?

272
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,790
No, there's nothing.

273
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,420
What the heck.

274
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,980
I found it!

275
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,550
Look!

276
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,790
Sorry, I know it hurts. Hang in there.

277
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,600
Here, take it.

278
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,700
I'm cold.

279
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,800
She's burning up.

280
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,080
We need some kind of fever medicine.

281
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,740
This looks like cold medicine.

282
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,660
   

283
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,220
So Yeon, take this fever medicine for now.

284
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,720
Looks like this was used as a construction office.

285
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
All we have is water.

286
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,050
I found some blankets.

287
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,680
I think we can use it to carry So Yeon.

288
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,280
I found something important. 
Most crucial thing at night.

289
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,020
Wow, what is it?

290
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,800
Mosquito killer.

291
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,200
Geez. Mountain mosquitos are terrible.

292
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,840
I'm hungry.

293
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,480
There's nothing to eat. Fuck.

294
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,110
We will starve to death at this point.

295
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,140
Where are you going?

296
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,160
To the bathroom.

297
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,440
Right. Even if we share this, we'll all be hungry.

298
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,930
It's better that at least one person is full.

299
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,550
Right.

300
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,600
- What? 
 - I'm sorry.

301
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,630
This isn't your first time!

302
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,390
Organize this properly again.

303
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,760
Yes, Sir.

304
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,470
Attention.

305
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,400
   

306
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,810
Hey, Park Jin Su!

307
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,340
What a small world!

308
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,520
Who are..

309
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,450
Hey man, we were classmates!

310
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,760
From where?

311
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,260
Nonsan. Nonsan.

312
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,960
Nonsan?

313
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,050
I'm from Chuncheon.

314
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,470
Nonsan...

315
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,690
we used to talk about 
how comfortable it would've been.

316
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,250
Oh, man, I'm hurt 
you don't even remember your classmate! Really!

317
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,190
Don't you remember?

318
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,940
 That's right! 

319
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,560
You wanted to eat choco pies, so

320
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,780
you even switched to Catholicism! Don't you remember?

321
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,950
I remember.

322
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,260
Yes, that's right, Man!

323
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,360
You scared me!

324
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,420
- Hey, have you been well? 
 - Yes.

325
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,990
Man, it's so good to see you!

326
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,390
Hey, let's sit down!

327
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,820
Wow, it's really good to see you!

328
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,610
But did your guys all arrive okay?

329
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,780
Yes, they all did.

330
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,160
Why? Your guys didn't?

331
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,060
Not yet.

332
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,410
We are still waiting.

333
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,960
They'll get here. Just wait a bit longer.

334
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,390
- Thanks, Man. 
 - Hold on a second.

335
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,060
This is Platoon Sergeant Park Jin Su.

336
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,640
Yes.

337
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes. I'm preparing it now.

338
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,780
Yes.

339
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,980
I'll have it ready by 13:00.

340
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,510
Yes.

341
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,720
Yes, I'll do that.

342
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,880
Oh my gosh!

343
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,890
You're still in great shape!

344
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,710
Of course, I still work out.

345
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah, keep it up!

346
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,660
Okay, I'll see you later.

347
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,600
Hey, wait.

348
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,820
Why?

349
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Do you have some cigarettes?

350
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,500
I quit.

351
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,010
Stop lying to me.

352
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,140
No, really.

353
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,200
Wait a second.

354
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
Show me your hand.

355
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,390
Huh?

356
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,860
Oh, wow, you really don't smoke!

357
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes, I said I don't smoke.

358
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,500
Maybe next time.

359
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,370
- I'll go now. 
 - See you.

360
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,390
Take care, Man.

361
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,370
If transportation vehicles are stolen during wartime,

362
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,180
do you know what the punishment is?

363
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,870
Execution.

364
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,110
I know that much, Dude.

365
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,560
I'll be back.

366
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,860
I'll come with you.

367
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,220
Forget it.

368
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,930
If I get executed, I'll need someone 
to take care of my dog tags.

369
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,500
- Hyeongnim! 
 - Oh my gosh!

370
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,100
What the hell is wrong with you?

371
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,370
Where is the platoon leader going?

372
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,200
He's not going out to get some food.

373
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,600
Shit, mind your own business!

374
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,310
At least look presentable and button up.

375
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,480
T-This.

376
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,660
Let's go.

377
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,460
Be honest. What did you eat over there?

378
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,550
Something good?

379
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,850
Hey, Guys, come here!

380
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,410
I think the platoon leader went to save the others.

381
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,920
- Really? 
 - Yes.

382
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,900
He told us to wait until a special order is made.

383
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
But why else would he leave?

384
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,090
The platoon leader thinks the same thing 
we are thinking.

385
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,200
I also think Chi Yeol and the group 
are in the mountains.

386
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,850
Of course, they're still alive. 
Why are you stating the obvious?

387
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,940
Right? That's why

388
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,180
I'm following the platoon leader.

389
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,510
Hey! Are you c-crazy? Aren't you scared?

390
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,670
Of course, I am!

391
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,330
But if it was Chi Yeol, he would have come for us 
no matter what.

392
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,620
I'm going, too.

393
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,090
Doing nothing and just waiting here is so frustrating.

394
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,180
Hey, Lee Na Ra!

395
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,230
- Grab my rifle too. 
 - Hey!

396
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,020
Shit.

397
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,180
Hey, No Ae Seol.

398
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,260
You can't even take care of yourself. 
What are you doing? Just stay here.

399
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm going, too.

400
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,030
Wait! Let's think about this more rationally.

401
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,600
If they were alive, 
they would have arrived already. And

402
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,030
what if, while going to rescue them, we get caught?

403
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,940
So what if we get caught?

404
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,080
What?

405
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,530
- Then we could all receive penalty points! 
 - Hey, Idiot.

406
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,190
Do you still think there will be entrance exams 
in this situation?

407
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,190
They never said it was canceled. We probably will.

408
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,960
You guys know we can't get into 
the university we want with penalty points.

409
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,250
Forget it. What did I expect from you?

410
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm going.

411
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,010
Me, too!

412
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,960
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm not going.

413
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,530
Why?

414
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,490
Kimchi, pass me the wrench.

415
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,280
- Hey, 
 - What?

416
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,250
What are you thinking about?

417
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,780
Nothing.

418
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,870
What is it?

419
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,290
It seems the people who were here left in a hurry.

420
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,920
I saw in the warehouse 
that they didn't even take the delivery van.

421
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,330
Fucking idiot! Why are you mentioning that only now?

422
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,750
Then we can just ride the van.

423
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,660
Hey, what are you talking about? 
Who's going to drive?

424
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,710
I can.

425
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,680
You don't even know how to ride a motorcycle.

426
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,870
Hey, I can ride it better than Kwon Il Ha.

427
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,940
Yes, right, Idiot.

428
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,880
We don't know what's going to happen, 
so I'll save some.

429
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,010
What's the commotion?

430
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,210
- Fuck! 
 - Oh, shit!

431
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,420
A sphere!

432
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Hey, behind you!

433
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,080
Help!

434
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,250
Go inside!

435
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,800
- Go inside! 
 - Watch out! Behind you!

436
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,810
Behind you! Oh, shit!

437
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,450
Run, run!

438
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,650
Run! Quickly, go inside!

439
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,980
Hey, get up!

440
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,430
Go, go!

441
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,650
Close the door!

442
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,610
Let's move this over!

443
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,060
- Shit! 
 - Push harder!

444
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,230
- Go help them! 
 - Why do I have to do it?

445
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,450
Oh, Shit!

446
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,490
They're coming through up there!

447
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,670
Hurry, hurry!

448
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,230
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - Oh no!

449
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,230
What do we do?

450
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,740
Don't worry.

451
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,940
The windows!

452
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,010
Yeon Ju! Check the other window!

453
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,630
Okay!

454
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,630
Are you okay?

455
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,280
Yes, I'm okay.

456
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,070
Are the windows holding up?

457
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,810
Yes, they seem to be okay.

458
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,720
Hui Rak! Hui Rak! Hold here!

459
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,380
Why is it moving around like that?

460
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,070
Fuck, there are two of them.

461
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,090
Let's check.

462
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,160
Oh my gosh!

463
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,720
I think it's better to check.

464
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,740
There seems to be one.

465
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,260
What are you guys doing here?

466
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,890
- We heard you're going to look for the others. 
 - I'm going to look for them.

467
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,860
So you guys go back.

468
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,680
Do you know what happens if you get caught?

469
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,150
We'll probably receive penalty points.

470
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,110
But what about you?

471
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,890
Hey, do you know what happens in a situation like this?

472
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,790
At the minimum, execution.

473
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,990
Let's go. It seems too late to turn back now.

474
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,980
Aigo!

475
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,090
What is this?

476
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,610
The thing is...

477
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,240
Hey, Hong Jun Hui! Did you eat ramen?

478
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,210
I didn't eat anything all day!

479
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,040
Are you crazy? You're not the only hungry one here!

480
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,190
Hey, did you attract that thing 
while sneaking off to go eat by yourself?

481
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,670
- Let go! 
 - That's enough.

482
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,180
How we're going to get out of here 
is more important.

483
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,530
I'm sorry.

484
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,620
That thing was pretty active earlier, 
but why is it suddenly so quiet?

485
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,470
Maybe... this is only a guess, but...

486
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,580
Maybe it knows we can't escape 
through the secured windows.

487
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,200
What?

488
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,570
Think about it.

489
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,470
We can't go out the windows, 
so it's waiting outside the only possible exit.

490
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,510
No way, it can't be that perceptive.

491
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,190
Aren't they unicellular organisms?

492
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,690
We don't know anything about them.

493
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,500
Their intelligence level, where they come from,

494
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,160
or why they came here.

495
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,880
One thing for sure is that 
they respond to sounds.

496
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,580
So Yeon.

497
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,740
So Yeon!

498
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,790
What's wrong?

499
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,350
The wound got infected, and her fever returned.

500
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,290
I think something terrible will happen 
if she doesn't get treated quickly.

501
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:28,510
Hey, let's just take the delivery van 
rather than sit around here.

502
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,660
Fuck, what am I even saying...

503
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,170
What are you doing?

504
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,980
We have to tell the others.

505
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,650
Like you said, we should escape 
using the delivery van.

506
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,750
I'm just saying. I don't actually mean it.

507
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,510
Then what? We just watch 
So Yeon suffering like that?

508
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,090
Chi Yeol.

509
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,690
Be careful.

510
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,160
I will.

511
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,090
Hui Rak, close the door as soon as I go out.

512
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,650
Hey.

513
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,980
Are you really going to be okay?

514
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,360
I'll be fine.

515
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,740
   

516
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,690
Hey, Jang Su!

517
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,270
Jang Su!

518
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,570
How did you get out?

519
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,380
Is that Chi Yeol?

520
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,450
How did he get here?

521
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,490
So Yeon's condition is really bad right now.

522
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,030
So we were thinking,

523
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,200
how about if we escape with the delivery van?

524
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,660
Chi Yeol, do you think 
you can open this from your side?

525
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,990
This...

526
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,310
Oh gosh!

527
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,110
No, I don't think I can.

528
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,950
- Yes, you'll need a tool. 
 - A tool?

529
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,780
Got it. Let me look for one.

530
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,190
Hey!

531
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,880
Be careful.

532
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,340
Okay. Don't worry.

533
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,390
Is this a good idea?

534
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,920
We have to try anything we can. We can't just stay locked in here.

535
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,230
That punk!

536
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,860
- What's going on? 
 - Oh gosh!

537
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,470
Oh gosh, what if something happened?

538
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,880
What's that?

539
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,520
What's going on?

540
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,520
Hey, Guys! Guys! Retreat!

541
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,600
Guys!

542
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,370
Retreat!

543
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,380
Open the door!

544
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,310
Hurry, hurry!

545
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,250
- Open it! 
 - Shit!

546
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,460
- Run! Quickly! 
 - Oh my gosh!

547
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,510
Chi Yeol's coming!

548
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,300
What's going on? Fuck!

549
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,300
What the hell do you think? Fuck!

550
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,600
Run fast! Hurry!

551
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,840
Get in! Hurry!

552
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,600
Come on, hurry!

553
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,450
Hey! Get in!

554
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,880
What's going on? What is it?

555
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,650
You saw the whole thing, too! Fuck!

556
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,600
But is Chi Yeol all right?

557
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,850
Guys,

558
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,890
this would work, right?

559
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,770
Kimchi, you were way freaking faster than usual!

560
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,540
Guys, let's get ready to leave.

561
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,040
Wait a minute.

562
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,820
We have to make that thing outside 
think we are still in here.

563
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,820
- What? 
 - What the...

564
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,040
What do you mean?

565
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
What is he doing?

566
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,420
I don't know.

567
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,250
What's this?

568
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,110
I thought that only happened in the movies.

569
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,770
Hey, how does the movie end again?

570
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:30,540
They kill the monster and win, right?

571
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,030
Right?

572
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,450
I don't know. I haven't seen the movie.

573
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,110
Yes.

574
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,450
You're right, but...

575
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,700
the daughter they tried to rescue

576
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,110
dies in the end.

577
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,710
"She dies"?

578
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,690
I can't believe she dies.

579
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,390
Hey, move this.

580
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,600
They're here.

581
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,340
Come out quickly!

582
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,480
- Let's go together. We'll go ahead and wait.  
 - What?

583
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,550
Tae Man!

584
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,310
Be careful.

585
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,050
It's coming out through the pipe!

586
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,020
What's going on?

587
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,720
- Run, run! 
 - Run!

588
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,940
- I said run! 
 - Fuck!

589
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,160
Go, go, go!

590
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,000
You guys go ahead!

591
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,450
- Oh my gosh! 
 - Just go!

592
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,080
Go! Hurry and go!!

593
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,230
- Oh my gosh! 
 - Run!

594
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,310
Let's do it together!

595
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,080
You can let it out this way!

596
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,340
Come with us!

597
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,170
- What's going on? 
 - Oh my gosh!

598
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,330
Run! Fast!

599
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,180
It's coming! It's coming!

600
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,910
Hey, help me with So Yeon!

601
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,050
Careful, careful!

602
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,900
Die, die!

603
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,030
Let's go!

604
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,440
Come over here, you bastard!

605
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,530
- Over here! 
 - Oh, no, no!

606
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,730
Here, on this side!

607
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,690
Right behind you!

608
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,040
Oh, okay!

609
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,960
What about the others?

610
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,980
Hurry, hurry!

611
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,920
Chi Yeol! Where are Tae Man and Su Cheol?

612
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,180
I don't know. They must be still over there 
trying to stop the sphere from coming out.

613
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,920
Come here! Over here!

614
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,280
Shit!

615
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,960
So Yeon, stay with me.

616
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,280
Why aren't they coming?

617
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,920
What do we do?

618
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,530
Fuck!

619
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,770
Get up!

620
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,020
Where are they?

621
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,260
- They're coming! 
 - Hurry, hurry!

622
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,650
Faster! Faster!

623
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,230
- Come in, quickly! 
 - Hurry, hurry!

624
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,040
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

625
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:39,430
- Is this it? 
 - Awesome!

626
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,520
Fuck! We'll be here all night!

627
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,550
- It's not it? 
 - Fuck!

628
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,810
Hey! This! This is it, right?

629
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,500
Okay, okay!

630
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,360
- Okay! 
 - All right!

631
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,870
Fuck! We're screwed!

632
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,550
- Why? 
 - It's stick shift!

633
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,340
What does that mean?

634
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,860
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

635
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,680
Look, over there!

636
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,660
Shit...

637
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:26,200
What are you guys doing in there?

638
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,750
Hey! We have to leave now!

639
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,280
- You said you know how to drive! 
 - Oh, shit!

640
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,500
It's different from my dad's car!

641
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,790
- What? 
 - Fuck! What are we supposed to do?

642
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,480
Seriously...

643
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,010
Move, I'll try!

644
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,630
- Do you even know how? 
 - Of course, I do! Give it!

645
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,250
- Do you really know how? 
 - Yes, hand it over!

646
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,830
- Hey! 
 - Oh, no!

647
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,450
- Hey, hey! 
 - Shit!

648
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,720
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

649
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,050
Move over!

650
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,810
We can get it.

651
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,570
Just a little more!

652
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,660
Push one more time!

653
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,630
- Not budging? 
 - No.

654
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:14,890
Fuck! Let's just run!

655
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,510
We can't. You'll get hurt running 
with So Yeon on your back.

656
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,620
Exactly! So why the hell did you butt in?

657
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,500
You're the one who fucked us over, Idiot!

658
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,740
Our family runs a driving school!

659
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,430
Oh, my gosh! Look over there!

660
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:41,920
If that gets inside, we're all dead. 
The only way we can survive now is

661
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,900
to leave So Yeon behind.

662
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,090
- What? 
 - What?

663
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,190
- Hey, are you crazy? 
 - Yes, I know!

664
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:53,280
There's no one here who wants to do that!

665
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,880
It's all my fault...

666
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,370
I'm sorry, Guys.

667
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,850
No, no, it's not because of you. It's okay.

668
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:14,660
Then one of us should cause a distraction,

669
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,300
and the rest of us will escape in this van. 
That's the only way.

670
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,980
What if that person gets caught?

671
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,340
It's too dangerous.

672
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,180
Jang Su! Jang Su!

673
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,770
- Oh my gosh! 
 - Oh no!

674
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,730
This is...

675
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,380
the best option we have, 
so we won't regret it later.

676
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,710
Fuck! Just pick already!

677
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,170
Everyone, show what you have.

678
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,630
Hui Rak.

679
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,260
Wu Hui Rak.

680
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,860
I think it's me.

681
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,520
I'm going.

682
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,630
Jang Su!

683
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,180
Hey!

684
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,980
What are you guys all doing? Open it.

685
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:19,120


686
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,100
Jang Su.

687
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,620
Be safe.

688
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,930
   

689
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,660
 You can start. 
   

690
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,510
 I'm healthy and well. 

691
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,210
 Mom and Dad, I hope you're well, too. 

692
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,160
Wait a minute! That's it?

693
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,580
Yes.

694
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,650
It's too short.

695
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,720
Don't you have anything more to say?

696
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,800
Thanks to you, Dad, 
I'm doing well in the military training.

697
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,540
That's right, your dad is a career military officer, right?

698
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,120
Then... did he give you any advice for your training?

699
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,850
When my dad drinks, there's one thing he always says.

700
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:24,090
You know how during military nuclear operations, 
soldiers wear gas masks.

701
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,430
In order to find out if the nuclear operation is over,

702
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,090
you have to remove the gas mask 
of one of the soldiers.

703
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,860
Really?

704
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,060
That must be a tough decision.

705
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:39,360
But if you're the leader, 
you're not supposed to hesitate.

706
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,570
You can't contemplate who is better than whom.

707
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,810
Whatever decision he makes, 
he must play the bad guy.

708
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:51,080
Ever since I heard that, 
I realized I couldn't be the leader,

709
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,540
unless I was heartless 
like Jo Yeong Sin or something.

710
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,240
Then...

711
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,590
What do you think you would do 
in that position as a leader?

712
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,410
I'm not sure.

713
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,090
 I guess I have no choice 
but to be the bad guy. 

714
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:12,730
   

715
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:21,980
♫  I realized a world is all alone  ♫

716
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:28,410
♫  I want to night, I am on my own  ♫

717
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:34,030
♫  And here we are, fighting for our lives  ♫

718
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:39,640
♫  We deserve, we'd die for  ♫

719
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:46,820
♫  Deep inside in the darkness  ♫

720
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:52,360
♫  I fall apart slowly  ♫

721
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:59,540
♫  Like a bird in the sky  ♫

722
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:06,850
♫  I want to feel alive  ♫

723
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:14,040
♫  I want the stars to fall   ♫

724
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:20,610
♫  I know we've got to try and stand tall  ♫

725
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:27,060
♫  Everything is sweeter, 
not that all my hopes are gone now  ♫

726
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:34,220
♫  I feel the light inside fading  ♫

727
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,720
♫  Somehow  ♫

728
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:45,100
♫  I tell myself, one day you'll find  ♫

729
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:51,630
♫  What you've been praying for all day in your mind  ♫

730
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:57,230
♫  I'm not afraid, getting over it one more time  ♫

731
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:02,820
♫  That we deserve, we could die for  ♫

732
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:10,000
♫  Deep inside, when it's over  ♫

733
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,570
♫  I fall apart slowy  ♫

734
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:22,780
♫  Like a window  ♫

735
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,740
♫  I want to feel alive  ♫
