1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,840
   

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,620
You heard that, right?

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,660
- Those were gunshots, right? 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,380
I think so. Do you think something happened?

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,450
Let's go outside first.

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,520
We'll find out once we go outside.

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,450
Hey, Jo Jang Su!

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,100
No!

9
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,440
Hey! Hey!

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,600
That bastard!

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,850
Hey!

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,900
Oh! That scared me!

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,710
What is this bastard?

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,470
I don't know.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,160
- I'm not going. 
 - Hey, hurry and come out.

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,370
No, I don't want to.

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,580
Gosh, hurry and come out! The exit is here.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm not going.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
- Damn it. 
 - Don't go.

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,920
Seriously...

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,540
Gosh, seriously.

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,830
Guk Yeong Su!

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,180
Hey!

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,470
Let go of me, you bastard.

25
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,480
Hey, try it with your hand.

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,090
My hand?

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,760
That tickles!

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Gosh, that tickles!

29
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,740
Hey, hey! What's going on?

30
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,430
That bastard is really strong!

31
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,790
What's going on?

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,740
Hurry, hurry!

33
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,910
Hurry and get in the car!

34
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,190
Hey! No, no!

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,690
No! No, you can't!

36
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Hey, hey. I caught it!

37
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,790
Oh, oh! Help me!

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,570
Come on!

39
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,030
Il Ha, Il Ha!

40
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,100
Gosh, fuck!

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,800
What is this?

42
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,710
Hey!

43
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,790
Gosh, damn it!

44
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,510
Oh, no!

45
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,880
Damn it!

46
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,820
Go away, you son of a bitch!

47
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,100
Gosh!

48
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,410
We caught it.

49
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,100
Hey.

50
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,780
Let's go.

51
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,030
I said, let's go!

52
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Hey, hurry!

53
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,480
One, two, three!

54
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,470
Hey, hurry!

55
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,300
Platoon Leader!

56
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,800
Hurry and go now! Hurry and go!

57
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,210
Hurry!

58
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,500
Over there! Over there!

59
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,200
What about Jo Jang Su?

60
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Two, three!

61
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,270
- Hurry and go. 
 - Wu Taek!

62
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,610
Hurry and shoot it already! Hurry up and shoot!

63
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,800
- The gun won't shoot! 
 - What are you talking about?

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,950
The gun won't shoot, you son of a bitch!

65
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,570
The gun won't shoot!

66
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,330
- Why is it not working! 
 -  Come on, you son of a bitch!

67
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,970
Gosh, damn it!

68
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,120
Whoever it is, hurry!

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,410
Platoon Leader...

70
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,700
Are you guys all right?

71
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,010
Let's go now.

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,040


73
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,740
What should we...

74
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,360
   

75
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,650
Oh, no...

76
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,970
We asked the units in the vicinity to recover bodies.

77
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,890
Did you distribute ammunition to them?

78
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,310
I gave them three rounds each.

79
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,860
What you guys saw today

80
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,820
was what happens when the spheres fall from the sky and split up.

81
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,230
Those miniature spheres attack human beings

82
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,670
and eat them.

83
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,000
The reason you guys receive training

84
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,690
is to eliminate those spheres.

85
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,110
Fuck.

86
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,710
So...

87
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,540
Prepare to fire.

88
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,230
What are you doing, So Yeon? Prepare to fire.

89
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,620
I will throw a helmet in front of us and when the miniature sphere attacks, we will shoot it all at once.

90
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,300
Do you understand?

91
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,500
Don't shoot!

92
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,480
Cease fire!

93
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,210
Hey.

94
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,920
Ae Seol.

95
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,600
Hey, Wu Hui Rak!

96
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,780
Hey, are you all right?

97
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,890
Are you not hurt anywhere?

98
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,330
Are you okay?

99
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,990
Hey, are you okay?

100
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,000
We were worried about you!

101
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,260
Where have you been?

102
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,560
Recruit No Ae Seol...

103
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,110
It's okay now.

104
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,380
Hurry and move!

105
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,150
Move quickly.

106
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,070
Quickly and accurately.

107
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,340
- Go stand over there. 
 - Hurry up and move!

108
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,650
Get through the training course quickly.

109
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,530
Why aren't you moving?

110
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,370
What's wrong with them?

111
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,200
Didn't they go practice shooting?

112
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,580
What happened?

113
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,360
I guess they got hurt badly.

114
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,950
What happened?

115
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,920
Sit down.

116
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,990
The search officially ends today. Great work.

117
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,200
What will happen from now on?

118
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,460
Either you'll be transferred to another unit, or you can be dismissed early from the military if you want.

119
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,870
That's not what I mean. I'm asking about the spheres.

120
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,370
It will be DEFCON 1 wartime situation. 
  (T/N: Defense readiness condition. 1 is the highest alert state) 

121
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,190
Of course, the government will enact martial law,

122
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,720
and the reserve forces and civilian defense personnel will also be called in.

123
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,730
Even third-year high school students may be drafted.

124
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,880
Even students?

125
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,560
One sphere decimated one army unit.

126
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,120
Imagine what would happen if all the spheres in the sky fell.

127
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,770
We're ridiculously short on people to fight.

128
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,890
But they're still only students. Will they accept this?

129
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,250
We will have to make them accept it.

130
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,280
High school seniors

131
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,460
have the entrance tests to think about, don't they?

132
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,890
They will never be able to take the entrance tests.

133
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,230
You know that very well, Major.

134
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,650
They will all be slaughtered.

135
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,900
They will die even if they don't do anything.

136
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,650
I'm saying we should at least hand them a gun.

137
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:21,070
I'm not saying this so we can kill one of them, but so we can save at least one of them.

138
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:39,030


139
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,070
   

140
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,840
   

141
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,490
   

142
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,010
   

143
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,270
   

144
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,260
   

145
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,230
- Where are you going?  
 - Go inside!

146
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,630
What are you doing? Go inside!

147
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,780
Hey, go inside!

148
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,970
Go inside! Hurry and go inside.

149
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,170
 Hurry and run inside! 

150
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,860
This is...

151
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,210
not a dream, right now, right?

152
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,150
Ms. Eun Yeong and...

153
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,820
they really...

154
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,720
they really...

155
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
I'm sorry.

156
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,690
I didn't intentionally not open the car door.

157
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,850
I was just scared.

158
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,930
Forget it. I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

159
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

160
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,010
I will go home.

161
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,300
I can't stay here any longer.

162
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,860
So Yun.

163
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,250
I want to go home, too.

164
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,800
Fuck! They're trying to make us fight those things!

165
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,850
You're right. I want to go home, too.

166
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,050
Hey, stop acting like children.

167
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,770
Forget college or bonus points for the CSAT! I don't need any of that.

168
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,750
Think first before you act,

169
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
instead of just packing your bags first.

170
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,670
Forget it. I want to leave, too.

171
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,870
I will go, too.

172
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,750
Don't go.

173
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,410
Hey, hey! Why are you also acting like this?

174
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,650
Sit down.

175
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,480
It's the ajeossi.

176
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,060
Sit down!

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,230
First, everyone, take a seat.

178
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,250
It's dangerous outside.

179
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,270
The safest place right now is here in this school.

180
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,520
"Safe"?

181
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,010
Supposedly, our homeroom teacher and Yeong Hun are both dead.

182
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,360
Is this what you call safe?

183
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,060
Having someone else protect you is not what's safe.

184
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,490
You need to be able to protect yourself.

185
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,750
In this school, that is what we're training you to do.

186
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,200
You've seen us. We can't even shoot a gun properly, so how could we?

187
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,160
How could we protect ourselves?

188
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,670
Just send us home.

189
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,250
We'll just stay home without going anywhere. Then we should be fine.

190
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,930
Just let us go home. I want to go home.

191
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,630
All right.

192
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,670
Let's say that you guys went home.

193
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
But what if those spheres attack your home?

194
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,990
Then what will you do?

195
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,750
Today's night training will proceed as scheduled.

196
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,710
What?

197
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,000
Everyone, prepare your equipment and get ready.

198
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,500
Damn it.

199
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,990
Fuck!

200
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,630
Platoon Leader talks like that,

201
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,300
but there are probably still people who want to go home.

202
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,350
My thoughts are that if we're going home, we should all go together,

203
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,160
or if we're going to stay,

204
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,060
then we should all stay together.

205
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,610
If we don't come to a consensus, I feel like we won't get anywhere.

206
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,570
You all saw it.

207
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,570
What the platoon leader said was right. If we go out right now, we would just become food for those spheres.

208
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,410
Rather than go out and get slaughtered, I would rather stay here.

209
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,630
Fuck! What good will come of staying here?

210
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,880
Let's just go!

211
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,130
Hey, were you listening at all? We should move together!

212
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,930
Don't you know that the reason we ended up in this mess was that you guys didn't move together?

213
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,690
Gosh, fuck!

214
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,590
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra! What the fuck did you say?

215
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,100
Fuck you! You want me to speak some more?

216
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,690
Is this the time for you two to fight?

217
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,910
Then what? What should we do, Class President?

218
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,690
What should we do?

219
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,440
Yes, you're right. It was our fault.

220
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,380
Hui Rak, it is true that we were wrong.

221
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,050
Fuck! Let go of me.

222
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,030
Guys,

223
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,670
I'm sorry.

224
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,510
So...

225
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,000
are you saying it's better to stay here together?

226
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,970
Instead of just focusing on one side, let's listen to diverse opinions.

227
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,300
Listen? What do you mean, listen?

228
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,730
Just vote on whether we'll leave

229
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,630
or stay.

230
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,950
Okay. Then we'll do that. Who thinks it's best to go home?

231
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,030
Gosh, these fucking bastards. Raise your hands!

232
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,750
Kimchi.

233
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
You little...

234
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,650
Hey, Kwon Il Ha!

235
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,600
You selfish bastard.

236
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,970
Hey, raise your hand. Raise your hand, you bastard!

237
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,640
- Kwon Il Ha, stop it! 
 - Fuck you!

238
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,860
Each person has their own opinions and reasons!

239
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,440
What reasons?

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,700
The bonus points for the CSAT? Whether our homeroom teacher or friends die,

241
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,920
are you saying that all you need is the bonus points for the CSAT?

242
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,840
Then what about you?

243
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,510
You knew that Yeong Hun ended up like that, so why didn't you say anything?

244
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,650
If you'd told us, things would have been different.

245
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,230
You didn't care about him because he was an outcast.

246
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,130
Oh, maybe I'm wrong.

247
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,630
You would have been happy since your class rank would go up if he disappeared.

248
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,700
Fuck!

249
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,430
You...

250
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,670
We got together for a discussion, not to fight.

251
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,180
Fuck! So what do you want? Are you saying we should all die here?

252
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,660
Gosh, fuck!

253
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,090
Are we seriously fucking soldiers?

254
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,280
I will go home, so you bastards who want to stay can fucking stay.

255
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,760
That's why I'm saying we should discuss this and come to a consensus!

256
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,600
I don't know about anything else, but I can't stand to be with her. So at least send her away.

257
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,290
Why are you only being mean to Ae Seol?

258
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,450
She'll probably kill us all before the spheres do!

259
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,020
- So I'm saying we should at least send her away. 
 - We should at least stay together!

260
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,630
What happens if we just keep trying to fight each other?

261
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,320
Everyone saw it. Even though we experienced all that, nobody asked

262
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,690
if we were okay... or consoled us.

263
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,070
Did anyone ask us how we felt?

264
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,550
That's how they thought of us from the start!

265
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,470
Because if it has to do with the CSAT,

266
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,300
we can't speak up and complain.

267
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,030
That's right.

268
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,500
Since we have the CSAT as our weakness.

269
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,090
You're right.

270
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,010
Let's not get fooled any more by what the adults say.

271
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,850
All right. Then we will take a vote again.

272
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,730
Who thinks we need to go home?

273
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,620
Guys.

274
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,020
Bad things happened this time, but what if nothing else happens from now?

275
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,450
Then we will be the only ones who don't get the bonus points for the CSAT. I will be at a major disadvantage!

276
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,070
Hey! What's wrong with you!

277
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,940
Hey! You try waiting a million years and see if you can take the CSAT.

278
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,930
Lift your hand. You son of a bitch, raise your hand!

279
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,180
Lift your hand! Let go of me!

280
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,430
This fucking son of a bitch!

281
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,230
Let go of me!

282
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,180
Damn it!

283
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,010
Yeong Su.

284
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,190
I'll beg you like this.

285
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,740
I can't stay here like this anymore.

286
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm really,

287
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,850
really scared.

288
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,420
Please let me go to my mom, Yeong Su. Please!

289
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,900
This is the opinion of the entire class.

290
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,970
Everyone wants to go home.

291
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,680
It was just one.

292
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,510
So many soldiers died because of just one of it.

293
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,410
So how are you saying you will go home,

294
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,940
avoiding the ever-increasing number of spheres.

295
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,500
Also, even if you go home right now,

296
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,370
- your parents aren't there. 
 - Excuse me?

297
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,360
An evacuation order has been given.

298
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,290
They've probably moved to an evacuation shelter by now.

299
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,880
No way. Are you serious?

300
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
You're lying, right?

301
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,780
Can't you send us to the evacuation shelter then? Platoon Leader.

302
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,900
You guys are currently soldiers,

303
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,160
and we are in the middle of a war.

304
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,410
You guys can't be discharged.

305
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,530
So don't think about useless things and prepare for training.

306
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,380
What, fuck! Fuck!

307
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,220
Damn it!

308
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,230
Fuck!

309
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,600
Are you okay?

310
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,820
Do you want to get hurt?

311
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,850
What! What do you mean, you fucking bastard?

312
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,070
I mean, I was just worried about you.

313
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,600
So?

314
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,110
So what, you bastard?

315
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,770
About Yeong Hun dying...

316
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,440
I wanted to tell you it wasn't your fault, so—

317
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,160
Talk one more time.

318
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,560
I'll kill you all.

319
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,460
Move quickly!

320
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,370
Hurry!

321
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,460
Hurry and move!

322
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,410
Gosh!

323
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,860
If you moved like this, you would already be dead!

324
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,520
Run!

325
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,510
If you want to survive, then run.

326
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,350
Run!

327
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,070
Move it.

328
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,700
Run!

329
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,020
Hold your firearm!

330
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,930
Run quickly!

331
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,270
If you want to live, then run!

332
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,270
Run. Run!

333
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,520
If you move like that, you will all die!

334
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,770
Get up.

335
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,590
If you don't want to die, then get up and run!

336
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,210
Recruit No Ae Seol.

337
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,010
Do you want to become a burden to your friends?

338
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,700
No!

339
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,650
Run!

340
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,800
If you want to live, then move!

341
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,530
Nobody will protect you.

342
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,360
Do not become a burden to your friends!

343
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,730
If you want to live, then run.

344
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,910
Move quickly!

345
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,460
Nobody will save you!

346
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,470
You need to survive on your own!

347
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,280
If you don't want to die, then move!

348
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,160
Run!

349
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,060
Senior Trainee...

350
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,590
Run.

351
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,160
If you want to live, then run!

352
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,560
I can't...

353
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,920
I can't...

354
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,780
I can't do it anymore.

355
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,210
Platoon Leader, I can't do it anymore.

356
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,900
I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.

357
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,520
This didn't make sense from the start.

358
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,790
If we get trained like this,

359
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,860
there's no way we can take the CSAT!

360
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,570
We were too naive, like idiots.

361
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,680
Hey. It's not that we're naive

362
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,100
but that the adults are bad.

363
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,210
That platoon leader just enjoys torturing us.

364
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,910
I mistakenly thought he was a good guy.

365
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,340
Don't think so badly of the platoon leader like that.

366
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,820
Gosh, it looks like we'll die not from the spheres, but from the training!

367
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,390
Damn it!

368
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,620
You will realize later that the platoon leader acting like that

369
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,930
is all for you guys.

370
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,010
Damn it! What a fucking joke.

371
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,070
We cannot get rid of the spheres with weapons of mass destruction.

372
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,040
With that gun, all we can do is delay it.

373
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,900
The only method we've come up with is DU ammunition.

374
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,430
"DU ammunition"?

375
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:18,880
And it only works on small ones. It doesn't work on medium-sized ones.

376
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,850
But the problem is, not only do we lack this ammunition,

377
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,090
we also lack gunners who can shoot the spheres with the DU ammunition.

378
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,860
That is why

379
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,350
I needed to gather even the third-year high school students.

380
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,630
Okay.

381
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,240
We're good. We can talk.

382
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,760
Do we need to just stay like this?

383
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,060
We don't have any other way.

384
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,260
Honestly, I can't even believe that our parents went to an evacuation shelter.

385
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,550
What if he lied in order to change our minds?

386
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,340
Hey, the platoon leader oppa

387
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,520
isn't someone to lie to us.

388
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:42,490
I want to believe that, but now, I can't trust anyone.

389
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,900
Let's check for ourselves.

390
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,370
Are you stupid? We don't have our phones, and internet doesn't work, so how can we check?

391
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,370
That's where your limits lie. Why would we not be able to contact them?

392
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,340
Is there a way for us to contact them?

393
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,710
What is there a lot of?

394
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,320
Pigeons.

395
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,430
- We'll attach a letter to a pigeon— 
 Shut Wang Tae Man up.

396
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,490
Let's go back even before pigeons.

397
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,390
The only method we've got is to go check in person.

398
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,850
Me. I'll go.

399
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,440
Shouldn't Kimchi go, too?

400
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,400
Me? Why me?

401
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,380
Your house is the closest to the school, so it would be the best one to check.

402
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,060
- I mean, but still— 
 - Then Chi Yeol can come, too.

403
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,500
But I'm emotionally not ready yet. 
 - Deok Jung.

404
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,010
What?

405
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,470
Hey, my house is far away.

406
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,050
Let's leave through here.

407
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,620
How do we leave through here?

408
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,940
I don't think me and Jang Su will be able to. I'll be going.

409
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,480
Our school is proud of its history and tradition.

410
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,690
What would be a good thing about it?

411
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,550
- Damn you! 
 - It's old.

412
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,850
Follow me.

413
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,120
Jang Su.

414
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,310
Hurry and come out.

415
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,570
I can't go...

416
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,040
Seriously.

417
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,750
Hey! Are you okay?

418
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,680
Guys.

419
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,150
Hurry and come out.

420
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,620
Are you really going to go this far?

421
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,510
Hey, are you all right?

422
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,180
Gosh, is it Kim Deok Jung?

423
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,550
Damn it.

424
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,150
Hurry and come out!

425
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,020
Damn it!

426
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,250
Get down!

427
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,380
Do we go now?

428
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,260
Go!

429
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,300
Damn you!

430
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,750
Hey!

431
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,240
What do we do?

432
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,490
Deok Jung, you're curious why we brought you here

433
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,810
when your house is far away, right?

434
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,940
Yes.

435
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,740
I'm sorry.

436
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,760
Why?

437
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
Hey!

438
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,770
Deok Jung!

439
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,150
- Oh, Hyeongnim! 
 - What brings you here at this hour...

440
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,880
- What did you eat? 
 - I didn't eat anything...

441
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,160
- That... 
 - Why, why?

442
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,770
Come and catch me!

443
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,760
That guy!

444
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,900
Let's go.

445
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,760
What are you guys doing here?

446
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,580
What? Are you thinking of running away or something?

447
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,270
Well?

448
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,490
They'll catch you. Then we're doomed.

449
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,490
Gosh, what is he saying?

450
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,190
"What is he saying?"

451
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,260
Run, you idiots.

452
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,000
What?

453
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
Run, you idiots.

454
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,990
What?

455
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,260
Run, you idiots.

456
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,830
Run, you idiots!

457
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,350
Hey, hey, run quickly!

458
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,360
Run, run!

459
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,340
Hey, hey!

460
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,090
Hey, run quickly!

461
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,800
Quickly! Run, run!

462
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,320
Run, run!

463
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,730
Stop chasing us!

464
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,160
Catch those bastards!

465
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,420
Hey! Just die!

466
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,240
Hey!

467
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,540
Loyalty! There were no issues during my shift.

468
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,660
Anything unusual about the spheres?

469
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,330
There were no issues up until now. I will continue my shift.

470
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,760
Hey! Stop right there!

471
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,720
Hey!

472
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,440
- What are you doing? Come here! 
 - Run!

473
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,960
Hey! Wait, wait!

474
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,340
Catch them! Catch them... We've got them.

475
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,900
Did you catch them?

476
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,170
I caught Deok Jung.

477
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,870
Geez, I'm hyperventilating...

478
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,660
- Platoon Two, roll to the right. 
  - Roll to the right! 

479
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,730
Roll to the right!

480
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,480
 Roll to the right! 

481
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,860
- Roll to the left! 
  - Roll to the left! 

482
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,760
- Stand up. 
 -  Stand up! 

483
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,470
Stand up!

484
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,930
From now on, you guys are no longer students.

485
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,680
I will treat you all as soldiers.

486
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,290
You guys will not act like babies

487
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,170
and won't have any rights as students.

488
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,830
You guys are just soldiers who fight when told to fight,

489
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,790
and die when told to die.

490
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,800
Do you understand?

491
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,430
 Yes. 

492
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,510
Platoon Two, get in push-up position.

493
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,810
 Get in push-up position! 

494
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,010
- One! 
 -  One! 

495
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,430
- Two! 
 -  Two! 

496
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,550
Do it properly!

497
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:15,080
Is there anyone who still wants to go home?

498
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,450
- Platoon Two, stand up 
 -  Stand up! 

499
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,350
From now, if anyone leaves this place, it will be considered deserting the army.

500
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,940
Deserting will be punished according to military law.

501
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,760
From this point on, anyone who leaves this school without permission

502
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,040
will be thought of as a deserter.

503
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,990
You can shoot them on sight.

504
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,180
Did the platoon leader go crazy?

505
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,410
- Will they really shoot us? 
 - No way. They wouldn't actually shoot us.

506
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,290
What if they actually shoot?

507
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,400
It would hurt a lot.

508
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,700
When you get shot,

509
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,600
supposedly the entry wound is the size of a bullet,

510
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,480
but the exit wound is the size of a watermelon.

511
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,840
Really?

512
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,100
Why don't you try getting shot and find out?

513
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,840
Are you all really not going to do anything?

514
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,050
We don't really have a choice. Either we hold it in

515
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,800
or endure it.

516
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,160
Aren't they both the same thing?

517
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,890
Holding it in and enduring.

518
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:25,190
That's what I mean. That's the only choice we have.

519
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,050
It's not that there is no way.

520
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,720
There is a way that we could try.

521
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:04,420
Hey. You know Yeong Hun, right?

522
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,430
Wait, seriously?

523
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,340
Look at this. I almost died.

524
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,250
- Wait. 
 - Let's talk for a moment.

525
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,150
Let go of me.

526
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,450
We might all die like this.

527
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,760
Hey, come here quickly, come here quickly!

528
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,090
 What is it?  

529
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,050
Hey, supposedly, both Class 3-2's homeroom teacher and Yeong Hun died.

530
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,960
 What! 

531
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,920
Supposedly, some alien creatures killed them!

532
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,640
Is what we heard about Class 3-2 true?

533
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,240
 Is it true? 

534
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,800
Are you using the CSAT as an excuse to get us to fight against those spheres?

535
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,550
 Tell us! 

536
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,470
 Is it true or not? 

537
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,410
Our class decided to move according to how your class moves.

538
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,610
- Thanks. 
 - Just give us the signal.

539
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,270
Okay.

540
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,660
- Thanks. 
 - It's mine.

541
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,660
But isn't it better for you to get some sleep?

542
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,610
What about the students?

543
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,320
They're full of complaints.

544
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,570
I mean, they went through something difficult,

545
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,720
so aren't you being a bit too hard on them? You know very well

546
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,830
how it feels to lose a colleague.

547
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,760
It's hard for us, too,

548
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,020
so how much harder must it be for them?

549
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:01,590
So you should give them some time to grieve and console them...

550
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,460
There's no time for us to console them.

551
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,830
If I need to be more cruel to save even one more of them, I will.

552
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,050
Let's go. The kids are waiting.

553
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,730
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

554
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,280
Let's go!

555
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,530
Let's go!

556
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,890
 Let's go! 

557
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,560
 Move! 

558
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,090
Stop right there!

559
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,220
 Let's go! 

560
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,240
Stop them, stop them! You bastards, move out of the way!

561
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,580
Hey, push! Push them!

562
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,100
What are you doing! Push them back!

563
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,740
Hey, you bastard!

564
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,850
Move back!

565
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,150
Gosh!

566
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,630
You bastards!

567
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,740
What are you guys doing? Go back inside!

568
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,420
I heard that Class 3-2's homeroom teacher died! 
 - Yeah, supposedly, she died!

569
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,600
This bastard! 
 - I heard it all from the guys in Class 3-2!

570
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,610
We heard it all!

571
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,710
 We don't want to be here! 

572
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,710
I heard that Class 3-2's Jang Yeong Hun also died!

573
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,450
Send us home right now!

574
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,820
 Yes, let us go home! 

575
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,690
Who said that, you bastard?

576
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,720
 Get out of the way! 

577
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,060
Hey! Platoon Commander, what are you doing?

578
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,830
Block them! Block them properly!

579
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,700
What are you doing, you bastards? Block them! Block them!

580
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,910
Why don't you let us go?

581
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,930
Gosh! These little...

582
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,160
Hey! If you guys keep acting like this, it won't do you any good.

583
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,470
You guys won't get any bonus points for the CSAT!

584
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,630
Ajeossi, Ajeossi! I don't care about any of that. Just let us go home!

585
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,810
You'll get penalty points, you bastard.

586
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,600
Okay, thank you for the penalty points. Let's go!

587
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,870
Where are you going, you bastards!

588
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:56,800
Are you not going to move?

589
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,260
What are you doing?

590
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,400
Hurry up and go inside!

591
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,010
Nothing will change from you guys doing this. Hurry up and go inside!

592
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,390
Why do we need to do that? We're not even soldiers!

593
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,490
How many times must I tell you?

594
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,910
From now, you guys are— 
 - We said we don't want that!

595
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,250
If you really think about us, then let us go home.

596
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,730
Why can't we do anything we want?

597
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:24,820
Why can't we do what we want?

598
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,260
What are you guys doing?

599
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,720
Make them go back inside, even if it requires force!

600
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,750
- Block them! 
 - Have them go inside!

601
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,590
- Hey! 
 - Let us go!

602
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,680
Block them, block them!

603
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,650
No, catch that guy!

604
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,970
It's really, really bad.

605
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,230
What happened?

606
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,570
Wake up.

607
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,720
Everyone, prepare to fire.

608
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,990
Move to the front. Move to the front!

609
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,410
Everyone go inside! Hurry!

610
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,650
Hurry and go inside!

611
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,340
Go inside quickly!

612
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,340
Protect the students!

613
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,380
Kim Chi Yeol, wake up and run!

614
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,490
Gosh!

615
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,070
Get out of the way!

616
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,730
Hey! Move!

617
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,850
Gosh!

618
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:58,100
What are you doing? Wake up!

619
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,380
Colonel, I'm here. Open the door.

620
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,590
Get away, man! Capture the spheres! Hurry!

621
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,380
Open the door! Colonel, Colonel!

622
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,630
Wait, Colonel, Colonel!

623
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:23,150
You son of a bitch!

624
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,060
Move out of the way!

625
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,220
- Hurry and leave! 
 - There is one here. We need to go out that way!

626
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,230
- There is one there too! 
 - We need to go out that way!

627
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,200
Kwon Il Ha!

628
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,110
Hey, wake up! Are you all right?

629
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:18,720
Let's go. We need to go. We need to go now!

630
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,620
Get up!

631
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,120
Come to your senses!

632
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,080
No! Gosh!

633
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,930
- What do we do? What do we do? 
 - We need to go!

634
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,340
How?

635
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,500
We can't go! We can't go! 
 - Damn it! I told them they should let us go home!

636
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,120
Are you guys going to die here?

637
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,450
You remember what the platoon leader said, right? Run to the classroom with all you got.

638
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,410
Run!

639
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,720
Hey, watch out!

640
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,150
Fuck! What is this?

641
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,690
Let's go!

642
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,000
Let's go, Wu Taek!

643
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,710
Hyeong...

644
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,530
Hyeong— Whoa!

645
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,750
No!

646
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,530
Wu Taek... Wu Taek, Wu Taek!

647
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,400
Do Su Cheol, just go!

648
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,660
Just go, you bastard!

649
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,460
Go!

650
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,210
Go!

651
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,670
Ae Seol, Ae Seol! We need to go!

652
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,700
It's okay, it's okay. Let's go.

653
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,570
Ae Seol! Enough, let's go!

654
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,260
Ae Seol, it's okay.

655
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,470
Ae Seol!

656
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,290
Hurry, hurry, we need to go!

657
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,260
Let's go!

658
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,820
Gosh, damn it!

659
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,840
Hurry and go inside! Hurry inside!

660
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,610
Gosh!

661
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,450
Guys, run quickly!

662
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,730
What is this?

663
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,590
Guys, hurry!

664
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,850
Hurry and close the door!

665
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,260
Hey,

666
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,450
hurry and lock the door!

667
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,160
Block the door!

668
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,430
What's going on?

669
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,170
Gosh, seriously!

670
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,780
Go upstairs to the classrooms!

671
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,140
What the fuck?

672
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,420
Why did all those things fall from the sky!

673
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,180
If they all fall like this,

674
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,680
then there should be hundreds, no,

675
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,980
thousands of small spheres!

676
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,810
Gosh, this is so unrealistic! It's not like this is a game!

677
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,190
Hey, but is it safe for us to be here?

678
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,590
I'm asking if it's really safe for us to be here!

679
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,120
What do we do?

680
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,910
We will all die!

681
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,260
We'll all die!

682
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,000
Shut up!

683
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,640
Wait.

684
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,540
Everyone, be quiet for a moment.

685
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,920
Guys!

686
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,960
It's such a relief! Have you gotten hurt anywhere?

687
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,590
Are you all okay?

688
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,280
Go to classroom 4.

689
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,940
Let's go!

690
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,210
Hurry and get up!

691
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,520
We can't!

692
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,570
Hurry!

693
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,990
We have to hurry and leave!

694
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,140
Hurry and run!

695
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,190
Hurry!

696
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,970
Please go inside!

697
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,560
Move, move!

698
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,090
Go, go, go inside!

699
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,440
Go inside and lock the door!

700
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,590
Hey, are you all right?

701
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,680
Hey, move it. Hurry!

702
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,150
Damn it, I don't see the guns!

703
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,400
Are you all right?

704
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,290
Put on your equipment and grab your rifles.

705
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,670
Yu Jeong, give out the DU ammunition.

706
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,890
Okay!

707
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:21,140
Hey, take your ammunition.

708
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,130
- Here. 
 - Gosh, this isn't working.

709
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,420
What do we do, what do we do?

710
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,830
It's okay.

711
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,090
Don't abandon me.

712
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,680
Okay.

713
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,250
Okay, be on guard when you have your helmet on!

714
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,550
Watch the front and the rear!

715
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,220
- This isn't working... 
 - It's not like this. Let go.

716
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,860
Move.

717
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,400
Guys.

718
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,990
Listen carefully.

719
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,680
Half of you, get in the front car. The other half of you, get in the left car.

720
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,080
You must run with all your might without looking back.

721
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,780
Do you understand?

722
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,030
Na Ra,

723
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:58,420
Jang Su, please watch our backs.

724
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,640
Run!

725
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,340
Run!

726
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,750
Run quickly!

727
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,980
Hurry and run!

728
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,470
Run!

729
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,980
Na Ra! You should hurry up inside as well!

730
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,540
Hurry!

731
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,030
Hurry inside!

732
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,100
Cha So Yeon!

733
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,220
Hurry and get in!

734
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,690
Are you crazy?

735
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,610
Are you crazy?

736
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,960
No. I don't want to go.

737
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,380
I'm going to go to my mom!

738
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,700
I want to go to my mom!

739
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,240
 What are you doing? Hurry and get in! 

740
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,600
 Hurry and get in!

01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,350
 Get in right now!

747
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:53,070
Jo Jang Su! Get Lee Sun Yi in the car right now!

748
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,850
What are you doing? No Ae Seol, shoot!

749
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,580
- Wait! 
 - I said, shoot!

750
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,160
Hey, you idiot! Come to your senseㄴ!

751
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,280
Hurry and get in!

752

Hurry, hurry!

756
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,390
Start moving the car!

757
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,570
Hey, grab her hand!

758
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,400
Hurry and get in!

01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,820
Hey! Hurry!

760
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,820
Darn it.

761
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,620
Hurry!

762
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,610
Behind you!

763
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,740
Hey!

764
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,400
Hurry and get in!

765
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,350
Hurry!

766
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,350
Just go!

767
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,620
Stop the car!

768
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,360
In Hye!

769
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,400
Hey! Just a bit faster!

770
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,550

In Hye! In Hye!

774
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,860
Hey, grab onto Yu Jeong!

775
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,340
Hold onto Yu Jeong!

Move!

777
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,360
Are you going to get everyone killed?

778
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,910
Grab onto Yu Jeong!

779
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,600
Take her!

780
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,150
We can't leave In Hye behind!

781
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,610
What do we do?

782
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,600
Take me, too!

783
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,510
Take me with you!

784
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,540
I want to live!

01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,880
In Hye! Don't die!

786
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,270
In Hye!

787
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,710
What do we do?

788
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,820
In Hye!

789
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:49,140


790
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,420
