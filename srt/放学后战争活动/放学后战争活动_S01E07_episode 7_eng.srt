1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,070
   

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,950
   

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:33,990


4
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,350
Come and get me if you can!

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,520
 Has it been one month already? 
   

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,820
 Since it's only been us. 
   

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,680
 It seems like only yesterday we were trembling at the sight of one sphere. 

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,560
 The kids'... 
   

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,720
 eyes have changed. 

10
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,720
Follow me, you pieces of shit!

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,240
Fuck, let's go!

12
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,650
 I don't fucking know. I just catch them without thinking about much else. 

13
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,020
 I just want to kill those fucking spheres. 
   

14
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,300
Yeon Bo Ra!

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,040
Fuck, there are so many.

16
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,820
Geez, fuck!

17
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,530
 Everyone's shooting abilities have improved a lot. 
   

18
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,140
 They're different from when they first shot targets at the shooting range. 

19
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,650
 If he could see us now, Platoon Leader would be... 
   

20
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,120
 very surprised. 
   

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,570
Yeon Bo Ra, are you ready?

22
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,540
- Just hurry! There are so many fucking spheres. 
 - Let's go!

23
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,330
Caught you, you punk!

24
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,070
   

25
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,540
Wait, where did it go?

26
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,850
It came this way, for sure. Shit, that sneaky bastard.

27
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,680
This is so annoying.

28
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,090
That bastard!

29
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,440
Hey, don't fucking swerve!

30
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,660
Then you should fucking drive.

31
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,180
 It doesn't seem real. 
   

32
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,820
 Sometimes it feels like I'm playing PUBG... 
   

33
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,560
 or like I'm just dreaming. 
   

34
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,180
I told you to stop!

35
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,060
Look at him.

36
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,210
Oh, really? Are you going in there?

37
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,240
Come here, come here. You're done for, Punk.

38
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,490
Look at him.

39
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,370
This bastard...

40
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,420
♪ Let's play hide and seek. I can almost see your sphere head. ♪

41
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,750
Where could the sphere have gone?

42
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,860
Punk, get reborn as a human in your next life. Punk!

43
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,550
Rascal.

44
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,840
Now then...

45
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,440
Adios.

46
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm fucked.

47
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,730
Somebody save me!

48
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,060
Mom!

49
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,010
Guys! Somebody save me!

50
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,690
Save me! Save me!

51
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,180
 Besides being worried about my grandma, I don't really have any hardships. 

52
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,000
Somebody save me!

53
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,920
It's showtime.

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,780
Fire!

55
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,180
Below you! Below you!

56
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,040
Shit!

57
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,600
 It's a relief the CSAT has been postponed for a month. 
   

58
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,540
 I couldn't study because of the war. 
   

59
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,840
Aren't they supposed to be sensitive to cold?

60
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,770
Why are they so strong?

61
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,240
They adapt well. How fucking infuriating.

62
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,450
I think we got all the ones here. Let's each make our reports.

63
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,310
Okay.

64
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,480
- I have two rounds left. 
 - I have one

65
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,830
I'm enko.

66
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,320
What?

67
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,640
It just means I'm all out.

68
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,130
Really?

69
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,250
Then my motorcycle gas is also enko.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,580
My stomach is also enko!

71
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,720
Same here.

72
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,230
Me, too!

73
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,070
Come on!

74
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,270
Let's go back now.

75
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,470
- Okay! 
 - Okay.

76
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,470
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

77
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,960
 Leaving first. 

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
Take care!

79
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,370
Come and get me if you can!

80
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,400
Let's hurry and go eat.

81
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,290
- Wait for me, Kim Deok Jung! 
 - Hurry up!

82
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,960
 Do you know what's most fucked up? 
   

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,330
 It's that we got used to this situation at some point. 
    

84
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,820
Can spheres adapt quickly?

85
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,610
You guys are quicker! Don't you think?

86
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,220
Well? You're even enjoying this!

87
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,820
Hey, stop complaining, will you?

88
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,700
Who would enjoy this situation?

89
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,440
Well, I thought we were the search team, but we've already killed three spheres today!

90
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,540
Do you call this a search team?

91
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,450
We need to search to be aware of our surroundings.

92
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,070
So what have we found out about our surroundings?

93
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,510
Until when do we need to fucking continue this shit?

94
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,330
Why would we have come all this way just to quit now?

95
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,010
And will you just let all our additional points go to waste?

96
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,640
You can just shut up!

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,370
Are you in better condition since Kwon Il Ha hasn't been pestering you?

98
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,320
The communications device needs to work for us to make our next decision.

99
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,710
Exactly! So when will the radio be fixed?

100
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,210
We'll all die at this rate.

101
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,900
- Exactly! 
 - Exactly.

102
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,520
Stop throwing a tantrum and let's talk it out at home, okay?

103
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,370
Home? She just said home.

104
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,120
- Did you all hear her? 
 - Yes.

105
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,770
- I'm the only one— 
 - She said, let's talk at home!

106
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,150
What's wrong with her now?

107
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,000
 Forget about the CSAT, 
   

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,280
 I just want to go home. 
   

109
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,380
 I really regret signing that contract 
    

110
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,930
 with all my being. 
   

111
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,660
 Kim Chi Yeol, don't you feel the same? 
   

112
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,780
- We're home. 
 - I'm exhausted.

113
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,030
She said we're home. I bet she's going to say she's going to go study at the academy after this.

114
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,820
- We're here. 
 - If this isn't home, then what is?

115
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,710
- Hey, be quiet. 
 - You be quiet.

116
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,260
Oh? It's the guys.

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,130
Search team, returned. Search team, returned.

118
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,360
Let's go. Hurry, hurry.

119
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,350
What bullshit. Are you on a vacation?

120
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,080
- We're the only fucking ones here. Why do we always do this shit? 
 - Hey, be quiet.

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,540
Gosh, he's so obnoxious.

122
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,170
Let him be. That's how he survives.

123
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,780
Dry shampoo!

124
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,080
 There isn't any! 

125
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,990
What the heck? You said you'd get me dry shampoo!

126
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,540
Just shave your head!

127
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,090
That might be better.

128
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,040
- Hui Rak, the clam chowder I mentioned— 
 - There was none!

129
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,590
Go!

130
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,140
Jang Su, can I join the assault team tomorrow? For additional points.

131
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,020
- Oh, sure. I'll think about it. 
 - Kimchi!

132
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,470
- Thank you. 
 - What about the clam chowder?

133
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,640
Where would we find that these days?

134
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,130
You said you'd get me some!

135
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,530
He only yells at me.

136
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,250
- Good job. 
 - ♪ I don't like the spheres ♪

137
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,200
♪ I really don't. I hate them ♪

138
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,600
- It's nice. Let's play it for the kids. 
 - Right?

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,110
Jun Hui, listen to our new single.

140
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,260
 - One, two, three, four—  
 - Get lost.

141
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,340
- So Yun! One, two— 
 - Gosh!

142
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,470
 - One, two, three—  
 - Hey.

143
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,640
- Did you finish what I told you? 
 - What?

144
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,230
I don't know.

145
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,670
Then you guys didn't do it.

146
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,730
You agreed to repair the leak in the roof.

147
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,740
 Oh, right! 

148
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,020
- Hold this. 
 - No wonder.

149
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,010
Jeez...

150
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,830
♪ Dry shampoo, dry shampoo ♪

151
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,920
-  ♪ Dry shampoo ♪ 
 - Crazy bitch.

152
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,880
- That's enough. 
 - In my opinion, she's all better now.

153
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,890
She's faking it.

154
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,990
- Aigo! 
 - Guys...

155
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,770
I'm getting stressed.

156
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,810
How does her acting not improve?

157
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,430
I'm hungry.

158
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,620
 Now that I think about it, 
   

159
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,610
 we're turning twenty years old in a few days. 
   

160
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,810
 Gosh. 
    

161
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,310
 It feels so weird. 
   

162
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,960
   

163
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,580
   

164
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,680
   

165
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,850
   

166
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,110
   

167
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,780
   

168
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,260
Why is it that the only thing my gun does is get heavier?

169
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,070
Is it getting heavier only for me?

170
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,570
Is it just me? 
    

171
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,310
I guess you're still not used to it.

172
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,260
Right? Gosh.

173
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,160
Thank you. 
    

174
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,220
Fuck! Wang Tae Man! Kwon Il Ha!

175
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,900
You guys said you would repair this!

176
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,430
Stop complaining. Why don't you just do it?

177
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,670
   

178
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,410
No. 1.

179
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,950
What about the radio?

180
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,790
Is it still not working?

181
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,550
No.

182
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,460
When will we get connected?

183
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,690
This is what the search team brought back, but there are no useful medications.

184
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,760
Things are hectic right now because so many people have frostbite.

185
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,140
There's a hospital nearby, so let's search over there.

186
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,020
I'll plan a route later.

187
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,140
- Have you tried canned tuna? 
 - Do you eat silkworm pupae?

188
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,680
- How can you eat pupae? 
 - Just eat anything.

189
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,390
I'm hungry!

190
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,990
Gosh, I'm hungry.

191
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,320
- All right. 
 - What?

192
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,010
Oh, it was nothing.

193
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,140
Damn it...

194
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,000
Jang Su, can't I have one more?

195
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,840
I can't, right? Shit.

196
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Shit!

197
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,200
Did you get hurt?

198
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,860
It's nothing.

199
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,790
Join the search team tomorrow.

200
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,690
Forget it.

201
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,240
Hi, Jang Su.

202
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,790
Pupae...

203
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,310
Jang Su, can't I get a little more today?

204
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,620
I feel like my stomach is eating itself!

205
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,770
No. And we don't know what will happen,

206
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,340
so we need to ration our meals.

207
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,370
I'll become a pile of bones at this rate.

208
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,550
What bones?

209
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,120
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

210
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,660
Red chili tuna. I can't take two, can I?

211
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,610
Leave.

212
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,380
Gosh, I'm hungry. Let's eat!

213
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,600
Dinner has finally arrived. Wang Tae Man's pick of the day is...

214
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Wang Tae Man's menu of the day isn't just regular tuna, but red chili tuna.

215
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,940
Whoever wants a bite, come join me!

216
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,320
Hey, Wang Tae Man, you have things to do.

217
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh, right.

218
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,690
   
   

219
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,100
The day we spent today was a gift from our late teacher, friends,

220
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,460
and our platoon leader.

221
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,200
Thank you for giving us a month without incident.

222
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,560
Just like you have now, please continue to protect us moving forward.

223
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,890
Kim Deok Jung!

224
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,070
I only had one meal. Of course, I'm hungry.

225
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,860
The end.

226
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,430
Now for the second most important thing. Let's eat.

227
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,730
Where's Chef No? Chef No?

228
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,070
- She's here. 
 - Chef No, please take good care of us.

229
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,820
No Ae Seol, let's go.

230
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,440
Let's go.

231
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm hungry.

232
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,500
Kimchi? Kimchi!

233
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,870
Pupae is waiting for me.

234
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,890
I'm hungry.

235
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,830
Ae Seol!

236
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,570
- Tuna. 
 - Tuna for me, too.

237
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm so hungry.

238
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,530
- Ssamjang! Ssamjang. 
 - And sesame oil too!

239
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,430
Hold on. Then I'll use ssamjang in this one and gochujang in this one.

240
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,860
- I want gochujang. 
 - I want ssamjang.

241
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,080
Can I get half-and-half?

242
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,220
- I want gochujang. 
 - You can't have half-and-half.

243
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Tuna and kimchi!

244
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,460
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

245
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,660
Add some eggs too.

246
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,660
We've been eating this for days. I'm sick of it.

247
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,840
They say everyone has their own talent.

248
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,540
Stir it more, it might taste like beef.

249
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,450
- Yes, just like that. 
 - Oh my gosh.

250
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,890
But canned food is canned food. Don't you think?

251
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,320
You should go and ask if you want some, too. Don't mind me.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,420
First come, first served.

253
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,260
- I want ssamjang. 
 - I have chili tuna, so I want gochujang.

254
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,230
- I want dwenjang. 
 - There's no dwenjang.

255
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,160
It's okay. Forget it.

256
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,010
   

257
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,470
What are you doing?

258
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,590
Oh, I'm checking our route for tomorrow.

259
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,810
What are you writing?

260
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,590
A letter? A diary entry?

261
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,500
It's nothing.

262
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,360
I don't have a knack for speech or writing,

263
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,110
so I'm amazed by people like you who are good at writing.

264
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,150
No, I'm not good at writing, either.

265
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,250
You were praised for your composition essay.

266
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,970
Did you know we spoke exactly once since we were placed in the same class?

267
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,950
When I asked you what the homework was.

268
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,280
If it weren't for this war,

269
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,920
you and I would have had nothing to talk about, right?

270
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,860
We would have probably graduated without talking to some of the others once.

271
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,820
Exactly. I guess there's a silver lining.

272
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,380
If we return to school later,

273
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,140
will we be able to act the same with each other?

274
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,930
People will return to their original cliques,

275
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,790
we'll each become busy, preparing for the CSAT,

276
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,270
and once we graduate, we'll lose touch with each other.

277
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,580
Wouldn't it be like that?

278
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,490
I'm not sure.

279
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,350
I don't think so.

280
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,470
I want to stay close with the new friends I made.

281
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,060
I see.

282
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,430
Ouch.

283
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,450
I guess everyone really does have their own talent.

284
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,270
You're rather good.

285
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,590
How elaborate.

286
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,180
- He's good, right? 
 - He is, right?

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,010
Let's see.

288
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,020
Hey, leave a bit of the sideburns. Okay?

289
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,820
Don't worry. I'm almost done.

290
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,580
Okay.

291
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,810
- Done! 
  - Wow! 

292
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,530
- Kim Deok Jung! 
 - It looks better.

293
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,060
Exactly. It looks refreshing.

294
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,130
- Not bad. 
 - It's neat.

295
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,440
You punk!

296
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,080
Jellyfish.

297
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,440
Gosh. What's wrong with them?

298
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,990
- Kim Deok, cut mine, too. 
 - What?

299
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,100
Hey, cut it at a salon later.

300
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,510
We don't know when we'll be able to.

301
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,580
I can't even wash my hair. It's so annoying! Just cut it off.

302
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,370
- But still... 
 - It's such a waste.

303
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,810
No complaining afterward, okay?

304
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,460
Okay.

305
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,390
Well then...

306
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,620
I can't watch.

307
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,680
Women's hair is different from men's hair.

308
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,510
- I'm cutting it all off. 
 - Okay.

309
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,340
   

310
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,310
What's this?

311
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,400
   

312
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,920
You don't say much these days. And you don't eat much either.

313
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,410
I stashed it for myself,

314
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,610
but you can have it.

315
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,690
Drink this and fool around like old times.

316
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,910
Am I a child?

317
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,770
Drink it or don't. Do whatever you want.

318
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,250
Wild Goose, this is Seagull, over.

319
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,000
Wild Goose, this is Seagull, over.

320
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,680
It's not working today either, right?

321
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,350
It turns on, but there's no signal.

322
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,990
Why is it suddenly broken?

323
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,200
Regarding the walkie-talkie, would we be able to get parts if we go there?

324
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,810
 Where? 

325
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,330
On the way back from exterminating spheres,

326
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,090
I saw a prison.

327
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm not sure if the sphere didn't attack it, but it looked unscathed.

328
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,170
We might find what we need there.

329
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,960
Wait, you haven't tried going inside yet?

330
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,380
What?

331
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,530
I didn't have much DU ammunition left.

332
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,540
And Deok Jung was complaining he's hungry, so we just came.

333
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,330
Gosh, he's never been helpful in his life.

334
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,320
Exactly.

335
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,200
Wait.

336
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,090
If it's a prison, it should have communication device parts.

337
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,290
We should make a trip tomorrow. Deal?

338
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,820
Deal.

339
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,610
Okay.

340
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,600
What does this do—

341
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,670
Back off.

342
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,660
Okay.

343
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,750
All done.

344
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,030
 - Wow.  
 - Kim Deok!

345
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,260
Kim Deok Jung, you're rather good.

346
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,980
Hey, can you cut mine, too?

347
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,910
Wh-What?

348
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,930
It's pretty.

349
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,220
Cut mine like Bo Ra's, too.

350
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,600
S-Sure.

351
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,570
N-No!

352
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,610
What the heck, Kimchi?

353
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,910
Who are you to say no?

354
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,210
Well, she's pretty just the way she is.

355
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,280
It's a waste.

356
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,410
Exactly. Who are you to feel it's a waste?

357
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,480
I'm against it, too. Her current hair suits her.

358
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,580
Su Cheol, which hairstyle suits me?

359
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,440
I don't know. Everything does.

360
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,290
Don't be like that. Which hairstyle?

361
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,310
Hey, flirting is a habit too.

362
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,690
- I'm not flirting. 
 - Ha Na, just shave it off.

363
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,190
- She said to shave it. 
 - That's not a bad idea.

364
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,640
How about it? Shall I cut it?

365
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,260
Yes, cut it.

366
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,560
All right.

367
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,050
I'll cut it short like Bo Ra's, okay?

368
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,970
Yes.

369
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,880
Okay.

370
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,790
Come on!

371
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,020
H-Huh? The scissors broke.

372
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,360
Can I cut it next time?

373
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,830
Oh, really?

374
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,810
Then I'll ask you next time.

375
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,940
Oh... I...

376
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,110
Can scissors break too?

377
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,520
Anything can happen.

378
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,670
What kind of scissors break?

379
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,020
You little...

380
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,770
The hair suits you.

381
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,480
How unexpected of Deok Jung.

382
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,000
- Right? 
 - Yes.

383
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,660
Hey! How is it? Nice, right?

384
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,050
Yeah. It looks nice...

385
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,700
and ugly.

386
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,940
Do you want to die?

387
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,240
Time to vote. Let's go.

388
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,810
Hey, Jo Yeong Sin! Do you think I'm easy just because I'm nice to you?

389
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,560
- Hurry. 
 - You have a death wish.

390
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,720
Am I the only one not dating?

391
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,330
When did they all pair up?

392
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,740
There are still some people who are confused.

393
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,630
Those who think we should stay on our own, write "O."

394
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,600
Those who want to go home, write "X."

395
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,570
Why do you have two?

396
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,270
Hey, this is mine.

397
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,650
Gosh, let's go home, Bo Ra.

398
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,080
Hey, hurry! Hurry!

399
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,770
- Gosh. 
 - Me, too. Me, too.

400
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,290
Me, too. Me, too.

401
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,460
Geez, I have to put "X" this time.

402
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,070
Everyone's going to write "X" this time, right?

403
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,860
We need to go home.

404
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,420
If it weren't for one prick.

405
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,040
What?

406
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,390
Hey!

407
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,500
"X."

408
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,040
Hey, you dumbass. Over something like that...

409
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,300
I'm hungry.

410
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,040
   

411
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,280
No discussions.

412
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,570
Isn't everyone done?

413
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,740
Think carefully before you vote.

414
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,720
Carefully, my ass. Are we electing the president?

415
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,690
I'll submit it for you.

416
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,870
Thanks, Su Cheol.

417
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,140
We're going home. Don't worry.

418
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,590
   

419
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,380
   

420
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,970
   

421
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,570
   

422
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,320
Stay.

423
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,180
- Get off me. 
 - I'm hurt.

424
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,540
Leave.

425
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,030
Come on!

426
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,690
- Let's go home. 
 - Let's go.

427
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,530
What is it?

428
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,640
Stay.

429
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,030
Shit, this is maddening!

430
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,440
Again? Why?

431
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,760
No!

432
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,530
What is this? Why is the result like this every time?

433
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,350
What's with the people who voted to stay?

434
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,470
What the heck?

435
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,140
Wu Hui Rak, you can't be like that because you have a different opinion. Be respectful.

436
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,850
Fuck! I never liked this voting system from the start!

437
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,320
That's enough, Wu Hui Rak. You look petty.

438
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,630
- What? 
 - Geez, Park So Yun.

439
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,210
How is wanting to go home petty?

440
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,500
Why? There must be a reason you don't want to go home.

441
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,040
Did your parents tell you not to come home and bury your bones in the army?

442
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,140
Bringing my parents into this? I have no choice, but to cross the line, too.

443
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,940
- Hey. 
 - What? What?

444
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,340
- Guys. 
 - You'll get hurt.

445
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,470
- So Yun. 
 - So Yun, come on.

446
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,630
- Gosh. 
 - What?

447
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,100
Can't we just please go home?

448
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,490
I don't want to be here anymore.

449
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,730
Who keeps voting to stay?

450
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,010
- Who is it? 
 - Who is it?

451
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,700
Hey, Lee Sun Yi. We agreed not to ask each other.

452
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,390
Did she say something wrong?

453
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,140
Don't you guys want to go home?

454
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,910
Why are we staying here like this?

455
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,680
We agreed to let majority rule from the start.

456
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,900
If you want to return, then you guys can go ahead.

457
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,850
I mean...

458
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,300
Did I say... I'm going to return?

459
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,440
It's because you're scared to return alone, isn't it?

460
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,690
We have to move together. That's what Platoon Leader said.

461
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,330
He is at it again.

462
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,720
Let's hang in there a bit longer.

463
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,460
We decided to vote until the walkie-talkie is fixed.

464
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,980
Fuck! We'll all die at this rate!

465
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,780
You all saw it! Kwon Il Ha almost died yesterday!

466
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,620
Be honest. How many times did he almost die on the way to the rest stop?

467
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,970
It's a miracle any of us are still alive!

468
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,600
It will be dangerous no matter what we do right now.

469
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,780
We can move once we have more solid information.

470
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,130
That's true.

471
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,230
Whether we continue the operation as ordered or return to Seoul.

472
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,990
We can choose once we get in touch. That's the safest.

473
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,380
When the hell will the walkie-talkie be fixed—

474
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,840
We'll bring back the parts from the prison tomorrow,

475
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,210
so enough with the complaining. Okay?

476
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,640
Come on...

477
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,600
I know you're all tired and exhausted. But let's hang in there a bit longer.

478
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,150
How would Platoon Leader feel if he saw us fighting like this?

479
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,870
That's right.

480
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,260
You always bring Platoon Leader up.

481
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,270
Okay, Second Squad, hit the sack!

482
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,400
Make sure to keep the order of duty.

483
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,580
Dismissed.

484
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,820
- Dismissed. 
 - We should go home.

485
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,980
- It's over. Come on. 
 - I'm sorry.

486
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,860
- Me, too. 
 - They're all dead. I'm going to fucking catch them all, these assholes—

487
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,710
- Hui Rak, come on. 
 - They all want to stay!

488
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,220
- I have a family, too! 
 - All right.

489
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,340
I have a family, too!

490
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,010
They're so fucking optimistic!

491
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,530
Fucking dismissed. Good night.

492
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,480
Why does everyone want to stay?

493
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Today, the first squadron assault team is Kim Yu Jeong, Jo Jang Su, Wang Tae Man, Yeon Bo Ra,

494
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,700
Jo Yeong Sin, No Ae Seol, Park So Yun, Wu Hui Rak.

495
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,780
The second squadron search team is Do Su Cheol, Cha So Yeon, Choi Yeon Ju,

496
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,710
Guk Yeong Su, Lee Na Ra, Kim Chi Yeol, Kwon Il Ha, Yu Ha Na.

497
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,130
The first squadron assault team will go to the prison, get parts for the walkie-talkie,

498
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,660
and dispose of the spheres caught by the detector on the way back.

499
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,580
The second squadron search team will go to the hospital to collect medicine

500
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,260
and other necessary items.

501
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,060
And the rest, Kim Deok Jung, Lee Sun Yi, Hong Jun Hui will guard the rest stop. Three people.

502
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,840
- No complaints, right? 
 - Yes, Ma'am!

503
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,720
- Okay, okay! 
 - I said I'll join the assault team.

504
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,730
You're hurt. Just join the search team today.

505
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,770
Can't you just switch No Ae Seol and Cha So Yeon?

506
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,960
Why do you keep putting No Ae Seol in the assault team?

507
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,330
Hey, Ae Seol has a high accuracy rate.

508
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,010
She's probably better than you, given your impatience.

509
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,590
What?

510
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm fine with the assault team.

511
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
I want to join the assault team, too.

512
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,340
You still haven't recovered from your cold.

513
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,970
You overworked yourself in the assault team for an entire month.

514
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,380
Join the search team for today.

515
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,930
Geez, what's the difference between the assault team and the search team?

516
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,050
If something goes wrong, aren't we all screwed anyway?

517
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:52,240
Exactly. So don't let your guard down and pay attention.

518
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,230
- Fighting! 
 - Let's be careful.

519
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,010
But... Ha Na's missing.

520
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,420
- What? 
 - What?

521
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,750
Gosh, Yu Ha Na.

522
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,570
I'll bring her.

523
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,300
Aigo, aigo.

524
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,070
Ha Na.

525
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,060
Ha Na!

526
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,210
Ha Na

527
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,430
I-I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

528
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,860
- Deok Jung. 
 - Yes?

529
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,080
I think I have a fever.

530
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,400
Hey, you were fine until just now!

531
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,940
You were on guard duty yesterday too.

532
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,690
I'm serious.

533
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,050
R-Really?

534
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,860
I'm being serious.

535
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,800
Try touching me.

536
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,580
Hey... I...

537
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,580
know you're just faking it.

538
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,550
I said, touch me.

539
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,140
Ha Na is very sick.

540
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,300
Bullshit.

541
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,090
Hey, it's not the first time she faked it.

542
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:25,290
Her acting isn't even good.

543
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,010
No!

544
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,190
She's really sick today. She has a fever.

545
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,210
I think it's a cold. I think it's a cold!

546
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,430
Is Yu Ha Na really sick?

547
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,850
- I'm sick, too. 
 - You're sickening.

548
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,650
I'll take her place.

549
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,550
Hey, Sun Yi! Why would you?

550
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,480
Okay then. Sun Yi will take Ha Na's place today.

551
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,540
All right, Second Squad. Let's go!

552
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,820
Fighting!

553
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:04,630
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

554
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:22,200
   

555
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,290
This is my first time at a prison.

556
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,740
Do you think any of us have been to one before?

557
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,100
Let's look for walkie-talkie parts first.

558
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,060
You just need to find a circuit board that looks like a card.

559
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,500
If you find something similar, show it to me or Yeong Sin.

560
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,830
It could be in the guard's room or the control room.

561
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,780
Let's split up and search.

562
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,630
All right!

563
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,330
Shit.

564
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,650
Open sesame.

565
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,710
Nothing?

566
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,790
Let's go this way.

567
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,640
How much further do we need to go?

568
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,620
Just a bit further.

569
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,950
How far is a bit?

570
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,720
You should have just stayed at the rest stopf if you were just going to complain.

571
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,450
Why did you take her place?

572
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,600
I was going to rest tomorrow. What?

573
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,280
The second day is most painful...

574
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,690
Give me your bag. I'll carry it.

575
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,440
Will you be okay? Thanks.

576
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,880
What if Na Ra says she'll date him?

577
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,490
He doesn't have a reason to reject her.

578
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,080
   

579
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,040
Chili? Vegetable? Jjajang?

580
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,290
Chili? Jjajang?

581
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,400
Gosh! Hurry up. What if someone comes?

582
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,660
Fuck operations. A person has to eat.

583
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,590
We'll die of starvation at this rate.

584
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,560
I think the kids will find out like this.

585
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,500
They meticulously keep track of the food.

586
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,840
Let's just forget it and go.

587
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,140
Yeah, I need to pee.

588
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,530
We'll definitely get caught.

589
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,950
Hey, they won't notice two or three things missing. They'll just assume it dropped somewhere.

590
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,920
Fuck, I never liked this from the start. We should have gone to Seoul from the beginning.

591
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,570
Everyone's nuts over college.

592
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,260
What are you doing?

593
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,780
Oh, my gosh!

594
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,240
Let's go if you're done with quantity check.

595
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,000
Y-Yeah.

596
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,910
Oh, y-yeah.

597
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,780
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

598
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,890
What do we do?

599
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,210
What do we do?

600
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,190
We're in trouble.

601
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,820
Come on.

602
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,310
Where were you guys?

603
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,790
- Did you steal something? 
 - What?

604
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
I was just asking. Why are you so surprised?

605
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,440
Hey...

606
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,410
I...

607
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,470
keep feeling anxious these days.

608
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,490
Wh-What are you anxious about?

609
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,460
Why? Is something wrong?

610
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,060
Just.

611
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,800
Today feels like the last peaceful day for some reason.

612
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,610
Crazy bastard. Don't jinx it.

613
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,570
Which is why I'll ask her today.

614
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,030
Ask what?

615
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,070
Ask Na Ra...

616
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,310
- to go out with me once the war ends. 
 - What?

617
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,530
What? L-Lee Na Ra?

618
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,980
Did you like Lee Na Ra?

619
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,890
Yes, didn't I tell you before?

620
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,250
No way.

621
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,140
Hey, you have a unique taste.

622
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,710
Hey, Do Su Cheol! You're saying you'll confess in this situation?

623
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,070
I know very well... she'll treat you like a crazy bastard.

624
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,790
Isn't this my best chance?

625
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,700
Chance?

626
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,170
She might think today's the last day, like I do.

627
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,470
You become more emotional at times like this.

628
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,960
That's true.

629
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,360
- She might say yes, unexpectedly. 
 - Right?

630
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,180
Hey, Guk Yeong Su, you've never dated before. What would you know?

631
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,710
The column said aloof women are easier to attack.

632
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,340
- Column, my foot. 
 - And Kimchi, you've never dated, either.

633
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,320
Gosh.

634
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,530
Just pray for Hyeong.

635
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,450
Hey, you're going now?

636
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,060
Really?

637
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,670
Gosh, seriously.

638
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,400
I can't sleep because my toe is tingly and itchy.

639
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,570
It's because you warmed it immediately after frostbite.

640
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,130
We'll get some medicine from the hospital, so just wait a bit longer, okay?

641
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,360
Gosh, my dermatitis is driving me crazy too.

642
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,130
Don't scratch it.

643
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,350
Me, too.

644
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm itchy, too.

645
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,890
Hey, yours is a fungal infection.

646
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,500
No, it's not.

647
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,610
- Hey, is— 
 - Shit, you scared me.

648
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,600
Oh, sorry.

649
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,770
Hey, sorry. Sorry.

650
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,380
What the... Is he a moron?

651
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,720
Hey, could you call Na Ra?

652
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,990
Na Ra?

653
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,680
Yes.

654
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,810
I have something to ask her.

655
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,600
Na Ra.

656
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,000
Yes.

657
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm going crazy.

658
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,830
It's not like I can crash the confession.

659
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,580
Be quiet.

660
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,140
Why did you want to talk to me?

661
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,640
What?

662
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,780
Because, well...

663
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,190
What can I do to improve my shooting skills?

664
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,230
Shh!

665
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,670
That dumbass.

666
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,140
He left the room all confident.

667
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,590
Pardon?

668
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,730
How you can improve your shooting skills?

669
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,230
Yes... I was curious.

670
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,640
Jang Su shoots well, too.

671
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,450
J-Jang Su...

672
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,700
Jang Su is sleeping. He sleeps early. He's snoring.

673
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,750
Hey.

674
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,990
At that rate,

675
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,110
don't you think he'll come back without confessing?

676
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,570
Yes.

677
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,320
Man, Do Su Cheol.

678
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,300
He's more pathetic than I thought.

679
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,790
I don't know.

680
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,810
I think I aim best when I'm not nervous.

681
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,690
If I get too nervous,

682
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,770
I have trouble aiming, too.

683
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
So...

684
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,280
don't be nervous and shoot.

685
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,770
That's the key, right?

686
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,070
Chi Yeol,

687
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,780
it's over. It's over.

688
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,420
Game over.

689
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,050
I said it's game over.

690
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,940
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

691
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,740
S-Sure.

692
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,540
Thanks, this late at night.

693
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,700
Sleep well.

694
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,210
Sure.

695
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,110
Yes!

696
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,060
- I told you to trust me. 
 - Thank god.

697
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,420
Na Ra!

698
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,850
Huh?

699
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,220
After the war, we'll return to school.

700
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,780
Yes.

701
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,590
Well...

702
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,870
once we get back safely... will you go out with me?

703
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,310
What?

704
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,820
We're screwed.

705
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,250
Why?

706
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,210
What do you mean, why?

707
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,090
You know how you transferred to our class during our second year?

708
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,400
I liked you since then.

709
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,770
What?

710
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,810
I see.

711
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,700
Are you surprised?

712
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,070
I'm not saying we should date right away.

713
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,860
Just that when we return to school...

714
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,620
we should study together... and hang out together.

715
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,840
There's...

716
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,180
Hey! Stop it.

717
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,060
- There's someone I like— 
 - You don't...

718
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,270
need to answer me right now.

719
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,290
I'd be surprised if I were you, too.

720
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,500
If someone said this to me all of a sudden.

721
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,380
Take some time to think about it, first.

722
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,510
Not too long, though.

723
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,240
Someone she likes...

724
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,990
Is it me?

725
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,230
 Wow! 

726
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,990
 We made eye contact. 

727
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,140
 Now that I think about it... 

728
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,610
 Na Ra and I make eye contact pretty often... 

729
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,400
 No way, does she have feelings for me? 

730
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,570
Oh, it's the hospital!

731
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,880
Hurry, Guk Yeong Su!

732
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,820
   

733
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,610
   

734
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,430
Any spheres?

735
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,700
None.

736
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,000
Let's split up.

737
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,580
Did you hear that?

738
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,140
Let's check it out.

739
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,870
I saw something like this.

740
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,910
What is that sound?

741
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,620
Hey.

742
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,660
Let's just leave for now.

743
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,820
- Did you hear that? 
 - Yes.

744
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,970
What is that sound?

745
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,010
Hey, did you hear that?

746
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,200
Yes.

747
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,990
- Where is the sound coming from? 
 - What could it be?

748
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,290
What could it be?

749
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,840
Is it a sphere?

750
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,710
It's not a sphere.

751
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,810
Then what is it? Shit, I have a bad feeling.

752
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,510
It's getting on my nerves.

753
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,080
Wait.

754
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,310
Listen carefully.

755
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,760
What?

756
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,420
This is an SOS signal.

757
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,340
Didn't you watch the movie?

758
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,950
No way...

759
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,340
Are you saying there's someone here?

760
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,870
Huh?

761
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,490
I think it's coming from inside there.

762
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,280
Is there really something inside?

763
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,370
Everyone be careful.

764
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,670
What's there to be careful about? We should just go home!

765
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,240
What?

766
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,760
Let's just go!

767
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,430
Why?

768
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,160
Who are you guys?

769
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,750
Let go of him!

770
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,060
Are you okay?

771
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,630
Who's there?

772
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,300
Open the door!

773
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,620
Open the door!

774
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,450
   

775
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:35,510
 So Yeon's cold is better, but Il Ha seems to have caught it, so we need cold medicine. 

776
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,380
 And Jun Hui is suffering from frostbite, so we need medicine for that too. 

777
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,160
 And don't you think Deok Jung lost weight? 
   

778
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,840
What? No, not at all.

779
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,940
I guess not.

780
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,550
Yeong Su is studying hard as usual.

781
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,350
So Yeon seems to have trouble sleeping these days.

782
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,460
I should talk to her tomorrow.

783
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,330
- And... 
 - Wow.

784
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,500
How do you know all that...

785
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,690
It's because I'm the one in charge.

786
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,290
Chi Yeol, when you record the students,

787
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,340
 you seem to take extra long when you're filming these with Na Ra. 
   

788
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,310
What?

789
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,290
Na Ra? Na Ra... aigo, well...

790
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,090
Na Ra is...

791
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:24,170
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

792
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,570
Thanks.

793
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,230
Thanks?

794
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,600
What... about you, Yu Jeong?

795
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,410
Is there anything going on with you?

796
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,510
 Me? Well... 
   

797
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,120
I'm just doing what Platoon Leader did.

798
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm also going to do my best...

799
00:52:53,340 --> 00:53:00,750
until this war is over, so we can all go home safely.

800
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,360
Don't push yourself too hard.

801
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,780
Hey, Chi Yeol.

802
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,450
Yes?

803
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,400
If...

804
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,580
By any chance...

805
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,540
Yes. What?

806
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,500
Nevermind... it's nothing.

807
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,370
What was that? So anticlimactic.

808
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,450
   

809
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:49,100
