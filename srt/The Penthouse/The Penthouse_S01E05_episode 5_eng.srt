 Episode 5 

2
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,040
But she's a bit pitiful since she wouldn't have died if she hadn't known anything.

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,070
She dared to threaten us by smartly taking a video?

4
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,670
Forget everything from now on, let's drink a toast.  To our fortunes.

6
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,840
Is someone there?

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,520
To cover up their affair,

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
they pushed her that far?

9
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
These people deserve punishment from the heavens.

10
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,450
I'm going to tear this son of a bitch to pieces.

11
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,900
It's alright, I guess I was a bit sensitive.

12
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,780
- Today... I'd rather go home. 
 - Don't worry,

13
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,820
Min Seol Ah is dead and her cell phone is gone too.

14
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,720
Our secret will be buried forever.

15
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,610
I'm not in that mood, I told you.

16
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,320
Are you hiding something from me?

17
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,340
Of course not.

18
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm just tired.  I'll call you later.

19
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,390
Why are you so startled?

20
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,670
Where have you been?  It's late.

21
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,980
I had a late lesson, so I was in the lesson room.

22
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,410
Oh, were you?

23
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,860
Take it easy.  I got your favorite whiskey as a present.

24
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,030
Shall we have a drink?  I have something to tell you too.

25
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,190
Tell me what?

26
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,430
About that night,

27
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,610
the night when Min Seol Ah died at Hera Palace—

28
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,490
What are you trying to say?  I don't want to think about that night any longer.

29
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,450
Did you forget what Chairman Ju said? Min Seol Ah did not come to Hera Palace.

30
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,290
So, you should stop talking nonsense too.

31
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,090
Why is she lying...

32
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,370
There is no way I did that.

33
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,690
No way I killed her...

34
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,480
No, it's not true...

35
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,080
You had a drink last night, so come have some hangover soup. I made your favorite dried pollack soup.

36
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,070
- When did you come home? 
 - In the morning.  Didn't you hear me taking my shower?

37
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,240
Since the kids are not home and you gave the housekeepers the day-off too, I rushed back home.

38
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,390
When did you prepare all of these?  I know you were having a hard time because of Hye In.

39
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,680
I've been a bit indifferent to you these days because I was busy taking care of Hye In.

40
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,470
I'm sorry.

41
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,840
You haven't heard the news yet, have you?  I heard that girl, Min Seol Ah, died.

42
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,220
 It was apparently a suicide. 

43
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,590
A suicide?

44
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,140
Why, all of a sudden?

45
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,400
Kids without parents are all same, you know.

46
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,090
I guess a person doesn't change until death.  She was so tenacious and ultimately she set her own apartment on fire.

47
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Are you having a fun trip, my princess?  No fighting with  Eun Byeol or Seok Gyeong yet?

48
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,810
Of course, I feel like dying since I miss my princess so much.  I'm going crazy now.

49
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,480
If you have any problems, call me right away, and I'll run to you.

50
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,390
- What's this, did she already hang up? 
 - Was that Je Ni?  Are they having fun?

51
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,900
Since this is a trip with her friends after such a long time, she's so excited.

52
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,260
My Je Ni is so pretty that I feel uneasy when she's out somewhere.

53
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,090
She's not that pretty.  No need to feel that much.  Well, good day.

54
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,210
By the way, what was that blood on that day?

55
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,020
- What do you mean, blood? 
 - You know, on the night of the party, you were in the restroom.

56
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,830
I saw it, Dr. Ha.

57
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,250
 Je Ni's mother, this is the men's washroom, men's washroom. 

58
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,860
Ah, I spilled wine on my clothing.

59
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,880
What do you mean, blood?  Some people might take that the wrong way.  Goodbye.

60
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,970
By any chance, did you do something to that girl, Dr. Ha?

61
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,970
I told no one about what I saw that night.

62
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,880
Je Ni's mother, please watch what you're saying.  Such suspicion is very unpleasant.

63
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,350
Does he take me for a fool?  Did he think I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between wine and blood?

64
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,900
There is definitely something going on.

65
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,520
How much on earth did she see?

66
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,950
Jin Hyeok, what a nice shot!

67
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,680
Pick it up.

68
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,230
What's this?  You told me to hit it for 120 meters.

69
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,920
I hit it for exactly 120 meters, so why did it drop there?  What would've happened if it had gone into the hazard?

70
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,140
The ball must have run some after it landed.

71
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,040
You should've accounted for that in the calculation.

72
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,780
If I lose this game, I'm going to get you.

73
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,900
What are you doing? Eun Byeol, aren't you playing?

74
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,840
What happened to Ha Eun Byeol, making an air shot?

75
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,670
- Hey, there is something going on with you, isn't there? 
 - What do you mean?

76
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,290
I'm just feeling a bit off, that's all.

77
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,850
Take a good look, I'll end this game for you.

78
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,210
Hey!

79
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,350
Oh my god!

80
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,400
Pull yourself together!  Take my hand!

81
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,630
Ju Seok Gyeong!

82
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,430
Oh my god, careful!

83
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,230
Come on.

84
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,480
Everything is wet.

85
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,690
It's all your fault.

86
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,360
This happened because you miscalculated the distance!

87
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,460
Why didn't you tell me there was a plastic sheet on the bottom of this hazard?

88
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,240
You should've told me in advance it would be slippery!

89
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,620
Were you trying to kill a person? Huh?

90
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,800
Stop it, it's okay.  Nothing bad happened, so it's fine.

91
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,290
You're okay, right?  Hurt anywhere?

92
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,180
It felt like someone was dragging me down in the water.

93
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,570
Such a piece of bad luck, that face...

94
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,350
Whose face was it?

95
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
It's nothing, I must have seen it wrong.

96
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,150
You walked a fine line between life and death in such a short moment.

97
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,060
It looks like you saw some sort of Grim Reaper.

98
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,570
Come on.

99
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,710
Oh my god, what should we...

100
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,940
It could've been a disaster.  Can you keep playing?

101
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,340
I'm so pissed off!

102
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Let's end it now.

103
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,100
Oh dear!

104
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,730
What are you doing?  Hurry up and drive us to the snack bar!

105
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,810
It's scary, I want to go home.

106
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,870
What's wrong with you, seriously?  Have you never seen lightning and thunder?

107
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,140
We will get punished for what we did to her.

108
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,990
Shut up!

109
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,640
If you bring that up one more time again, I won't let it go.

110
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,910
Argh!

111
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,910
- Seok Gyeong! 
 - It hurts!

112
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,150
Anyone here?

113
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,490
Min Hyeok...

114
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,380
Help!

115
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,070
Over here!

116
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,820
 Anna's Diary 

117
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,170
 Diary - Writing 

118
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,310
 Diary - Reading 

119
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,500
 April 25th, 2015 - I have a brother 
 April 3rd, 2015 - For the first time, I've got a family  

120
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,010
 For the first time in my life, I've got a family.  

121
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,160
 Welcome, Seol Ah. 

122
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,150
 You wouldn't know how much we've been waiting for you. 

123
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,970
 Let me introduce them to you.  They are going to become your mom and dad.  

124
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,430
 Welcome, my daughter. 

125
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,640
 Shall we go in? 

126
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,780
 From today on, your name will be Anna, Anna Lee. 

127
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,580
 Anna... 

128
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,430
 I was smitten with them from first sight.  

129
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,750
 Our Anna is the prettiest one.  

130
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,640
 Oh.  

131
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,010
 Happy Birthday, Anna 

132
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,820
 Happy birthday, my daughter. 

133
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,670
 Ta-da! 

134
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,280
 I love you, Anna. 

135
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,900
 Wow... 

136
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,070
 I want to try it on.  

137
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,890
 Finally I've got a home and family to return to. I'll live a new life in the U.S as Anna Lee, not as Min Seol Ah.  

138
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,500
 I'll grow up as a proud and amazing person under my parents. 

139
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,890
Why on earth did you get disowned by them, Seol Ah?

140
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,740
Oh, dear.

141
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh, my god.

142
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,040
Min Hyeok's mom, look.

143
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,390
How can she drive that kind of car?

144
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,020
Oh, hello.

145
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,700
How are you all?  Am I a bit late?

146
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,420
You all saw the news that Min Seol Ah died, right?

147
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,910
Seriously, I was so shocked.

148
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,790
Just thinking that such a girl like her could've attended this school, it's so horrible.

149
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,360
So what, even if her voice was great?

150
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,710
I don't understand why such a low-quality girl was accepted as the top student, to begin with.

151
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,290
Shouldn't those judges get reprimanded?

152
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,000
True, her character was way low in quality, wasn't it?

153
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,490
As one of the judges, I apologize.

154
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,930
However, I think this is our opportunity to turn to improving.

155
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,040
This chance allows us, parents, to gather our strength to maintain the reputation of this school

156
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,050
and the root of the problem is now gone too.

157
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,310
That's what I'm saying.

158
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,110
Working in a bar and even having a sugar daddy... What might have happened if our children were badly influenced by her?

159
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,710
Because of one rotten apple, the whole barrel of good names for this prestigious school could've been ruined.

160
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,410
- True, true. 
 - She's right.

161
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,900
Seol Ah...

162
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,760
wasn't a girl like that.

163
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,810
Hello, everyone.

164
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,610
I'm the mother of Bae Ro Na, who got accepted as number one on the waiting list.

165
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,120
Has anyone here ever worked at a part-time job cleaning grills?

166
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,890
I guess not.

167
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,960
Seol Ah had several part-time jobs to do in a day, which is even tough for grown-ups,

168
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,380
and really lived diligently.

169
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,530
How do you know that?

170
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,950
Because I saw it for myself.

171
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,820
As a parent raising a child,

172
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,650
don't you feel a bit ashamed of talking bad about a dead girl?

173
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,780
Who is talking here, after wining a lottery ticket because of a dead girl?

174
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,620
Why aren't you a bit more honest?

175
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,750
You're the one who should have the biggest smile right now.

176
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,590
Because of that dead girl, you got the biggest benefit.

177
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,430
All those words you didn't really mean... How funny it is.

178
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,870
How amazing you are, Oh Yun Hui.  How do you feel after your first parent committee meeting?

179
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,950
In the history of this school, no one on the waiting list for Vocal Music has gotten accepted before.

180
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,660
Are you just lucky or do you have some other talent?

181
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,480
Don't pick a fight with me.

182
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,200
My daughter got accepted fairly, so we have no reason to be mocked by you.

183
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,280
How did you get the settlement payment for my lawsuit?

184
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,310
What?

185
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm asking you how you got ₩100 million in such a short period of time.

186
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,420
I guess you sold your house for your daughter.

187
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,630
What are you talking about?

188
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,380
You just dropped the lawsuit.

189
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,900
Why, did you also think it was too harsh?

190
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,250
Maybe ₩100 million is some pocket money for you,

191
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,970
but for the people like me, it's too huge to get, even after giving up our lives.

192
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,890
Swaying other people with money, gosh...

193
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,230
Thanks for dropping the lawsuit, anyway.

194
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,320
Damn!

195
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,530
All right, you're right.

196
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,350
Since Dr. Ha earnestly asked for my help...

197
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,010
So, that ₩100 million

198
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,830
was my husband's money, you say?

199
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,930
Saying that woman wouldn't have such a big amount of money,

200
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,560
he begged me to save her.

201
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,330
He seemed to feel so bad for her.

202
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,370
How could a lawyer make a settlement behind his client's back?

203
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,500
I will never let this go quietly.

204
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,570
In fact, the key point of this case isn't the assault.

205
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,070
So, are you going to reveal to the world it was because of adultery?

206
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,330
Then, aren't you the one who would lose face here? Your reputation is the most important thing for you, isn't it?

207
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,120
Ah, well, I guess it doesn't matter.  I got it.

208
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,530
Please don't ever tell him that I know about this.

209
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,150
If you do,

210
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,100
I really won't hold it in.

211
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,620
 Incoming call: Mommy 

212
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,780
Oh.

213
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,530
Hey, Mom!

214
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,000
Me?  What do you think I'm doing?

215
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,260
I'm in the middle of a phone call with Mom!

216
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,200
-  Hey!   
 - Huh?

217
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,670
 You crazy bastard! 

218
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,400
Do you know how expensive that is?

219
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,560
It is the handmade watch that your dad paid ₩1.5 billion to win that auction!

220
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,850
But you snuck it out and then lost it!?

221
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,100
Well, Mom, that's not how it happened but...

222
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,790
What!

223
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,080
I just wanted to brag about it.

224
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,170
Because I work under Dad, they subtly disregard me...

225
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,430
Calling me, "Sorry ass, Papa's boy with no money"...

226
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,020
Why are you a Papa's boy?  Mama's boy makes more sense...

227
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,190
Shut up!

228
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,300
Did you two perhaps make a plan to fool me and sell it somewhere else?

229
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,280
Mother, how could I dare to lie to you?

230
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,190
Then, why are we still not getting any news about it when it even has a serial number?

231
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,210
Starting this month, I'll seize Gyu Jin's monthly salary.

232
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,960
No, Mother-in-law!

233
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
It's already so small now.

234
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,210
Gyu Jin will be able to find it.

235
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,350
No, he will definitely find it, Mother-in-law.

236
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,920
You will, right, honey?

237
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,130
Where can I possibly find it?

238
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,150
If your salary is seized, I'm going to die, seriously.

239
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,710
I'll die too.

240
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,280
If I go there again, I might see a ghost. No, I don't want to, it's too scary.

241
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,810
You lived in a place like this...

242
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,100
 Gold Medal - Min Seol Ah / 4th Grade / Yeong Ran Elementary School 

243
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,200
Min Seol Ah...

244
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,370
- Hold on, hold on. 
 - Don't grab me.

245
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,120
You're walking in too fast.

246
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,760
Go search.

247
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,850
Ah, damn...

248
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,990
Gosh...

249
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,970
Why did you bring me here to the place where a girl died?  Damn, this is spine-chilling.

250
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,340
Well, it wasn't in the flowerbed and you never know, so...

251
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,230
I'll give you a big chunk of the commission, Dr. Ha.

252
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,670
That was from Switzerland,

253
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,780
I told you it's the one and only skeleton watch of that model in the world, right?

254
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,730
You've already told me that a hundred times on our way here.

255
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,220
Anyway, it's definitely not in my car

256
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,130
and even if it was dropped here, it was probably burnt to ashes.

257
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,110
So, why did you bring your father's watch without telling him?

258
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,490
Well, why did he set the fire here, then?

259
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,700
If I see Ju Dan Tae... you know,

260
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,030
he's a nut job, totally crazy.

261
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,010
Damn, it's not here, no.

262
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,320
Maybe the police took it.

263
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,360
You'd better tell Chairman Ju everything and ask him to check with the police.

264
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,500
No way, I should never tell him!

265
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,270
With his crappy temper, if he finds out that I dropped something,

266
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,590
it's obvious he would make a huge fuss about it.

267
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,300
This is driving me crazy.

268
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,570
Anyway, because of that little girl, everything is so messed up.

269
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,850
Why did she have to die at other people's apartments and cause such a mess like this!

270
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,780
 Don't, don't do that! 

271
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,980
Omo! It's a ghost, ghost!  Help!

272
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,920
Oh my god, a ghost!

273
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,300
Help! It was a ghost, ghost!

274
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,160
Is this your mom, me?

275
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,180
Seol Ah...

276
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,420
All of them were in on this.

277
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,300
I will never forgive all those people who made you like this...

278
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,360
One by one, I will find every one of them

279
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,890
and tear them to pieces.

280
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,880
Is it you, Sugar?

281
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,670
Sugar.

282
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,220
 That was from Switzerland, 

283
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,300
 I told you it's the one and only skeleton watch of that model in the world, right? 

284
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:58,920
 Min Seol Ah was murdered at Hera Palace 

285
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,640
 Incoming: Secretary Yun 

286
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,230
Yeah?

287
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,070
What did you say? I'll be there, so don't touch it.

288
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,870
Dad, the fountain!

289
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,930
Damn it.

290
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,220
 Min Seol Ah was murdered at Hera Palace 

291
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,890
- Get rid of it.  
 - Yes, Chairman.

292
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,350
Get Forensics to find any fingerprints.

293
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,060
Yes, sir.

294
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,120
Who was the first one to find it?

295
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,190
It was Eun Byeol and Je Ni. They were on their way to the swimming pool.

296
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,100
Look at the CCTV, it was cleverly moved in advance, it's either a person who knows this place very well...

297
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,070
Or a person who lives in this place.

298
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,770
- Then, perhaps there was a witness on that day— 
 - Shush.

299
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,030
Either way, this is someone's malicious intention to shake our Hera Palace by using that girl's death.

300
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,050
Yes. That's right.

301
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,630
This person is trying to scare us by reopening a closed case,

302
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,740
so definitely it's a scheme to decrease our property values.

303
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,320
I'll never let this person get away with this,

304
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,380
anyone who tries to shake Hera Palace, no matter who that might be!

305
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,710
You should!  Of course, you should!

306
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,230
You kids, have you ever seen any suspicious person?

307
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,900
We saw no one.  There was only the two of us.

308
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,060
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

309
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,630
- Eun Byeol!  Eun Byeol! 
 - Eun Byeol!

310
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,590
- Oh my god, are you alright? 
 - Are you okay?  Eun Byeol!

311
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,860
Are you awake now?

312
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,990
Eun Byeol, shall we talk?

313
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,760
When an acquaintance dies, the huge stress of it can affect you.

314
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm thinking about introducing you to my friend, a renowned doctor who specializes in PTSD.

315
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,000
No, I'm okay.

316
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,020
You'd better go to work.

317
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,170
Our Eun Byeol isn't that weak.

318
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,470
Just think about it, Eun Byeol.

319
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,280
This isn't like you, fainting due to this little incident.

320
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,570
You should keep your mind straight, especially in a situation like this.

321
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,340
You should prepare for the concert and the entrance ceremony too.

322
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,380
I heard everything...

323
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,960
The conversation you had with Min Seol Ah in the maintenance room...

324
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,850
What?

325
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,630
Min Seol Ah said she saw everything.

326
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,450
The scorecard from the entrance exam, which you manipulated...

327
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,140
If others find that out, what will happen to us?

328
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,920
Will I be ruined?

329
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,810
That's not going to happen. You know she is dead.

330
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,660
I released her, Min Seol Ah...

331
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,510
From that maintenance room, I did.

332
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,640
What?

333
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,480
Why did you?

334
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,850
 Who knows? I might know much more 

335
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,160
 than you think I do. 

336
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,100
 What can you possibly know? You're nothing.  

337
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,860
 The corruption of the entrance exam for Cheong Ah Arts School.  

338
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,840
 I know everything! 

339
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,020
 Your daughter, Ha Eun Byeol.  Did she get accepted fairly and justly? 

340
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,320
 Didn't she get accepted just by taking another person's seat? 

341
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,390
 I saw everything, you know.  

342
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,510
 The scorecard from the Cheong Ah Arts School's entrance exam, which you manipulated. 

343
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,890
 Die! 

344
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,050
 Die! 

345
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,710
 Die! 

346
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,630
 I trusted you though.  

347
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,590
 About me messing up on my singing test, you were the only one I told! 

348
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,790
 But you blackmailed my mom with that!  Are you even a human!? 

349
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,540
 I had no other choice.  

350
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,430
 To protect myself, 

351
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,030
 I had to have at least one thing which could scare your mother.  

352
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,660
 I'll give you my cell phone, so untie me.  

353
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,620
 How can I trust your words? 

354
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,950
 I'm also so tired now.  

355
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,660
 Your mom and all adults here... 

356
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,300
 I'm sick of all of them.  

357
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,990
 I don't want to get involved with them anymore.  

358
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,460
 So, untie me, and I'll give you what you want.  

359
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,610
 Really? 

360
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,910
 If you try to trick me, I won't stay still.  

361
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,290
 Hey!  Stop right there! 

362
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,040
 Hey!  Stop! 

363
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,520
 Don't do this, Eun Byeol.  Please.  

364
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,490
 Give me, give me your cell phone! 

365
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,440
She died because of me.  Because of me...

366
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,390
It's not your fault.  Min Seol Ah...

367
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,570
She just missed a step while running away.

368
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,220
But... Min Seol Ah died at Bosong Village though.

369
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,500
Didn't she?  No way, then at Hera Palace...

370
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,850
Tell me.  Did she die at Hera Palace?

371
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:03,060
Listen to me carefully.  That night, Min Seol Ah committed suicide on the rooftop of her apartment.

372
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,810
Do you understand me?  Answer me!

373
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,640
No.  No, it isn't true though. It's a lie!

374
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,170
I'm telling you, believe my words!

375
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,320
About this story, do the other kids know too?

376
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,320
Don't tell anyone, ever. You shouldn't even utter a word about it until your death.

377
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,960
You weren't there at that time. You don't know anything about it, got it?

378
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,640
This is the secret between you and me.  Understand?

379
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,820
Forget it, everything about that girl.  She was just

380
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,900
destined to die.  So...

381
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,020
it was never your fault.

382
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,650
Prepare yourself or you will be late for the practice session for the concert.

383
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,710
   

384
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,010
   

385
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,490
 (all marked 8-10 points out of 10) 

386
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,750
   

387
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,090
   

388
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,310
   

389
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,110
   

390
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,570
 (All marked 1 point out of 10 / "Discard") 

391
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,250
 (All marked 1 point out of 10 / "Discard") 

392
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,060
 (changed to 9-10 points) 

393
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,980
 (changed to 9-10 points) 

394
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,590
   

395
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,130
It's alright, she's already cremated.  Everything is gone.

396
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,220
There is no way that this will be revealed to the world.

397
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,250
Did you say you want to know the contact details of her adoptive parents?

398
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,300
I know nothing, except for the fact that she was adopted in the U.S.

399
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,620
   

400
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,060
I'm sorry, but I can't give you any personal information.

401
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,300
And since her adoption was already cancelled and their relationship is over, the parents don't want to be reconnected.

402
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,970
They don't want it?  What was the reason for canceling her adoption?

403
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,800
   

404
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,330
   

405
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,530
   

406
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,550
The record shows that she was deported after committing a crime.

407
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,310
A-A crime?

408
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,920
We don't know any more than that.

409
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,180
Damn it!  Why do you keep digging into that closed case?

410
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,870
I have to know who her adoptive parents were and why her adoption was canceled.

411
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,970
I told you, I don't know either.

412
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,600
And... Seol Ah is already dead too.

413
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,780
How did you know that?

414
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,120
Well, obviously I was informed because she used to be at my facility!

415
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,170
Because she died with a huge commotion, setting a fire before her death, it was on the news!

416
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,670
On the news, her name wasn't mentioned.

417
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,750
What are you hiding?  What on earth is it?!

418
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,860
Was it her, who visited you?

419
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,650
Yes, sir.  She came to me several times, asking a lot of questions about Min Seol Ah.

420
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,890
Well, after abandoning her years ago, now she's...

421
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,120
You didn't say anything about me, did you?

422
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,660
Of course not.  How can I say that unless I'm crazy?

423
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,410
If this works out well, I might catch a big fish.

424
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,940
She's a kid who can become big money even after her death.

425
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,750
Oh, Min Hyeok, how can you be so good at instruments too?

426
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,620
Oy, Waiting List.

427
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,330
Oh, so you're the one on the waiting list.

428
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,030
Nice to see you, Waiting List. I've heard a lot about you.

429
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,030
I'm told you're such an annoying nuisance.

430
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,940
My name is Bae Ro Na, not Waiting List.

431
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,830
- She's quite tough indeed. 
 - See?  She's like this.

432
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,360
She has such a thick-skinned face.

433
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,470
 (in Italian) Buon Giorno.  You can speak Italian, can't you? 

434
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:45,330
 Look at her style... Dang, it's so tacky. 

435
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:49,320
 (in Chinese) Still, her face is quite pretty.  

436
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,490
 (in German) You said she's pretty?  Do you have a problem with your eyes? 

437
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,530
Are you that proud of foreign language skills?  Is that the only thing you can brag about?

438
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,720
If you don't want to sit with me, move out of my way.

439
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,620
Oh, Min Hyeok.  Look at this, I got hurt.

440
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,110
It hurts.  She's totally a thug!

441
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:16,030
She's acting quite tough, despite being on the waiting list.  Is being brazen her style concept?

442
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,850
Why not, she's full of energy.

443
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,050
That's enough.

444
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,090
This is getting too childish, we're not elementary school kids.

445
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,280
It doesn't matter whether she was on the waiting list or not, since we are all friends.

446
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm Ju Seok Gyeong.  Let's get along well.

447
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,780
I'm Bae Ro Na, nice to meet you.

448
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,890
What's wrong with her?

449
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,270
Hey, we've got big trouble!

450
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,620
On the homepage of Cheong Ah Art School, there is a post about the reason for Min Seol Ah's death.

451
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,020
 - Wait, wait! Please! 
 - Here, here, look this way.  

452
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,380
 ...we should stomp on her.  This is why your parents abandoned you! 

453
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,920
   

454
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,910
   

455
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,540
   

456
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,430
   

457
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,290
   

458
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,110
 Prison meals are ready for them, go, go! 

459
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,430
 I'm sure there must be more victims. 

460
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,000
 Warning for Chills: The Reason Why Min Seol Ah Died 

461
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 We're sorry but this account is unavailable at the moment 

462
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,020
For now, we've closed our official SNS accounts.

463
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,590
However, since there are kids who've already watched the file, it won't be easy to completely block it.

464
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,290
What about the students' parents?

465
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,700
We're getting a lot of requests to have this issue investigated thoroughly.

466
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,710
Who on earth did this...

467
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,760
Min Seol Ah, that kid, is still a problem even after her death.

468
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,400
It turned out we should've promoted Bae Ro Na on the waiting list quicker, as her mother suggested.

469
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,440
- Bae Ro Na's mother? 
 - Yes, ma'am.

470
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,130
For a while, she visited me every day and begged.

471
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,830
Asking me if there was any kid canceling the acceptance, she harassed me so much for a while.

472
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:02,460
Was there.... such a case like that?

473
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:12,660
Make one anonymous letter. There is also something I'd like you to investigate.

474
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,560
The banner on the fountain and the video file posted on the CAAS web site,  (CAAS - Cheong Ah Arts School) 

475
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,560
are all done by the same person!

476
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,220
No need to be upset.  Since the victim is already dead, the police won't be able to investigate further.

477
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,740
If this becomes an issue on any TV show, we would never know.

478
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,280
These days, there's no way we can stop anything on SNS.  (SNS - Social network sites) 

479
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,000
Dr. Ha, you're talking as if this doesn't concern you.

480
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,670
If this case goes public, all of us, including our children, will die.

481
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,730
I know, right?  To be honest, Min Seol Ah was at fault too.

482
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,640
She lied about her age and credentials to get a tutoring job, so she didn't do anything better either.

483
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,800
I don't think it was all our kids' fault to make Min Seol Ah die.

484
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,380
What do you mean?

485
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,410
Bae Ro Na, who was number one on the waiting list.

486
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,480
It seems her mother approached Min Seol Ah.

487
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,220
What are you talking about?

488
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:07,750
What about her?  What did she say?  No way. She didn't ask her to give up her spot, did she?

489
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,730
She is really something, that woman is.

490
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,500
Oh my god, this means she threatened that poor girl?

491
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,820
The nature of this sin is very nasty.

492
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,640
Covering up news with some other news is always the best answer.

493
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,950
We're just changing the target, from our children to someone else.

494
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,100
True, since a rumor is scarier than a truth.

495
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,330
We'll overcome this crisis, this time too, as we always do.

496
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,730
Do you have any concrete proof that she blackmailed Min Seol Ah?

497
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,990
Right now, we're looking for proof.

498
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,950
Once as it's gathered, our school foundation will call an emergency meeting for parents.

499
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,690
Please take good care of it, Assemblyman Jo.

500
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,220
Please keep this issue from being reported on the news.

501
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,250
You know I'm not the type of person who forgets who gave me a favor.

502
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,140
For Assemblyman Song of the Independence Party, here is the money for his slush fund.

503
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,200
I thought he would need it for him to be re-elected for a third term.

504
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,030
It's not like we've known each other only for a short time,

505
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,390
so I will do my best, as much as possible.

506
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,590
Sorry about this, but it's an urgent call.

507
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,010
Yes.

508
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,830
You look so dignified whenever I meet you, Madame.

509
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,170
This beautiful penthouse suits you well.

510
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,380
I'll take my leave first for you two to talk.

511
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,520
Min Seol Ah.

512
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,230
How do you know her?

513
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,120
And how do you... know her?

514
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,480
A politician and an orphan. There's nothing suspicious about such a relationship.

515
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,740
But, it's different with you.

516
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,090
If Chairman Ju knew,

517
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,520
that you had a biological daughter...

518
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,250
What are you talking about?

519
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,350
You know, on the outside of a greenhouse,

520
00:47:55,350 --> 00:48:00,170
sometimes you get storms and lightning.

521
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,620
I am saying if the conversation between you and me goes well,

522
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,800
you won't get kicked out of this penthouse.

523
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:42,200
 Since 1972...Cheong Ah Arts School and Foundation For The Arts] 

524
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,860
 Oh Yun Hui, let's end our ill-fate as of today. 

525
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,130
Today, due to the proxy given to me by the Chairman of Cheong Ah Arts Foundation, I am

526
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,080
standing here to lead this emergency meeting.

527
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,860
What is the reason... for calling me here today?

528
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,720
A few days ago, an anonymous letter was delivered to the Principal of Cheong Ah Arts School.

529
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Student Lee Min Hyeok's mother will read its content.

530
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,260
"I'm denouncing one mother who is twisted with menace and obsession.

531
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,890
She is the mother of the student who was first on the waiting list."

532
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,050
What are you saying right now?

533
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,180
Please have a seat.

534
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:07,340
"She is a murderer.

535
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,930
In order to enroll her own daughter, she continuously, to a pitiful student,

536
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,690
she tenaciously coaxed her to give up her enrollment.

537
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:21,280
That's because this student didn't have parents.

538
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,790
If that child died because of this mother,

539
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,640
please make Cheong Ah Arts School take strong measures

540
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,430
to  prevent any injustice regarding this child's death."

541
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,380
   

542
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,220
Crazy, crazy, crazy!

543
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,420
"I'm denouncing one mother who is twisted with menace and obsession."

544
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,940
Isn't this talking about your mom?

545
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,020
You are number one on the waiting list.

546
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,070
She's a murderer?

547
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,300
This is crazy.

548
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,030
 It's not true. 

549
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:12,510
I didn't do anything to that child!

550
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,680
To my knowledge, the kids from Hera Palace are the ones that did her wrong.

551
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,360
Which is why that child committed suicide.

552
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,500
Do you think that's what really happened?

553
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,310
I gave her some information by a mistake.

554
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,450
Information about that child to that person.

555
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,900
 Oh, right.  I heard that there is an orphan among the accepted students. 

556
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,890
 Why don't you go find that child? 

557
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:38,690
 Who knows?  If you give that kid a lot of money, 

558
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,090
 that kid may give it up. 

559
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:46,560
I never would have imagined that she would really go looking for her there.

560
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:51,570
I'll take it from here.

561
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,680
My name is Lee Gyu Jin.

562
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,430
Ms. Oh Yun Hui?  After hearing that there was an orphan,

563
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,730
you came here, to Cheong Ah Arts, right away, correct?

564
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,250
I'm told that you came and went to the Principal's office, correct?

565
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,500
What are you all doing right now?

566
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,180
That's right.

567
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:15,400
Do you remember the conversation you had with Oh Yun Hui at that time?

568
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,360
She demanded the list of accepted students.

569
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,450
That was... really, I was only thinking just in case...

570
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:28,750
Just in case!  If you threatened a powerless and poor child,

571
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,900
she might give up her enrollment!

572
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,350
It was probably because of that hope.

573
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,720
Was it not?

574
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,860
By any chance, was it your mom who pushed Min Seol Ah

575
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,120
from the rooftop?

576
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,610
You mean she'd go to such lengths for her daughter?

577
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,810
Chills.

578
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:53,030
Now that I think of it, your mother came to meet us the day after Min Seol Ah's death, with bloodied hands.

579
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,350
What do you think really happened?

580
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,620
Did she kill Min Seol Ah and try to cover it up as a suicide?

581
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,010
Are you done talking?

582
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,170
Do you want to die!

583
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,260
How dare you come at me?  Do you really want to die?

584
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,220
At that time...

585
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,680
I was desperate.

586
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,230
Since the people said that her enrollment might get canceled,

587
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:49,030
I thought my Ro Na might get the chance.

588
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,320
But...

589
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,060
So?  To that pitiful kid

590
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,730
who had no parents...

591
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,720
Were you stalking her!

592
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,790
No, I'm telling you I didn't!

593
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,260
It is true that I went to look for that child.

594
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,500
Speaking of which, she told us that she had seen Min Seol Ah working at part-time jobs.

595
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,200
If she hadn't stalked her, how would she have known where she works part-time?

596
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,110
Isn't that true?

597
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:22,600
That's right! I remember that!

598
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,990
That's good that you're pointing that out.

599
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:33,480
And so, I brought this person as my witness.

600
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,230
That lady came to my restaurant.

601
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:50,610
Now that I think of it, I'm sure that she was trying to do poor Min Seol Ah wrong.

602
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,840
What are you saying?

603
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,450
Who's the one who did wrong to that kid?

604
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:02,830
Shouldn't we be reporting this to the police, instead of doing this?

605
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,260
 It was the first time, that someone took my side. 

606
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:20,010
 What are you doing! Hey! 

607
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,290
 Are you crazy? Are you determined to make my business go bankrupt? 

608
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,810
 You! Don't even think about receiving money for the next three months. Got it? 

609
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,190
 From morning till night. 

610
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,430
 Please Sajangnim! 

611
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,470
 I need the money. You haven't even paid me for the last month. 

612
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,320
 Are you crazy? 

613
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,720
 Do you know how much all the plates you broke cost? Hurry and clean this up! 

614
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,790
 Clean this up and wash them! 

615
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,490
 What are you doing? 

616
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:54,160
 Isn't it wrong to have her carry such heavy grills in the first place? 

617
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,930
 This is child abuse! I'm going to report you. 

618
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:58,920
 Who are you! 

619
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,530
 I'm her parent! What! 

620
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,600
 Get up right this instant. 

621
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,020
 There are a lot of other places you can earn money. 

622
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,680
 Why are you working under such a scumbag? 

623
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,520
 Is that ajumma crazy? 

624
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,050
 Get away before I call the police! 

625
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,970
 Where are you going! C-Clean this up! 

626
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,160
 Thank you for bringing me here. 

627
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,230
 What will you do, getting fired from your job because of me? 

628
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,460
 I can find another. 

629
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,600
 Take this and buy yourself some food. 

630
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,550
 It's okay, I have money. 

631
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,000
 It's because I feel bad. 

632
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,430
 Take it. 

633
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,800
 Do you live here? 

634
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,020
 I will contact you if I come across any good job opportunities. 

635
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,740
 Receiving a favor at no price for the first time, 

636
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,150
 I don't think I'll be able to forget it. 

637
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,220
It's true that I briefly held ill intentions toward the child.

638
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,860
But I felt sorry for her after seeing her difficult life.

639
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,280
So I wanted to help her in some way.

640
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,230
I even wanted to help her get a job!

641
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,890
You're not even Min Seol Ah's guardian. Why would you go that far?

642
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:39,910
Weren't you trying... to strike a deal with her so she would give up her admittance?

643
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,810
I said it's not like that!

644
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,760
Don't. Don't be mad.

645
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,680
Now. If that's the case, all of us

646
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:58,630
should now go back to the night Min Seol Ah died.

647
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:05,820
Ms. Oh Yun Hui, what were you doing that night and where?

648
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,780
That night...

649
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,690
You were drinking.

650
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,370
After that?

651
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,290
A-After that...

652
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,800
I don't remember.

653
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,040
She just said that she does not remember!

654
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,230
That means, in terms of what happened the night of the accident,

655
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:40,160
Ms. Oh Yun Hui has no idea what she did.

656
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,740
She has no alibi!

657
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,990
What are those wounds on your hands?

658
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,960
I'm sure you don't remember those, either?

659
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,190
It appears that this matter is now out of our hands.

660
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,970
Let's call the police.

661
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,410
Principal, until this whole situation has been completely resolved,

662
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,220
I request you to reconsider Bae Ro Na's acceptance.

663
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,340
If not, we parents will all reject the admittance of our children.

664
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,240
Alright, then. We will decide through a majority vote.

665
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:33,000
If you are against the admittance of Bae Ro Na... please raise your hand.

666
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,790
Please state the conclusion.

667
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,290
What's wrong with all of you?

668
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,490
I really did not do anything to her.

669
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:59,690
Seriously! Please believe me!

670
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,320
 (Acting) Chairwoman 

671
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:11,520
If this is what the parents want, as the acting Chairwoman of the school,

672
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,200
I have no choice but to retract Bae Ro Na's...

673
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,290
 Just a moment, please. 

674
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:27,900
I know where Oh Yun Jui was that night.

675
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,860
Dr. Ha! Sit!

676
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:37,150
That night, she was with me. At Hera Palace.

677
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,030
 Hey, you! 

678
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,230
 Ah, really, let go. 

679
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,830
 Let go of me! 

680
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,830
 How did you get here? 

681
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,020
 Ha Yun Cheol? 

682
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,930
 It is you, Ha Yun Cheol. 

683
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,020
 Go back. Seo Jin will make a scene if she sees you. 

684
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,200
 Is your wife that scary? 

685
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,410
 Are you happy after abandoning me and going to her? 

686
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,630
 You're no different from Cheon Seo Jin. 

687
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,950
 You didn't believe me either! 

688
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,270
 Out of my way! 

689
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,050
 - Come on. 
 - Let go of me! 

690
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,130
 My misery started with Cheon Seo Jin. 

691
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,240
 I don't care, whoever interferes with my daughter's future, 

692
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,840
 I'll destroy all of them. 

693
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,420
 So get out of my way! 

694
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,600
 Come here. 

695
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,330
 Let me go! 

696
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,300
 Get away! 

697
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,290
 Yun Hui! 

698
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,480
 Yun Hui! 

699
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,590
 Yun Hui, get a hold of yourself! You're hurt! 

700
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:54,190
 Let go of me! 

701
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,740
 It's because of this. Because of this, my life was ruined! 

702
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,150
 Because of this... 

703
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,590
 Give me your hand. 

704
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,020
Do you have proof?

705
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,890
We can't blindly trust your words, Dr. Ha.

706
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:29,300
Everything should've been recorded on the security footage.

707
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,390
You all should stop this witch hunt already.

708
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,060
How exactly is pushing the blame on an innocent person for the benefit of Cheong Ah Arts?

709
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:41,430
Min Seol Ah's death has already been confirmed to be a suicide!

710
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,820
Must you really create another victim to sleep soundly at night?

711
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,820
What are you doing? Did your heart hurt when you saw your first love like that?

712
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,290
Don't you think you forced all of this to happen?

713
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,600
The best that smart brain of yours could come up with was turning an ordinary woman into a criminal?

714
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,720
You think Oh Yun Hui who forced her way into my lessons without permission is ordinary?

715
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,890
She's still stuck in a ridiculous delusion all by herself! Do you know?

716
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,570
But...

717
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,600
someone who calls himself my husband takes her side?

718
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,830
That! That was because she was so drunk.

719
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,760
I thought she shouldn't see you...

720
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,530
You!

721
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,400
You call that an excuse?

722
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,520
So...

723
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,960
So, you gave her ₩100 million?

724
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,770
You... knew?

725
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,180
What's going on between you two? Were you guys secretly dating behind my back?

726
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,420
You still haven't forgotten that good-for-nothing first love!

727
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,960
It's not like that, don't jump to that conclusion!

728
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:26,230
Then? Then how else am I supposed to understand why you paid that much money in her place?

729
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,990
You stepped all over my pride.

730
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,590
I can never let this slide.

731
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:39,500
Wait and see

732
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,160
how I'm going to respond.

733
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,870
What if scars remain on your pretty face?

734
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,140
Why do you keep getting hit like a fool?

735
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,770
I'm just letting them do it. You think I can't fight?

736
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:05,340
So why would you let them do it? It makes my heart hurt.

737
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,870
Then what am I supposed to do?

738
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:10,390
What if I hit them wrong and they demand another settlement fee?

739
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,570
We're poor. You want to sell this house, too?

740
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,950
Je Ni's mom is even worse. Can you handle that?

741
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,930
So, that's why you couldn't fight back?

742
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,200
Don't worry.

743
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,710
It didn't hurt at all.

744
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,990
That brat has such weak fists.

745
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,660
She's so freaking weak.

746
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,060
Don't look at me like that!

747
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,760
I'll just step on them with my skills later.

748
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,080
I'm so sad.

749
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,390
 Next on the news. 

750
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,570
 Last night, one media company reported an adultery scandal 

751
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,940
 between the two-term Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon and an actress.  

752
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,590
 Assemblyman Jo is insisting that this is groundless fake news. 

753
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:58,000
 He has announced that he will file a lawsuit against the people who spread this rumor. 

754
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,390
 Reporter Song, please tell us the details. 

755
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,420
 Yes, Assemblyman Jo is currently in a scandal with an unknown actress... 

756
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,580
That surprised me.

757
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,710
 ...stating the consistent claim of innocence... 

758
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,400
   
 If these rumors turn out to be true... 

759
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,350
 he has stated he will drop out of the race. 

760
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,270
 Amidst this surprising... 

761
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,000
 Oh Yun Hui. This was your doing, wasn't it? 

762
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,570
If you took my money, you should've kept your mouth shut for the rest of your life.

763
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:23,130
What... are you talking about, Assemblyman Jo?

764
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,640
You released that news! How dare you act innocent!

765
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,770
Come here right now and return every cent I gave you

766
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:32,010
or I'm going to ruin your daughter's life forever!

767
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,600
H-Hello...

768
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,160
Hello? Hello? Assemblyman Jo?

769
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,630
Assemblyman Jo?

770
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:59,990
It's me, Oh Yun Hui. Are you inside?

771
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,160
Assemblyman Jo, I'm coming in!

772
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,670
Assemblyman Jo, I'm coming up!

773
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:15,630
Assemblyman Jo, are you here?

774
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,170
Assemblyman Jo?

775
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:43,400

 I don't know anything.

01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,360
 You're the one who stabbed the person you loved in the back and came to me! 

781
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,910
 That means there's a witness! 

782
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,440
 There's someone I'm suspicious of. 

783
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,270
 Su Ryeon? 

784
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,680
 What if Su Ryeon saw us? 

785
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,430

01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:09,710
 How long has it been? Since you betrayed me?
