1
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,270
No way!

2
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,530
 Was Sugar Min Seol Ah's dog? 

3
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,720
 Min Seol Ah and Sugar, both of them... 

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,280
 Both died in this house. 

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
 What is this? 

6
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,210
Ro Na...

7
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,840
Let's move out.

8
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,620
I don't think I can live here.

9
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,980
Oh Yun Hui, how dare you! 
    

10
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,830
You dare to hinder my business?

11
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,510
Is it the time to relax and exercise right now?

12
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,840
Oh Yun Hui... that woman... did you meet her?

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,480
I even took a loan out on the law firm building without letting my father know.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,150
After making a plan, we should carefully carry it out.

15
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,460
If we just meet her without any plan, what are we going to do?

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,570
Then Attorney Lee or Dr. Ha, did you find out anything about Oh Yun Hui?

17
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,940
The way you talk irritates me so much.

18
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,490
Who caused this trouble for us?

19
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,270
By any chance, Dr. Ha, you didn't leak the information to her, did you?

20
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,300
Does what you are saying make any sense?

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,460
That night!

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,080
Dr. Ha, you drank with Oh Yun Hui!

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,350
The fact is that while having an affair with her secretly, you leaked the information to her.

24
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,530
Hey, Ha Yun Cheol!

25
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,160
What nonsense!

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
Are you saying that I was a spy?

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,010
Why would I do that when I even put all of my friends' money into this project?

28
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,600
I never did it.  I swear it on my Eun Byeol.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,020
I really hope that is true.

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,260
Otherwise, you'll die by my hands.

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,620
It means there is someone who gives her real estate information

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,480
and watches her back.

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
How could her information be so correct—

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,460
 Checking System 

35
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,430
 Danger!  Virus App Found! 

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,160
  Checking  

37
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,350
  Wiretapping app under examination  

38
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,560
 Eavesdropping app detected! 

39
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,300
 Being tapped. 

40
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,630
The installed app was deleted.

41
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,320
Who would dare to eavesdrop on my cell phone?

42
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,500
 In three months' time, there'll be an announcement of Bosong Village's redevelopment.  

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,130
 The country's largest shopping village will be built right here. 

44
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,430
 Bring as much money as you can, 

45
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,280
 the investment is guaranteed to gross five times more. 

46
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,350
Don't tell me that it is Sim Su Ryeon?

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
 No signal  

48
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,550
Honey, what brings you to my study?

49
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm borrowing your book.

50
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,470
Search.

51
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,850
There is nothing detected on the detector.

52
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,520
Nothing?

53
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,510
I'm going to get ready for work.

54
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,480
Did you summon me, Chairman?

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,670
Is there anything unusual about my wife?

56
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,880
There is nothing unusual.

57
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,710
She is getting along with her children.

58
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,570
And it seems she socializes with another parent as well.

59
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,860
Whose parent?

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,490
She's called Bae Ro Na, Seok Gyeong's friend.  Her mom

61
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,730
visited her at home a few days ago.

62
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,560
If it's Bae Ro Na's mom ... Oh Yun Hui?

63
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,720
Your wife has met Oh Yun Hui a few times.

64
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,390
Why are you showing it to me now!

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,000
 No way, you... and Oh Yun Hui, that woman? 

66
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,560
Are you going to work even today too?

67
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,710
I heard Teacher Cheon wouldn't work because the students went on a  field trip today.

68
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,070
so we will be having lunch together after a long time.

69
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,430
How nice it would be for Hera Club women to gather together.

70
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,950
I got it. Go back to work quickly, Dongsaeng.( Younger sibling )

71
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,700
Is she busy?  What kind of CEO can't take even one day off?

72
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,800
It'll obviously show in kids getting affected when their mother stays out during the critical time of their lives.

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,510
Why did she start working all of a sudden?

74
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,420
She is the daughter of Simwun Construction.

75
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,090
That construction company is in the top 5 in this country.

76
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,820
If she took after her dad, she must be competent in running a business.

77
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,500
Didn't that company already disappear without any trace?

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,300
There is still the furniture company left. It is our country's best brand.

79
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,880
Yes! It's me.

80
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,330
Why are you calling now?  I was waiting for so long.

81
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,170
What reservation?  Where? Who is calling?

82
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll dash over right now. Yes.

83
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,850
What to do? Something happened and I need to go.

84
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,120
I have some urgent business and I can't help it.  I'm going.

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,850
Again?

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,260
- Don't you think Je Ni's mom is suspicious, Teacher Cheon? 
 - Why?

87
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,600
This is not the first time she's ditched us after getting a call.

88
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Whomever she meets, wherever they meet, every time she comes back,

89
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,400
it's a given that she will be carrying shopping bags full of luxury brand items.

90
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,830
Then she washes up.

91
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,940
What?

92
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,920
Well, a few days ago...

93
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,960
 - I found you! 
 - That startled me! 

94
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,570
 Did you go somewhere? 

95
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,890
 The department store.  I went shopping for  a while. 

96
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,300
 The shopping diet seems to be perfect for me. 

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,580
 I lose 2 kg soon after walking through a department store. 

98
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,270
 That bag... did you buy it today? 

99
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,900
 It's beautiful isn't it? A brand new item. 

100
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,770
 It created a sensation 

101
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,990
 when Ashlyn Pierce appeared with it in a fashion magazine. 

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,900
 But that bag isn't available in our country. How did you buy it? 

103
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,120
 Actually, my close unni bought it in Europe. 

104
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,510
 She said she didn't like it and gave it to me. 

105
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,640
 Who gives such an expensive gift? 

106
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,490
 I've heard it is such a limited edition that even global celebrities can't find it. 

107
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,620
 It's a rare item, so she gave me a gift. 

108
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,820
 I have a lot of wealthy unnies. I've got to go. 

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,100
 The perfume is different from this morning. Did you re-apply your makeup? 

110
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,510
 Just where did you go today? 

111
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,930
 - Perhaps— 
 - Perhaps, what! 

112
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,330
 Sang Ah, don't you have anything better to do?  Memorizing someone else's perfume. 

113
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,940
 That's why  Min Hyeok is always in last place. 

114
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,280
 If you don't have anything to do, watch your kid well. 

115
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm certain it's a man. She has a sponsor.

116
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,360
How can someone raising a daughter be a dirty cheat?

117
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,750
I wonder if she feels ashamed for Je Ni.

118
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,590
You didn't even see it yourself.

119
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,740
You know that saying that speculation is defamation, don't you?

120
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,220
I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

121
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,860
Since Je Ni's mother isn't here, let's have lunch later.

122
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,930
   

123
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,460
Hey, don't laugh.

124
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,030
- Didn't you find out?  
 - I don't know.

125
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,580
   

126
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,910
   

127
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,710
Sim Su Ryeon. 
  P A P A 

128
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,600
J King Holdings's Chairman Ju Dan Tae's wife...

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Aish.

130
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,210
Sugar died?

131
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,960
Because Ro Na had become so attached to her, she was very sad.

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,840
She went to the charnel house in the morning and to school  while crying.

133
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,910
Perhaps because she's grown up as an only child, she gives her heart easily.

134
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,900
I see.

135
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,860
I hoped Ro Na would take care of her.

136
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,220
By the way, how is your husband?

137
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,550
Since he lost at the auction, he must be furious now.

138
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,340
Unni.

139
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,070
- Unni. 
 - Yes?

140
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,020
I asked, how is your husband?

141
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,270
He tends not to display anything at home.

142
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,190
What do you think to do from now on?

143
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,950
I'll sell it to him after getting as much as I can.

144
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,150
Maybe the price will be whatever I ask for.

145
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,940
How much should I ask for?

146
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,970
I don't know anything.  Do as you please.

147
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,210
Can I really do that?

148
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,670
One moment.

149
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,570
Hello?

150
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,550
This is Ju Dan Tae.

151
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,810
We've met a few times.

152
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,920
Ju Seok Hun's dad?

153
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,750
 J King Holdings  

154
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,060
Oh Yun Hui has arrived.

155
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,490
Alright.

156
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,920
Thank you for coming. Sit down, please.

157
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,250
 Never show intimidation or that you're flustered, 

158
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,430
 because he becomes stronger to a weak person. 

159
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,730
Why did you want to meet with me?

160
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,910
What tea would you like?

161
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,630
I'm good. I have a prior engagement, so I have to get going soon.

162
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,690
Then, I'll get straight to the point.

163
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,610
You have a house in Myeongdong that you won through an auction, correct?

164
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,730
How did you know that?

165
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,700
You're very lucky.

166
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,010
You bought in Bosong Village before news of its redevelopment was released. Now, you've got a house in Myeongdong as well.

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,980
I guess you've done a background check on me.

168
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,300
You can say that it was out of mere interest.

169
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,440
I was wondering how you got that information.

170
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,810
You must know very well if you're interested in me.

171
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,660
I've worked in real estate for ten years.

172
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,900
Naturally, I gained an eye for determining which places were of value.

173
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,330
That house won't be very useful for you, Ms. Oh Yun Hui.

174
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,160
It's on the verge of collapse and the site is too small to construct a new building.

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm well aware.

176
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,790
I bought that place strictly for investment purposes.

177
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,250
I heard rumors that a shopping center is being built there.

178
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,640
Although I'm sure that's information you already know.

179
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,100
Sell it to me.  I'll pay you 30% more than you  bought it for.

180
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,960
The place is worthless and you'll only pointlessly be paying more taxes.

181
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,590
What you just said makes me believe that place is quite valuable.

182
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,500
I like the way you think.

183
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,900
It's as beautiful as your appearance.

184
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,420
 Don't be fooled by his manners. 

185
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,250
 He'll try to sweet-talk his way into your heart. 

186
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,100
I heard your husband died

187
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,880
and you've been struggling to raise your daughter alone.

188
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,540
There's a principle that there is a finite amount of luck in the world.

189
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,010
I think you've used up all your luck already.

190
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,660
Alright. I'll raise it by a full 100 percent.

191
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,210
You will never receive a better offer.

192
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,130
That is a very nice offer.

193
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm glad you like the offer.

194
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,390
Let's sign on it immediately.

195
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,580
 Real Estate Transfer Contract 

196
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,250
Hold on a moment.

197
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,310
I said it was a nice offer. I never said I would accept it.

198
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,460
What are you trying to pull right now?

199
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,880
 He has a habit of rubbing his fingers when he feels uneasy. 

200
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,210
 That's when you throw your trump card. 

201
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,680
I mean I will reject your offer.

202
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,200
I'll have to get going due to other plans.

203
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,890
I enjoyed our conversation today.

204
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,790
Ms. Oh Yun Hui.

205
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,750
I heard you're close to my wife.

206
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:56,240
Maybe that's how you knew. Did my wife pass along the information?

207
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,110
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

208
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,040
Does Su Ryeon have a reason to interfere with her husband's work like that?

209
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,910
Su Ryeon really respects her husband.

210
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,110
I won't relay to her what you just said.

211
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,420
What do you want?

212
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,790
I'll do my absolute best to work with your answer.

213
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,380
What do I want?

214
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,350
Not selling it to you.

215
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,380
I've never seen such a crazy woman before.

216
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,030
How dare she not know her place and joke around?

217
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,540
So, what did you say?

218
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,630
 I went off about how I wouldn't sell it to him. 

219
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,190
Good job. The knife is in our hands, after all.

220
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,880
Let's talk later.

221
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,830
 Restricted Number 

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,340
Hello?

223
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,150
It's been a while, Madam Sim Su Ryeon.

224
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,520
Who is this?

225
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,150
I'm hurt.

226
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,050
Have you forgotten my voice already?

227
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,220
Will you remember if I call you like this? Min Seol Ah's mom? 
    

228
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,650
- Director Min? 
 - Aigoo!

229
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,570
So you haven't forgotten me.

230
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,560
It's me! Director Min of Hope Orphanage.

231
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,140
The savior who took in your daughter and raised her!

232
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,120
How could someone in jail call me?

233
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,530
This is a place with humans too, you know.

234
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,450
You're the one who killed Assemblyman Jo, right?

235
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,600
Why? Did you feel a bit sorry to the daughter you abandoned?

236
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,940
You bastard.

237
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,490
You devil!

238
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,750
 Your husband doesn't know yet, does he? 

239
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,210
 That Min Seol Ah is your biological daughter? 

240
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,940
Isn't this too unfair, then?

241
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,130
After living in prison for a while, I want to live a righteous life now.

242
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,580
Have you still not come to your senses after using adoption to sell kids?

243
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,200
Even prison is a waste for people like you. You deserve to die immediately.

244
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,340
But what can we do? It won't be easy to see me dead.

245
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,830
I think you'll die first at the hands of Chairman Ju.

246
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,890
I told him today.

247
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,010
- That you are Min Seol Ah's biological mother. 
 - What?

248
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,530
 You don't have time to curse me out right now. 

249
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,510
In 30 minutes, the present I just sent out

250
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,620
will arrive in your husband's office.

251
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,350
 J King Holdings 

252
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,570
Quick delivery.

253
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,160
Go ahead.

254
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,470
 J King Holdings 

255
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,190
Wait!

256
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,360
Is this a delivery for Chairman Ju Dan Tae?

257
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
Yes.

258
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,500
Give it to me. I was told to pick it up.

259
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,870
Here you go.

260
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,640
Have a good day.

261
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,390
What are you doing here, honey?

262
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,590
You didn't even call.

263
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,130
I had something to do in the area

264
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,910
and I thought I'd stop by to see your face.

265
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,460
You don't look too good.

266
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,470
Why are you sweating so much?

267
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,530
Maybe because I started work. I've had some problems to deal with.

268
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,260
So why did you go back to work?

269
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,320
If it's hard, you should quit immediately.

270
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,540
It's not that bad.

271
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,730
Could I have a cup of tea?

272
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,500
Chairman Ju, your meeting is starting.

273
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,920
- You should go ahead, I'm alright. 
 - Okay.

274
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,190
See you at home.

275
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,170
 Madam Sim Su Ryeon. 

276
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,650
 You'll have to get me out of prison. 

277
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,050
 If not, I'm going to expose your secret! 

278
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,000
 Together with patients for 30 years - CAMC 

279
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
Come in. 
   CAMC - Cheong Ah Medical Center  

280
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,440
What are you doing here?

281
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,350
You never called back although I called you so I was curious.

282
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,920
You must have just finished a surgery.

283
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,700
I asked what you're doing here.

284
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,410
What's so weird about a wife visiting her husband's hospital?

285
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,480
If you don't have plans, let's have dinner together.

286
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,330
And I'm sorry about ruining our dinner plans the other night.

287
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,510
I do have plans.

288
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,630
Really, what's the matter with you! You wouldn't be called a narrow-minded person?

289
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,640
Fine, don't eat with me. I'm not begging you.

290
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,460
Are you going through puberty or something? What are you so annoyed about?

291
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,260
If there's something on your mind, just let it out!

292
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,040
Do you know how tiring this is for the people around you?

293
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,700
You have to respond when someone is trying.

294
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,770
Don't try.

295
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,570
Don't do anything at all. Also, don't pretend to be giving me a favor either.

296
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,870
What?

297
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,160
You're really childish--

298
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,730
 Restricted Number 

299
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,950
Are you done?

300
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,870
I can go now, right?

301
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,180
 I know everything you've done 

302
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,660
 with Ju Dan Tae. 

303
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,500
It's the eye.

304
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,590
She's not selling it? Even for double?

305
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,410
Was Oh Yun Hui that crazy when she was dating you?

306
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,630
Well, she had to have been that crazy to slit her throat in front of Seo Jin.

307
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,620
But you know, Doctor Ha,

308
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,550
your taste in women is really constant.

309
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,300
How could you like such headstrong women?

310
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,180
- Pervert. 
 - What are you going to do now?

311
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,130
We'll have to convince her very well

312
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,290
so that she accepts our offer.

313
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,240
We'll look pathetic. Why should we do that?

314
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,630
Deal!

315
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,150
I understand what you're talking about.

316
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,610
You mean we can relax for the first time in a long time.

317
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,950
I'll entrust this case to you, Attorney Lee.

318
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,980
Just entrust this to me.  I'll make her unable to stand without stamping her seal.

319
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,440
How are you going to do that?

320
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,430
It's a secret. What?

321
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,750
Are you afraid I will kill your first love like this?

322
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,210
I'm just going to scare her a little bit.  Just a little bit.

323
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,750
Don't even think about butting in this time!

324
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,320
Dr. Ha!  You put in more than ₩30 billion of your own money!

325
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,100
You don't want to lose that money, do you?

326
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,700
Just be prepared for swallowing what I feed you.

327
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,820
 Are you capable of doing that? 

328
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,220
 Just put things into your mouth and swallow well.  Otherwise, you'll get indigestion. 

329
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,040
 Yangjae Flower Market 

330
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,720
That's good?

331
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,170
Yes?  This is Ju Dan Tae.

332
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,030
 Let's meet now.  It's urgent.  I'll go to the villa first. 

333
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,550
Which crazy bastard...

334
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,250
I'm sure Min Seol Ah said something to someone before she died.

335
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,250
The picture of the eye is the same as the one at the time.

336
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,100
The fountain at Hera Palace. The letter with the pocket watch. They are all the same person.

337
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,680
Maybe, this person has Min Seol Ah's phone?

338
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,280
Then there must be our video too.

339
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,890
That's good.  With this opportunity, we'll catch him and get rid of that phone completely.

340
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,700
I've been always bothered that we couldn't find that phone.

341
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,490
We don't even know who has the phone so how can we find it?

342
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,660
By chance, do you have a hunch who has it?

343
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,650
Yes, I do.

344
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,980
Who?

345
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,290
Min Seol Ah's oppa.

346
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,990
Oppa?

347
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,050
 Do you think I came all this way without arranging some safeguards? 

348
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,040
 I have someone who will help me. 

349
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,780
 If something happens to me, my oppa will come to find you and will not leave you alone. 

350
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,540
I found out that Min Seol Ah was adopted and then her adoption was dissolved.

351
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,400
It seemed there was a brother in that family.

352
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,070
You're saying that brother is threatening us right now?

353
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,900
There is no reason to do that.  They weren't even blood-related to each other. That's not it.

354
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,930
How are you so sure?

355
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,690
I've already checked that part.

356
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,670
The family that adopted Min Seol Ah... There is such a tight veil on that family that no one can even find out their names.

357
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,900
No one can know anything except that her adoption was dissolved because she stole something.

358
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,520
We don't know who they are

359
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,730
but it means that they don't have the time to be concerned with someone like Min Seol Ah.

360
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,420
So that girl deceived me again?

361
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,990
That insolent thing.

362
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,850
Before and now, I'm suspicious of one person.

363
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,800
Who is that?

364
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,690
Your wife.

365
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,090
You think that she knows about our relationship?

366
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,240
But she hasn't said a single word? With her elegant personality?

367
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,050
No, she wouldn't have been able to stand such filthy behavior for even a day.

368
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,740
How many women are there in Korea who divorce their husbands for adultery?

369
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,780
Not to mention, you are tremendously wealthy.

370
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,930
To split all that money in a way that is advantageous for her,

371
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:20,660
she may need your weak point. And that weak point could be Min Seol Ah.

372
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,030
What a ridiculous speculation.

373
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,050
Your wife may have seen Min Seol Ah falling and dying at Hera Palace.

374
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,520
I keep having this thought,

375
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,880
that Sim Su Ryeon is acting.

376
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,060
Don't get worked up, just wait. I will take care of this.

377
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,350
What are you doing here?

378
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,170
How did you get in here?

379
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,910
I'm sorry, I took a wrong turn.

380
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,080
You're all working hard.

381
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,350
Oh, really.

382
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,040
Did my wife return home right away?

383
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,260
Yes. But there is one strange thing.

384
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,300
What is it?

385
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,170
A delivery came to the Chairman's office this afternoon, but the document disappeared.

386
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,300
What? A delivery addressed to me disappeared?

387
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,760
Yes, and it was about the time that Madam visited your office.

388
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,420
Hello?

389
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,580
 It's me, Madam. Did you receive the gift I sent you? 

390
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,980
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want from me?

391
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,070
 Oh, I already told you. To get me out of here. 

392
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,060
Pay my bail and use your influence here and there.

393
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,120
You have at least that much power, don't you?

394
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,130
 I can't give you too much time. 

395
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,370
If it's too difficult for you, perhaps I should ask Chairman Ju?

396
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,160
You will die by my husband's hands. If you don't want to die, shut your mouth and talk to me.

397
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,780
Then come to visit me tomorrow.

398
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,310
I'll be waiting.

399
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,840
Hello? Hello?

400
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,360
 So she's being threatened? By whom? 

401
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,760
Hey, what's with you?

402
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,800
Why are you giving Seok Hun chocolate milk?

403
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,420
Because I'm thankful to him for something.

404
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,240
Thankful to him?

405
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,440
I am dumbfounded.

406
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,730
Hey, do you like Ju Seok Hun?

407
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,990
Mind your own business.

408
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,330
You can't like Ju Seok Hun carelessly.

409
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,020
Did you get Seok Gyeong's permission, at least?

410
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,510
Get permission for what?

411
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,530
Ju Seok Hun completely belongs to Ju Seok Gyeong.

412
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,500
All the girls in our school like Ju Seok Hun

413
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,640
but why doesn't he date any of them?

414
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,340
Stop it, what if Seok Hun hears about what you said?

415
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,480
But Bae Ro Na is acting up without knowing her place.

416
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,790
So I'm explaining it to her because I feel sorry for her.

417
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,700
Hey, everyone already knows it.

418
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,690
Seok Hun.

419
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,680
When did you get here?

420
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,450
Thanks, Bae Ro Na. I'll enjoy it.

421
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,030
Hey, An Eun Hu?

422
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,880
How about a game after class in the gym? It's been so long.

423
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,280
Oh... sure.

424
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,060
Let's do that.

425
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,860
Everyone in their seats.

426
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,610
- Bae Ro Na? 
 - Yes?

427
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,230
I assigned an essay about the performance. Why haven't you turned it in?

428
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,520
I couldn't attend the performance because I didn't have a ticket.

429
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,790
It was sold out, so I couldn't get one.

430
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,860
Are you really using that as an excuse?

431
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,460
You are the only one who didn't turn in your essay.

432
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Be prepared for the grade you will be getting.

433
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,410
 I returned to Korea. To Hope Orphanage where my little sisters and brothers are. 

434
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,490
 What are you doing? 

435
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,180
 Why are you eating dog food? 

436
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,760
 Unni Seol Ah, when did you return? 

437
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,430
 Unni, I'm hungry. 

438
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,240
 Please give us some food. 

439
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,750
 Where is the Director? Where is he? 

440
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,650
 These bastards, are you finished with the laundry? 

441
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,670
 If you don't finish this and all the cleaning too, there will be no food again today. 

442
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,340
 So you're back? 

443
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,100
 Why won't you give my little sisters and brothers any food? You promised you wouldn't do this anymore. 

444
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,610
 You get a monthly stipend for them. Why would you not give them food? 

445
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,540
 I heard from the U.S. 

446
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,560
 So you stole and got kicked out, huh? 

447
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,690
 How shameless of you to return here. 

448
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,620
 Aren't you ashamed in front of your little siblings? 

449
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,050
 You arranged it with them from the start, didn't you? 

450
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,780
 To frame me for stealing and then kick me out? 

451
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,810
 Because those people never needed a daughter. 

452
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,840
 - Isn't that true? 
 - You... ! 

453
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,740
 Won't you shut your mouth? 

454
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,660
 How dare you accuse me of such a thing? 

455
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,990
 I even bought you an apartment, you thieving wench. 

456
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,410
 You should be grateful. 

457
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,100
 - I don't need that. 
 - Is that so? 

458
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,110
 Seol Ah, then turn over ownership of your place to me. 

459
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,190
 I raised you all your life. Shouldn't you pay me back for all the food I gave you, at least? 

460
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,250
 You are the devil. 

461
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,630
 Are you going to sell my little siblings off, too? 

462
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,260
 I will tell on you, everything you've done. 

463
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,280
 If you dare to touch even a hair on my siblings, see what I'll do to you! 

464
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,970
 This insolent wench. 

465
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,430
 You! Take that! How dare you talk that way to your father? 

466
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,580
 This is why your adoptive parents kicked you out! 

467
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,320
 I protected my little siblings, so I was satisfied with that. 

468
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,230
 "He cursed at us and hit us. I put both my arms around my little siblings... I protected my little siblings, so I was satisfied with that." 

469
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,380
Good thing you're here. I was worried that maybe you weren't.

470
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,200
What brings you here, Seo Jin?

471
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,290
I heard that you've gone back to work. My visit is too late, isn't it?

472
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,240
The CEO of a furniture company, huh?

473
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,250
That's so cool.

474
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,660
I bought you some delicious egg tarts.

475
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,990
Thank you. Let's have a cup of coffee together.

476
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,970
 JAKOMO 

477
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,040
An apple necklace...

478
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,210
It's familiar...

479
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,910
Where did I see it?

480
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,970
What are you doing?

481
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,860
I was looking at a picture. Did you paint it?

482
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,340
It's not done yet.

483
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,640
I'm embarrassed to show it to others.

484
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,430
Why not?  You used unique colors.

485
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,340
The coffee is getting cold.

486
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Let's go.

487
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,410
 Bosong Village 3rd Dong 

488
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,500
 JAKOMO 

489
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,360
Follow her.   We can't lose her.

490
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,210
Yes, Director.

491
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,820
 Southern Detention Center 

492
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,760
 Southern Detention Center 

493
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,960
Why is she at the detention center?

494
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,750
Find out who she is going to meet.

495
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,650
Yes, Director.

496
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,140
  Service &amp; Information Center 

497
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,240
 Visiting Application 
 Prisoner: Min Hyeong Sik 

498
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,110
Min Hyeong Sik?  Who is he?

499
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:33,830
Min Seol Ah was also from Hope Orphanage, where Min Hyeong Sik was a director.

500
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:39,850
Then this means Sim Su Ryeon is visiting the director of Min Seol Ah's orphanage?

501
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,670
Yes, that's right.

502
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,360
Min Seol Ah... Sim Su Ryeon...

503
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,970
Min Seol Ah...

504
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,470
 This is the Apple necklace sold at that shop. Do you remember? 

505
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,630
Min Seol Ah!

506
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,380
It was surely Min Seol Ah's necklace.

507
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,350
 Sim Su Ryeon must be related to Min Seol Ah. 

508
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,000
 I'm sure of it. My hunch was not wrong. 

509
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,690
Please save me!

510
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,390
Is there anybody?

511
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,400
Wow, how loud!

512
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,020
I heard you did classical voice music.  So your voice is sonorous.

513
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,470
Attorney Lee— Did you do this?

514
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,690
What are you doing?

515
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,490
Hand over the land at Myeong-dong to us.

516
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,740
Chairman Ju Dan Tae got very angry.

517
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,120
You hurt his pride very much so he said he couldn't even give you the premium now.

518
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,830
Do you always handle your business in this way?

519
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,640
This is a crime!

520
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,660
Hurry untie me!  Hurry untie me!

521
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,670
I know it.

522
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,180
Gyu Jin is a lawyer.

523
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,370
I'm not a crude person but a gentleman.

524
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,380
Even though you do this, do you think I would sell the house?

525
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,350
Let's proceed simply.

526
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,230
I mean, you should be

527
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,920
worried about your daughter who is waiting for you.

528
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,510
If you touch my Ro Na, you'll be killed by me.

529
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:41,220
Hey!  If I decide to, I can become a really terrible person.

530
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,630
Don't come near me! Don't come!

531
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,480
Let me go!

532
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,310
Stamp here.

533
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,120
I don't want to!

534
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,860
Hold her right!

535
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,410
- I told you I don't want to! 
 - Stamp it!

536
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,240
Stamp!

537
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,080
Catch it, you bastards!

538
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,150
Catch it!

539
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,980
I told you to catch it, you bastards!

540
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,520
Hurry move fast!

541
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,290
Hey! Drag him!  Who is that bastard?

542
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,400
Catch him!

543
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,190
Over there, you bastards!

544
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,560
What are you guys doing?

545
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,890
- Block him! 
 - No!

546
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,490
What kind of bastard is it?

547
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,950
Why did you bastards let him go?

548
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,560
Stick to him, you bastards!

549
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,670
Stamp it!

550
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,250
Hey, come on!

551
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,950
- You, come here! 
 - Go away, go away!

552
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,560
Stamp here!

553
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,800
No!  Let me go!

554
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,980
You bastard!

555
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,660
Go away!

556
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,000
Stamp here!

557
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
No, you bastard!

558
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,450
Yun Cheol!

559
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,050
You! Shit!

560
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,380
Yun Hui, run away.

561
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,180
How dare you!

562
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,430
My mom let me learn Taekwondo and Judo, both of them when I was a kid.

563
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,160
I'm a good fighter.

564
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,770
Come on, hurry!

565
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You idiot!

566
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,160
My ₩30 billion is at stake!

567
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,310
Are you okay?

568
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,840
Nothing happened to you, right?

569
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,530
Y-Yun Cheol!

570
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,590
Yun Hui, you stay here.

571
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,900
Be careful.

572
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,270
What happened, Dr. Ha?

573
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,400
You were too much for this case.

574
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,290
This method wasn't what I agreed to.

575
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,730
I can't just stay still and watch you anymore if you keep straying like this!

576
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,510
Are you confident about giving up your money?

577
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,970
Although you can't even do it, what's the reason you show yourself off in front of your first love?

578
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,760
You covet money but you pretend to be a nice guy and play the hypocrite.

579
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,700
I hate a person like you the most in the world!

580
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,110
Come here.

581
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,970
 Hand over the land at Myeong-dong to us. 

582
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,130
 Chairman Ju Dan Tae got very angry. 

583
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,620
 You hurt his pride very much so he said he couldn't even give you the premium now. 

584
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,330
While competing with a person like you,

585
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,180
did you think I wouldn't have prepared this kind of stuff?

586
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,560
Kidnapping, involuntary confinement, and even assault...

587
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,310
there are three in a set.

588
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,980
If I pass on this recording file to police and media,

589
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,120
I don't think it'll end up just one nick on your life, Ju Dan Tae.

590
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,160
Will it be okay?

591
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,330
What do you want?

592
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:46,250
From now on, I'm going to deal only with Ha Yun Cheol.

593
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,140
If you want to negotiate with me, then only talk to Ha Yun Cheol.

594
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,360
What are you doing?  Let's go.

595
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,760
Move your car!

596
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,050
Eun Hu, when you have such a bad auditory sense, how can you do music?

597
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,510
Here! Here! Throw a punch right!

598
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,900
Who are you to speak about someone else? A guy like you?

599
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,790
I did wrong.  I did wrong.

600
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,850
I won't do it again.

601
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,170
Forgive me just once.

602
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,400
I didn't know well so...

603
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,300
Looks like you think we're friends or something because I let you pass once or twice.

604
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,000
But I cannot endure anyone touching what belongs to me.

605
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,520
Do you know that?

606
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,530
What are you doing?

607
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,360
Don't you know that you need permission before you use the gym?

608
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,780
An Eun Hu? What's wrong? Are you hurt?

609
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,680
Looks like he was too vigorous about boxing.

610
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,350
You should have taken it easy.

611
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,590
That's right, you should abandon that useless desire of yours to win.

612
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,780
Hey. Who did this?

613
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,600
Who hit you? Was it Ju Seok Hun?

614
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,730
- Those guys bullied you, right? 
 - No.

615
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,110
It's obvious they did.

616
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,280
Are you still going to deny it?

617
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,220
Goodness, look at you.

618
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,990
Go to the nurse's office for now.

619
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,650
- I will take care of— 
 - I told you, that's not what happened.

620
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,140
You startled me.

621
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,300
They are my friends and we were just playing.

622
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,580
Please don't butt in.

623
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,240
Gosh, he surely has a temper.

624
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,370
You shouldn't do that.

625
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,540
I may not look it, but I am a teacher at Cheong Ah Arts School.

626
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,590
Why are you so late coming here? And not answering your phone?

627
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,580
What is the matter? So many eyes to be cautious about, so why?

628
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,250
I didn't have time to wait. My suspicion was correct.

629
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,700
Your wife is somehow related to Min Seol Ah.

630
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,550
What are you talking about again?

631
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,950
Do you know who your wife met with today?

632
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,040
She met with the Director of the orphanage that Min Seol Ah grew up in.

633
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,830
- At the detention center, at that.
 - A detention center?

634
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:19,320
That Director Min Hyeong Sik, it turns out that he was Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon's henchman.

635
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:24,060
He's a brutal criminal who trafficked the bone marrow of orphans. Why would your wife visit someone like that?

636
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,600
She is definitely connected to Min Seol Ah somehow.

637
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,040
She saw Min Seol Ah die or...

638
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,650
Or?

639
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,740
She knew Min Seol Ah from before.

640
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,450
Does that make any sense? How could she have known Min Seol Ah?

641
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,370
How could she have known Min Seol Ah?

642
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:46,100
Min Seol Ah was an orphan.

643
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,890
Maybe your wife

644
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,380
knows Min Seol Ah's biological parents?

645
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,310
Isn't that too much of a leap in logic?

646
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,370
If there is even 1% reason for suspicion, we have to confirm it.

647
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:03,250
There is definitely something going on with your wife.

648
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:07,670
Listen carefully. We cannot afford to let this pass.

649
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,310
It appeared that she was being threatened by someone.

650
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,240
Threat?

651
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,310
That's right. It's probably that guy, Director Min Yeong Sik.

652
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,590
But why him?

653
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,960
Maybe that guy

654
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,590
knows your wife's secret?

655
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,330
That guy in the detention center?

656
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,250
Hello? Why do you keep doing this? I asked you to stop.

657
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,970
Who are you speaking to?

658
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:02,310
Who is this? I asked who you are, you punk!

659
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,120
 Unknown Caller 

660
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,480
Just what are you going around doing without telling me?

661
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,050
Who is this guy? Director Min Hyeong Sik?

662
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,440
How did you know that, honey?

663
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,650
Why would this guy be threatening you?

664
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,900
I am asking you, why is he threatening you?

665
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,840
It's not me

666
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,650
but you who is being threatened.

667
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,060
What?

668
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,340
This letter came this afternoon.

669
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,810
 Your husband killed Min Seol Ah! 

670
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,030
 Min Seol Ah was murdered in Herapalace! 

671
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,160
 If you don't get me released from here, I will expose your husband's secret! 

672
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,510
Please tell me honestly.

673
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,940
Did you kill Min Seol Ah?

674
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,470
He even says he has conclusive evidence. But what evidence would he be threatening us with?

675
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,920
It's ridiculous, just nonsense. Why would I kill Min Seol Ah?

676
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,230
I met with Director Min Hyeong Sik at the detention center today.

677
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,090
He said that Min Seol Ah didn't die in Bosong Village

678
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,460
but at Hera Palace. What is he talking about?

679
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,200
Thinking back, you have been acting strange since the fountain lighting ceremony.

680
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,540
Please tell me.

681
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,230
I have to know so I can help you.

682
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,800
Did you perhaps kill Min Seol Ah to cover up what our children did to her?

683
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,560
No. Absolutely not.

684
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,190
You're telling me the truth, aren't you? You are not related in any way to Min Seol Ah's death?

685
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,800
I'm scared. I was so scared that I thought I would die.

686
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:44,490
Don't worry. You've got me.

687
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:47,160
He's just babbling nonsense because he's trying to extort money out of us.

688
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,980
I trust you, Honey.

689
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,230
Alright.

690
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,210
Go to bed first. I'll be going out for a bit.

691
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,370
This is the golf driving range owned by Director Min.

692
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,160
It's closed for business for now.

693
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,760
Open it up.

694
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,590
Dig thoroughly.

695
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,120
Don't leave even a speck of dust unturned.

696
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,390
Hold on. Step aside.

697
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,290
 I will expose what your husband did! 

698
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,820
This criminal dares to threaten me?

699
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,000
What shall I do?

700
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,130
Take care of all of this. Quietly.

701
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,770
 I know what you did with Ju Dan Tae. 

702
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,100
 So have you thought about things a bit? 

703
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,080
 I'm looking for a skilled lawyer for you. 

704
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,830
 So please wait a little longer. 

705
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,710
 I knew that you would understand. 

706
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,420
 I realize this is too late for me to say, 

707
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,480
 but I really adored Seol Ah. 

708
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,820
 You really must know that. 

709
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,740
 Yes, I know it very well. 

710
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,290
 I will make sure not to forget and I will repay you for it. 

711
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,780
 Are you home, Chairman? 
   

712
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:54,920
  Hello.  Why do you keep doing this? I asked you to stop. 

713
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,640
 Who are you speaking to? 

714
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,580
 Who are you? I asked who you are, you punk! 

715
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,120
 Every night, I imagined killing the Director countless times. 

716
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,710
 If I had never met that man, 

717
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,780
 maybe my life would have been a little happier? 

718
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,950
  P A P A 

719
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,730
 Heraclub: The specter of Min Seol Ah who's been threatening us disappeared completely. 

720
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,930
 Heraclub: The specter of Min Seol Ah who's been threatening us disappeared completely. 

721
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,390
 There will no longer be any reason to feel anxious. 

722
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,900
Wasn't it an apple pendant?

723
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,080
Was I mistaken about what I saw?

724
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,420
 From Seok Gyeong: Why do you think Ha Eun Byeol bought out the entire performance venue? 

725
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,790
 I am telling you because it's been bothering my conscience. 

726
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,730
Did Ha Eun Byeol do that on purpose?

727
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,030
What's wrong? What's going on?

728
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,690
That girl bought all the tickets on purpose in order to make me not be able to do my assignment.

729
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,360
Mom, I got a zero grade on my essay assignment because of her.

730
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,550
If I don't get first place on my mid-term singing exams,

731
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,330
my grades will be ruined.

732
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,670
Get up. Let's go now.

733
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,000
Let's go with Mom and argue properly.

734
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,640
I can't. Then Seok Gyeong will be in trouble.

735
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,240
She's my only friend at school.

736
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,360
Oh, really...

737
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,330
 Don't overreact. 

738
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,270
 Then and now, you're so bad at fighting. 

739
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,940
 It's not that I'm bad at fighting... 

740
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,170
 Stop messing with Ju Dan Tae. 

741
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,450
 You don't seem to know what kind of guy he is— 

742
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,490
 I am not afraid of that guy at all. 

743
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,600
 He's just a loser who stinks. 

744
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,920
 But how deeply involved are you with Ju Dan Tae, anyway? 

745
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,540
 What are you doing with that crazy jerk? 

746
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,960
 Stop associating with him, unless you want to regret it. 

747
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:09,260
 Do you understand what I'm saying? 

748
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,610
 Right now, you seem just like you were in high school. 

749
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,780
 You haven't changed at all. 

750
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,930
 Can you actually smile, while looking like that? 

751
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,790
 Let me see. You need more medicine on that. 

752
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,200
 That scar is the same, too. 

753
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,180
 What are you doing? 

754
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:56,510
 You don't have the right to ask about this scar. 

755
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,030
Why do you look like that? Did you fight?

756
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,560
It's nothing. I just bumped into something.

757
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,400
Just what are you going around doing these days?

758
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,180
Won't you answer me?

759
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,660
Since when were you so interested in me?

760
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,190
Just be the way you were before.

761
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,970
Out of my way.

762
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,360
Do you think I'm doing nothing because I don't know?

763
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:44,490
I already know that you're meeting with Oh Yun Hui.

764
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,150
Since we're talking about this, let me ask you something.

765
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,690
Do you even think of me as your husband? Why do you bother living with me, anyway?

766
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,750
- What? 
 - You've never once loved me.

767
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,490
I was just the man of your competitor whom you had never beat!

768
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,380
So you just wanted to steal me away from her. Isn't that true?

769
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,040
Why? Did Oh Yun Hui ask to be with you again?

770
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,520
Did she ask you to come back to her after divorcing me?

771
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,250
You gave her ₩100 million, so you think that gives you the right to date her again?

772
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,900
Stop talking about ₩100 million!

773
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:21,610
Compared to how you cut her throat

774
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:26,990
and compared to how you ruined her successful life in one moment,

775
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,820
isn't that ₩100 million small potatoes?

776
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:37,500
Do you think that I did that?

777
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,850
That I cut Oh Yun Hui's throat?

778
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,740
You would know the best.

779
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,200
Ha Yun Cheol!

780
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,820
How dare you run away like a coward!

781
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,220
How nice.

782
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:46,750
If it hadn't been for this watch you gave me, I would have been in real trouble.

783
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,360
I never imagined that he would really do something like that.

784
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,720
Your husband is a very scary man.

785
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,900
How can you sleep in the same bed with a man like that?

786
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:02,120
I know. If you think about it, I'm quite cold-blooded, huh?

787
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:09,920
The house from the auction should be quickly sold at the point when it can be most profitable.

788
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,060
If we drag things out too long, you could be in danger again.

789
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:20,580
I said I would only negotiate with Ha Yun Cheol, so I'm sure I will hear from him soon.

790
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:25,390
I shouted and acted big.

791
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:29,250
But I don't know what I should ask for as a condition of the deal.

792
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,760
There is something I've thought of.

793
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:39,000
A condition that both you and I need.

794
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,020
Speak honestly.

795
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,110
Were you bullied?

796
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,410
I told you, I was not.

797
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,040
We were just boxing, that is all.

798
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,320
You can go now.

799
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:14,250
He's obviously lying because he is scared.

800
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,170
We should convene the Committee Against School Violence and investigate this properly.

801
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,310
But there is no victim. So what do we investigate?

802
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,360
Teacher Gu, aren't you overreacting right now?

803
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,920
Why do you keep causing problems?

804
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,030
Can you really say that after you saw that?

805
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:33,780
A group of five kids attacked one kid.

806
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:38,380
First, I plan on meeting with the parents of everyone involved.

807
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,490
Teacher Gu, let me warn you.

808
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,800
Why do you make things so difficult, like this?

809
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,180
Then should I have just reported this directly to the Ministry of Education?

810
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:57,450
To be honest, I was trying to keep this quiet as possible

811
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,650
and this is my way of doing that.

812
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,950
Director Cheon, as the guardian of Ha Eun Byeol,

813
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,490
you will have to discuss this with me, too.

814
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,390
Alright, Teachers, I'll be on my way.

815
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,610
Seeing how he's acting up, he's like a ticking bomb.

816
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,520
Looks like it's a matter of time before he causes some big trouble.

817
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,860
Let's use this chance to find a reason to fire him.

818
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,260
He was hired based on a recommendation from a friend of my father.

819
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,210
So let's wait and see. He's a contract employee, after all.

820
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,340
Hello.

821
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,550
I am Gu Ho Dong, the Deputy Homeroom Teacher in the Music Department at Cheong Ah Arts School.

822
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,310
Ah yes, it's nice to meet you.

823
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,890
Ah yes.

824
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,370
What brings you here?

825
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:54,300
I have something to discuss with you regarding Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong.

826
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,170
That is why I am visiting you.

827
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:01,560
Your home is really a work of art.

828
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,570
This is the penthouse, right?

829
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,130
This is the first time I've been to a place like this, you see.

830
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,570
I heard Hera Palace is where the wealthiest people in Korea live.

831
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:17,630
So how much would a place like this cost?

832
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:21,110
Seok Hun's dad will be coming down soon.

833
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,820
Please have some tea, Teacher.

834
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,500
Yes, I will enjoy it.

835
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:33,530
Wow, this tea smells so elegant, befitting this penthouse.

836
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,550
Oh no. The expensive cup is broken.

837
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,650
It is very expensive, isn't it?

838
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,230
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

839
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:51,360
It's alright.

840
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,470
Your daughter's eyes resemble yours very much.

841
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,950
 I came here to see you, Sim Su Ryeon. 

842
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:15,590
Gosh, that is too funny.

843
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,100
Oh, Teacher Cheon, getting off work now?

844
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,200
Our yoga session just ended.

845
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,080
I was about to come see you, actually.

846
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,930
You haven't heard from the school yet, have you?

847
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:29,930
What now? Did something happen again?

848
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,940
Our children—

849
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,880
Excuse me, please step out of the way.

850
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,370
Looks like we're getting new next door neighbors. The previous family emigrated to Australia.

851
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,200
- 45th floor, right? 
 - Yes.

852
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,120
Yes.

853
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,410
Move it this way.

854
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:45,920
Isn't that the furniture brand from Su Ryeon's company?

855
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,630
Yes, that's right. I haven't seen any of those designs before.

856
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,550
Maybe they're new?

857
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:54,100
Looks like someone with good taste is moving in.

858
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,160
What a relief that this person suits the high-class level of Herapalace.

859
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,320
Teacher Cheon? I think she's coming.

860
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,960
Teacher Cheon?

861
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,400
You're the new person moving in right? So nice to meet you.

862
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,650
Welcome, nice to meet you.

863
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,540
Hello. I'm moving in to the 45th floor.

864
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,630
Oh Yun Hui?

865
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,140
Please take good care of me from now on, Cheon Seo Jin.

866
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:18,750


867
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,330
 The Penthouse: War in Life 

868
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,120
 Is this really our home? 

869
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,370
 Are we really living in Hera Palace starting today?? 

870
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:36,850
 Are you Seok Hun's father? 

871
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,840
 Did you have a nightmare or something? 

872
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,360
 I will make sure to kick you out of here, Oh Yun Hui. 

873
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,830
 I've heard that he is the most successful Korean-American. 

874
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,470
 His name is Logan Lee. 

875
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,120
 Your husband seems so precious to Oh Yun Hui. 

876
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,000
 I was curious about your home. You will have to protect it well, 

877
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,250
 Cheon Seo Jin.
