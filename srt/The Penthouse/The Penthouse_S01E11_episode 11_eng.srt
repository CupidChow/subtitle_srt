 Student Statement 

2
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,880
I told you to hurry up and write.
  Episode 11 

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,870
Where you bought those cigarettes and whom you smoked them with.

4
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,870
You'd better accurately write everything down.  Don't leave a thing out.

5
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,990
If you don't write it all, you cannot go home today.

6
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,010
But it's not mine.

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,950
I really don't smoke

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,660
This won't do. Should I call your mother?

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,900
No.

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,590
No. Please don't call my mom. I beg you.

11
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,500
I really don't smoke.

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,150
- What are you going to do? 
 - Get out of my way.

13
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,410
I can't understand.

14
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,360
Why are you this concerned about Bae Ro Na? That wench is nothing.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,840
Let me answer what I didn't before. I don't like you.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,900
So would you please stop paying attention to me?

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,120

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,050
Ju Seok Hun? You didn't go home yet?

20
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,780
I have something to tell you.

21
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,670
What is it?

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,200
The person who put the cigarettes in Bae Ro Na's bag is me.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,930
Did you really do it?

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,180
Did you really do it, I asked you.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,800
I told you that I did. Didn't you understand me?

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,700
How can you... ? Why did you do it?

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,110
Why would you do that to me?

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,440
Because I was bored.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,540
Hey, Ju Seok Hun, you'd better speak straight.

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,930
If you're just saying that to protect Bae Ro Na—

31
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,480
Would I have any reason to do that?

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,500
That is... you do not have such a reason.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,440
You don't... but...

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,920
Oh, what is going on? This isn't it.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,180
You just wait.

36

 J King Holdings] 

37
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,570
Hello, this is Ju Dan Tae. I want to speak to Logan Lee.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Yes, I understand.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,050
Please also schedule a meeting for me as soon as possible.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,930
I will be waiting.

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,610
You have a guest, Chairman.

42
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,190
I told you to not let anyone in.

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,850
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

44
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,300
I already came in.

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,540
You can go.

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,040
Your office is much more

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,960
cozier than I thought. How's business?

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,560
Your business isn't much affected by the economy, is it?

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Let's get to the point. What brings you here?

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,380
Well, in that case,

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,940
you know they're choosing publicity models at Cheong Ah Arts School, right?

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,860
But the more I think about it,

53
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,340
Seok Gyeong seems perfect.

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,750
Did you come visit me at my company just to tell me that?

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,950
Was my gift to you not enough?

56
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,510
How about buying me that drink you didn't before, Hyeong-nim (older brother)?

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,760
Hyeong-nim?

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,110
Did I come in too fast without braking?

59
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,160
Should I have turned on the turn signals?

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,060
I feel getting closer to you.  I like it.

61
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,660
But what can I do? I was planning to have dinner with my wife.

62
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,910
A dinner date with your beautiful wife, huh?

63
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,370
What a family man you are.

64
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,040
Then I'll just be on my way.

65
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,970
Secretary Jo?

66
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,030
Wow, are you going to see me off?

67
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,320
That isn't necessary—

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,030
"I do not intend to have a younger brother like you."

69
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,960
That is what Chairman wanted me to tell you.

70
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,780
"You have quite a dirty temper, Hyeong-nim."

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,900
Please tell him I said that.

72
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm sorry that this causes you to work late, Teacher.

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,610
I will go home and speak to my son.

74
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,440
Of course, you should. You are the head of operations for our school.

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,220
So would this be such a problem?

76
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,770
I will take care of this matter well.

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,990
 Unni, could I ask you let Ro Na stay with you tonight? 

78
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,940
 I'll tell you the specifics later. 

79
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,500
I'll take Ro Na home, too.

80
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,810
These are Seok Gyeong's clothes. Feel free to change into them

81
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,240
It's alright for you to sleep with Seok Gyeong tonight, isn't it?

82
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,420
Of course.

83
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,820
I was worried that Mom would find out I got in trouble at school.

84
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,280
Please don't tell my mom what happened today.

85
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,510
I am very sorry that you were falsely accused because of Seok Hun.

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,810
Seok Hun didn't do that.

87
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,370
Hmm?

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,770
Ha Yun Cheol, Oh Yun Hui, I want to kill them both.

89
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,910
Calm down.

90
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,680
I can't let my precious lover be bothered by her loser husband.

91
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,140
When did you prepare all this?

92
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,840
These are all my favorites.

93
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,840
At least in this villa, I want you to be happy without any concerns.

94
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,780
You can have anything you want, and enjoy all you want. You amply deserve that.

95
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,710
This will be our sign.

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,370
When I'm wearing this scarf, it will mean

97
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,220
that I plan to have you.

98
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,270
You dirty pieces of trash.

99
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,170
What? Do you even have the guts to shoot?

100
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,330
So shoot.

101
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,190
Shoot!

102
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,640
Shoot, I said!

103
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,600
I took the poor son of grape farmers and finally washed all that dirt off you.

104
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,770
And you plan to live the rest of your life as a murderer?

105
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,890
Do whatever you want if you want to rot in prison for the rest of your life.

106
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,810
You sons of b**ches!

107
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,400
 This will be our sign. 

108
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,890
 That I plan to have you. 

109
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,780
 Dad when are you coming home? 

110
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,970
 I'm scared to be home alone. 

111
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,160
 Come on here. 

112
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,430
Ha Yun Cheol, what's wrong with you?

113
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,290
There's blood on your hands...

114
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
Yun Hui...

115
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,010
What do I do now...

116
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,080
Did something happen?

117
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,540
What?

118
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,090
How can a doctor hurt his hands like this?

119
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,530
Your hands save lives.

120
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,570
It's no big deal.

121
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,020
There was an incident at the hospital.

122
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,440
- Where's Ro Na? 
 - She's at Seok Gyeong's place.

123
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,160
She's going to spend the night there.

124
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,530
Do you want to have a drink?

125
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,760
Human fate is funny.

126
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,810
Who knew we would meet again like this

127
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,210
and live in the same apartment?

128
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,080
I resented you for a really long time.

129
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,090
Everytime I heard something about Seo Jin,

130
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,080
I thought about you.

131
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,500
So I stayed far away from music as I got older.

132
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,660
I must be getting punished.

133
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,340
 You saw it. Your wife's true face. 

134
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,370
Don't say that and have a good life with Seo Jin.

135
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,460
Stop fighting.

136
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,180
What if...

137
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,490
I ever come back to you?

138
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,610
I would never be good enough for you Yun Hui, right?

139
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,270
I think that's enough. You're drunk.

140
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,830
 Yun Hui, make Seo Jin feel all the pain she's made you suffer. 

141
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,280
 You don't have to feel guilty at all. 

142
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,580
 You can do that. 

143
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,600
Let's not do this.

144
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,540
You won't have to worry about Oh Yun Hui. You helped make things a lot easier.

145
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,310
We just need to have the steering committee meeting tonight to cast their votes.

146
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm trusting you.

147
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,800
Make sure to get that woman out of my sight.

148
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
You don't have to worry.

149
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,720
What's wrong?

150
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,160
I think someone touched my gun.

151
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,780
I don't even let the workers touch this gun.

152
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,520
They probably nudged it a bit while cleaning.

153
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,850
I think you're being too sensitive.

154
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,570
You should hurry. It's getting late.

155
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,650
What's this? He's still not home?

156
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,340
Where were you? Your car was in the garage.

157
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
What happened to your hand?

158
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,980
I asked, where were you last night?

159
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,040
Why are you acting like that?

160
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,210
Why are you packing your things?

161
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,500
I asked, what the hell do you think you're doing?

162
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,090
Well, since I came with nothing,

163
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,290
I guess I could leave with nothing, too.

164
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,560
Let's get a divorce. Let's stop deceiving each other.

165
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,410
What? Divorce?

166
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,740
Isn't this what you wanted, too?

167
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,720
I'll speak to your father.

168
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,850
Let's end this quickly as soon as getting the paperwork done.

169
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,210
 Have some hangover soup before you go to work. You were really drunk. 

170
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,210
You were with Oh Yun Hui all night?

171
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,400
And you dare to bring up a divorce? With what right?

172
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,770
You think I'm going to let you two do whatever you want?

173
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,540
I'm going to take Eun Byeol with me the second I find a house.

174
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,890
I can't leave her alone with someone like you.

175
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,300
Leaving may be easy, but it's going to be much harder to come back.

176
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,160
I don't intend to come back.

177
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
I'll stop sending the living expense to your parents at Yeongwol from this month.

178
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,810
And the marriage fund for a bunch of your siblings will be stopped immediately!

179
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,640
I do have that much money too.

180
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,270
Eun Byeol's dad!

181
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,770
Ha Yun Cheol!

182
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,970
Mom! What's wrong?

183
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,720
Ro Na, you can go.

184
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,790
You disgusting, superficial bitch.

185
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,490
Is this because of Yun Cheol?

186
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,380
Are you really that unconfident?

187
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,100
Stop making it obvious that you don't have a husband.

188
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,450
I think you plan on staying here using my husband.

189
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,090
But things will never go the way you want them to.

190
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,930
We'll see soon enough.

191
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,730
The one leaving Hera Palace

192
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,990
won't be me, but you.

193
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,140
You, Cheon Seo Jin.

194
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,140
Yes, hello?

195
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,410
Logan Lee? You're a hard man to see.

196
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,720
Have you received the files I sent?

197
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Yes, I got the documents.

198
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,830
A few obstacles here and there, but fairly a satisfying deal.

199
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,780
Okay. I'll set up a date soon.

200
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,850
Yes, that'll be great.

201
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,330
Let me know anytime. I'll be waiting.

202
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,430
You're late to work, Doctor Ha.

203
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,440
Are you still upset about the Oh Yun Hui situation?

204
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,910
I thought we called it even.

205
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,600
I have good news.

206
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,650
Soon, I'll be selling the Myeongdong land for the best price.

207
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,760
Your bank account will be quite full.

208
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't touch me!

209
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,130
Please withdraw my investments as quickly as possible.

210
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,440
That stingy bastard.

211
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,510
I just don't like him.

212
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,080
   

213
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,870
 J King Holdings 
 From Chairman Ju Dan Tae 

214
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,360
I saw Cheon Seo Jin leaving your apartment earlier, Yun Hui.

215
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,270
Did something happen between you two?

216
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,710
I was with Ha Yun Cheol last night.

217
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,660
I think he figured out Cheon Seo Jin's affair.

218
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,430
And that the other guy is Chairman Ju as well.

219
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,260
Was it your doing?

220
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,170
That Cheon Seo Jin keeps provoking me.

221
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,440
She even brought Ro Na's grandmother to cause a scene. How could I stay calm?

222
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,520
And he would've found out eventually.

223
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,210
- So... 
 - Aren't you even mad?

224
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,210
It wouldn't be enough to rip Cheon Seo Jin into shreds.

225
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,550
Your elegance is a disease. Why don't you say anything?

226
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,920
You're having such a hard time by yourself

227
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,800
while that brat is completely fine. How is that fair?

228
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,340
It's so infuriating.

229
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,990
Anyway, that household is going to be in hell for a while.

230
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,110
Since Ha Yun Cheol found out, do you think he'll let his cheating wife sit still?

231
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:48,030
That guy had an "I'm screwed in this life" face,

232
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,110
but for some reason, it made me feel good.

233
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:59,030
Still, that was only for a moment.

234
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,090
What does that mean?

235
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,360
The feeling of being betrayed by your spouse...

236
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,380
I know the pain and hell he's going through right now.

237
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,150
I know it too well. I felt sad for him.

238
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,410
So I became his drinking buddy.

239
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,830
That's where we stopped.

240
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,620
Are you sure absolutely nothing happened?

241
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,250
I took a couple pictures to completely piss Cheon Seo Jin off,

242
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,470
but I couldn't send them.

243
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,230
I'm Ro Na's mom.

244
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,930
I don't want to do anything that she'll be embarrassed about.

245
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,730
My Ro Na only has me in this world.

246
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,370
I'm sorry, Yun Hui.

247
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,970
I thought badly of you for a second.

248
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,670
You're really an amazing person.

249
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:17,020
Su Ryeon, let's be friends forever.

250
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,600
Let's never fight or betray each other.

251
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,730
No matter how big a problem you cause, I will never hate you.

252
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,320
Really? You promise?

253
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,420
Sure. Promise.

254
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,090
Seok Hun did it?

255
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,340
He came to me on his own two feet and confessed.

256
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,230
For now, Seok Hun's mother came by to take him home.

257
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,140
but I'm not sure how we should settle this.

258
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,610
Well, she did promise to buy air conditioners for the entire school this summer.

259
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,100
I suppose letting this go would be the reasonable choice.

260
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,350
Ju Seok Hun. We are specially letting this slide just this once thanks to the Arts Director.

261
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,400
You basically used a parents' chance card.

262
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,490
The gold card.

263
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,210
I already had to hush up your violence incident last time.

264
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,210
It's regrettable that something like this happened again.

265
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,330
Don't ruin your father's reputation.

266
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,620
Focus on your audition for the publicity model role.

267
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey. Aren't you going to thank the Arts Director?

268
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,510
You're relying too much on your father right now, you punk.

269
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,730
 No one will go to the engine room to see Min Seol Ah, right? 

270
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,580
 If she reveals the truth about our relationship... 

271
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,970
She probably did it because I'm worth it to her.

272
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,900
What the hell are you saying?

273
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,510
Hey, Ju Seok Hun! That little punk —

274
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,660
Let him go.

275
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,510
He's at that age.

276
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:09,240
During your probation period, you got into trouble again?

277
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,980
Was it really you who did it? Did you put the cigarettes in Bae Ro Na's bag?

278
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,130
Goodness me. You've never received a punishment you deserve,

279
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,590
so you keep doing the same things over and over again.

280
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,500
It's not too late to apologize to Ahn Eun Hu for beating him.

281
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,690
I didn't do anything worth apologizing for.

282
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,000
Are you so good at fighting? Hm?

283
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,950
You know how to throw a good punch?

284
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,220
Come on, want to spar with me?

285
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,430
Bring  it on, punk. Show me what you got!

286
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,800
You should stop. It's embarrassing to lose to your student.

287
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,140
What, you scared?

288
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,080
You scared and want to back out?

289
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,010
Then, admit that you beat up Ahn Eun Hu. And apologize to him.

290
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,450
I can't! He deserved to be hit.

291
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,090
You sure have a lot of excuses for beating a kid up, you heartless punk!

292
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,880
Hey, if you're going to box,

293
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,490
you should've made it fair. Why did you cover his eyes?

294
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,680
You cowardly bastard.

295
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,350
I will not go easy on you because you're a teacher.

296
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,890
Wow, Ju Seok Hun. Your fists aren't what I expected.

297
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,090
Why are they so slow?

298
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,010
You sure acted cocky before.

299
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,550
Shut up with the bullshit and focus on the match.

300
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,570
Bull... You dare say that to a teacher?

301
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,130
Fine. Hey, should we do this for real?

302
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,700
Come at me.

303
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,590
Saw that? You're no match for me, you punk.

304
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,730
Why didn't you attack my face?

305
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,170
You think I'm a fool?

306
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,730
You think I want to get fired for beating up the son of a rich family?

307
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,950
I only attacked the fatal points that aren't in plain sight.

308
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,260
Unlike a certain coward.

309
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:42,440
Ju Seok Hun, make sure to clean up before you go.

310
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,710
It's thirty minutes today.

311
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,730
Thirty minutes?

312
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,650
Why do the times keep getting shorter? How can he eat in that time?

313
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,360
Just let him eat the lunch then go. If you're caught, we all die.

314
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,850
I got it, so just open the door.

315
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,960
Honey!

316
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,600
 Avoid possible burns  

317
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,340
Your face is so sunken, Honey.

318
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,990
I missed you like crazy.

319
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,530
It's only thirty minutes today.

320
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,380
 2020 Cheong Ah Publicity Model Audition Manuscript 

321
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,970
 Nambu Correctional Center 

322
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,830
I lost enough money for a new car in thirty minutes.

323
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,720
That's why you work hard to earn money.

324
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,210
Hello, Father-in-law.

325
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,280
Honey.

326
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,610
I came for lunch, too. That's okay, right?

327
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,090
How could the two of you go on a date without me?

328
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,900
I didn't have any afternoon classes, so I tagged along with Father.

329
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,610
Let's go in.

330
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,260
Alright, what is it you wanted to tell me?

331
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,560
By any chance, does your family need more money?

332
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,900
It's nothing like that.

333
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,180
Our parents-in-law are living comfortably now.

334
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,740
Even our sisters-in-law found work so they can take care of themselves.

335
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,970
It's unexpected but still good news.

336
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,330
Now you should take care of Seo Jin, too.

337
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,190
How long will you be the only one to receive support?

338
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,030
He cares so much for me.

339
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,100
Right, Honey?

340
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,440
The braised pollack is pretty good but it's too far from you.

341
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,370
Eat up.

342
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,090
Ow, you're hurting me!

343
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,680
Do you think I would change my mind even if you acted like this?

344
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,320
I don't know why you're acting like this but enough with the whining already.

345
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,870
If couples divorce over a couple of fights, no one would get married.

346
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,600
Is divorce a joke to you?

347
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,030
This is an important moment of Eun Byeol's life. How could you be so selfish?

348
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,510
How dare you say that to me?

349
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,690
You think you have the right to worry about Eun Byeol?

350
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,370
I'm going to tell Father everything and get the divorce.

351
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,240
Even if we do get a divorce, it will be by my choice.

352
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,960
I will be the one to decide, and when.

353
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,710
The whole world revolves around you, doesn't it?

354
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,960
Everything you've done —

355
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,930
Just answer the call.

356
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,370
What is it?

357
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,960
It's urgent, Doctor!

358
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,580
 Current Time 
Time in Surgery / Time Under Anesthesia 

359
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,580
 Even if we do get a divorce, it will be by my choice. 

360
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,880
 I will be the one to decide, and when. 

361
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,110
There is a massive hemorrhage, Doctor!

362
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,440
Control the hemorrhage first then suction.

363
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,300
Hemostatic clamp.

364
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,440
The blood isn't stopping!

365
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,770
I think we touched a nerve. What do we do?

366
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,210
Bleeding is getting severe.

367
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,260
Pulse is in 60.

368
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,610
It's getting weak, Doctor.

369
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,870
Her blood pressure is dropping!

370
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,090
Patient's condition keeps getting worse.

371
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,640
- What should we do, Doctor? 
 - This is an emergency situation!

372
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,210
- Doctor Ha! 
 - Doctor Ha!

373
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,720
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

374
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,300
What should we do, Doctor?

375
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,130
Who are you trying to fool?

376
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,960
Has Son-in-law Ha ever called me first to grab a meal?

377
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,180
There's a problem between you two, isn't there?

378
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,540
It's true we fought, but it's nothing serious, Father.

379
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,990
It's just a typical couple's fight.

380
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,180
You are the one who insisted on this marriage!

381
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,600
What have you been doing with your life, losing your husband's interest?

382
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,830
You can barely take care of your family. How are you supposed to take care of Cheong Ah Foundation?

383
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,580
I can do a good job.

384
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,300
To get that position, I even gave up the soloist at the Teatro alla Scala and came back to Korea.

385
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,370
I'll never give in the Cheong Ah Foundation chairperson position to Seo Yeong.

386
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,580
Why don't you hold onto Son-in-law Ha first?

387
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,320
Make sure no ridiculous rumors get out!

388
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,940
There is no divorce in our family.

389
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,730
If you're going to divorce him, give up on the chairwoman position!

390
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,480
 Connecting... Black Box 

391
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,010
So, he saw everything?

392
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,600
 Cheong Ah Medical Center Director Park 

393
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,140
Hello, Director Park.

394
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,570
You must be so busy. I heard there were a lot of patients and things are hectic

395
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,080
at the hospital from my husband.

396
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,180
What did you say?

397
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,040
If he hurt his hand and wasn't feeling well, he should have let us know beforehand.

398
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,810
The patient could have been paralyzed!

399
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,680
Her family is making a fuss saying they will sue.

400
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,840
If you don't resolve this situation properly, don't even dream of becoming a future director.

401
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,880
I'm sorry, Director. I will take full responsibility for everything.

402
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,810
And how are you going to do that?

403
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,870
Are you aware that the patient is a VVIP?

404
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,450
Once they receive the footage of what happened in the surgery room, you'll be forced to meet with the disciplinary committee.

405
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,040
As a director of the foundation, it is very unfortunate that the surgery was unsuccessful.

406
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,470
However, isn't it impossible to claim this as malpractice?

407
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,190
I want you to take care of this case quickly in order to reduce leaking any negative talk at maximum.

408
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,480
That's true, but I don't think the family will easily settle this—

409
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,410
Aren't you in the director's position to take care of such matters?

410
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,370
It was an unavoidable happening while a doctor was treating a critically ill patient.

411
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,470
We can't take any responsibility of the patient if the judiciary doesn't accept this as a malpractice.

412
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:02,200
Do you plan on losing a capable doctor over one small mistake?

413
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,920
As for a settlement issue of the legal dispute, a smart and sexy lawyer...

414
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,310
Lee Gyu Jin will take this case.

415
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,480
Doctor Ha, you were born lucky when it comes to women.

416
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,890
If everything goes well, you should be good to your wife.

417
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,650
This is all thanks to Seo Jin.

418
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,880
You must be having the time of your life.

419
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,130
Why is this so boring?

420
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,700
Those who have everything don't know how to treasure their things.

421
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,310
Stand straight, you don't have to feel so down.

422
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,510
Do you plan on quitting the hospital over something like this?

423
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,940
Shut that mouth of yours. I don't need any your help.

424
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,340
You can't live without me. We're a married couple.

425
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,410
No matter what anyone says.

426
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,340
You think I don't know why you need me?

427
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,880
This is for the chairperson position of Cheong Ah Foundation, isn't it?

428
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,440
Your father will hate having a scratch on that oh-so-great family of yours. Am I wrong?

429
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,400
Did you see us? Me and Chairman Ju together?

430
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,820
So?

431
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,940
- What? 
 - It's not a big deal.

432
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,030
These things can happen to couples at least once.

433
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,530
It's like a car accident, the same way you were drawn to Oh Yun Hui.

434
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,770
Are you out of your mind?

435
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,650
How could you say something so insane? The other guy is Ju Dan Tae.

436
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,390
The man I loathe the most!

437
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,960
So did you! You also met with Oh Yun Hui, the woman I loathe the most.

438
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,080
That's why we need to separate.

439
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,970
You want me to stay as Cheon Seo Jin's accessory like a fool?

440
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,470
Yeah. You can't even do that?

441
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,300
Have you ever done something good for me until now?

442
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,860
That's why you should've done something at least once!

443
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:51,520
Divorce? I told you, it will never happen without my consent.

444
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,340
You're crazy.

445
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,950
I don't think you're in an ideal situation right now.

446
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,990
If I don't help you, then Cheong Ah Medical will drive this incident to your personal medical negligence.

447
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,960
Then your doctor's license will be taken away and you will be completely blacklisted in this field.

448
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,970
Eun Byeol?

449
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,880
You'll never take her.

450
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,450
Both the house and custody, either. The judge will rule in my favor.

451
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,260
Because you have made zero contribution to our assets.

452
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,420
Cheon Seo Jin!

453
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,820
But!

454
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,590
If you come back to home as if nothing happened,

455
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,780
I'm planning to protect you from the patient's guardians' malpractice claim by all means.

456
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,950
You're my husband, after all.

457
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,610
It's your choice, but I can't wait long.

458
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,060
I'll tell Eun Byeol you went to a conference.

459
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,810
My heart hurts for you.

460
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,460
It's about your divorce. I don't think it'll be easy.

461
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,270
You have to think about this carefully.

462
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,370
You want to get kicked out of the hospital, never be allowed to see Eun Byeol again, and live as an incompetent divorcee?

463
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,610
You can't!

464
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:13,990
You should keep the title of son-in-law of Cheong Ah Foundation and live a lavish life forever.

465
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,760
Your life is in Cheon Seo Jin's hands.

466
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,140
Text me.

467
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,540
Cheon Seo Jin is really something.

468
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,320
How could she be so confident when she's cheating?

469
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,370
She's freaking cool.

470
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,550
 This phone was in the vent. 

471
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,710
 I'm sure someone will come for it. 

472
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,220
 About that phone, I think I know whose it is. 

473
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,610
   

474
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,670
   

475
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,260
 The password... I got it! 

476
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,310
 - You got it? 
 - Yes. 

477
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,040
 My daughter is crying and making such a fuss saying she forgot her password. 

478
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,340
 My daughter is so pretty, isn't she? 

479
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,180
 She is! 

480
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,870
-  She looks just like her father. 
 - You punk. 

481
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,150
 You can go. 

482
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,920
 Was she a good student? 

483
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,740
Let's see.

484
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,380
Ju Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin—

485
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,640
You were being threatened by Min Seol Ah.

486
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:28,350
Did you even involve us in murdering Min Seol Ah after you did it perfectly?

487
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,410
There is a card I have.

488
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,190
How will I use it...?

489
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,860
You can look forward to it.

490
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,380
Your face will be tanned if you stay like that.

491
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,420
I thought you might need this.

492
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,110
What's the pain relief patch for?

493
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,320
I saw before. You got hit by the PE teacher.

494
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,550
I'm sorry.  It was because of me.

495
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,570
It wasn't.

496
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,010
Hey, why are you suddenly undressing?

497
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,000
Didn't you bring it for me to use? Give it to me.

498
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,360
Good luck with the audition.

499
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,360
Yeah.  You too.

500
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,750
- Oppa, is something wrong?  Did you get hurt? 
 - No.

501
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,910
Did the PE Teacher really hit you?

502
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,830
I'm not going to let this slide, Gu Ho Dong.

503
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,060
Don't say anything to Dad.

504
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,280
So why did you get involved in Bae Ro Na's business?

505
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,370
Even if you misunderstood that I did it.

506
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:07,210
I think Teacher Gu is determined to watch us.  Be careful for the time being.

507
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,280
What is there to be careful about.  There is a real culprit.

508
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,600
- Eun Byeol. 
  - What?

509
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,880
She did it.  I saw.

510
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,790
When we went to Bae Ro Na's home, Eun Byeol was in her bedroom.

511
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,180
- I'm sure she did it. 
 - Why would Eun Byeol do it?

512
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,800
Because Eun Byeol likes you, she wants to make Bae Ro Na get into trouble.

513
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,580
Thinking that you are interested in Bae Ro Na, Eun Byeol must have  a lot of heartache.

514
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,980
How could someone imagine something so nasty?

515
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,080
If Ha Eun Byeol and Bae Ro Na have a proper fight,

516
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,160
I can be the publicity model.

517
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,460
Will you help me? Let's go.

518
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,630
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

519
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,030
   

520
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,200
   

521
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,370
Do you really have to go this far?

522
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:53,580
Then, do you think it makes sense that we live in the same apartment on good terms?

523
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,210
Your fun play at Hera Palace ends today.

524
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,240
Still, since you've slept here for a few days, your life is successful.

525
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,830
You did get something to brag about for a long time.

526
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,870
Get ready and come down.  It starts at 7 pm.

527
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,760
The reason that an emergency meeting of the steering committee was called today is

528
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,060
a complaint was received that the new resident of 4502

529
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,670
damaged the reputation of Hera Palace.

530
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,960
And today to determine whether the resident should be evicted.

531
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,290
If you agree to the eviction, vote in favor,

532
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,960
and if you oppose, then vote against it.

533
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,630
Wait a moment.

534
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,380
In talking about damage to the reputation of Hera Palace,

535
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,020
doesn't Oh Yun Hui look like a victim?

536
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,370
Isn't talking about a mandatory eviction aggression by the board?

537
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,190
In any case, since a complaint was received, shouldn't we follow procedure?

538
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,060
Oh, my husband is regrettably absent because he has a seminar.

539
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,850
If Dr. Ha isn't here, do we need to conduct a vote?

540
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,990
Who would vote against?

541
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:03,720
Knowing that, Dr. Ha gave me a proxy,

542
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,560
and voted in advance.

543
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,530
What a virtuous man he is.

544
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,920
Okay, let's start voting.

545
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,810
There is a rule guaranteeing secrecy.

546
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,940
Please turn around and wait.

547
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,190
 Ballot on Eviction of Oh Yun Hui 

548
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,590
   Agree X 

549
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,940
 Agree X 

550
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,900
Let's count the votes. Please.

551
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,980
Then, let's start counting.

552
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,330
Agree.

553
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,580
 Agree  | Oppose 

554
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,340
Agree.

555
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,330
Agree.

556
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,270
We've already got three votes in favor of eviction.

557
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,750
I can't believe it.  As soon as you unpacked, you're being kicked out.

558
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,720
Please continue.

559
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,990
Opposed.

560
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,770
That was Su Ryeon's vote, wasn't it?

561
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,930
Opposed.

562
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,980
That must be Dr. Ha's vote.

563
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,640
There aren't any more opposed votes, are there?

564
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,950
- Then it is five in agreement vs. two— 
 - Opposed.

565
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,590
Who the heck was that?  I was sure we were all loyal.

566
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,480
Calm down. There is one more vote.

567
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,420
This last vote will determine Oh Yun Hui's fate.

568
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,610
Opposed.

569
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,760
- Unbelievable! 
 - You guys seriously, Jeez.

570
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,500
Congratulations.

571
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,710
Really.  
    

572
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,980
Who the heck are the ones opposed?

573
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,880
Isn't there a rule guaranteeing secrecy for voting?

574
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:28,050
Thank you. For accepting me as a neighbor I'm very thankful.

575
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:32,070
Going forward I will do my best to not generate any criticism.

576
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,950
Thank you.

577
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,270
Honey, did you see Teacher Cheon's expression earlier?

578
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,640
She's so mad that she could die.

579
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,610
But, how could there be 4 votes against?

580
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,710
Who the hell were the traitors?

581
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,070
I know.

582
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,950
 What? 

583
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,500
 Have you every hugged my Ro Na? 

584
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,850
  Just money. Money! 

585
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,490
 Oppose 

586
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,880
 Then can I ask you anytime I have something I don't know? 

587
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,870
 LIke Oppa. 

588
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,120
 Opposed. 

589
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,810
You're not, are you?

590
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:35,320
If not either of us,

591
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,190
Chairman Ju and Je Ni's mom who were traitors.

592
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:42,340
Jeez, I didn't see them that way. They must have weak minds.

593
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,460
I'm going to exercise.

594
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,380
Call my mom for hello.

595
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,550
Is he kidding?

596
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,470
 Oppa. You said you would find my mom. 

597
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,480
 You have to do it. 

598
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,720
 Why are you looking for her now? She abandoned you. 

599
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,280
  I need to confirm something. 

600
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,120
 How is my mom living. 

601
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,390
 How would you like her to be living? 

602
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,870
 I want her to be as unhappy as I am. 

603
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,580
 I want her to be as unhappy as I am. 

604
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,270
 I want her to be as unhappy as I am. 

605
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,670
 I want her to be as unhappy as I am. 

606
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,820
Sim Su Ryeon.

607
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,500
You should not be so happy.

608
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,520
Wow, that's pretty.

609
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,020
I made them myself.

610
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,860
Please take care of me in the future.

611
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,410
- I will enjoy it.  Yun Hui, have a seat. 
 - Yes.

612
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,570
It looks delicious. How did she make all these?

613
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,910
If Teacher Cheon finds out, we're going to be in hot water.

614
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,450
You made this yourself? You are talented.

615
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,470
It's very delicious.

616
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,790
Is it okay?

617
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,680
It's good.

618
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,850
What is this?

619
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:14,780
 2020 Cheong Ah School Publicity Model Audition 

620
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,950
Pretty!

621
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,970
 Cheon Seo Jin 

622
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,150
Cool!

623
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,450
Now the next model is Ha Eun Byeol.

624
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,780
Naturally good. Could we hear your statement?

625
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,250
If I become the publicity model,

626
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:47,380
I will throw body and soul into promoting the value of Cheong Ah Arts School.

627
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,500
Very well done. 
  Kwon Hye Mi 

628
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,050
The other teachers have no objection to passing her, right?

629
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,820
Next, Ju Seok Hun.

630
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,480
Seok Hun is really handsome.

631
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,010
Seok Hun passed the camera test.

632
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,110
Good luck.

633
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,910
Thanks.

634
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,930
Lee Min Hyeok.

635
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,380
I asked the mothers to come to school.

636
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,930
As you see from the video, it's not something we should tolerate.

637
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:52,420
If parents teach children wrongly,

638
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,310
parents should also be punished.

639
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:00,340
Everyone.  Ten hours of community service.  Any objection?

640
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,040
- Ten— 
 - I have no objection.

641
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:07,530
Parents who were supposed to set good examples, were busy covering up and settling their children's bad behavior.

642
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,070
I will gladly accept any punishment.

643
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,620
But, shouldn't Teacher Cheon be punished?

644
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,350
Eun Byeol also participated in the incident.

645
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:20,200
Oh, the Arts Department head had to be left out because she is judging the audition for publicity model.

646
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,750
That means she doesn't want to get punished with us for her reputation.

647
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,290
Anyway, she's full of herself.

648
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,520
Hello,  Chairman.

649
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,550
It's Seok Hun's mother.

650
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,010
- Is Chairman Ju doing fine? 
 - Yes, thankfully.

651
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,100
Thank you for always working hard for the school.

652
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,020
- Teacher  Gu. 
 - Yes.

653
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,680
There's no need to have Seok Hun's mother do community service.

654
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,240
No.  It was my fault.

655
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,440
And, I hope the children also will receive appropriate punishment

656
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,130
for their part in the wrongdoing, Chairman.

657
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,710
It's not cool.

658
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,270
We're here to get punished instead of the kids so they won't get demerits.

659
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,370
Why are you borrowing trouble? Really.

660
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,640
Will you be responsible if our kids don't get accepted to Seoul National University?

661
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,310
Is just Seoul National University so important?

662
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,250
What do you mean just Seoul National University?  It's very important to me.

663
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,470
We made Min Hyeok sing so that we can send him to Seoul National.

664
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:27,240
Min Hyeok's dad's whole family went to Seoul National, Stanford, and Oxford.

665
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,130
If Min Hyeok can't go to Seoul National,

666
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,730
how much blame will I get that he takes after his mother's brain?

667
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,250
What should I do first?

668
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:42,750
That's a good attitude.

669
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,540
It's a good day to clean, isn't it?

670
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,530
Shall we start first with separating the recyclable trash?

671
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,210
Recycle? We're going to work with trash?

672
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,120
Who did this like this?

673
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,220
Do it like this.

674
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,330
What are you doing?

675
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,630
Lift this up like this...

676
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,550
Make this volume big...

677
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,080
Like this. Like this!

678
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,590
Je Ni's mother and Min Hyeok's mothers are working so hard.

679
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:31,980
Is Seok Hun's mother the only one playing around?

680
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,560
I'm working right now.

681
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,340
Don't pretentiously pretend to be working.

682
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,210
Work harder.

683
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:01,280
 I will be the face of Cheong Ah who looks like all my friends, just as they are. 

684
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,380
Phony. Phony.  She's acting like she's some kind of model.

685
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:09,650
Bae Ro Na is surprising.  Does she have talent?

686
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:19,650
Your voice cracked often.  Haven't you been practicing too much?

687
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,450
- What the heck are you doing? 
 - You should talk.  What are you?

688
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,810
Don't say you like Ju Seok Hun.

689
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,970
Must I answer?

690
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,110
This is a warning.  Don't hang around Seok Hun.

691
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:52,250
Don't talk to him. Don't smile at him. Don't act like you know him.

692
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,430
- I don't want to. 
 - What?

693
01:03:54,450 --> 01:04:01,550
I'm going to surely get selected and  be the model with Seok Hun.

694
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,360
Don't even dream that. That's my position.

695
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,670
Wait and see.

696
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:14,710
This time I will not lose to you, Ha Eun Byeol.

697
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,960
Everyone is working hard.

698
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,040
Of course.  Breaking our backs, losing our arms,

699
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,260
we're in the middle of diligently sweeping and wiping.

700
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,580
Oh yes, yes.

701
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,410
Seo Gyeong's mother seems to be wiping without any elbow grease.

702
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,670
There is dust.

703
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,220
Follow me. You have to clean the bathroom.

704
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,130
Not the bathroom for us, please!

705
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,430
The other mothers can take a short break.

706
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,470
Stick to me.

707
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,710
Run to come!

708
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,360
I'm tired.

709
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,200
How is this situation going on?

710
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,080
What do you mean? Su Ryeon is the only one who is spinning her wheel.

711
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,300
Seok Hun was the ringleader.

712
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,190
Are you still cleaning?

713
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,810
Teacher Cheon.

714
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:44,800
We're working to death. Our arms and legs hurt all over.

715
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,580
Can't you make Teacher Gu stop?

716
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,980
Where is he now?

717
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:02,630
Can't you scrub harder?

718
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,510
You said you would be punished for your child?

719
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,380
Are you sure you're reflecting on yourself?

720
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,210
Don't do like that but scrub harder with this.

721
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,100
Use this one too!

722
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,210
This, this, all of these.

723
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,070
Clean properly, please!

724
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,120
Why are you going so far?

725
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,960
Your attitude, isn't it too malicious?

726
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,350
What is it?

727
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:38,350
You must gradually be getting worked up about doing what you haven't done?

728
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,160
Are you feeling responsible for what your kids did wrong?

729
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,020
I guess you must really love them a lot.

730
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,590
Or are you putting on a show?

731
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:52,580
With a noblesse oblige  appropriate for Chairman Ju's reputation, or something like that?

732
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:55,470
Why exactly are you angry with me?

733
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:59,470
I'm not angry. I'm envious.

734
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,250
You look so happy.

735
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:07,680
Well.  I don't know how long that happiness will last.

736
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,590
Don't beat around the bush.

737
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,970
Say what you want now.

738
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,970
Quit the pretense, Ahjumma.

739
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,850
They aren't even your own children.

740
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,800
Right now.

741
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,410
What did you say?

742
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,370
You have your own daughter separately.

743
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,180
Who are you?

744
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,990
Are you curious about who I am?

745
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:42,580
Min Seol Ah's mother.

746
