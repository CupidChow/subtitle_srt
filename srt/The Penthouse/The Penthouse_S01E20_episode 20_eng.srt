1
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,540
Logan! Logan! Good thing you came.

2
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,940
There seems to be a misunderstanding. Please resolve this ridiculous situation.

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,530
You still don't get it now, huh, Mr. Ju.

4
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,100
The person who sued you was me, Mr. Ju Dan Tae.

5
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,300
What did you say?

6
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,560
I sued you.

7
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,280
I heard you used my name to receive investments?

8
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,480
You- You know how to speak Korean?

9
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,190
I want him to receive the strongest penalty according to the law.

10
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,670
I have never been involved with this person regarding business matters.

11
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,910
No, no, no.

12
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,090
Logan Lee, why are you doing this? We even wrote up a contract.

13
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,270
We agreed to create the casino with my Myeong-dong land as collateral—

14
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,130
Would this answer your question?

15
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,810
What is this? This—

16
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,300
 Whether you are someone who will hold my hand or hold me back, 

17
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,030
 Or someone who stabs you in the back. 

18
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,980
This is—

19
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,920
Didn't I say I would stab you in the back?

20
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,980
You bastard! Let go of me!

21
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,990
Get him. Get that bastard!

22
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,800
He's a con man! This bastard is a con man! Let me go.

23
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,040
Gu Ho Dong!

24
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,280
Chairman Ju! Don't say anything!

25
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,350
- Gu Ho Dong! 
 - Use your right to remain silent!

26
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,490
This bastard. You bastard!

27
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,160
Let go. I said that guy is a con man!

28
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,790
Catch that bastard!

29
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,150
Gu Ho Dong!

30
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,740
I bet you're surprised I called you so suddenly.

31
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,900
You were the only person I could think of to ask this favor.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,100
In my life, I thought there would be nothing you could ever ask of me.

33
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,860
I thought you were living well elegantly.  How did you get involved in something like this?

34
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,080
I lived my life holding on to a monster.

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,650
I'm sorry to contact you over something like this.

36
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,660
I graduated by living off you in your house like a parasite for five years.

37
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,130
You even paid for my tuition.

38
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm glad I can pay you back like this.

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,830
Thank you.

40
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
What's the matter, all of a sudden?  What makes you come to the broadcasting station?

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,780
I was waiting for you. There's something I have to tell you urgently.

42
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,320
Su Ryeon, do you happen to know Happy Future Party's Leader Jeong Du Man?

43
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,070
No, I've never met him.

44
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,990
I knew it.

45
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,040
There's a rumor secretly spreading in the political and financial circles,

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,530
that you and Party Leader Jeong Du Man are very close.

47
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,650
What do you mean? Why would I be with such a person?

48
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,420
I found out that reason today.

49
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,210
You said you wanted me to look for Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong's birth mom, right?

50
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,500
Did you find her?

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,460
I found this picture when I was looking through Ju Dan Tae's safe today.

52
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,330
Don't be shocked.

53
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,740
This woman is the twin's biological mother.

54
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,810
No way.

55
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,830
How could this be?

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,220
Where is this woman right now?

57
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,580
 Welcome to 'Reporter Kim's Eyewitness'. 

58
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,330
  Chairman Ju of J King Holdings, the largest investment company in Korea,  

59
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,090
  was arrested on suspicion of embezzlement, bleach of fiduciary duty, and investment fraud.  

60
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,230
  Using a casino business as bait, he planned to collect a large amount of investment money and increase his stock's value. 

61
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,340
 The Seoul Central District Prosecution Office did a search and seizure in the J King Holding building located in Yeoksam-dong, 

62
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,000
 summoned people relevant to this case, and are interrogating them as witnesses.  

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,300
  Today, 'Reporter Kim's eyewitness' will cover this case intensively. 

64
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,950
 A video of an affair between Chairman Cheon of Cheong Ah Foundation and Chairman Ju of J King Holdings is circulating online, 

65
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,010
They played around intensely.

66
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,650
Chief Kang, is there really no hope for Chairman Ju?

67
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,700
Is he going to be arrested?

68
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,870
Then what about my Myeong-dong land?

69
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,320
If the owner is arrested, it'll turn into nothing but paper.

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,390
Take care of it before the price hits rock bottom.

71
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,200
  Cheong Ah foundation is being under investigation for manipulating grades and a corrupt entrance exam— 

72
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,500
No! No!

73
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,110
Eun Byeol!

74
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,170
No! No!

75
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,420
 A re-investigation of the death case of Miss Min, 

76
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,000
 first place student for the 2020's Cheong Ah Arts School's admission has been requested .  

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,260
 Before student Min's death, she was bullied by a group of prospective students of Cheong Ah Arts Schools, 

78
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,590
 and it was also revealed  that she went through serious violent assaults. 

79
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,430
 The interesting part is that the attackers are all residents of the Hera Palace, a symbol of wealth, located in Gangnam. 

80
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,740
  They were called the little Hera Club, and during their time at school, 

81
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,350
  they were allowed despotic power over fellow students. 

82
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,650
Am I going to be kicked out of school for this?

83
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,150
I got in through  Teacher Cheon's connection!

84
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,200
Don't worry. You have me.

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,460
Wait. Wait! Why are you doing this?

86
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,520
Mom!

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,150
Let go of me!

88
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,670
Honey!

89
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,110
Come on!

90
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,120
Mom!

91
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,460
Mom!

92
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,640
Dad!

93
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,660
Dad!

94
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:01,900
  J King Holdings 

95
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,290
What about the Chairman? What happened?

96
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,000
It seems like the investigation is going to get longer.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Everything was seized, even including the secret ledgers from the office, so there is nothing we can do right now.

98
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,090
I should've done something to stop this beforehand.

99
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,530
The people from Hera Club were also taken to the police station.

100
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,830
It looks like they're going to investigate Min Seol Ah's death as well.

101
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,040
The police barged into Hera Palace so the place is in an uproar.

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,150
The police?

103
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,330
Ro Na. My Ro Na.

104
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,690
  The police are re-investigating the death of student Min who died at Hera Palace.  

105
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,190
  They are narrowing their search to the people who entered the building that day. 

106
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,250
  Especially the day the incident occurred— 

107
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,430
Will it end like this?

108
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,970
  They are retracing student Min's steps from that day. 

109
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,460
  They are focusing on the possibility of a murder. 

110
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,390
I'm telling you

111
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,090
this was a coerced

112
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,690
and false confession.

113
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,640
Think about it and tell me.

114
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,460
Why are we being investigated right now?

115
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,500
Sim Su Ryeon is doing this to have the upper hand in her divorce.

116
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,590
That couple is in the middle of a divorce lawsuit right now.

117
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,870
The whole purpose of the divorce was the money.

118
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,690
Since that house has a lot of wealth, in Sim Su Ryeon's view,

119
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,770
it was desperately important to find her husband's weakness.

120
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,320
That's why she went through all that to confine and threaten us.

121
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,110
What was I supposed to do to survive? I should give her the answer she wanted to hear, don't you think?

122
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,580
Sim Su Ryeon, that woman, isn't in her right mind.

123
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,060
Is there any evidence that proves that dead girl is her daughter?

124
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,180
There are suspicions of corruption surrounding the entrance exam process for years, is there anything you would like to say?

125
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,580
Prosecutor. I have a lot of money.

126
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,360
To the point where I'd still have plenty of money even if I spent one hundred million won every month.

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,100
But you're saying I admitted such untalented students just to receive some loose change?

128
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,700
My pride doesn't allow something like that.

129
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,930
I'm curious as to who this whistleblower is. Is it Gu Ho Dong?

130
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,690
I can't confirm that.

131
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,520
There's no one else but him that would say such nonsense .

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,670
But that person, is a con man who stole an identity to get the job.

133
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,290
He's trying to ruin the foundation with that fake name, Gu Ho Dong.

134
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,310
How are you going to explain the corruption of the entrance exam for your daughter?

135
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,860
We've already received her exam video and results.

136
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,990
We even have the file you fabricated yourself.

137
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,600
Are you calling this admission corruption?

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,690
In the vocal department's admission process, we select students by looking at their potential.

139
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,670
We pick students on the quality of their voice and potential for the future.

140
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,160
A mere mistake on that day isn't a good enough reason for elimination.

141
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,950
Are you calling this mere video evidence?

142
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,430
Do you know how much damage you've cost our foundation, Prosecutor?

143
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,590
I won't let this slide.

144
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,120
I want a defamation lawsuit and damage compensation.

145
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,050
All of it.

146
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,190
 What are you drawing, Mom? 

147
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,540
 The house I want to live in later. It's pretty, isn't it? 

148
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,100
 I like an apartment better. 

149
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,750
 But still, if you're going to live there, I'm going to follow you.  

150
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,190
 I'm going to stick to you and live with you forever. Even when I'm married. 

151
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,660
 That's going to be hard for Mom. 

152
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,150
Why are you here?

153
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,310
What are you!

154
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,570
I was worried about you guys.

155
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,080
You're despicable.  If you were really worried about us, would you have done that?

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,560
You were the one who reported Dad, weren't you? Are you out to ruin our family?

157
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,640
Are you happy now that you got your revenge?

158
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,060
Your Dad is receiving his punishment for his wrongdoings.

159
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,360
That's the right thing to be done.

160
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm sick of it! Those wrongdoings, wrongdoings!

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,290
Are we really a family?

162
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,460
If we're family, aren't you supposed to cover up our wrongdoings?

163
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,800
You only care about your precious biological daughter, but don't think of us.

164
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,220
We're your children too. You were our mother!

165
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,480
Was it all a lie?

166
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,910
No. It's not a lie.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,900
I swear, I have never once thought you weren't my children.

168
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,740
If you really thought of us as a family, you would never have done this.

169
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,580
I don't want to see you. Get out.

170
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,710
Get out of our house right now!

171
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,530
- Get out! 
 - Seok Gyeong, come to your senses.

172
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,760
Oppa, say something. Can you understand this lady?

173
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,130
Can you understand what she's done to us?

174
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,780
Why did you come? You know you wouldn't hear nice words.

175
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,220
I am really sorry towards both of you.

176
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,880
However, it was something that had to be done.

177
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,250
That way, I felt like I could forgive you

178
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,650
and go back to before.

179
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,170
I know it's also my fault that you guys became this warped,

180
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,140
but I'm going to live forever with that punishment.

181
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,310
Till the day I die, as your mom—

182
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,150
If you want to hear the word "Mom", go hear it from your dead daughter.

183
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,340
We need some time.

184
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm trying to understand you, so please just go back for now.

185
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,740
I'll be here so don't worry and go.

186
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,140
I'll watch over the kids.

187
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,040
Thank you.

188
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,300
If something happens to them, please contact me.

189
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,190
I will.

190
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,590
Ro Na. Ro Na. Bae Ro Na!

191
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,830
Unni, why are you here?

192
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,960
What about Ro Na?

193
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,260
Ro Na!

194
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,560
Where is Ro Na?

195
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Don't tell me you did something to her.

196
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,860
What do you think I did?

197
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,370
Unni!

198
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,170
If you lay a finger on her, I won't stay still.

199
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,820
And what if you don't stay still? Will you kill me too?

200
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,560
It seems like you know your child is precious.

201
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,960
Tell me now. Where is Ro Na?

202
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,630
Seol Ah thanked you and thought you were a nice lady.

203
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,030
Have you ever thought about what it felt like for her

204
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,630
when the only person she trusted abandoned her?

205
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,830
This is a hundred, no a thousand times more frightening than when I thought Cheon Seo Jin was the one who killed her.

206
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,170
Nothing happened to Ro Na, right?

207
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,710
If something happens to Ro Na, I'll die.

208
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,090
Just kill me and don't touch her.

209
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,780
No.

210
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,410
You need to know the sadness of losing a child.

211
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,630
Isn't it only fair if you go through the same thing?

212
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,530
Unni.

213
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,360
It's all my fault. I did it, so please save Ro Na.

214
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,400
She did nothing wrong.

215
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,140
Ro Na is my life.

216
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,400
Back then I must have been crazy because I was drunk.

217
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,070
I wasn't in my  right mind.

218
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,090
The day you told me you were Seol Ah's mother,

219
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,920
that's when I remembered everything.

220
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,000
I really can't believe I did something like that.

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,350
Really. Please, believe me.

222
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,620
Turn yourself in.

223
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,040
- What? 
 - Admit your crime and receive your punishment.

224
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,080
Then, my Ro Na

225
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,960
will live forever as a murderer's daughter.

226
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,570
I can't. If I do that, my Ro Na will die.

227
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,250
Unni, you also know what Ro Na is like.

228
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,040
So why did you do something like that?

229
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,320
Why did you do something irreversible? All because of Cheong Ah Art School.

230
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Unni, Seol Ah is already dead.

231
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,700
The living ones should live on.

232
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,500
From now on, I'll do really well.

233
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll live by making amends to Seol Ah and you for the rest of my life.

234
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm begging you.

235
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,640
Does it make it okay if the remaining people live well? Do you think it all ends just because you cover it up?

236
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,980
Is that why you joined hands with Ju Dan Tae?

237
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,790
How could you betray me like this, how could you!

238
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,400
I'm going to reveal

239
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,380
every truth.

240
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,520
I'm going to show that Seol Ah

241
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,540
also has a mom.

242
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,070
Unni. No, please. I'm begging like this.

243
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,100
Please, Ro Na can't find out. Please.

244
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Give me some time. To make Ro Na not know about it,

245
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,180
I'll send her abroad and turn myself in as you want.

246
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,190
Please, I ask of you.

247
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,640
Ahjumma, I bought ice cream.

248
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,530
Mom.

249
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,970
What are you doing?

250
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,650
Ro Na.

251
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,860
Why didn't you pick up your phone? I was worried.

252
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,850
I left my phone.

253
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,790
Mom, what's going on?

254
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,360
Is it something I can't know?

255
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,570
It's nothing. It's nothing. Go in and rest.

256
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,670
I'll tell you.

257
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,810
Since it seems too difficult for your mom to tell it.

258
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,530
Unni!

259
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,460
Stop.

260
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll do what you want tomorrow.

261
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,930
So please, stop. Stop.

262
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,470
Keep

263
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,990
your promise.

264
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,750
I'll be on my way.

265
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,910
Mom, are you okay?

266
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,320
Yes.

267
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,520
I'm just a little dizzy.

268
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,820
I'm going to go in and rest.

269
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,700
Mom. Did you see the news?

270
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,170
Hera Palace is in chaos.

271
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,330
You know Min Seol Ah, the one who was first place at Cheong Ah Arts School's admission test.

272
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,160
They said the place she died was Hera Palace.

273
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,260
They said it wasn't a suicide but a homicide.

274
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,590
I don't know what's going on.

275
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,610
We lived in her house for a while.

276
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,510
Ahjussi in the penthouse, Teacher Cheon, and even Je Ni's and Min Hyeok's parents

277
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,040
are being investigated by the police.

278
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm going to bed.

279
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,990
 What do I do, Ro Na? 

280
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,220
 If I turn myself in, the world is going to come after us. 

281
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,020
 It's all over. 

282
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,140
 I ruined your life. 

283
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,040
 Is it true Ha Eun Byeol was admitted corruptly?  

284
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,160
  Out of tune at the admission test?  Wow! 

285
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,370
  Her mom who would shield her is being interrogated by prosecutors.  

286
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,840
 Would she go off like this? 

287
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,260
 She was always acting like a princess, so annoying. 

288
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,570
 Ha Eun Byeol's personal pictures and information were all exposed.  She can't hold her head up any more. 

289
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,710
 The public petitions, that Ha Eun Byeol should be kicked out of school, already reached over 50,000!! 

290
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,900
 Ha Eun Byeol, out! 

291
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,670
How many times did I say it?

292
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,500
There was a party that day, and we were all at the party location.

293
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,060
I...

294
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,280
I saw about 20 people who were holding golf bags  in our elevator on that day.

295
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,480
How many hours are you going to interrogate us for?

296
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,720
You established a paper company and tried to launder your slush fund, didn't you?

297
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,000
This document is the business plan that was handed to Chairman Ju in person by Logan Lee

298
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,950
when he visited J King Holdings.

299
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:32,760
Lawyer. You may be aware, but this is not a question you can answer for him.

300
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,820
I know that but—

301
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,570
Have you ever accepted bribes from parents for an agreement to accept their children to Cheong Ah Arts School?

302
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,050
No.

303
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:45,000
What is this file of manipulated entrance exam results we found in your computer?

304
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,740
I never made any file like that.

305
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,390
Then who made this file?

306
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,960
I don't know that.

307
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,780
If you didn't make this, why was it found in your office?

308
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,190
This is the first time I've ever seen such a file.

309
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:06,430
Prosecutor. You've been interrogating for awhile now. Let's take a break.

310
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,560
You did a good job, Chairwoman.

311
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,640
Get some rest. I'll prepare well for your next summons.

312
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,390
You did well too, Lawyer Park.

313
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,540
Doctor Ha is being investigated at the police station as a witness.

314
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,420
I am tired. Let's go home.

315
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,260
Eun Byeol.

316
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,720
Eun Byeol?

317
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,960
Eun Byeol? Eun Byeol!

318
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,300
Eun Byeol! Why are you like this? Eun Byeol?

319
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,430
Eun Byeol! Come to your senses!

320
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,920
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

321
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,660
Her oxygen levels are dropping!

322
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,590
Eun Byeol! Don't die! Eun Byeol!

323
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,700
If something happens to you, I'll die too!

324
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,360
Are you done yet? She's dying!

325
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,940
Eun Byeol!

326
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,450
Please, Eun Byeol!

327
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,130
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol.

328
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,800
Eun Byeol, Mom is here. Eun Byeol?

329
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,430
Eun Byeol! Her body is cold!

330
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,880
Hurry, please hurry!

331
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,900
Look at how cold her body is!

332
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,440
Hurry!

333
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,970
- Her blood pressure is dropping! 
 - Get me a defibrillator!

334
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,250
Yes.

335
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,890
200 joules. Clear.

336
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,830
Shock.

337
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,150
- 250 joules. 
 - 250 joules. Clear.

338
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,930
Shock.

339
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,880
 Mom! 

340
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,990
  Cheong Ah Arts School Entrance Ceremony 

341
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,660
Normal heart rhythm has returned.

342
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,890
Eun Byeol...

343
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,550
Chairwoman!

344
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,510
Where are you?

345
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,570
Where are you right now, Sim Su Ryeon?!

346
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,120
Cheon Seo Jin.

347
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,160
Please...

348
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,790
stop now.

349
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,390
Stop it right here.

350
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,170
I beg you.

351
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,400
My Eun Byeol... please spare her.

352
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,990
I really... didn't kill your daughter.

353
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,550
I know.

354
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,100
That you didn't kill her.

355
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,490
What is it?

356
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,230
- I am sorry. 
 - Okay.

357
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,030
What's wrong?

358
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,510
I waited for you because I have to ask you for a favor.

359
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,860
You know?

360
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,450
If you know it, why are you going this far?

361
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,970
Then... do you think that you have done nothing wrong?

362
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:40,110
By disrespecting, locking up, and threatening my Seol Ah, and even fabricating a suicide note, you made my child's death dirty!

363
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,420
And on top of that you had an affair with my husband.

364
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,180
Right in front of my eyes.

365
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,520
What do you feel is so unfair?

366
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,910
So... you will go to the very end?

367
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,620
My Eun Byeol tried to die! Will you feel relieved once my daughter dies?

368
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,300
That's your problem. Didn't you bring up this on yourself?

369
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,680
Please stop. Please stop here.

370
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
This is an issue among the adults.

371
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,520
Do you think you have the right to wound my daughter?

372
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Did you have the right to wound Seol Ah?

373
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,330
Your daughter will receive exactly the same that my child did.

374
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,970
I don't plan on stopping.

375
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,310
All the evidence I collected will be sent to the police, and if it gets rejected, I'll send it again.

376
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,620
And again. I'll do everything to prove your crimes.

377
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,530
If you want to protect Eun Byeol, admit your crimes and accept your punishment.

378
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,530
Step down from the foundation's chairperson's position and never teach students again.

379
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,970
I can't do that.

380
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,150
I worked so hard for that position. It's my everything!

381
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,930
You still have ambition towards the chairperson's position?

382
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,550
Is that why you still can't give up the position after seeing your child dying?

383
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,460
Is your ambition and greed more precious than your child?

384
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,490
Don't talk to me like that. What does something like you know?!

385
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,530
Pull yourself together if you want to save your child! You're a mother too.

386
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:23,900
For your own sake and Eun Byeol's, give up everything and accept your punishment.

387
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,410
Before you do, I don't care about Eun Byeol's wounds.

388
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:54,050
Alright. Just go ahead. Let's go to the end.

389
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,470
I won't stand by and let you attack me.

390
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,100
Really?

391
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,610
I almost forgot.

392
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:13,440
I'll apologize for revealing the affair video of you and Ju Dan Tae.

393
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,300
What did you say?

394
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,820
You guys were already over, but I wasn't being considerate.

395
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,640
You didn't know? Ju Dan Tae is already on Oh Yun Hui's side.

396
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,050
No way.

397
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,280
Why would Ju Dan Tae fall for someone like Oh Yun Hui? Do you think I'll be convinced by your lies?

398
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,490
You're still believing Jun Tan Dae?

399
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,090
Then see it for yourself.

400
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,420
Did you make Eun Byeol like that for a man like him?

401
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,600
I feel terrible for you, Cheon Seo Jin.

402
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,890
Get rid of Sim Su Ryeon.

403
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,910
What did you just say?

404
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,860
Are you asking me to kill Sim Su Ryeon?

405
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,410
That woman, Sim Su Ryeon, is not as weak as you think.

406
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,280
No, she's already become too strong.

407
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,620
What are you talking about?

408
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,340
The person helping Sim Su Ryeon was Logan Lee.

409
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,950
Sim Su Ryeon is holding hands with Logan. I confirmed it myself.

410
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,820
I know already. He's the one who sued me.

411
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,150
I will regret for eternity that I found out so late.

412
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,250
Are you going to let them be, even knowing that?

413
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,450
Sim Su Ryeon, that woman, is terrifying.

414
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,120
She won't end this quietly. We have to stop it before.

415
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,990
If not... You and I will both die.

416
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,120
But... why?

417
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,020
Why do you want to kill Sim Su Ryeon so badly?

418
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,960
I've become curious.

419
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,830
That's...

420
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,910
Because Su Ryeon knows of our relationship.

421
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:36,430
Everything including that I'm helping you now. We can't go back know.

422
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:40,150
Su Ryeon isn't in her right mind, she's even threatening my Ro Na.

423
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,070
She might lock us both up for embezzlement.

424
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,910
I don't intend to leave her alone.

425
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,700
Both Sim Su Ryeon and that bastard Logan Lee.

426
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:55,830
You and I have become one person to Su Ryeon.

427
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,860
An enemy that she has to get revenge on.

428
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,920
We can't just stand by and let her attack us.

429
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,880
Don't worry. If you fall into danger while helping me,

430
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,540
I have to protect you.

431
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,280
Let me take care of Sim Su Ryeon, it won't take long.

432
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,500
Oh Yun Hui!

433
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,950
Explain yourself. Why are you with this man?

434
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,260
Tell me? What are you doing with him?

435
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,290
- Let go. 
 - What are you doing right now?

436
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,560
What's your relationship with him? Did you sleep together?

437
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,130
Did you? Did you sleep with him?

438
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,480
Tell me yourself. Tell me!

439
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,240
Get your hands off my woman!

440
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,940
What?

441
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,870
What did you just say right now?

442
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,710
How could you do this to me? How could you!

443
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,830
Did you lie to me? You said it wasn't Oh Yun Hui. You deceived me?!

444
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,580
How could you?

445
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,070
Stop it!

446
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm really sick and tired of this. Do you really have time to be jealous right now?

447
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,080
If you have time to do this, go protect your foundation. Stop being so possessive!

448
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,210
Ju Dan Tae, you bastard!

449
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,730
Stop right there!

450
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,250
Get up, let's go.

451
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,890
I told you I'm not going. With the family like this, how could I go to school? It's embarrassing!

452
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,620
Listen to me. It won't be resolved quickly.

453
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,860
I'll be your guardian from now on, so listen to what I say.

454
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,150
Why are you the guardian when I'm right here?

455
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,170
Dad, are you ok? Nothing's wrong, right? Nothing's happening to our family, right?

456
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,700
Are the things on the news true?

457
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,790
I'll take care of that, so you guys don't have to worry about it.

458
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,420
Go to school. You have to be more confident during times like this.

459
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,130
Show them that nobody can touch us.

460
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,500
I don't care about anything else.

461
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,340
I don't care who you're seeing, or if people point fingers at you.

462
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,560
But I can't forgive you if we become poor.

463
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,560
  Cheong Ah Arts School 

464
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,790
This is what they mean by birds of a feather flock together.

465
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,020
How thick-skinned they are.

466
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,780
If I were them, I wouldn't be able to come to school. I'd be too embarrassed to show my face.

467
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,760
Their parents are dirty too.

468
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,500
Wow, I got the willies. You guys came to school?

469
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,850
This is more than cocky, it's scary.

470
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,390
Look at this.

471
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,470
How dare you block my path?

472
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,090
Why? Are you pissed? Hit me if you're pissed.

473
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,040
Hit me, hit me.

474
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,870
Hit me.

475
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,400
Ju Seok Hun cooled his temper a lot.

476
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,300
I saw the news yesterday and it looks like your family is on the verge of going bankrupt.

477
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,120
Your dad is a total con man.

478
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,750
Even a dirty affair.

479
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,880
Then what's going to happen?

480
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,330
Are you and Eun Byeol becoming sisters?

481
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,510
Ju Eun Byeol?

482
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,120
Stop it.

483
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,650
Yeah, you shouldn't do this among friends. It's already distressing as it is.

484
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,810
It must be distressing.

485
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,770
According to the news,  Min Seol Ah's assailants are you and your parents.

486
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,780
Look at Ha Eun Byeol. She's too embarrassed to come to school.

487
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,420
Shut up!

488
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,860
Shut up you pieces of trash!

489
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,490
Trash! Trash!

490
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,510
Trash! Trash!

491
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,490
Trash!

492
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,700
Stop it!

493
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,190
Aren't you guys in the wrong too?

494
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,740
When others were bullied, you ignored, ran away and crawled on your own.

495
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,700
But now you guys bully them when the situation has changed? You guys are identical.

496
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,420
Hey! Are you taking Ju Seok Hun's side because he's your boyfriend?

497
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,890
Bae Ro Na. Ju Seok Hun's era is over now.

498
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,500
Do you want to go out with me starting today? Don't we look good together?

499
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,710
Don't we look good together?

500
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,740
They're fighting!

501
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,400
You bitch!

502
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,400
Stop!

503
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,330
What are you doing in our graceful school?

504
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,250
They started it first by throwing trash!

505
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,830
No, Seok Gyeong grabbed my hair first!

506
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,730
Everybody quiet!

507
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,850
The school is already a mess as it is, how dare you start big fights?

508
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,660
Everybody go back to your classrooms and get ready for class. Now!

509
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,200
Move faster!

510
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,130
Ju Seok Hun, Ju Seok Gyeong, Yu Je Ni, Lee Min Hyeok, stop.

511
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,010
You guys can't leave like this. Aren't you going to clean this trash up?

512
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,420
We didn't do it. They threw it at us, we're victims!

513
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,760
How dare you talk back when a teacher is talking?

514
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,830
You guys all receive 2 demerits.

515
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,720
And clean the bathrooms before you leave school today.

516
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,970
Bae Ro Na. Why are you looking at me like that?

517
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,180
Aren't you in the same line as them?

518
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,440
Come here and pick up the trash.

519
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,450
Now!

520
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,630
Teacher, do you know you're the worst?

521
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,380
Eun Byeol.

522
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,430
I won't go down like this.

523
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,800
I'll make a comeback.

524
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,630
You trust me, right?

525
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,250
Are you listening to me?

526
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,400
My Eun Byeol, hurry and wake up.

527
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,320
And let's eat delicious food together.

528
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,080
I'll make pasta and wait for you.

529
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,870
Search through everything!

530
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,940
Where's the guest who stayed here?

531
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,820
He already checked out.

532
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,840
You guys go to the airport first.

533
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,760
Find and bring him here  no matter what!

534
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,460
You took out everything from the hotel, right?

535
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,410
Ok, you did a good job Secretary Hong. See you in America.

536
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,980
You stay safe too.

537
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,690
It seems like Oh Yun Hui told Ju Dan Tae about our relationship.

538
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,630
It makes sense, she has nowhere else to go.

539
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,160
Did you report Oh Yun Hui?

540
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,120
She promised me to turn herself in by today.

541
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,180
Do you think she'll keep that promise?

542
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,080
She'll never go to the police station on her own.

543
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,500
That is

544
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,450
Oh Yun Hui's choice.

545
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,190
I'm going to keep my words. The promise I made with Seol Ah.

546
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,030
Let's go to America together.

547
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,360
All that's left is for you to be happy.

548
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,810
I promised Seol Ah that I would show her you living happily.

549
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,240
I can't leave.

550
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,900
Ju Dan Tae is chasing after you.

551
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,660
Even until he receives proper punishment from the law,

552
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,390
you have to avoid this place.

553
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,390
What about Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong? I'm those kids' mother.

554
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,300
Do you think those kids want you too?

555
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,240
There are things you can't force.

556
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,730
You must've known the moment you decided to get revenge for Seol Ah,

557
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,270
that you wouldn't be able to go back to that house.

558
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,330
I can't leave my kids with him.

559
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,720
 Korea Air 

560
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,330
The flight is tonight.

561
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,490
I prepared everything. We can't delay it any further.

562
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,840
I also told Hye In her mother was coming.

563
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,950
Thank you. Really.

564
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,490
I'll wait until you come.

565
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,030
I won't leave until you come.

566
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,080
I'm so tired. You said not to worry, but what's this?

567
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,760
What's with a police interrogation?  I could live without the law.

568
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,500
Ma Ri, you are a person who needs the law to live.

569
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,080
Why are you blaming my husband? We bought you hangover soup earlier!

570
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,410
I'm already tired as it is from the interrogation all night.

571
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,410
No.

572
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:01,690
And, I made it so you're only interrogated as a witness, so why are you so mad?

573
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,860
Did you commit a crime without us knowing?

574
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,770
Why were you so scared that you were bent over in front of the police officers?

575
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,220
It's humiliating.

576
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,760
Watch your words. When was I scared?

577
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,660
As a lawyer I really feel dirtied after being interrogated by the police.

578
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,060
Min Hyeok met some bad friends!

579
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,850
Our family is not the type to do such things.

580
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:34,170
So are you saying this is all my Je Ni's fault?

581
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,700
Then is it my Min Hyeok's fault?

582
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,140
How dare you touch me?

583
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:45,520
I can't even act like I don't notice you if you stare at us so obviously. Damn.

584
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,200
Is this your first time seeing a famous person?

585
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,290
We became a trending search, and our face is all over the news.

586
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,860
We've become famous people.

587
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,120
It's more embarrassing if we group together, let's go.

588
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,220
Honey, you did such a good job.

589
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,940
You're here?

590
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,160
Where did her mother go?

591
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,290
She briefly went out to do something.

592
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,150
The child is in this state, what—

593
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,740
They finished the gastric lavage (stomach pumping) and her breathing and heartbeat have returned to normal.

594
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,450
Shut up and go to that great owner of yours.

595
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,400
Eun Byeol, I'm sorry.

596
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,920
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

597
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,550
I'm really sorry, Eun Byeol.

598
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,920
I'm sorry.

599
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,230
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol, are you awake?

600
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,550
It's dad, can you recognize me?

601
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:24,210
Why did you do it? Why did you do something so scary?

602
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,680
Eun Byeol

603
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,850
Eun Byeol?

604
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,390
Of course, Sunbaenim. 
  Alumni List - Seoul National University 

605
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,620
Nothing will cause trouble to Cheong Ah Foundation.

606
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,560
You believe in me, right?

607
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,580
If you protest against the prosecutor's investigations together as the alumni association.

608
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,950
it will really be helpful.

609
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,560
Then I'll contact you again, Sunbaenim.

610
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,940
Is this the time to be doing this? After you made our Eun Byeol that way!

611
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:20,310
Are you saying it's all my fault? What are you so self-righteous about?

612
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,490
Eun Byeol is—

613
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,120
Eun Byeol is not speaking.

614
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,800
What?

615
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,050
Eun Byeol is awake?

616
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,680
She's gained her consciousness, but she isn't saying anything.

617
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,030
It seems like deliberate aphasia.

618
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,470
Aphasia?

619
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,940
She just woke so it must be a temporary state.

620
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,770
There's nothing to worry about.

621
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,830
After dealing with the Foundation situation, I'll just let her  get proper treatment.

622
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,130
I'm busy so leave.

623
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,690
Seo Jin, please get a hold of yourself.

624
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,220
How is the foundation important in this situation?

625
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,620
It's important! If everything is back to its original place,

626
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,220
our Eun Byeol will also return to the way she was.

627
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:31,540
Going to school, eating well, and zealously practicing singing without any problems.

628
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,910
I believe in my daughter.

629
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,160
I'll withdraw Eun Byeol from school, and take her to my hometown.

630
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,980
I don't need the director spot for Cheong Ah Medical Center.

631
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,320
You are so two-faced.

632
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,940
Acting like you're the only righteous one with a conscience.

633
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,660
Don't be so pretentious.

634
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,990
You didn't admit to what you did to Min Seol Ah at the police station.

635
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:06,180
You just don't want a criminal record following you around for the rest of your life.

636
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,500
You're ultimately the same as the people at Hera Palace. No!

637
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,080
You're worse.

638
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,470
You criticize others easily but cover your own mistakes behind your back.

639
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,800
Stop putting up a show for the sake of Eun Byeol.

640
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,410
In the end, I'm the one who will save Eun Byeol and protect her.

641
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,170
Right!

642
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,380
Did you just figure that out now?

643
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,820
I'm that kind of a person.

644
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,760
But I can't give up Eun Byeol.

645
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,660
I can no longer leave Eun Byeol by your side.

646
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:09,220
Sunbaenim, it's Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.

647
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,090
I called because I need some help.

648
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,770
This foundations corruption scandal...

649
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,770
Please help me.

650
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,310
It's me, Oh Yun Hui.

651
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,990
Nothing is the matter, right? I was going to call you because I was worried.

652
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,290
What will you do about Su Ryeon?

653
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,690
I'm so anxious that I feel like I'm going crazy. You don't know what she might do to us right now.

654
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,260
Why are you anxious? I'm Ju Dan Tae.

655
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,930
No matter how hard she tries to bring me down, I'm here perfectly fine.

656
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,700
Sim Su Ryeon definitely cannot win over me.

657
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,760
Don't worry and wait.

658
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,030
Yes?

659
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,950
This is 4502, right? Go pick up your package at the security room.

660
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,870
I'm busy right now so I'll go pick it up later.

661
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,780
Hello?

662
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,270
 Is this Ms. Oh Yun Hui? This is Gangnam Police station. 

663
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,100
Is there a problem?

664
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,850
 You have to come out for a witness statement in regards to J King Holdings. 

665
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,260
Alright.

666
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:26,030
 You have until today to turn yourself in. After that, I can't guarantee anything.    

667
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,240
  You should also experience the sadness of losing your child.    

668
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,770
  Don't you have to go through the same thing for it to be fair?    

669
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:44,960
  You're still not ready? I do not intend to forgive you.    

670
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,100
  Go to the police station immediately!    

671
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,270
-  If you try to hold out until the end, Ro Na will become ruined just like Seol Ah... 

672
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,920
Please don't do this.

673
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,180
If you do  anything to my Ro Na, I won't leave you alone.

674
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,400
Starting the classical vocal without the instruments, now we are studying—

675
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,940
Ro Na! Bae Ro Na!

676
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,060
Mom?

677
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,630
Are you okay? Nothing happened right?

678
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,420
Why are you being this way? Why would I be hurt?

679
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,620
Isn't Ro Na's mom crazy? What is she doing?

680
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,810
Ro Na's mother. What kind of disturbance is this? We are in the middle of class.

681
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:52,910
Ro Na fought with other students. I didn't hit or scold her.

682
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,640
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,870
What is wrong, Mom? You said you were okay earlier.

684
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,900
Why are you coming to my school and making a scene?

685
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,500
I'm embarrassed to death.

686
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:08,820
I'm sorry, I must have lost it for a moment.

687
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,330
I'm so anxious that's why.

688
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:15,250
When school closes, don't go around alone, okay?

689
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:20,500
Don't meet anyone or go to the academy, just come home right away after school.

690
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,570
Mom, are you going somewhere?

691
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,990
Mom.

692
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,900
Is it because of the penthouse ahjumma?

693
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,520
I don't know what happened but can't you apologize first?

694
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,960
She looks so sad lately.

695
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,670
Why are you so nosy? Worry about your mom.

696
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,420
Truthfully, after I quit school, it was so hard

697
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,320
that I thought of something scary for a moment.

698
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,420
A car was coming but I didn't want to avoid it.

699
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,020
  Ro Na, are you okay?    

700
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,930
  The person who saved me then was Ahjumma.    

701
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,150
  She was hugging me so tightly.    

702
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,990
"Ro Na, live. Live no matter what."

703
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,280
It seemed like she was saying that.

704
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,590
So if you did something wrong,

705
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:36,820
apologize to her first, I beg of you.

706
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,600
Mom, Mom

707
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,690
 Seoul Gangnam Police Station 

708
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,750
What am I thinking right now?

709
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,750
Get a hold of yourself, Oh Yun Hui.

710
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:30,200
 You have until 6pm today. I can't wait any longer. 

711
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,270
 Sim Su Ryeon. 

712
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,180
 Jakomo 

713
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,560
 My little sister 

714
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,710
 The Republic of Korea Passport 

715
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,130
 Housekeeper Yang 

716
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,770
Yes, Ms. Yang did something happen?

717
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:37,980
 Ma'am, the Chairman took the kids into the study room again!  What should I do? 

718
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,210
 Hera Palace 

719
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,220
Seok Hun, Seok Gyeong!

720
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,920
 Su Ryeon 

721
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,590
 The person you are calling is not available— 

722
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,420
Unni!

723
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,280
Unni!

724
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,150
Are you okay? Unni!

725
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,780
What did you say? Unni ...

726
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,610
Unni ...

727
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,630
Unni? Unni.

728
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,940
Unni, wake up. Don't die.

729
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:44,630
No, no don't die!

730
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,920
What is going on?

731
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,980
What's going on?

732
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,630
Someone  must've gotten hurt.

733
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,850
You're under arrest on a charge of murder.

734
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:17,970
You have the right to remain silent, and the right to a lawyer.

735
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,650
You also have the right to request a review of the legality of your arrest.

736
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,390
Housekeeper Yang, what happened?

737
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,820
Madam is...

738
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,980
Take her away.

739
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,200
You did this?

740
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,260
To my wife? How could you do something like this!

741
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,660
What are you doing, take her away!

742
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,050
- Mom. 
 - Mom.

743
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,090
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

744
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,390
Mom! Let go!

745
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,060
Mom! Mom!

746
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,290
Mom!

747
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,280
Mom! Let go of me!

748
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,900
Mom!  Let go!

749
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,090
Let go of me!

750
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,560
Mom! Mom!

751
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,630
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

752
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:14,830
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

753
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,460
Let go!

754
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,660
Calm down. Calm down! Calm down.

755
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,590
Calm down.

756
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,200
A murder case in Hera Palace?

757
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,070
How could something like this happen here? Is this a lie?

758
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,440
Is that really Su Ryeon?

759
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,010
Oh my. What's going on?

760
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,420
Isn't that Oh Yun Hui?

761
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,560
No way.

762
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,440
Wait, Oh Yun Hui killed Su Ryeon?

763
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,760
That crazy wench, is she human?

764
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,780
How could this happen?

765
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,750
Search everything!

766
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,600
Look at how she put her face on their family picture. What a stalker.

767
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,710
How creepy.

768
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,110
What's all this?

769
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:26,090
Why are there so many designer bags and clothes?

770
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,860
There's a knife missing in the kitchen. It matches the weapon used in the crime.

771
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,970
Collect it as evidence.

772
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:45,020
Ahjussi-deul... who are you?  (plural of Ahjussi) 

773
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,140
Are you her daughter?

774
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,090
Yes. That's right.

775
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,760
What are you doing in my house?

776
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,790
What about my mom? Where is my mom?

777
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,400
 Secretary Hong: Chairman, I think you should see this. 

778
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,230
 Gangnam's Hera Palace,  a symbol of wealth, has been involved in another unfortunate incident. 

779
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,580
  Mrs. Sim has been murdered in the penthouse. 

780
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,200
  A fellow resident Mrs. Oh, has been arrested at the scene. 
   

781
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,170
  Mrs. Sim, who resided in the penthouse, died at the scene from excessive bleeding. 

782
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,230
Taxi. Taxi!

783
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,800
Taxi!

784
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,860
 Passport - United State of America 

785
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,950
I came back from grocery shopping,

786
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:06,270
and I saw the woman from the 45th floor scanning the card and going into the penthouse.

787
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,520
I thought it was weird,

788
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,610
then I suddenly heard a scream from inside.

789
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,600
I ran inside and madam was...

790
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,450
That woman killed her, I saw it.

791
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,630
I saw her stab madam with a knife.

792
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:28,390
 I was preparing for a divorce with my wife. 

793
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,100
My wife had another man.

794
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,020
She kept demanding a divorce

795
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:39,000
so she could go to America with that man.

796
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,610
But ever since Oh Yun Hui discovered we were getting a divorce,

797
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,880
her obsession started.

798
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,060
She kept calling me.

799
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:57,440
She acted as if she were my wife.

800
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,590
One day she snuck into our bedroom.

801
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,620
It scared me so much.

802
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,160
Are you talking about this?

803
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,110
Yes, that's right.

804
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:16,070
I have many possessions so I have CCTVs even in the bedroom.

805
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:18,620
But this was recorded on there.

806
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:22,230
She was wearing your dead wife's clothes.

807
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:27,340
Has she ever threatened you personally?

808
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,350
She's said this to me before.

809
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,280
I recorded it just in case.

810
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,750
  I waited for you because I have a request. 

811
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:44,770
  Get rid of Sim Su Ryeon. 

812
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,960
Why did you want to kill Sim Su Ryeon?

813
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,950
Was it because you wanted Ju Dan Tae and the penthouse?

814
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,160
Is that what Ju Dan Tae said?

815
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:03,550
That I wanted to have him?

816
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,060
We have evidence as well.

817
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:12,070
We found your fingerprints all over Sim Su Ryeon's murder weapon.

818
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,460
This is the knife you used, right?

819
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:21,330
Answer me, Oh Yun Hui. Did you kill Sim Su Ryeon with this knife?

820
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:25,630
There is a witness too so there's no point in denying it.

821
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,280
Yes.

822
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,240
I killed her.

823
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,710
What? What did you just say?

824
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,930
I killed her.

825
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,820
I hated her

826
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,950
to the point

827
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:00,640
I wanted to kill her.

828
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:20,380


829
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,000
  The Penthouse: War in Life 

830
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,890
  Did Oh Yun Hui kill Su Ryeon? 

831
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,370
  I admit to all the charges. 

832
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,670
  Mom! Mom! 

833
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,100
  Father, are you really ok with this? 

834
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,220
  I'm just trying to put everything back in its place. 

835
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,650
  You must be happy, Chairman Ju and Seo Jin. 

836
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,390
  What are you talking about? Talk to me in a way I can understand! 

837
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,130
  Su Ryeon told me everything before she died. 

838
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:50,050
  It's truly extraordinary. 

839
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,900
  The heavens are also on our side, the wealthy side, in the end.
