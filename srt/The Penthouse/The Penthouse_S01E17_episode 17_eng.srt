2
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,860
It wasn't a dream.

3
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,580
Min Seol Ah... fell here at Hera Palace.

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,170
I-I killed that girl.

5
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,830
- Yun Hui. 
  - Unni.

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,300
You got here early.

7
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,820
 Episode 17 

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,260
Why did you ask to meet here?

9
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,320
I have something to say to you, Yun Hui.

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,420
To be honest...

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,120
I've been using you.

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,860
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,350
The person who sent you to Min Seol Ah's house in Bosong Village,

14
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,320
is me.

15
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,310
And I'm the person who called you to Hera Palace.

16
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,820
I've been using you.

17
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,150
I needed you,

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,140
for my revenge.

19
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,610
I'm... Min Seol Ah's mom.

20
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,940
You're surprised, aren't you?

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,330
I'm sorry for telling you now.

22
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,570
I've been busy up to now trying to find the culprit who killed Seol Ah.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,580
Now, it's time to capture the culprit.

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,120
The culprit?

25
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,030
  Ro Na, what are you doing? It's the weekend, let's go out— 

26
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,830
 What are you doing? Stop! 

27
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,620
 You'll get hurt! 

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,840
 You were right, Mom. 

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,650
 Talent? I don't need any of that. 

30
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,170
 Money and connections are talent. A person like me shouldn't sing. 

31
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,930
 So it's ok if my voice doesn't work now. 

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,150
 Let go! 

33
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,290
 Let go! 

34
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,320
 How did you get here? 

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,440
 My misery started with Cheon Seo Jin. 

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,140
 I don't care, whoever interferes with my daughter's future, I'll destroy all of them. 

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,030
 Yun Hui, you're hurt. I have to treat you. 

38
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,660
 Let go! I can't leave like this! 

39
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,720
 I have to get Ro Na admitted to CAAS. 

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,100
  I can't let Ro Na live like me! 

41
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,880
 - Oh Yun Hui, come here. 
 - Let go! 

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,680
  Oh Yun Hui! 

43
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 Give it to me. Give the your phone! 

44
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,840
  - Why are you here? 
 - Ahjumma?  

45
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,280
  What's wrong with your face? Did something happen to you? 

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,660
  The Hera Palace people are trying to kill me. I'm frightened, Ahjumma. 

47
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,170
  Please help me.  Please save me, Ahjumma. 

48
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,280
  Who's trying to kill you? 

49
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,560
  It's ok, there's no one here right now. Let's get out of here first. 

50
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,540
  Wait. I have to find something first. 

51
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,260
  I hid my phone. 

52
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,660
  You go first, Ahjumma. 

53
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,620
  Where are you trying to run away to? 

54
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,190
  Please let me live, Ahjussi. 

55
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,860
 Hurry up and give it to me! 

56
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,880
 Please let me live! 

57
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,930
  Where is your phone! 

58
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,990
  Ahjumma? 

59
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,570
  Was that you Ahjumma? 

60
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,590
  Did you save me? 

61
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,010
  Thank you. 

62
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,800
  If you disappeared, my Ro Na would be accepted. 

63
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,550
  If you disappeared. 

64
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,960
  Hello? Where are you calling from? 

65
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,350
  Cheong Ah Arts School? Why? 

66
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,470
 W-what? What did you just say? 

67
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,310
 Student Bae Ro Na is accepted and added to the Department of Vocal Music at Cheong-A Arts School, I said. 

68
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,490
  A-Accepted, added to? W-Why... Why? How? 

69
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,290
  One of the accepted students died yesterday. 

70
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,910
Yun Hui are you ok?

71
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,660
I'll tell you everything.

72
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,800
When you witnessed Jo Sang Heon's  death,

73
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,910
truthfully speaking,

74
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,910
I was in that house with you.

75
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,340
Jo Sang Heon?

76
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,830
Then, the person who killed Jo Sang Heon...

77
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,360
Was you?

78
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,060
I basically did.

79
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,240
But I don't feel any guilt in his death.

80
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,630
He asked for hell.

81
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,170
Unni, I don't know what you're talking about.

82
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,110
Under the condition you would keep your mouth shut about Jo Sang Heon,

83
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,190
I had you buy the house in Bosong Village.

84
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,230
 Purchase Unit 501 in Building 3 by tomorrow. 

85
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm the person who had you move into Min Seol Ah's house.

86
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,330
I planned all of this, it's not a coincidence.

87
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,090
Do you not understand what I'm talking about?

88
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,530
Why?

89
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,970
Why?

90
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,170
Why did you do that?

91
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,330
After Seol Ah died, I wasn't living anymore.

92
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,640
Everyday I felt like hell.

93
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,950
I had to do anything I could to find the culprit.

94
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,670
That's why I used your emotions.

95
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,090
I needed you who hated Cheon Seo Jin.

96
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,990
Because Cheon Seo Jin is related to my daughter's death.

97
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,000
- Cheon Seo Jin? 
 - Not just Cheon Seo Jin,

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,660
but also Ju Dan Tae, Lee Gyu Jin, Ha Yeon Cheol, Kang Ma Ri, Go Sang Ah,

99
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,610
and even their kids. They're all accomplices in Seol Ah's death.

100
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,220
They locked my daughter in the mechanical room, moved her corpse,

101
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,410
and even committed arson. They dirtied and humiliated Seol Ah's name.

102
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,650
They have to be punished.

103
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm going to make them pay the price for killing my daughter.

104
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,670
Soon, the police will begin their reinvestigation.

105
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,290
What about proof?

106
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,340
If they still haven't found the culprit, doesn't that mean there's no proof?

107
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,120
I saw it.

108
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,030
What?

109
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,970
The person who pushed my Seol Ah, I saw clearly.

110
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,930
On this balcony on the 47th floor.

111
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,380
Who... is that?

112
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,590
They were wearing a  ruby ring.

113
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,640
A red ruby ring. I'm positive it's the ruby ring that Cheon Seo Jin was wearing during the party.

114
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,660
 Logan Lee 

115
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,740
Wait one moment.

116
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,200
Is something wrong?

117
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,220
I'm ok. I'll call you later.

118
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,290
 She was wearing a ruby ring. A red ruby ring. 

119
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,450
It wasn't a ruby ring but it was an apple necklace.

120
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,530
Did I kill Min Seol Ah?

121
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,070
Did I kill a person?

122
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,170
No, no. I didn't do it. No, that was impossible I did.

123
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,620
I killed Su Ryeon's daughter?

124
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
No. I don't think so.

125
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,060
I didn't do th

126
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,860
No no no!

127
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,780
No no no!

128
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,850
It's time to bring things to an end.

129
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,260
My daughter...

130
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,690
Hello?

131
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,340
Did the conversation go well with Oh Yun Hui?

132
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,420
We couldn't talk long because she was too shocked.

133
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,200
Maybe I should have mentioned things earlier.

134
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,530
How much do you trust Oh Yun Hui?

135
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,750
What do you mean?

136
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,470
Actually, Oh Yun Hui is one of the suspects, too.

137
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,990
That doesn't make sense. She's like a sister to me.

138
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,340
You have to think things objectively.

139
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,510
Oh Yun Hui also...

140
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,510
It is a fact that she was also at Hera Palace the night Seol Ah died.

141
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,800
That is true, but—

142
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,990
Don't trust anyone but yourself, not even me.

143

 4/21 Period 1 Math 

144
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,540
Dad?

145
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,680
Memorize it. You could do that at least, right?

146
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,670
This is something I can do for you. Don't lose to Ha Eun Byeol.

147
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,770
I'll check whether you memorize all the answers.  So see you in the study in the morning.

148
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,110
5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 53135, 53135.

Secretary Jo, submit Hye In's death report form early tomorrow.

151
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,430
Sim Su Ryeon, I don't know what you're up to.

152
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,400
But it isn't time to let you go yet.

  2020 Jakomo Headquarters 

154
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,220
 Ro Na, are you playing the piano again? 

155
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,420
 Why did you push me? 

156
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,180
 I liked you. 

157
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,570
 Oh Yun Hui, was it you? 

158
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,250
 It was you who killed Seol Ah? 

159
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,340
 Unni, I didn't mean to kill her. 

160
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,610
 I really must have not been thinking right at that time! 

161
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,930
 Why did you do that to a poor kid? Did you think it was okay because she was an orphan? 

162
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,050
 Is it okay for an orphan to die unfairly?  

163
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,940
 How could you kill someone just to get your daughter into school? 

164
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,340
 I'm so sorry! I really did wrong! I really must have been crazy! 

165
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,850
 Thinking about Ro Na, I unknowingly —  I was not in my right mind! 

166
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,590
 Please forgive me! I'm begging, please. 

167
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,750
 Forgive? You dare to ask for forgiveness? 

168
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,320
 Your daughter has to die just like my daughter Seol Ah did! Just like my Seol Ah! 

169
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,190
 No!  Not Ro Na! Kill me instead!  Please! 

170
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,570
 Noo! 

171
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,190
 - I'm sorry! I did wrong! 
 - Die! Die! 

172
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,330
H-Hello?

173
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,900
 Is this Oh Yun Hui? This is the police. 

174
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,280
Police?

175
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,170
 A reinvestigation will start again soon. 

176
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,230
What school do you go to?

177
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,500
I told you I don't go to school! I was expelled.

178
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,880
Such a young girl stole something, you're such a scapegrace!

179
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,820
Ro Na! What happened? Are you okay?

180
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,760
Are you the mother of Bae Ro Na?

181
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes. What happened? Why is my daughter here?

182
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,980
She stole beer at a convenience store early in the morning.

183
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,680
It was all caught on video, and she admitted it.

184
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,670
Bae Ro Na.

185
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,820
Did you really steal?

186
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,290
I did! I stole! They wouldn't sell it to me, so what choice did I have?

187
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you crazy, you wench?

188
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,510
What! It doesn't even cost much!

189
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,860
Why did you hit me? Who are you to hit me like this? With what right did you hit me?

190
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,080
Like mother, like daughter, right?  I didn't want to go home but it's good now.

191
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,700
Just put me into a detention center or a jail!

192
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,920
Why are being like this!

193
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm already about to go crazy, why are you being like this as well?

194
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Why are you making me fret over you?

195
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,410
You're doing all sorts of things and now you're even stealing? Stealing?

196
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,160
Why are you hitting me?

197
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,390
- Ma'am, please calm down. 
 - You're crazy!  Crazy!

198
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,820
- What are you going to do?  You want me to die? 
 - Ma'am! Calm down!  Ma'am!

199
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,600
Let go! It hurts!

200
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,050
Why did you bring me here?

201
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,130
It's cold. I want to go.

202
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,670
You have no desire to make amends with me, right?

203
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,120
You don't want to go back to school either, right?

204
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,400
You don't want to live well by pulling yourself together, right?

205
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,410
What have I done in order to send you to Cheong Ah Arts School...

206
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,730
Stop using me as an excuse. I did all that I could too.

207
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,440
Alright, let's just give it all up.

208
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,200
School, singing that you like.

209
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,210
Give up everything, and live the way you want to.

210
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,020
I don't want to live anymore. The moment you give up on your life,

211
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:00,030
my life is over too. I have no reason to live anymore, Ro Na. No reason...

212
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,880
I don't want to live any more either.

213
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,740
So you're going to die here? How could you say that your daughter?

214
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,090
You're going to die just because I stole once?  You don't have any other reasons to die?

215
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,470
What do you want me to do?

216
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,070
I hate you.  When I hate you so much, can't I even do such a thing?

217
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,070
I can't throw a tantrum or gripe to you?

218
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,300
You're my mom.  When I only have you whom I can throw a tantrum to,

219
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,540
can you even not forgive me?

220
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,880
How am I supposed to live by myself without you?

221
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,810
I only have you.

222
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,420
Sorry Ro Na. I'm so sorry.

223
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,650
I don't want to act like this but whenever I see you, I get upset.  What should I do?

224
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,410
Why did you meet Ha Eun Byeol's dad of all people, and have to hear such a word from her?

225
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm so upset that I'm going to go crazy!

226
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,850
Ro Na, I made a mistake.

227
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,920
But something you're thinking of really never happened. Please trust me.

228
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,220
I really only have you.

229
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,930
You're really all that I have.

230
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,890
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for being incompetent.

231
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,510
I'm sorry for making things hard for you.

232
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,740
What's wrong with you?  Even if someone gave me a thousand of Teacher Cheon Seo Jin,

233
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,530
I wouldn't switch my mom.  I'm really happy because I'm your daughter.

234
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,500
My mom is nice.

235
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,390
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

236
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,740
Mom, I'm sorry.

237
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,340
I'll go back to school, and not give up on singing.

238
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,700
I will never ever lose to Ha Eun Byeol.

239
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,180
I'll win the trophy and go to Seoul National University.

240
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,600
I promise I'll be successful and protect you.

241
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,080
 What am I going to, having made you the daughter of a murderer? 

242
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,890
 What am I going to do, Ro Na? 

243
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,600
Don't say anything even if I mess up on my test. I might even get the worst score.

244
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,280
- Should I go with you? 
 - Nope. I can go by myself.

245
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,300
- I'm going to take care of everything on my own. 
 - Hold on.

246
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,730
Good thing I didn't throw away your uniform.

247
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,980
You look the prettiest when you're in your uniform.

248
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,540
I'll be back!

249
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,410
Get yourself together, Oh Yun Hui.

250
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,970
Nobody knows. No one.

251
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,780
You need to be stronger. For Ro Na.

252
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,470
Because I am a mother.

253
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,100
Because I am Ro Na's mother.

254
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,610
You! Are you coming back to school?

255
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,900
Can you do me a favor?

256
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,050
The necklace!

257
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,460
 Unni Su Ryeon 

258
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,560
Why are you surprised? You're headed to work early.

259
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,090
That's ... I have a meeting in the morning.

260
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,160
I got a call from Ro Na, saying she was going to school today.

261
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,220
I heard everything worked out well at the police station as well. That's good to hear.

262
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,750
Yes. I'm busy, so I'll get going first.

263
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,140
Do you have time tonight? I need to ask a few things about the day Seol Ah died.

264
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,450
Today? I need to work until late.

265
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,650
Also, I don't have anything to say because I don't know anything.

266
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,160
I wasn't even living at Hera Palace at that time.

267
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,760
I understand you're confused. I'm really sorry, Yun Hui.

268
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,930
But I must find out the culprit who killed Seol Ah.

269
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,390
I really need your help. I'll help you too.

270
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,740
I'll help with anything you need to get revenge on Cheon Seo Jin.

271
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,810
Revenge?

272
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,870
Be honest. You're trying to achieve everything you want without having to do the dirty work yourself!

273
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,150
You knew I would do anything when it comes to Cheon Seo Jin.

274
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,370
It was all a lie, pretending to care for me and worry about me.

275
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,100
You just behaved hypocritically!

276
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,220
Am I wrong?

277
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,560
It started that way, but I was sincere towards you.

278
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,100
I don't want to hear it! Why me of all people? Why did you have to bring me into this?

279
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,500
Why did you stir me who lived quietly and send me to Bosong Village and get involved in Min Seol Ah's matter?

280
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,900
Because of that, my Ro Na and I have had such a hard time, do you know that?

281
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,100
Why on earth?

282
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,150
Yun Hui, you have a daughter too, so you could understand where I'm coming from.

283
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,980
The suspect is within Hera Palace.

284
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,710
So, what do you want me to do?

285
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,920
I need Yun Hui's testimony.  Please go to the police and give testimony as much as you know.

286
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,250
Me? Why should I?

287
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,500
Do you know what this is?

288
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,240
This contains my Seol Ah's ashes. The ashes of my daughter who died pitifully are in here.

289
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,370
- Stop talking about Min Seol Ah! 
 - Yun Hui.

290
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,730
I'm late, I need to get going.

291
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,570
   

292
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,450
Oh dear, what a sight you are now.

293
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,600
You got divorced and kicked out of your home, yet you still can sleep, can't you?

294
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,400
- What's this about, so early in the morning? 
 - Have you heard the news?

295
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,300
Chariman Ju and Logan Lee signed the Memorandum of Understanding, but do you know what?

296
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,270
In Myeong-dong, they want to build a hotel with casino.

297
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,200
Our money is tied up there, so isn't it good if something is being done?

298
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,730
How could you be so relaxed?!!

299
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,300
Is it because you extinguished some urgent fire with your alimony?

300
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,650
In that property of Myeong-dong, we put our 60 billion won,

301
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,840
but how could he sign the contract without telling us?

302
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,200
This means he's totally ignoring us.

303
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
At this rate, what if there is some jackpot in that land?

304
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,720
We will not be able to get our share!

305
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,980
So what?  What do you want to do?

306
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,530
We should claim our property right too.

307
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:48,170
How could you manage becoming a doctor with that brain?

308
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Right now, aren't you the one who should be pissed off by Chairman Ju the most, Dr. Ha?

309
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Looking at you all packed up, you must have already submitted  your resignation to the hospital,

310
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,200
so shouldn't you think about your future plan even now?

311
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,130
Have you decided which hospital you would go to?  Where, in your hometown?

312
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,500
Why would I go to my hometown, when so many of my patients are here in Cheong Ah Medical Center?

313
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,660
If you don't go, then what?

314
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,130
Have you forgotten the agreement you wrote to Seo Jin during the divorce process?

315
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You received 7 billion won, and promised to leave Cheong Ah Medical Center forever.

316
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
No, I didn't.

317
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm promoted to Director of Cheong Ah Medical Center.

318
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,970
What are you...?

319
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,600
On the day before my father-in-law passed away, he told me to become the director of this hospital.

320
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,700
So I'm going to move my stuff to the Director's office today.

321
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,100
Although I want to refuse it,

322
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,600
since this is his last will, I must comply, right?

323
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,270
Does Seo Jin also know this?

324
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,020
Not yet. She will find it out soon.

325
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,600
Wow, Ju Seok Hun, why are you so late?  I thought you were not coming.

326
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,610
Come in.

327
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
Who are you talking to?

328
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,350
What is this?  You dropped out, but now are you coming back?

329
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,270
Come on, no way. She didn't even take the mid-term exam yesterday.

330
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,500
Where is my seat?

331
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,630
- Move. 
 - Huh? Oh, okay.

332
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,910
Thanks.

333
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,130
By the way, what's this situation?

334
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,000
Is he taking care of her so openly?  Does this look strange to me only?

335
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,770
I'm dating Bae Ro Na.

336
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,700
So going forward, all of you should watch your language.

337
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,170
 We should date, I said.  Can't you understand?  

338
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,950
 I guess it must not be your true feelings.  Then what is this about?  

339
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,620
 You said you liked me.  That's why we should date. 

340
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,230
 I think this would be interesting.  

341
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,870
 As I'm coming back after withdrawing my dropping out, 

342
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,520
 don't you think there should be one event at least? 

343
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,020
Ju Seok Hun, you must be totally out of your mind.

344
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,470
What? You're dating Bae Ro Na?

345
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,240
Even at a glance, it's so obvious she's using you.

346
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,700
Don't you get that she's using you as a shield to come back to school?

347
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,700
- I don't care, whatever it is. 
 - What?

348
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,310
All of you, sit down.  The test will start in 10 minutes.

349
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,560
 The person you called is not answering so you will be redirected to voice mail... 

350
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Ju Dan Tae, what is he really trying to do?

351
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,780
He hasn't said a word of apology yet.

352
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,310
Yes?  What's this about so early in the morning?

353
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,350
Have you heard the news?

354
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,330
There was a hot news in personnel changes at Cheong Ah Foundation.

355
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,920
Is there any personnel change in Cheong Ah I don't know about?

356
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,700
Chairwoman Cheon, there is a problem.

357
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,550
I need to go as I'm busy, Attorney Lee.

358
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,240
Hello?

359
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,970
Ah, our dear Chairman Cheon Myeong Su! How many more moves did he foresee, eh?

360
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,740
- Bae Ro Na came back. 
 - What did you say?

361
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,870
- Her dropout...? 
 - She said she wouldn't.

362
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,740
She even got her parent's letter of confirmation.

363
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,380
Where is Bae Ro Na right now?

364
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,300
 Music Classroom 1 

365
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,920
Teacher!

366
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,940
What a relief to have Ro Na back, you know?

367
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,980
To be honest, wouldn't it be a great waste to lose her talent if she dropped out?

368
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,850
Her grades, ability, and personality, in every aspect.

369
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,700
She's outstanding, unlike someone.

370
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,420
I'll give my vote that in the future she would grow up to be a world-renowned singer.

371
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,370
Since when have you cared about Bae Ro Na so much?

372
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,320
Since those kids from Hera Palace bullied her.

373
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
Is that so?

374
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,240
So starting from now, I'll take proper care of her.

375
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,000
To protect a talent.   Then, keep up the good work, Director—

376
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,870
Ah, no, Soon-to-be Chairwoman Cheon.  In short, shall I call you just 'Soon-to-be'?  Soon-to-be.

377
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,710
Soon-to-be!

378
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,830
Seowon bank rejected our loan application?

379
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,360
But our company has high asset value.

380
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,460
I don't understand this situation either.

381
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,140
If the loan is blocked so suddenly like this, what should we do?

382
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,440
The condition Logan Lee gave for co-CEO system was an equal amount of investment.

383
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,710
I heard there are many other conglomerate groups, not only Five Star Group, contacting Logan Lee now.

384
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,820
If Logan tries to break the contract because of this issue with investment funds—

385
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,660
That won't happen.

386
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,090
- Have you processed what I ordered to be done? 
 - Yes, Chairman.

387
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,730
Is this now the time to use new collateral...?

388
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,220
Team Leader Oh, contact Logan Lee and tell him that we have something to show him immediately.

389
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,320
Despite this difficult economic environment, our sale rate has increased from the previous quarter,

390
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,250
and we also received very excellent score at customer satisfaction evaluation.

391
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,280
Thank you all.

392
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,130
Since the feedback about our products is great,

393
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,510
why don't we use this level of leather for better margin rate?

394
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,310
We are the sound company selling not only products, but also the value.

395
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,880
Only with good quality, can we keep our customers.

396
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,530
 Incoming call: Hye In's caregiver 

397
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,960
Has anything happened to Hye In?

398
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,500
The thing is,

399
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,800
they say Hye In's death is registered, and now her treatment is on hold.  What happened, ma'am?

400
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,530
What are you talking about?  Her death certificate is registered?

401
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,770
Haven't we anticipated this already?

402
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,870
If she's registered as dead, half of Ju Hye In's property will become his.

403
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,280
I can't let him take that land, never!

404
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,830
My father left it for Hye In's share.

405
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,700
How could he covet that land when he tried to kill Hye In?

406
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,950
I just got a call from Ju Dan Tae's side.

407
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,910
They say there is a land property he'd like to show me,

408
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,630
so probably, they meant that land.

409
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,300
How shameless he is!

410
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,720
We can no longer put it off.

411
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,140
Please schedule the meeting with Ju Dan Tae immediately.

412
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,540
Oh, my princess!  How was your test?  Were all the questions your tutor had predicted on the test?

413
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,360
I don't know, I screwed it up totally.  Get me a new tutor.

414
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,860
But... I had a better score than her.

415
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,100
What?

416
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,300
You did better than Eun Byeol...?  Then, you'll be ranked as the top. Eun Byeol, I heard you kept scoring zero.

417
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,090
As Eun Byeol marked all her answers wrong by one question off today, she totally messed up math.  58%.

418
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,350
- She's the sole bottom of our class.  
 - 58%?

419
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,790
Eun Byeol did...?

420
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,660
Eun Byeol...

421
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Because Bae Ro Na made a come back today.

422
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,500
A come back?  So Ro Na came to school today, really?

423
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,030
So, Eun Byeol had a total mental breakdown,

424
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,510
and she changed her OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) card more than 10 times  and marked it incorrectly.

425
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,940
While doing so, she was so crushed at the end and marked it all wrong.

426
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,960
But what's more shocking is that Ro Na and Ju Seok Hun declared to be a couple.

427
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,600
Ro Na and Seok Hun? Why would they...?

428
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,300
What's all this about? Huh?

429
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,110
Why are you so late?

430
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,470
I told you to run over when I called you.

431
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,020
What are you thinking about? Why did you come back?

432
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,140
Did you forget?

433
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,710
Did you forget everything? Should I tell the whole world that your mom is an adulteress?

434
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,230
Did you just laugh?

435
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,390
Do it. Go tell everyone.

436
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,580
What?

437
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:54,040
If you want to tell everyone that your dad had an affair, go tell everyone.

438
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,800
What?

439
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,430
You. You're scared, aren't you?

440
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,610
You're bothered by me returning, aren't you?

441
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,710
That's why you marked your math test answers out of sequence.

442
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,610
I heard you had perfect scores until yesterday. How are you going to live with that mentality?

443
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,380
At this rate...

444
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,440
What if you end up marking the answers out of order on the SAT?

445
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,880
Bae Ro Na! Do you want to die?

446
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,590
I haven't even started.

447
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,020
Look forward to how I'll act in the future.

448
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,800
Ro Na.

449
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,420
Seok Hun, you're here? Do you want to study together at my house?

450
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,840
There's no one at home. We can eat dinner together.

451
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,070
Sounds good.

452
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,880
He came right away because I said I missed him.

453
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,890
Let's go, I'm hungry.

454
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,860
How dare you flirt with Seok Hun! Are you a gold digger like your mom?

455
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,180
Why you— Are you done talking?

456
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,100
Ha Eun Byeol, stop it!

457
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,660
Why are you always on her side?

458
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,460
Why do you like Bae Ro Na when you don't know anything about her?

459
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,200
Do you not know what kind of person Bae Ro Na is?

460
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,090
Her mom is an adulteress.

461
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,290
She's a disgusting home wrecker who ruins families!

462
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,190
My mom isn't an adulteress, don't say that recklessly!

463
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,270
If she flirts with a man who has a family, she's a gold digger and an adulteress.

464
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,470
Nothing changes even if you shield it.

465
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,610
Seok Hun, how could you date a girl like Bae Ro Na, it's degrading!

466
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,270
Isn't it embarrassing?

467
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,850
How are we different?

468
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,350
You and I aren't that great. Do you know?

469
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,440
We may be dirtier.

470
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,760
We may act highly and elegantly on the outside, but on the inside we're rotting trash.

471
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,530
What? How could you compare Bae Ro Na to us?

472
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:58,120
What? Because you're Cheong Ah's next chairperson's daughter and my dad is a CEO?

473
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,670
But do you know what the reality is?

474
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,290
My dad and your mom are seeing each other.

475
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,000
What did you just say?

476
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,780
My dad and your mom are having an affair. That disgusting affair you keep talking about.

477
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,780
Since you know now, let's live quietly.

478
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,870
Before you and I embarrass ourselves more.

479
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,820
No, no!

480
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,620
There's no way!

481
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,950
Follow her.

482
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,860
 Jakomo 

483
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,950
She's shopping at the mall right now.

484
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,400
There's no suspicious behavior yet.

485
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,220
Have someone keep following her. You come in.

486
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,140
Yes, Gu Ho Dong. We threw them off her trail.

487
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,710
Yes.

488
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,680
She knew all along, but kept it hidden.

489
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,670
Since when?

490
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,710
I arranged a meeting with Logan Lee. You can go right now.

491
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,060
Good job. Let's go.

492
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,510
- Are you sick somewhere? 
 - Sorry?

493
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,920
You don't look good.

494
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,660
I heard your daughter dropped out. If you need help with anything, let me know.

495
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:56,340
If Cheon Seo Jin hears those words, she won't be happy.

496
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,420
I'll take care of my business.

497
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,650
Choosing the person I need, and helping that person, is something I decide.

498
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,920
Thank you for your thought.

499
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,000
But my daughter went to school today.

500
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,660
She did? That's good.

501
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,290
I thought about what would be good for a promotion gift,

502
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,230
and I decided on a car fit for a J Kings Holdings Team Leader.

503
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,230
From now on, your safety is the safety of the company.

504
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,170
You're giving me a car?

505
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,740
That's too much for a gift. It's burdensome, so I'll decline.

506
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,660
What happened that day,

507
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,630
thank you for keeping it a secret.

508
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,950
So you want to invest with this site as collateral?

509
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,050
As you can see, with a building like this in Seoul, there won't be a problem getting a loan.

510
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,270
Yes, yes. The location is spot on. I almost want it for myself.

511
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,300
Then as soon as we acquire the investment money, we'll start the process of establishing the corporation as co-owners.

512
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,100
Alright.

513
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,400
I like the way you handle business, Mr. Ju.

514
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,090
Thank you.

515
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,110
It's been a while, Logan.

516
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,520
Oh?

517
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,460
What brings you here?

518
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,900
This is the furniture company I run.

519
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,240
Oh really?

520
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,480
I was just talking some business with Mr. Ju.

521
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,400
He's planning to invest with this site as collateral.

522
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,280
I'll tell you the details as we go in. This way.

523
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,190
I think there's a misunderstanding.

524
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,100
This land belongs to my daughter.

525
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,750
Unfortunately, that daughter passed away not long ago. And the owner of the land has changed.

526
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,790
It does belong to me now.

527
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:07,190
Honey, what are you talking about? Hye In isn't dead.

528
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,850
Excuse me.

529
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,500
What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

530
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:23,040
You're the one who's crazy. I clearly told you to wait.

531
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,170
You registered Hye In's death certificate without asking me?

532
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,270
I waited a long time, she died 6 months ago.

533
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,900
She's not going to come back anyway. What's the reason you postpone reporting her death by paying fines?

534
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,350
It won't become money if we leave it alone.

535
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,980
Either way, half of this land is mine. It should be fine if I use it.

536
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,750
Didn't you refuse to divorce me because you covetted Hye In's land all this time?

537
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,260
Or is it my turn now.

538
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,440
Are you going to kill me and take this land all by yourself?

539
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,290
What are you talking about right now?

540
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,050
You thought I wouldn't know?

541
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,720
You killed Hye In.

542
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:08,350
Just how much do you know?

543
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,630
What did you and Yun Tae Ju plan before he died?

544
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:17,400
Are you curious? About what we planned?

545
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,160
Come in.

546
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,730
  Ha Min Hospital 

547
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,440
Ju Hye In.

548
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,960
Hye In, say hello to your dad.

549
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,790
Dad?

550
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,830
Your child is greeting you. It's been awhile, aren't you happy to see her?

551
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,700
Hye In?

552
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,360
- Hye In? 
 - She's been getting better with rehabilitation treatment.

553
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,970
At the hospital she'd been receiving

554
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:16,070
shots that kept her asleep for too long. So it took her some time to recover.

555
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,700
Now all her organs are returning to normal.

556
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,750
She learned to speak, and now walks a little.

557
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,820
Aren't you happy?

558
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,470
You were so caring of Hye In.

559
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,040
How—

560
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,880
I brought Hye In because she said she has something to say to her dad.

561
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,060
Hye In, tell him yourself.

562
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,910
This land is my grandfather's gift to me.

563
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,490
I won't give it to anyone.

564
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,040
  Sim Su Ryeon. How dare you trick me and hide the kid? 

565
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,990
  Ju Dan Tae. Starting now, I'm going to make you  pay for everything you did. 

566
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,360
What in the world is going on, Mr. Ju?

567
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,640
Were you trying to put up a fake collateral?

568
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,300
By claiming your living daughter is dead?

569
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,170
And this isn't even your property?

570
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm very disappointed in you.

571
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,330
That's not true.

572
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,120
Logan.

573
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:26,040
I want you to know that you can't do anything with this land without Hye In's permission.

574
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,880
I gotta go, she's not feeling well.

575
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,660
You bastard! I can't believe that you missed that.

576
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:17,750
What on earth have you been doing not even keeping an eye on her properly?

577
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,300
How could you not have known that Hye In was alive?

578
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,560
I'm sorry Chairman. I was sure that we were following and watching her the whole time.

579
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,230
Shut up. How could someone that was at the department store show up there?

580
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,120
Then whom were you following yesterday?

581
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,010
Sim Su Ryeon! I can't be patient anymore.

582
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,960
Su Ryeon has another daughter?

583
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,240
Whose kid is she?

584
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,460
Su Ryeon knew where Chairman Ju was.

585
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,050
And brought her daughter there.

586
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,120
No way...  Su Ryeon and Logan Lee?

587
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,850
You're putting in too much strength.

588
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,330
The higher the note is, the lower you should bring your breath.

589
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,520
Let's try again.

590
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,030
 That day, Ro Na's singing 

591
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,950
 was the best I had ever heard. 

592
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,800
 Su Ryeon 

593
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,320
 The person you are calling is not available... 

594
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,450
Logan, wait for me by the exit of the penthouse.

595
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,060
I'll be out with the items I've found.

596
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,230
Let's talk.

597
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,050
I'm busy right now.

598
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,140
No matter how busy you are, this can't happen.

599
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,890
Why did you ignore my calls all day?

600
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,480
You still haven't explained why you were at the villa with Oh Yun Hui.

601
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,250
I told— , I told you.

602
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:12,570
I was just resting there. Oh Yun Hui happened to be there with me after the company dinner.

603
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,150
Oh Yun Hui was wearing my clothes that you had gifted me.

604
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,340
I told you she had to change because her clothes were ruined.

605
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,440
Do I have to explain every little thing?

606
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,250
I heard you signed the contract with Logan Lee. So kick Oh Yun Hui out immediately.

607
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,220
Logan Lee wants her, as do I.

608
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,580
- What? 
 - Be careful there are a lot of eyes here.

609
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,980
Don't change the subject.

610
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,640
I don't know what you're thinking but remember this.

611
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,660
The promise we made when we started over, that I would decide our relationship.

612
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,580
Meeting together and breaking up,

613
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,720
is all decided by me.

614
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,970
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

615
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,780
Open the door, Eun Byeol.

616
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,540
Ha Eun Byeol!

617
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,800
What are you doing here?

618
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,590
Who let him in! I told you not to open the door for him.

619
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,880
Madam, that was—

620
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,290
Don't attack an innocent person.

621
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,520
She was worried about Eun Byeol so she called me.

622
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,790
Eun Byeol has locked herself in her room all day and wouldn't come out.

623
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,650
She's been throwing and breaking things in her room and throwing a fit.

624
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,010
She's acting out because she bombed the exam.

625
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,450
If you intend to use her as an excuse to keep coming in the house,  give up that intention.

626
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,450
Remember that I have the legal custodial rights.

627
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,420
Even if it weren't for Eun Byeol, I had to see you regarding another matter.

628
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,970
Is there still something left for us to talk about?

629
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,170
Oh. You'll have to vacate the hospital soon.

630
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,440
It seems like you still don't know. I've been transferred.

631
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,240
Transferred?

632
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:10,200
To where? It seems like there's still some place that is looking for you.

633
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,910
Yeah. Cheong Ah Medical Center.

634
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,790
Are you kidding right now?

635
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,110
I've started working as the Director of Cheong Ah Medical Center.

636
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:26,000
I thought I should tell you directly myself.

637
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,800
What are you talking about?

638
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:35,150
I've never confirmed that as the Chairwoman so with what ability can you be a director?

639
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,390
Father-in-law's will.

640
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,650
I don't think it needs your approval.

641
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,820
 Content of Will 

642
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:48,040
The day before your father died, he left Cheon Ah Medical Center in my hands.

643
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:55,790
I didn't know back then, but it looks like it became his last favor.

644
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:00,730
I look forward to working with you, Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.

645
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,720
Leech-like human!

646
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,380
How on earth did this happen, Attorney Park?

647
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,290
Why didn't you tell me about Cheong Ah Medical Center's director's matter?

648
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,850
Come to my office right now. This instant!

649
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,690
Who would send this to me?

650
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,830
2232 2232

651
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,440
2232

652
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,930
2232 2232 2232 2232

653

 4/22, 1st class, General Science 

654
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,880
What are you doing?

655
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,440
Is this how you got a 100%?

656
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,430
Pretend like you didn't see anything. Dad got it for me.

657
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,870
How long are you going to keep living like this?

658
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,220
Dad gave me permission!

659
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,430
So it's not something you can have a say about.

660
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,200
Up until this point, you're the one who has been helping me manipulate my grades.

661
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,900
Why do you suddenly have a conscience that you didn't have before?

662
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,140
What's wrong with your arm?

663
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,020
Let go!

664
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,570
Did dad do this?

665
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,950
Tell me. Did he do it?

666
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,050
If I received something, I should pay the price.

667
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,830
2235 2235

668
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:31,640
This isn't paying a price. It's violence and abuse.

669
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,070
What's wrong with you acting like someone who doesn't know anything?

670
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:40,120
Mind your own business! I'll figure out how to live from now on.

671
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,980
You already abandoned me.

672
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,030
At this rate, we're going to die in Dad's hands.

673
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:53,700
It doesn't matter if I die, as long as I beat Eun Byeol.

674
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,150
2232

675
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,830
2232

676
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,770
Sim Su Ryeon!

677
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,870
Where is Sim Su Ryeon?

678
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:14,030
Where is she?

679
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,290
Where is Ju Hye In? Where did you hide her!

680
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,980
Some place you'll never find her.

681
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,110
Some place where you'll never be able to kill her again.

682
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,860
Tell me! Where did you take that wench!

683
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,860
You dare treat me like an idiot?

684
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,390
You're not even human.

685
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:16,690
Trash. Murderer!

686
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,090
None of that is important.

687
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,010
Since we've gotten to know about each other much more,

688
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,600
we can be a more harmonious couple now.

689
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,690
Crazy bastard.

690
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,520
All this time you've acted too gracefully,

691
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,390
elegantly, and high end.

692
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:43,150
A woman like you needs to be punished.

693
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:49,120
A punishment for deceiving her husband and thinking about other things.

694
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:58,320
After you receive your punishment, everything will go back to how it was.

697
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,460
 I'm on my way to America. I'm going to make you happy. 

698
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,780
 There's no need to feel guilty. 

699
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,320
 Now it feels like I've met a partner just for me. 

700
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,050
 - Use me. 
 - Don't trust men too much. 

701
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,660
 I'm not in the mood to coax your hot headed temper right now. 

702
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,540
 It's beautiful. 

703
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,130
 A bloody wind will blow. Someone might die. 

704
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,030
 They'll know once they go through the same thing. 

705
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,300
 What they did wrong. 

706
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,299
♫  The look they try to take something out of me  ♫
