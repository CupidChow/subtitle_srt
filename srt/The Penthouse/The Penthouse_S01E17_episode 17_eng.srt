2
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,860
It wasn't a dream.

3
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,580
Min Seol Ah... fell here at Hera Palace.

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,170
I-I killed that girl.

5
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,830
- Yun Hui. 
  - Unni.

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,300
You got here early.

7
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,820
 Episode 17 

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,260
Why did you ask to meet here?

9
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,320
I have something to say to you, Yun Hui.

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,420
To be honest...

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,120
I've been using you.

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,860
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,350
The person who sent you to Min Seol Ah's house in Bosong Village,

14
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,320
is me.

15
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,310
And I'm the person who called you to Hera Palace.

16
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,820
I've been using you.

17
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,150
I needed you,

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,140
for my revenge.

19
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,610
I'm... Min Seol Ah's mom.

20
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,940
You're surprised, aren't you?

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,330
I'm sorry for telling you now.

22
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,570
I've been busy up to now trying to find the culprit who killed Seol Ah.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,580
Now, it's time to capture the culprit.

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,120
The culprit?

25
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,030
  Ro Na, what are you doing? It's the weekend, let's go outâ€” 

26
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,830
 What are you doing? Stop! 

27
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,620
 You'll get hurt! 

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,840
 You were right, Mom. 

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,650
 Talent? I don't need any of that. 

30
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,170
 Money and connections are talent. A person like me shouldn't sing. 

31
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,930
 So it's ok if my voice doesn't work now. 

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,150
 Let go! 

33
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,290
 Let go! 

34
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,320
 How did you get here? 

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,440
 My misery started with Cheon Seo Jin. 

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,140
 I don't care, whoever interferes with my daughter's future, I'll destroy all of them. 

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,030
 Yun Hui, you're hurt. I have to treat you. 

38
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,660
 Let go! I can't leave like this! 

39
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,720
 I have to get Ro Na admitted to CAAS. 

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,100
  I can't let Ro Na live like me! 

41
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,880
 - Oh Yun Hui, come here. 
 - Let go! 

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,680
  Oh Yun Hui! 

43
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 Give it to me. Give the your phone! 

44
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,840
  - Why are you here? 
 - Ahjumma?  

45
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,280
  What's wrong with your face? Did something happen to you? 

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,660
  The Hera Palace people are trying to kill me. I'm frightened, Ahjumma. 

47
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,170
  Please help me.  Please save me, Ahjumma. 

48
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,280
  Who's trying to kill you? 

49
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,560
  It's ok, there's no one here right now. Let's get out of here first. 

50
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,540
  Wait. I have to find something first. 

51
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,260
  I hid my phone. 

52
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,660
  You go first, Ahjumma. 

53
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,620
  Where are you trying to run away to? 

54
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,190
  Please let me live, Ahjussi. 

55
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,860
 Hurry up and give it to me! 

56
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,880
 Please let me live! 

57
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,930
  Where is your phone! 

58
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,990
  Ahjumma? 

59
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,570
  Was that you Ahjumma? 

60
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,590
  Did you save me? 

61
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,010
  Thank you. 

62
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,800
  If you disappeared, my Ro Na would be accepted. 

63
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,550
  If you disappeared. 

64
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,960
  Hello? Where are you calling from? 

65
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,350
  Cheong Ah Arts School? Why? 

66
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,470
 W-what? What did you just say? 

67
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,310
 Student Bae Ro Na is accepted and added to the Department of Vocal Music at Cheong-A Arts School, I said. 

68
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,490
  A-Accepted, added to? W-Why... Why? How? 

69
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,290
  One of the accepted students died yesterday. 

70
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,910
Yun Hui are you ok?

71
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,660
I'll tell you everything.

72
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,800
When you witnessed Jo Sang Heon's  death,

73
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,910
truthfully speaking,

74
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,910
I was in that house with you.

75
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,340
Jo Sang Heon?

76
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,830
Then, the person who killed Jo Sang Heon...

77
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,360
Was you?

78
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,060
I basically did.

79
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,240
But I don't feel any guilt in his death.

80
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,630
He asked for hell.

81
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,170
Unni, I don't know what you're talking about.

82
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,110
Under the condition you would keep your mouth shut about Jo Sang Heon,

83
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,190
I had you buy the house in Bosong Village.

84
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,230
 Purchase Unit 501 in Building 3 by tomorrow. 

85
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm the person who had you move into Min Seol Ah's house.

86
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,330
I planned all of this, it's not a coincidence.

87
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,090
Do you not understand what I'm talking about?

88
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,530
Why?

89
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,970
Why?

90
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,170
Why did you do that?

91
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,330
After Seol Ah died, I wasn't living anymore.

92
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,640
Everyday I felt like hell.

93
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,950
I had to do anything I could to find the culprit.

94
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,670
That's why I used your emotions.

95
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,090
I needed you who hated Cheon Seo Jin.

96
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,990
Because Cheon Seo Jin is related to my daughter's death.

97
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,000
- Cheon Seo Jin? 
 - Not just Cheon Seo Jin,

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,660
but also Ju Dan Tae, Lee Gyu Jin, Ha Yeon Cheol, Kang Ma Ri, Go Sang Ah,

99
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,610
and even their kids. They're all accomplices in Seol Ah's death.

100
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,220
They locked my daughter in the mechanical room, moved her corpse,

101
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,410
and even committed arson. They dirtied and humiliated Seol Ah's name.

102
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,650
They have to be punished.

103
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm going to make them pay the price for killing my daughter.

104
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,670
Soon, the police will begin their reinvestigation.

105
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,290
What about proof?

106
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,340
If they still haven't found the culprit, doesn't that mean there's no proof?

107
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,120
I saw it.

108
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,030
What?

109
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,970
The person who pushed my Seol Ah, I saw clearly.

110
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,930
On this balcony on the 47th floor.

111
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,380
Who... is that?

112
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,590
They were wearing a  ruby ring.

113
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,640
A red ruby ring. I'm positive it's the ruby ring that Cheon Seo Jin was wearing during the party.

114
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,660
 Logan Lee 

115
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,740
Wait one moment.

116
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,200
Is something wrong?

117
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,220
I'm ok. I'll call you later.

118
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,290
 She was wearing a ruby ring. A red ruby ring. 

119
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,450
It wasn't a ruby ring but it was an apple necklace.

120
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,530
Did I kill Min Seol Ah?

121
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,070
Did I kill a person?

122
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,170
No, no. I didn't do it. No, that was impossible I did.

123
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,620
I killed Su Ryeon's daughter?

124
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
No. I don't think so.

125
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,060
I didn't do th

126
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,860
No no no!

127
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,780
No no no!

128
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,850
It's time to bring things to an end.

129
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,260
My daughter...

130
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,690
Hello?

131
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,340
Did the conversation go well with Oh Yun Hui?

132
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,420
We couldn't talk long because she was too shocked.

133
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,200
Maybe I should have mentioned things earlier.

134
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,530
How much do you trust Oh Yun Hui?

135
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,750
What do you mean?

136
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,470
Actually, Oh Yun Hui is one of the suspects, too.

137
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,990
That doesn't make sense. She's like a sister to me.

138
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,340
You have to think things objectively.

139
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,510
Oh Yun Hui also...

140
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,510
It is a fact that she was also at Hera Palace the night Seol Ah died.

141
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,800
That is true, butâ€”

142
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,990
Don't trust anyone but yourself, not even me.

 4/21 Period 1 Math

Dad?

145
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,680
Memorize it. You could do that at least, right?

146
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,670
This is something I can do for you. Don't lose to Ha Eun Byeol.

147
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,770
I'll check whether you memorize all the answers.  So see you in the study in the morning.

148

Secretary Jo, submit Hye In's death report form early tomorrow.

151
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,430
Sim Su Ryeon, I don't know what you're up to.

152
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,400
But it isn't time to let you go yet.

  2020 Jakomo Headquarters 

154
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,220
 Ro Na, are you playing the piano again? 

155
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,420
 Why did you push me? 

156
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,180
 I liked you. 

157
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,570
 Oh Yun Hui, was it you? 

158
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,250
 It was you who killed Seol Ah? 

159
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,340
 Unni, I didn't mean to kill her. 

160
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,610
 I really must have not been thinking right at that time! 

161
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,930
 Why did you do that to a poor kid? Did you think it was okay because she was an orphan? 

162
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,050
 Is it okay for an orphan to die unfairly?  

163
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,940
 How could you kill someone just to get your daughter into school? 

164
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,340
 I'm so sorry! I really did wrong! I really must have been crazy! 

165
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,850
 Thinking about Ro Na, I unknowingly â€”  I was not in my right mind! 

166
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,590
 Please forgive me! I'm begging, please. 

167
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,750
 Forgive? You dare to ask for forgiveness? 

168
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,320
 Your daughter has to die just like my daughter Seol Ah did! Just like my Seol Ah! 

169
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,190
 No!  Not Ro Na! Kill me instead!  Please! 

170
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,570
 Noo! 

171
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,190
 - I'm sorry! I did wrong! 
 - Die! Die! 

172
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,330
H-Hello?

173
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,900
 Is this Oh Yun Hui? This is the police. 

174
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,280
Police?

175
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,170
 A reinvestigation will start again soon. 

176
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,230
What school do you go to?

177
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,500
I told you I don't go to school! I was expelled.

178
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,880
Such a young girl stole something, you're such a scapegrace!

179
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,820
Ro Na! What happened? Are you okay?

180
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,760
Are you the mother of Bae Ro Na?

181
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes. What happened? Why is my daughter here?

182
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,980
She stole beer at a convenience store early in the morning.

183
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,680
It was all caught on video, and she admitted it.

184
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,670
Bae Ro Na.

185
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,820
Did you really steal?

186
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,290
I did! I stole! They wouldn't sell it to me, so what choice did I have?

187
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you crazy, you wench?

188
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,510
What! It doesn't even cost much!

189
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,860
Why did you hit me? Who are you to hit me like this? With what right did you hit me?

190
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,080
Like mother, like daughter, right?  I didn't want to go home but it's good now.

191
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,700
Just put me into a detention center or a jail!

192
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,920
Why are being like this!

193
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm already about to go crazy, why are you being like this as well?

194
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Why are you making me fret over you?

195
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,410
You're doing all sorts of things and now you're even stealing? Stealing?

196
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,160
Why are you hitting me?

197
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,390
- Ma'am, please calm down. 
 - You're crazy!  Crazy!

198
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,820
- What are you going to do?  You want me to die? 
 - Ma'am! Calm down!  Ma'am!

199
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,600
Let go! It hurts!

200
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,050
Why did you bring me here?

201
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,130
It's cold. I want to go.

202
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,670
You have no desire to make amends with me, right?

203
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,120
You don't want to go back to school either, right?

204
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,400
You don't want to live well by pulling yourself together, right?

205
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,410
What have I done in order to send you to Cheong Ah Arts School...

206
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,730
Stop using me as an excuse. I did all that I could too.

207
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,440
Alright, let's just give it all up.

208
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,200
School, singing that you like.

209
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,210
Give up everything, and live the way you want to.

210
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,020
I don't want to live anymore. The moment you give up on your life,

211
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:00,030
my life is over too. I have no reason to live anymore, Ro Na. No reason...

212
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,880
I don't want to live any more either.

213
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,740
So you're going to die here? How could you say that your daughter?

214
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,090
You're going to die just because I stole once?  You don't have any other reasons to die?

215
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,470
What do you want me to do?

216
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,070
I hate you.  When I hate you so much, can't I even do such a thing?

217
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,070
I can't throw a tantrum or gripe to you?

218
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,300
You're my mom.  When I only have you whom I can throw a tantrum to,

219
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,540
can you even not forgive me?

220
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,880
How am I supposed to live by myself without you?

221
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,810
I only have you.

222
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,420
Sorry Ro Na. I'm so sorry.

223
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,650
I don't want to act like this but whenever I see you, I get upset.  What should I do?

224
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,410
Why did you meet Ha Eun Byeol's dad of all people, and have to hear such a word from her?

225
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm so upset that I'm going to go crazy!

226
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,850
Ro Na, I made a mistake.

227
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,920
But something you're thinking of really never happened. Please trust me.

228
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,220
I really only have you.

229
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,930
You're really all that I have.

230
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,890
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for being incompetent.

231
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,510
I'm sorry for making things hard for you.

232
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,740
What's wrong with you?  Even if someone gave me a thousand of Teacher Cheon Seo Jin,

233
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,530
I wouldn't switch my mom.  I'm really happy because I'm your daughter.

234
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,500
My mom is nice.

235
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,390
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

236
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,740
Mom, I'm sorry.

237
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,340
I'll go back to school, and not give up on singing.

238
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,700
I will never ever lose to Ha Eun Byeol.

239
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,180
I'll win the trophy and go to Seoul National University.

240
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,600
I promise I'll be successful and protect you.

241
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,080
 What am I going to, having made you the daughter of a murderer? 

242
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,890
 What am I going to do, Ro Na? 

243
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,600
Don't say anything even if I mess up on my test. I might even get the worst score.

244
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,280
- Should I go with you? 
 - Nope. I can go by myself.

245
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,300
- I'm going to take care of everything on my own. 
 - Hold on.

246
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,730
Good thing I didn't throw away your uniform.

247
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,980
You look the prettiest when you're in your uniform.

248
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,540
I'll be back!

249
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,410
Get yourself together, Oh Yun Hui.

250
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,970
Nobody knows. No one.

251
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,780
You need to be stronger. For Ro Na.

252
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,470
Because I am a mother.

253
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,100
Because I am Ro Na's mother.

254
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,610
You! Are you coming back to school?

255
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,900
Can you do me a favor?

256
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,050
The necklace!

257
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,460
 Unni Su Ryeon 

258
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,560
Why are you surprised? You're headed to work early.

259
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,090
That's ... I have a meeting in the morning.

260
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,160
I got a call from Ro Na, saying she was going to school today.

261
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,220
I heard everything worked out well at the police station as well. That's good to hear.

262
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,750
Yes. I'm busy, so I'll get going first.

263
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,140
Do you have time tonight? I need to ask a few things about the day Seol Ah died.

264
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,450
Today? I need to work until late.

265
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,650
Also, I don't have anything to say because I don't know anything.

266
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,160
I wasn't even living at Hera Palace at that time.

267
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,760
I understand you're confused. I'm really sorry, Yun Hui.

268
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,930
But I must find out the culprit who killed Seol Ah.

269
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,390
I really need your help. I'll help you too.

270
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,740
I'll help with anything you need to get revenge on Cheon Seo Jin.

271
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,810
Revenge?

272
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,870
Be honest. You're trying to achieve everything you want without having to do the dirty work yourself!

273
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,150
You knew I would do anything when it comes to Cheon Seo Jin.

274
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,370
It was all a lie, pretending to care for me and worry about me.

275
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,100
You just behaved hypocritically!

276
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,220
Am I wrong?

277
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,560
It started that way, but I was sincere towards you.

278
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,100
I don't want to hear it! Why me of all people? Why did you have to bring me into this?

279
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,500
Why did you stir me who lived quietly and send me to Bosong Village and get involved in Min Seol Ah's matter?

280
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,900
Because of that, my Ro Na and I have had such a hard time, do you know that?

281
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,100
Why on earth?

282
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,150
Yun Hui, you have a daughter too, so you could understand where I'm coming from.

283
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,980
The suspect is within Hera Palace.

284
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,710
So, what do you want me to do?

285
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,920
I need Yun Hui's testimony.  Please go to the police and give testimony as much as you know.

286
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,250
Me? Why should I?

287
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,500
Do you know what this is?

288
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,240
This contains my Seol Ah's ashes. The ashes of my daughter who died pitifully are in here.

289
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,370
- Stop talking about Min Seol Ah! 
 - Yun Hui.

290
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,730
I'm late, I need to get going.

291
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,570
   

292
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,450
Oh dear, what a sight you are now.

293
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,600
You got divorced and kicked out of your home, yet you still can sleep, can't you?

294
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,400
- What's this about, so early in the morning? 
 - Have you heard the news?

295
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,300
Chariman Ju and Logan Lee signed the Memorandum of Understanding, but do you know what?

296
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,270
In Myeong-dong, they want to build a hotel with casino.

297
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,200
Our money is tied up there, so isn't it good if something is being done?

298
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,730
How could you be so relaxed?!!

299
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,300
Is it because you extinguished some urgent fire with your alimony?

300
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,650
In that property of Myeong-dong, we put our 60 billion won,

301
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,840
but how could he sign the contract without telling us?

302
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,200
This means he's totally ignoring us.

303
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
At this rate, what if there is some jackpot in that land?

304
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,720
We will not be able to get our share!

305
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,980
So what?  What do you want to do?

306
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,530
We should claim our property right too.

307
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:48,170
How could you manage becoming a doctor with that brain?

308
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Right now, aren't you the one who should be pissed off by Chairman Ju the most, Dr. Ha?

309
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Looking at you all packed up, you must have already submitted  your resignation to the hospital,

310
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,200
so shouldn't you think about your future plan even now?

311
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,130
Have you decided which hospital you would go to?  Where, in your hometown?

312
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,500
Why would I go to my hometown, when so many of my patients are here in Cheong Ah Medical Center?

313
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,660
If you don't go, then what?

314
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,130
Have you forgotten the agreement you wrote to Seo Jin during the divorce process?

315
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You received 7 billion won, and promised to leave Cheong Ah Medical Center forever.

316
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
No, I didn't.

317
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm promoted to Director of Cheong Ah Medical Center.

318
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,970
What are you...?

319
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,600
On the day before my father-in-law passed away, he told me to become the director of this hospital.

320
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,700
So I'm going to move my stuff to the Director's office today.

321
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,100
Although I want to refuse it,

322
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,600
since this is his last will, I must comply, right?

323
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,270
Does Seo Jin also know this?

324
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,020
Not yet. She will find it out soon.

325
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,600
Wow, Ju Seok Hun, why are you so late?  I thought you were not coming.

326
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,610
Come in.

327
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
Who are you talking to?

328
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,350
What is this?  You dropped out, but now are you coming back?

329
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,270
Come on, no way. She didn't even take the mid-term exam yesterday.

330
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,500
Where is my seat?

331
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,630
- Move. 
 - Huh? Oh, okay.

332
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,910
Thanks.

333
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,130
By the way, what's this situation?

334
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,000
Is he taking care of her so openly?  Does this look strange to me only?

335
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,770
I'm dating Bae Ro Na.

336
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,700
So going forward, all of you should watch your language.

337
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,170
 We should date, I said.  Can't you understand?  

338
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,950
 I guess it must not be your true feelings.  Then what is this about?  

339
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,620
 You said you liked me.  That's why we should date. 

340
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,230
 I think this would be interesting.  

341
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,870
 As I'm coming back after withdrawing my dropping out, 

342
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,520
 don't you think there should be one event at least? 

343
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,020
Ju Seok Hun, you must be totally out of your mind.

344
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,470
What? You're dating Bae Ro Na?

345
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,240
Even at a glance, it's so obvious she's using you.

346
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,700
Don't you get that she's using you as a shield to come back to school?

347
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,700
- I don't care, whatever it is. 
 - What?

348
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,310
All of you, sit down.  The test will start in 10 minutes.

349
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,560
 The person you called is not answering so you will be redirected to voice mail... 

350
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Ju Dan Tae, what is he really trying to do?

351
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,780
He hasn't said a word of apology yet.

352
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,310
Yes?  What's this about so early in the morning?

353
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,350
Have you heard the news?

354
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,330
There was a hot news in personnel changes at Cheong Ah Foundation.

355
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,920
Is there any personnel change in Cheong Ah I don't know about?

356
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,700
Chairwoman Cheon, there is a problem.

357
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,550
I need to go as I'm busy, Attorney Lee.

358
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,240
Hello?

359
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,970
Ah, our dear Chairman Cheon Myeong Su! How many more moves did he foresee, eh?

360
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,740
- Bae Ro Na came back. 
 - What did you say?

361
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,870
- Her dropout...? 
 - She said she wouldn't.

362
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,740
She even got her parent's letter of confirmation.

363
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,380
Where is Bae Ro Na right now?

364
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,300
 Music Classroom 1 

365
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,920
Teacher!

366
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,940
What a relief to have Ro Na back, you know?

367
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,980
To be honest, wouldn't it be a great waste to lose her talent if she dropped out?

368
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,850
Her grades, ability, and personality, in every aspect.

369
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,700
She's outstanding, unlike someone.

370
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,420
I'll give my vote that in the future she would grow up to be a world-renowned singer.

371
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,370
Since when have you cared about Bae Ro Na so much?

372
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,320
Since those kids from Hera Palace bullied her.

373
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
Is that so?

374
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,240
So starting from now, I'll take proper care of her.

375
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,000
To protect a talent.   Then, keep up the good work, Directorâ€”

376
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,870
Ah, no, Soon-to-be Chairwoman Cheon.  In short, shall I call you just 'Soon-to-be'?  Soon-to-be.

377
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,710
Soon-to-be!

378
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,830
Seowon bank rejected our loan application?

379
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,360
But our company has high asset value.

380
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,460
I don't understand this situation either.

381
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,140
If the loan is blocked so suddenly like this, what should we do?

382
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,440
The condition Logan Lee gave for co-CEO system was an equal amount of investment.

383
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,710
I heard there are many other conglomerate groups, not only Five Star Group, contacting Logan Lee now.

384
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,820
If Logan tries to break the contract because of this issue with investment fundsâ€”

385
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,660
That won't happen.

386
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,090
- Have you processed what I ordered to be done? 
 - Yes, Chairman.

387
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,730
Is this now the time to use new collateral...?

388
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,220
Team Leader Oh, contact Logan Lee and tell him that we have something to show him immediately.

389
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,320
Despite this difficult economic environment, our sale rate has increased from the previous quarter,

390
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,250
and we also received very excellent score at customer satisfaction evaluation.

391
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,280
Thank you all.

392
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,130
Since the feedback about our products is great,

393
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,510
why don't we use this level of leather for better margin rate?

394
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,310
We are the sound company selling not only products, but also the value.

395
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,880
Only with good quality, can we keep our customers.

396
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,530
 Incoming call: Hye In's caregiver 

397
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,960
Has anything happened to Hye In?

398
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,500
The thing is,

399
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,800
they say Hye In's death is registered, and now her treatment is on hold.  What happened, ma'am?

400
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,530
What are you talking about?  Her death certificate is registered?

401
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,770
Haven't we anticipated this already?

402
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,870
If she's registered as dead, half of Ju Hye In's property will become his.

403
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,280
I can't let him take that land, never!

404
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,830
My father left it for Hye In's share.

405
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,700
How could he covet that land when he tried to kill Hye In?

406
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,950
I just got a call from Ju Dan Tae's side.

407
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,910
They say there is a land property he'd like to show me,

408
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,630
so probably, they meant that land.

409
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,300
How shameless he is!

410
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,720
We can no longer put it off.

411
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,140
Please schedule the meeting with Ju Dan Tae immediately.

412
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,540
Oh, my princess!  How was your test?  Were all the questions your tutor had predicted on the test?

413
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,360
I don't know, I screwed it up totally.  Get me a new tutor.

414
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,860
But... I had a better score than her.

415
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,100
What?

416
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,300
You did better than Eun Byeol...?  Then, you'll be ranked as the top. Eun Byeol, I heard you kept scoring zero.

417
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,090
As Eun Byeol marked all her answers wrong by one question off today, she totally messed up math.  58%.

418
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,350
- She's the sole bottom of our class.  
 - 58%?

419
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,790
Eun Byeol did...?

420
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,660
Eun Byeol...

421
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Because Bae Ro Na made a come back today.

422
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,500
A come back?  So Ro Na came to school today, really?

423
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,030
So, Eun Byeol had a total mental breakdown,

424
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,510
and she changed her OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) card more than 10 times  and marked it incorrectly.

425
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,940
While doing so, she was so crushed at the end and marked it all wrong.

426
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,960
But what's more shocking is that Ro Na and Ju Seok Hun declared to be a couple.

427
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,600
Ro Na and Seok Hun? Why would they...?

428
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,300
What's all this about? Huh?

429
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,110
Why are you so late?

430
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,470
I told you to run over when I called you.

431
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,020
What are you thinking about? Why did you come back?

432
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,140
Did you forget?

433
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,710
Did you forget everything? Should I tell the whole world that your mom is an adulteress?

434
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,230
Did you just laugh?

435
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,390
Do it. Go tell everyone.

436
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,580
What?

437
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:54,040
If you want to tell everyone that your dad had an affair, go tell everyone.

438
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,800
What?

439
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,430
You. You're scared, aren't you?

440
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,610
You're bothered by me returning, aren't you?

441
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,710
That's why you marked your math test answers out of sequence.

442
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,610
I heard you had perfect scores until yesterday. How are you going to live with that mentality?

443
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,380
At this rate...

444
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,440
What if you end up marking the answers out of order on the SAT?

445
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,880
Bae Ro Na! Do you want to die?

446
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,590
I haven't even started.

447
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,020
Look forward to how I'll act in the future.

448
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,800
Ro Na.

449
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,420
Seok Hun, you're here? Do you want to study together at my house?

450
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,840
There's no one at home. We can eat dinner together.

451
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,070
Sounds good.

452
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,880
He came right away because I said I missed him.

453
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,890
Let's go, I'm hungry.

454
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,860
How dare you flirt with Seok Hun! Are you a gold digger like your mom?

455
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,180
Why youâ€” Are you done talking?

456
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,100
Ha Eun Byeol, stop it!

457
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,660
Why are you always on her side?

458
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,460
Why do you like Bae Ro Na when you don't know anything about her?

459
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,200
Do you not know what kind of person Bae Ro Na is?

460
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,090
Her mom is an adulteress.

461
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,290
She's a disgusting home wrecker who ruins families!

462
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,190
My mom isn't an adulteress, don't say that recklessly!

463
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,270
If she flirts with a man who has a family, she's a gold digger and an adulteress.

464
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,470
Nothing changes even if you shield it.

465
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,610
Seok Hun, how could you date a girl like Bae Ro Na, it's degrading!

466
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,270
Isn't it embarrassing?

467
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,850
How are we different?

468
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,350
You and I aren't that great. Do you know?

469
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,440
We may be dirtier.

470
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,760
We may act highly and elegantly on the outside, but on the inside we're rotting trash.

471
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,530
What? How could you compare Bae Ro Na to us?

472
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:58,120
What? Because you're Cheong Ah's next chairperson's daughter and my dad is a CEO?

473
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,670
But do you know what the reality is?

474
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,290
My dad and your mom are seeing each other.

475
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,000
What did you just say?

476
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,780
My dad and your mom are having an affair. That disgusting affair you keep talking about.

477
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,780
Since you know now, let's live quietly.

478
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,870
Before you and I embarrass ourselves more.

479
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,820
No, no!

480
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,620
There's no way!

481
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,950
Follow her.

482
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,860
 Jakomo 

483
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,950
She's shopping at the mall right now.

484
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,400
There's no suspicious behavior yet.

485
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,220
Have someone keep following her. You come in.

486
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,140
Yes, Gu Ho Dong. We threw them off her trail.

487
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,710
Yes.

488
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,680
She knew all along, but kept it hidden.

489
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,670
Since when?

490
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,710
I arranged a meeting with Logan Lee. You can go right now.

491
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,060
Good job. Let's go.

492
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,510
- Are you sick somewhere? 
 - Sorry?

493
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,920
You don't look good.

494
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,660
I heard your daughter dropped out. If you need help with anything, let me know.

495
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:56,340
If Cheon Seo Jin hears those words, she won't be happy.

496
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,420
I'll take care of my business.

497
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,650
Choosing the person I need, and helping that person, is something I decide.

498
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,920
Thank you for your thought.

499
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,000
But my daughter went to school today.

500
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,660
She did? That's good.

501
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,290
I thought about what would be good for a promotion gift,

502
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,230
and I decided on a car fit for a J Kings Holdings Team Leader.

503
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,230
From now on, your safety is the safety of the company.

504
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,170
You're giving me a car?

505
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,740
That's too much for a gift. It's burdensome, so I'll decline.

506
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,660
What happened that day,

507
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,630
thank you for keeping it a secret.

508
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,950
So you want to invest with this site as collateral?

509
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,050
As you can see, with a building like this in Seoul, there won't be a problem getting a loan.

510
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,270
Yes, yes. The location is spot on. I almost want it for myself.

511
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,300
Then as soon as we acquire the investment money, we'll start the process of establishing the corporation as co-owners.

512
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,100
Alright.

513
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,400
I like the way you handle business, Mr. Ju.

514
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,090
Thank you.

515
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,110
It's been a while, Logan.

516
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,520
Oh?

517
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,460
What brings you here?

518
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,900
This is the furniture company I run.

519
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,240
Oh really?

520
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,480
I was just talking some business with Mr. Ju.

521
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,400
He's planning to invest with this site as collateral.

522
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,280
I'll tell you the details as we go in. This way.

523
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,190
I think there's a misunderstanding.

524
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,100
This land belongs to my daughter.

525
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,750
Unfortunately, that daughter passed away not long ago. And the owner of the land has changed.

526
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,790
It does belong to me now.

527
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:07,190
Honey, what are you talking about? Hye In isn't dead.

528
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,850
Excuse me.

529
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,500
What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

530
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:23,040
You're the one who's crazy. I clearly told you to wait.

531
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,170
You registered Hye In's death certificate without asking me?

532
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,270
I waited a long time, she died 6 months ago.

533
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,900
She's not going to come back anyway. What's the reason you postpone reporting her death by paying fines?

534
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,350
It won't become money if we leave it alone.

535
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,980
Either way, half of this land is mine. It should be fine if I use it.

536
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,750
Didn't you refuse to divorce me because you covetted Hye In's land all this time?

537
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,260
Or is it my turn now.

538
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,440
Are you going to kill me and take this land all by yourself?

539
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,290
What are you talking about right now?

540
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,050
You thought I wouldn't know?

541
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,720
You killed Hye In.

542
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:08,350
Just how much do you know?

543
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,630
What did you and Yun Tae Ju plan before he died?

544
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:17,400
Are you curious? About what we planned?

545
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,160
Come in.

546
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,730
  Ha Min Hospital 

547
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,440
Ju Hye In.

548
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,960
Hye In, say hello to your dad.

549
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,790
Dad?

550
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,830
Your child is greeting you. It's been awhile, aren't you happy to see her?

551
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,700
Hye In?

552
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,360
- Hye In? 
 - She's been getting better with rehabilitation treatment.

553
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,970
At the hospital she'd been receiving

554
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:16,070
shots that kept her asleep for too long. So it took her some time to recover.

555
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,700
Now all her organs are returning to normal.

556
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,750
She learned to speak, and now walks a little.

557
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,820
Aren't you happy?

558
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,470
You were so caring of Hye In.

559
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,040
Howâ€”

560
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,880
I brought Hye In because she said she has something to say to her dad.

561
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,060
Hye In, tell him yourself.

562
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,910
This land is my grandfather's gift to me.

563
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,490
I won't give it to anyone.

564
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,040
  Sim Su Ryeon. How dare you trick me and hide the kid? 

565
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,990
  Ju Dan Tae. Starting now, I'm going to make you  pay for everything you did. 

566
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,360
What in the world is going on, Mr. Ju?

567
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,640
Were you trying to put up a fake collateral?

568
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,300
By claiming your living daughter is dead?

569
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,170
And this isn't even your property?

570
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm very disappointed in you.

571
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,330
That's not true.

572
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,120
Logan.

573
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:26,040
I want you to know that you can't do anything with this land without Hye In's permission.

574
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,880
I gotta go, she's not feeling well.

575
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,660
You bastard! I can't believe that you missed that.

576
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:17,750
What on earth have you been doing not even keeping an eye on her properly?

577
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,300
How could you not have known that Hye In was alive?

578
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,560
I'm sorry Chairman. I was sure that we were following and watching her the whole time.

579
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,230
Shut up. How could someone that was at the department store show up there?

580
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,120
Then whom were you following yesterday?

581
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,010
Sim Su Ryeon! I can't be patient anymore.

582
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,960
Su Ryeon has another daughter?

583
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,240
Whose kid is she?

584
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,460
Su Ryeon knew where Chairman Ju was.

585
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,050
And brought her daughter there.

586
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,120
No way...  Su Ryeon and Logan Lee?

587
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,850
You're putting in too much strength.

588
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,330
The higher the note is, the lower you should bring your breath.

589
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,520
Let's try again.

590
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,030
 That day, Ro Na's singing 

591
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,950
 was the best I had ever heard. 

592
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,800
 Su Ryeon 

593
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,320
 The person you are calling is not available... 

594
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,450
Logan, wait for me by the exit of the penthouse.

595
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,060
I'll be out with the items I've found.

596
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,230
Let's talk.

597
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,050
I'm busy right now.

598
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,140
No matter how busy you are, this can't happen.

599
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,890
Why did you ignore my calls all day?

600
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,480
You still haven't explained why you were at the villa with Oh Yun Hui.

601
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,250
I toldâ€” , I told you.

602
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:12,570
I was just resting there. Oh Yun Hui happened to be there with me after the company dinner.

603
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,150
Oh Yun Hui was wearing my clothes that you had gifted me.

604
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,340
I told you she had to change because her clothes were ruined.

605
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,440
Do I have to explain every little thing?

606
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,250
I heard you signed the contract with Logan Lee. So kick Oh Yun Hui out immediately.

607
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,220
Logan Lee wants her, as do I.

608
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,580
- What? 
 - Be careful there are a lot of eyes here.

609
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,980
Don't change the subject.

610
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,640
I don't know what you're thinking but remember this.

611
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,660
The promise we made when we started over, that I would decide our relationship.

612
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,580
Meeting together and breaking up,

613
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,720
is all decided by me.

614
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,970
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

615
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,780
Open the door, Eun Byeol.

616
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,540
Ha Eun Byeol!

617
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,800
What are you doing here?

618
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,590
Who let him in! I told you not to open the door for him.

619
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,880
Madam, that wasâ€”

620
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,290
Don't attack an innocent person.

621
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,520
She was worried about Eun Byeol so she called me.

622
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,790
Eun Byeol has locked herself in her room all day and wouldn't come out.

623
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,650
She's been throwing and breaking things in her room and throwing a fit.

624
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,010
She's acting out because she bombed the exam.

625
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,450
If you intend to use her as an excuse to keep coming in the house,  give up that intention.

626
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,450
Remember that I have the legal custodial rights.

627
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,420
Even if it weren't for Eun Byeol, I had to see you regarding another matter.

628
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,970
Is there still something left for us to talk about?

629
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,170
Oh. You'll have to vacate the hospital soon.

630
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,440
It seems like you still don't know. I've been transferred.

631
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,240
Transferred?

632
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:10,200
To where? It seems like there's still some place that is looking for you.

633
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,910
Yeah. Cheong Ah Medical Center.

634
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,790
Are you kidding right now?

635
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,110
I've started working as the Director of Cheong Ah Medical Center.

636
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:26,000
I thought I should tell you directly myself.

637
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,800
What are you talking about?

638
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:35,150
I've never confirmed that as the Chairwoman so with what ability can you be a director?

639
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,390
Father-in-law's will.

640
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,650
I don't think it needs your approval.

641
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,820
 Content of Will 

642
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:48,040
The day before your father died, he left Cheon Ah Medical Center in my hands.

643
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:55,790
I didn't know back then, but it looks like it became his last favor.

644
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:00,730
I look forward to working with you, Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.

645
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,720
Leech-like human!

646
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,380
How on earth did this happen, Attorney Park?

647
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,290
Why didn't you tell me about Cheong Ah Medical Center's director's matter?

648
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,850
Come to my office right now. This instant!

649
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,690
Who would send this to me?

650
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,830
2232 2232

651
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,440
2232

652
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,930
2232 2232 2232 2232

653
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,650
 4/22, 1st class, General Science 

654
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,880
What are you doing?

655
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,440
Is this how you got a 100%?

656
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,430
Pretend like you didn't see anything. Dad got it for me.

657
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:49,870
How long are you going to keep living like this?

658
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,220
Dad gave me permission!

659
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,430
So it's not something you can have a say about.

660
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,200
Up until this point, you're the one who has been helping me manipulate my grades.

661
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,900
Why do you suddenly have a conscience that you didn't have before?

662
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,140
What's wrong with your arm?

663
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,020
Let go!

664
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,570
Did dad do this?

665
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,950
Tell me. Did he do it?

666
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,050
If I received something, I should pay the price.

667
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,830
2235 2235

668
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:31,640
This isn't paying a price. It's violence and abuse.

669
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,070
What's wrong with you acting like someone who doesn't know anything?

670
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:40,120
Mind your own business! I'll figure out how to live from now on.

671
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,980
You already abandoned me.

672
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,030
At this rate, we're going to die in Dad's hands.

673
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:53,700
It doesn't matter if I die, as long as I beat Eun Byeol.

674
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,150
2232

675
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,830
2232

676
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,770
Sim Su Ryeon!

677
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,870
Where is Sim Su Ryeon?

678
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:14,030
Where is she?

679
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,290
Where is Ju Hye In? Where did you hide her!

680
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,980
Some place you'll never find her.

681
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,110
Some place where you'll never be able to kill her again.

682
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,860
Tell me! Where did you take that wench!

683
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,860
You dare treat me like an idiot?

684
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,390
You're not even human.

685
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:16,690
Trash. Murderer!

686
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,090
None of that is important.

687
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,010
Since we've gotten to know about each other much more,

688
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,600
we can be a more harmonious couple now.

689
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,690
Crazy bastard.

690
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,520
All this time you've acted too gracefully,

691
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,390
elegantly, and high end.

692
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:43,150
A woman like you needs to be punished.

693
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:49,120
A punishment for deceiving her husband and thinking about other things.

694
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:58,320
After you receive your punishment, everything will go back to how it was.

 Penthouse: War in Life 

697
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,460
 I'm on my way to America. I'm going to make you happy. 

698
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,780
 There's no need to feel guilty. 

699
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,320
 Now it feels like I've met a partner just for me. 

700
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,050
 - Use me. 
 - Don't trust men too much. 

701
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,660
 I'm not in the mood to coax your hot headed temper right now. 

702
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,540
 It's beautiful. 

703
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,130
 A bloody wind will blow. Someone might die. 

704
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,030
 They'll know once they go through the same thing. 

705
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,300
 What they did wrong. 

706
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,299
â™«  The look they try to take something out of me  â™«
