Everything is set.

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,730
Finish it with this.

 Honorary membership- Mr. Logan Lee

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,510
 Hearty welcome to Hera Palace

 SJ Lighting 

7
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,830
I prepared so you can do the lighting ceremony yourself.

8
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Wow. What an honor.

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,210
Now, should we all count together?

10
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,900
Ten, nine,

11
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,750
eight, seven,

12
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,740
six, five,

13
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,280
four, three,

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,890
two, one,

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,040
Zero!

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,760
 Min Seol Ah 

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,400
 Min Seol Ah's killer is in this room 

18
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,280
Who pulled such terrible prank?

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
Who?

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
Min Seol Ah's killer is in this room...

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,600
Which bastard did this?

22
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,900
  That's definitely Seol Ah's shoe. Who on earth did it? 

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,010
  The Hera Palace people are trying to kill me. I'm frightened, Ahjumma! 

24
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,110
  Please help me. Please save me! 

25
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,130
 Hera Palace 47 

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,100
  Someone pushed Min Seol Ah. From the 47th floor. 

27
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,910
Unni. Are you ok?

28
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,460
I apologize. It looks like someone played a cruel prank.

29
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,520
It seems like we'll have to end the party here today. I'll call you later.

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm very disappointed in you, Mr. Ju.

31
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,130
I was expecting something a little more... spectacular.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,350
Excuse me.

33
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,430
Ms. Oh Yun Hui. Follow him.

34
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,930
Hey! Leave the party room.

35
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,030
Get out!

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
   : Did you like the present I sent? 

37
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,000
 Where are you right now? Why are you doing althis? 

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
  Why are you going so far? 

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,210
  Because the person who killed Min Seol Ah was your husband. Now it's your turn. 

40
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,860
  Reveal that the dead Min Seol Ah is your daughter. 

41
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,900
 Right now! 

42
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,000
 I'll give you one minute. Hurry up. 

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,470
  Say it right now!! 

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,670
 50 seconds!! 

45
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,700
 40 seconds!! 

46
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,800
 20 seconds!! 

47
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,380
You did this, didn't you?

48
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,910
The person who planned all of this is you, Sim Su Ryeon.

49
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,510
It was you from the start. Everything from the beginning!

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,630
Teacher Cheon, what are you talking about?

51
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,490
Why would Su Ryeon do that?

52
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,600
Seo Jin, aren't you being a bit excessive? Su Ryeon doesn't know anything.

53
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,420
No. I'm positive it's Sim Su Ryeon.

54
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,640
The only person who would bring us all here together and put on an incredible show,

55
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
is you.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,550
But why would Su Ryeon do that?

57
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,560
You can't blame it on someone not related to it.

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,230
I have proof.

59
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,480
Clear proof that Sim Su Ryeon has been threatening us all along.

60
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,390
Seo Jin, I have no idea what you are talking about at all.

61
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,660
Don't you?

62
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,580
How long will you be able to lie your way out of this?

63
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,680
This painting. I took it from your office this morning.

64
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,040
You may have fooled me once, but you probably didn't think that I would go there again.

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,750
I wondered where I saw this apple necklace, and as expected, it was Min Seol Ah's.

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,850
Why, of all people, did you happen to draw Min Seol Ah?

67
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,770
If she has no relation to you, there's no reason to draw her, don't you think?

68
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,570
T-That. This ...

69
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,400
Oh my!

70
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,060
- This eye. 
 - You're right!

71
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,160
This is Min Seol Ah!

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,070
Did you really draw this, Su Ryeon?

73
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,800
There's no reason to.

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,780
The person who released the recording of our kids,

75
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,660
and pressured us by sending threatening letters,

76
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,230
it was all you. Why? Why did you do this?

77
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,810
This kid, is it really Min Seol Ah?

78
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,790
Did you draw this? Why on earth did you do such a thing?

79
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,500
- Answer me! 
 - It's because Min Seol Ah ...

80
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,600
is Sim Su Ryeon's daughter.

81
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,710
What nonsense are you talking about?

82
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,480
Say it for yourself. Deny it if it's not true.

83
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,460
It's true.

84
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,160
I drew this painting.

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,180
Is it really you?  Why did you do it? Why?

86
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,470
I saw ...

87
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,160
that night ... Min Seol Ah

88
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,330
falling to her death here, at Hera Palace.

89
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,100
Ever since that night, I've had nightmares every night.

90
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,620
Min Seol Ah did not commit suicide.

91
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,370
Someone pushed her from up there.

92
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,490
I didn't see the face,

93
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,500
but I clearly saw ... the hands that pushed the resisting child.

94
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,410
Min Seol Ah was murdered, not suicide?

95
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,880
There's no way. Then what did we do?

96
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Did we join the commission of a murder?  Did we?

97
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,370
Then why didn't you say anything until now?

98
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,070
You witnessed a murder taking place.

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,870
It's because I thought my husband

100
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,090
and Seo Jin were the criminals.

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,980
What are talking about?

102
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,360
Seo Jin and my husband are in a adulterous relationship.

103
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,590
Min Seol Ah knew about it and was threatening them.

104
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,310
  She already knew about it. 

105
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,160
An adulterous relationship?

106
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,950
Teacher Cheon and Chairman Ju?

107
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,450
Teacher Cheon, it's not true right? Chairman Ju,

108
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,090
Su Ryeon is mistaken right?

109
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,190
Proof that they frequented the Yangpyeong house,

110
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,210
is in my hands.

111
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,430
Teacher Cheon.

112
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,300
Min Seol Ah was holding on to your vulnerable point,

113
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,350
so you locked her in the mechanical room, right?

114
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,620
I heard everything you two talked about.

115
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,790
That's why I was scared, that the two of you

116
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,100
might've killed Min Seol Ah.

117
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,800
It's not me. Why would I?

118
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,350
Then did you push her, Seo Jin?

119
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,730
Because she knew about the affair? Was that why?

120
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,910
Tell me yourself.

121
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,140
Deny it, if it's not true.

122
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,630
Don't put on a show, it doesn't work on me.

123
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,860
Tell me your relationship with Min Seol Ah!

124
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,530
I wanted to protect my family.

125
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,070
And I kept warning you with my own methods.

126
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,620
That's why purposely wore that scarf today.

127
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,300
But we've come all this way.

128
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,180
I was hoping you would understand and stop on your own.

129
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,130
I saw. The hands that pushed her.

130
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,580
The red ruby ring.

131
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,290
But I won't say that out loud.

132
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,400
Should I reveal it right now?

133
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,120
No. Call it off.

134
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,610
Sim Su Ryeon. You knew all along?

135
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,570
What a fun sight, Bae Ro Na.

136
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,900
Seok Hun should've been here to see it.

137
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,320
What are you doing?

138
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,680
I won't let you all get away with this!

139
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,510
Well, it would've taken this much courage to pretend to be Min Seol Ah.

140
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,380
Is this how you bullied Min Seol Ah?

141
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,860
Is that why she died?

142
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,950
I hate both you and your mom so much.

143
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,690
I hate you for being around Seok Hoon all the time

144
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,250
and I think your mom is lowly for approaching my dad for being his first love.

145
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,590
- What? 
 -You didn't know?

146
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,570
Your mom is going around hitting on my dad.

147
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,830
My parents fought because of that and my dad left the house!

148
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,300
Stop kidding yourself.

149
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,360
My mom isn't someone who would do that.

150
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,290
You're shameless just like your mom.

151
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,150
My family is a mess because of your mom.

152
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,950
My parents might even get a divorce!

153
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,580
Did you know that my dad slept over your house a while ago?

154
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,400
You're lying. You think I'm going to fall for that?

155
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,080
 Was someone here last night? 

156
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,820
 Oh, I couldn't fall asleep so I had some drink by myself. 

157
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,210
 You know I like drinking alone. 

158
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,180
There's no way.

159
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,220
No.

160
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,010
If you don't believe me, go find out for yourself.

161
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,900
To see if I'm lying or not.

162
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,380
It'll be good for you to listen to me from now on.

163
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,100
Or else I'm going to tell everyone

164
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,220
what your mom did.

165
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:15,020
Then both you and your mom will be screwed for life.

166
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,350
Ro Na. Bae Ro Na!

167
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,520
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

168
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,210
Ro Na!

169
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,430
Ro Na, are you okay?

170
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,400
Are you okay?

171
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,090
Move.

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Can't you hear me?  Stop putting on a show.

173
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,800
Ha Eun Byeol. You'd better not be lying. Or I won't leave you alone.

174
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,150
They were brazenly having an affair in front of my eyes?

175
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,230
I, all-knowing Kang Ma Ri, didn't know this at all.

176
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,080
She has no qualification to be an educator, does she?

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,340
What would our innocent children be learning from her?

178
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,840
How can she go around seducing someone's husband

179
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,870
and on top of that, she did murder—

180
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Did Teacher Cheon really push Min Seol Ah to cover up her affair?

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,130
That's horrible. It's too vicious.

182
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,490
There's no such thing as a murderer who isn't vicious.

183
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,590
Dammit I really stepped in shit.

184
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,600
I mean, those two worked together to kill Min Seol Ah

185
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,100
and they roped us in to help abandon the body.  Damn.

186
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,130
Honey, Honey. Shouldn't we at least report them now?

187
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,430
We really believed that it was a suicide!

188
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,490
Wouldn't that be an extenuating circumstance?  
 ( a condition to excuse the crime or reduce the punishment )

189
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,390
You, such a childish woman!

190
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,030
We are tied hands and feet to those two.

191
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,510
The moment we dumped her corpse, whether it is to heaven or to hell,

192
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,970
we have a common destiny.

193
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,610
Accomplices! Don't you understand?

194
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,710
Accomplices?

195
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,020
Why would we be accomplices? We didn't know anything and were blindly fooled!

196
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,660
Are we just going to stay still?

197
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,030
Are you going just to watch Teacher Cheon brazenly having an affair but doing whatever she wants?

198
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,970
Then what are we supposed to do?

199
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,930
How long have you known?

200
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,990
It's been a few months.

201
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,790
I'm pretty sure you knew too.

202
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,040
You knew that I did a background check on you at the errand services center.

203
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
Why didn't you ever ask me about it?

204
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,730
I thought you would end it soon.

205
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,400
That you were just shaken up once.

206
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,870
I was waiting for you to come back to your family on your own.

207
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,550
But still, how can you reveal that in front of everyone like that? What are we supposed to do now?

208
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,100
- We should get a divorce. 
 - I won't.

209
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,900
We can never get a divorce.

210
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,490
Isn't that what you wanted?

211
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,400
The Hera Club people already know now. How can we live together?

212
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,300
Nothing changed. You're the only one for me.

213
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,180
I know that you two

214
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,440
are already in a deep relationship.

215
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,660
My thought stays the same.

216
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,860
Is divorce that easy? What about Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong?

217
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,220
Give me some time. I'll figure it out myself.

218
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,060
There's something I want to confirm.

219
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,080
Was today's event planned by you?

220
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:27,250
Both sending us the threatening letter and putting the eye picture on the fountain

221
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,380
were they all done by you?

222
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,250
If anyone did those things, it would be probably you.

223
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,150
What are you saying? I didn't kill her.

224
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,260
What if I don't believe you?

225
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,730
Do you think I would risk my life to handle a child like that?

226
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,330
 I'm at the villa. I'm waiting. Let's meet right now. 

227
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,070
 Not today. Next time. 

228
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,540
 Do you want me to barge into the penthouse? 

229
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,820
Stay in the study for now.

230
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,460
I feel uncomfortable being in the same bed as you.

231
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,150
Trust me and don't think about anything else. Wait for me.

232
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,460
It's me. How's the situation looking?

233
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll be right over.

234
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,250
I said to see each other next time. Why are you acting like a child?

235
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,130
Is that something you should be saying to me right now?

236
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,230
Because of your wife, my disgrace has been revealed to the world,

237
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,830
Do you think I would be in my right mind?

238
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,350
You provoked her first by making her the culprit that threatened us.

239
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,550
Saying nonsense about her being Min Seol Ah's mother.

240
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,290
You believe your wife?

241
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,500
Sim Su Ryeon is a scary person!

242
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,650
She knew about our relationship this whole time but was acting like she didn't know!

243
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,310
Do you think a woman like that is just going to confess that she was the one threatening us?

244
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,210
I already looked into it as much as I could.

245
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,590
I even stuck someone onto her to verify all of her appointments.

246
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,350
Do you think she figured out all, even including that you had someone tail her?

247
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,940
Stop it! I'm so tired I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

248
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,950
What happened with Oh Yun Hui?

249
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,810
What's the reason you made her work at your company?

250
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,110
I told you. I'm keeping her for a bit because of Logan Lee.

251
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,860
If that bitch had any ability, how much would there be?

252
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,890
She's a woman who was showing houses without a real estate agent license.

253
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,550
Fire her right away. If you need help with anything, I'll help you.

254
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,120
Why are you so emotional? Back at the party and now too.

255
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,790
Don't you think we should be a little careful now that everyone knows about our relationship?

256
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,090
Why are you being so persistent like someone who has nothing to lose?

257
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,170
Right now, I lost the most important thing to me.

258
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,630
My pride.

259
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,510
I was just humiliated in front of the Hera Club members.

260
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,200
All that pride I've kept over these years was crushed in seconds. Is that nothing?

261
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Beside my father, I've never bowed my head to anyone.

262
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,250
But now my weakness has been shown to them.

263
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,020
If you turn your back on me,

264
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm going to go crazy.

265
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,850
Don't get too worked up.

266
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,420
You know I love you, right?

267
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,820
I'll make it so that no one can bother you.

268
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,870
I'm Ju Dan Tae.

269
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,180
Get divorced from Sim Su Ryeon. I'm not telling you to come to me this instant.

270
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,430
It disgusts me knowing that you're sleeping and eating with someone like her.

271
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,080
Wait a bit.

272
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,490
There's something I need to take from her lastly.

273
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,530
What's that?

274
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,070
Later.

275
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,760
Before that, you're really not related to Min Seol Ah's incident, right?

276
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Then what about you?

277
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,320
My

278
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,500
name

279
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,990
is

280
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,150
Ju Hye In.

281
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,980
Good job, Hye In.

282
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,300
You really did a good job.

283
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,500
Mommy is so happy.

285
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,630
My Hye In can even say her own name.

286
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,370
A day like this has come.

287
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,310
Mom.

288
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,580
Don't cry.

289
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,570
I won't cry.

290
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,210
I'll listen to you.

291
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,720
 Ha:  Yun Hui, is living like this right? 

292
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,220
 Would it be better if I just get a divorce? 

293
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,960
How could Mom... how could she...

294
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,510
Looking at your face, it seems like you finally believe me.

295
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,360
Are you ready to save your mom?

296
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,080
Hey.

297
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,920
I found these pictures in my mom's drawer.

298
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,680
Stop it!

299
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,560
Isn't your dad at fault too?

300
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,640
If you want to blame someone, go to your dad!

301
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,440
Your mom is the one seducing a man with a family!

302
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,330
My family was happy and had no problems until your family moved in.

303
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,090
It's ruined because of your mom.

304
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,000
Why should it only happen to us?

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,160
Your mom should know what it feels like.

306
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,810
Don't touch my mom.

307
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,790
What do you want me to do?

308
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,770
I'll do whatever you want.

309
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,370
Please.

310
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,300
Secretary Jo. Get lost.

311
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,580
I said get lost.

312
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,410
I have something to discuss with Chairman Ju.

313
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,810
What's the matter?

314
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,080
Did you find the culprit behind the mannequin show?

315
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,660
Whoever it might be, if he weren't bitterly resentful of Min Seol Ah's killer, would he have done that?

316
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,330
I don't want to hear such a scary story early in the morning.

317
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,930
I'm looking for the mannequin show culprit so they'll be caught soon.

318
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,810
The person who killed Min Seol Ah

319
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,090
is you, right? I'm right, aren't I?

320
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,160
Lawyer Lee!

321
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,100
A few months ago, I got my hands on this.

322
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,090
Min Seol Ah's phone.

323
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,800
How did you—  Why haven't you told me?

324
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,940
There's an amazing movie in here. The stars are Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

325
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,400
The genre is erotica and the title is "Wrong Meeting."

326
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,410
I really enjoyed it, Chairman Ju. It was hot.

327
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,950
You must eat something good for boosting up energy.

328
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,420
I don't think this is a good time to show your card.

329
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,370
My relationship with Cheo Seo Jin was already revealed.

330
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,020
If you'd wanted to show it, you should've speeded  up doing it.

331
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,750
Then what about this?

332
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,850
 Today is November 14,  Saturday.  

333
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,460
 I'm currently on my way to Hera Palace. 

334
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,570
 Seok Gyeong's dad wanted to meet and called me.  

335
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,980
 If something happens to me, or if I die 

336
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,200
 It's probably Seok Gyeong's dad, 100%. 

337
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,670
Crazy b*tch.

338
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,440
This is the perfect timing to reveal this!

339
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,760
Isn't this guaranteed evidence to show that you killed Min Seol Ah?

340
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,050
Until you  prove your alibi which is proof that you didn't kill her,

341
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,330
this is going to be a big disadvantage.

342
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,430
This is advice I'm giving you as a lawyer.

343
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,560
What are you trying to do?

344
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,670
Ju Dan Tae. I don't think this is a situation where you should be speaking to me so casually.

345
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,940
What should I do? Should I hand this over to the police?

346
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,360
What do you want?

347
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,860
My  investment of thirty billion won for the Myeongdong land,

348
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,390
add a 5 percent interest and pay up.

349
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,740
I also need to live!

350
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,220
I'm currently in talks with Logan Lee about the contract.

351
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,320
Logan Lee or whatever I don't care about that!

352
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,300
I can't bear nor do I have time or patience for that guy who acts on a whim!

353
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,150
So spit up my money immediately.

354
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,730
I told you my dad's law firm building is going to end up in someone else's hands.

355
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,150
Is that all you want?

356
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,590
For now.

357
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,790
Let's do that. It's not difficult to get mere 30 billion in cash.

358
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,830
Wire the money to my account by today.

359
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,630
Also, don't speak to me so casually next time. Hey.

360
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,650
What is it that you need to say? I need to head to work soon.

361
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,670
I don't think this is a situation for you to act so shamelessly.

362
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,900
We're thinking of officially submitting a petition  to Cheong Ah Arts School.

363
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,060
I can't entrust my child to someone as immoral and unscrupulous as you.

364
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,050
A teacher having an affair?

365
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,180
And on top of that with a parent from the same school?

366
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,420
So?

367
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,770
Wh-What do you mean "so"?

368
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,400
You should hand in your resignation!

369
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,090
You came all the way here this morning just to say that?

370
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,330
She is laughing at us.

371
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,060
She meant our words were ridiculous, didn't she?

372
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,980
It seems you can't feel the reality of this, I guess it can't be helped.

373
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,570
Then we'll have no other choice but to visit Chairman Lee.

374
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,100
Or shall we go straight to the Ministry of Education.

375
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,190
Do as you please.

376
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,790
What is this?

377
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,070
These are Min Hyeok's and Je Ni's middle school report cards.

378
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,920
How did such low achieving students in both school grades and practical scores, as you can see,

379
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,040
get into Cheong Ah Arts School?

380
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,400
Have you already forgotten how they were admitted?

381
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,980
Didn't Je Ni's mom pay for my interior design expenses,  the blue chip picture on my living room wall,

382
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,360
and the rent for the hall for the Cheong Ah graduation performance?

383
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,320
They were bribes to look upon Je Ni favorably.

384
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,390
Delivery of party food at every school event,  food during the national holidays is the basic

385
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,000
and even packing up five different types of kimchi and side dishes and filling up the fridge.

386
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Min Hyeok's mother, that was you right?

387
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Wasn't that all because we were on the same boat?

388
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,990
If you want, I'll resign from Cheong Ah Arts School.

389
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,200
However, don't forget, without me ...

390
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,610
your kids' lives also end here.

391
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,430
Would there be any reason for unqualified subpar kids

392
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,080
to remain at Cheong Ah Arts School?

393
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you not want to send them to Seoul National University School of Music?

394
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:23,400
That's not it. I just did it because Su Ryeon asked us

395
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,320
to come here and relay a message.

396
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,700
I just came here with that heart.

397
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,910
Then make a choice.

398
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,590
There's no need to make a choice.

399
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,520
I am going to trust you fully and go to the end.

400
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,910
That's why I told you I didn't want to come here.

401
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,500
You put on me the clothes that don't even look good on me and dragged me all the way here.

402
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,530
I've always not gotten along with Su Ryeon.  You're the one that is close to her.

403
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,710
Am I crazy that I carry the ball for someone else's family business?

404
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,180
Fine.

405
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,160
The performance test for the midterms will start soon.

406
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,540
I'll become of great help to

407
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,300
Je Ni and Min Hyeok.

408
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,150
I'll apologize for acting like Min Seol Ah this whole time.

409
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,330
There will be nothing like that from now on.

410
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,630
Wasn't it just yesterday you said it was definitely not you.

411
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,880
It was me who did it. I'm sorry.

412
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,950
Bae Ro Na. What's wrong with you?

413
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,730
You really creep me out.

414
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,630
Is this something that'll end just with your apology?

415
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,090
How about dropping out? Of course you're going to quit school, right?

416
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,320
She confessed so she  will listen to her conscience.

417
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,160
Promise to be obedient to us from now on.

418
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,430
Why? Can't you do it?

419
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,390
   
 1. All the threats related to Min Seol Ah were done by me. 

420
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:31,600
 2. I won't tell anyone about what happened last night at the community center. 

421
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,210
 3. 

422
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,910
 I will do everything Ha Eun Byeol tells me to do. 

423
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,390
 Write it. 

424
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,500
   

425
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,340
 2020.4.10 - Bae Ro Na 

426
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,900
 If you go against any of these, 

427
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,700
 Your mom won't be able to show her face at Hera Palace. 

428
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,320
I promise.

429
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,680
You can go.

430
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,590
You two were diligent.

431
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,270
Ju Dan Tae, you.  Such a small thing.

432
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,310
You're acting up.

433
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,730
Hey, thanks to you, I survived.

434
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,120
Let's see, has my thirty billion won  come in?

435
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,390
What the?  Why hasn't he put it in?

436
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,460
Ah, seriously! This  moron Ju Dan Tae.

437
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,600
He doesn't listen.

438
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,010
Ms. Mi Ja.

439
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,360
Come on

440
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,210
"Ms. Mi Ja"?

441
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,440
You crazy bastard!  Have you speculated in something by selling our law firm's name all this time?

442
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,110
Is this true?

443
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,370
Who—

444
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,450
What on earth have you been doing?

445
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,000
What kind of company is our law firm connected to in such an illegal investment now?

446
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,420
Mom. This is—

447
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,880
You know what would happen to you and me if your father found out, right?

448
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,470
Of course, you and I will be kicked out.  We're having a joint funeral, Brat.

449
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,750
How are you going to fix this?

450
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,300
Why is it just me? You made money making illegal investments too.

451
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,980
What are you saying? When did I?

452
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,530
I learned this all from you!

453
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,010
This little bastard.

454
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,410
Save me!  Save me!

455
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,430
What's all this?  Why have I become cannon fodder?

456
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,360
Are you asking because you don't know?

457
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,910
You let go of my hand first.

458
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,620
I can't protect you anymore.

459
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,050
There will be a tax audit soon at your law firm.

460
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,790
You're telling me to die by myself?

461
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,270
This is something we all did together!

462
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,150
Of course all the documents will exclude my name.

463
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,600
You think I would have done this without thinking that through?

464
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,900
Do you really have to do this far?

465
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm sure you do. That's right.

466
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,200
I was careless.

467
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,860
At the sight of thirty billion won,

468
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,010
I went crazy a little bit. You crazy bastard!

469
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:23,500
But still, we have had some sort of relationship.

470
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,870
We also have grown attached to each other meantime.

471
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,830
Isn't that so, Chairman Ju?

472
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,280
Wow.

473
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,170
What should I do to ease your heart, Chairman Ju?

474
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,970
Should I get on my knees? These knees

475
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,170
I'm bringing out my earnest feelings and showing them to you.

476
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,130
Bring Min Seol Ah's phone this instant!

477
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,640
Yes!

478
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,430
Gu Ho Dong is in  the hospital?

479
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,610
Yes. He was in a big car accident 5 years ago and is still unconscious.

480
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,270
This is the real Gu Ho Dong.

481
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,410
His hometown is in Gyeongsang-Province and

482
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,060
after an award winning National Sports Festival,  he became a physical education teacher.

483
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,980
Then who is the person at Cheong Ah Arts School?

484
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,300
Maybe it is  a case of phony employment after buying Gu Ho Dong's identity.

485
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,070
 Who on earth are you? 

486
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,230
Do it properly!

487
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,530
Why are you shopping during the class?

488
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,500
  Secretary Hong    

489
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,990
What's wrong?

490
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,470
 Min Seol Ah's phone has been turned on. 

491
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,300
Where is that?

492
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,970
Good bye. My money line.

493
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,320
Gosh, who is it?

494
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,650
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

495
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm already busy as is.

496
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,690
Are you kidding me right now?

497
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,420
I just had it. I took it out of my safe and put it in my bag.

498
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,720
I feel wronged.

499
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,780
Shall I cut open my belly and show you?

500
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:25,110
Chairman Ju. Chairman. Let's talk this out.

501
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,800
Hey. Hey!

502
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,380
I graduated from Sangmok High School.

503
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,410
Hey, don't you know Lee Gyu Jin from Daechi-dong?

504
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:40,030
Okay, I'll show you hell! Come at me!

505
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,940
  Aigoo, hello.    

506
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,930
 I am Gu Ho Dong, the Deputy Homeroom Teacher in the Music Department at Cheong Ah Arts School. 

507
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,510
 It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Logan Lee. 

508
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,610
Gu Ho Dong is

509
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,720
Logan Lee?

510
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,800
  I have a family for the first time.    

511
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,570
 Your brother is sick. 

512
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,560
 So we need your help, Anna. 

513
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,260
   I was set up. Oppa, oppa, please say something.    

514
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,630
 I found out for the first time that day 

515
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,970
 that I had a sick older brother. 

516
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,190
 04.11.2016. With Anna at Central Park.  
 Pretty Dongsaeng (younger sibling ), Stupid Oppa

517
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,100
He was Seol Ah's new brother.

518
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,010
I'm sure that someone took it.

519
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,510
I had it for sure until I was out of the office.

520
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:14,400
Oh. I bumped into someone at the lobby.  Do you think that guy took it?

521
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,950
Then it would've been caught on the lobby camera!

522
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,400
Then is it—

523
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,120
You're right! The mannequin show culprit!

524
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,150
It's him. I'm sure of it.

525
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,880
Chairman Ju, if we find him, we can find Min Seol Ah's phone—

526
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,550
You little—  Shut up your mouth, seriously!

527
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,080
Then why have you been holding on to her phone for this long, creating this mess?

528
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,290
Chairman.

529
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,370
L-Lawyer Lee?

530
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,620
So our redevelopment plan—

531
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,740
- What's wrong? 
 - I just got off the phone with Logan Lee.

532
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,260
He's on his way to the hotel.

533
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,470
Have the car ready.  Oh Yun Hui will go with us.

534
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,200
What are you doing? How did you get in here?

535
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,970
It was you? Seol Ah's adopted brother?

536
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,360
You did such cruel things to my daughter, yet you dare to threaten me? Using Seol Ah's name?

537
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,910
You adopted my Seol Ah to take her bone marrow, didn't you?

538
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,650
And then frame her for robbery and cancel the adoption?

539
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,670
You should have just thrown her out!

540
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,630
Why did you give scars to the poor child?

541
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,870
I didn't know.

542
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,700
I found out the truth later. And I wanted to take responsibility somehow.

543
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,870
But Seol Ah... died.

544
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,870
How much was the deal with Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon?

545
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,410
Do you know how long I looked for you?

546
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,550
You hid so well using your rich family.

547
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,340
Why did you appear now?

548
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:47,410
If you lived because of that young girl, then you should've lived like a human!

549
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,310
You're not even human!

550
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,100
So I came! Even though I'm inhumane,

551
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,070
I wanted to live unashamed for once.

552
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,350
You bastard, are you going to weasel out until the end?

553
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,880
I promised myself everyday that I would kill you.

554
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,830
Die, die, die, die!

555
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,100
Die!

556
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,400
Stop it now.

557
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,180
Stop, stop! Stop!

558
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,110
Stop it. Stop it!

559
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,460
I understand.

560
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,540
So stop.

561
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,790
Ok, kill me.

562
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,000
But before that, kill Ju Dan Tae first.

563
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,480
Why? You can't give up that petty family of yours?

564
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,880
Even if Ju Dan Tae killed your daughter? Because he's your husband?

565
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,010
Shut up. I'll kill Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin. And you as well.

566
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,530
You have to find out the culprit who killed Seol Ah first.

567
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,660
Before that. I'll give you a chance.

568
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,010
A chance to act like a mom for once.

569
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:27,960
  Oppa, you said you would find me my mom, right? 

570
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,240
  There's something I want to check. I want to see how she's living. 

571
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,470
  How do you wish she's living? 

572
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,880
  I wish mom was living as miserably as I am. 

573
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,690
  When I was young, I used to think like that. 

574
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,600
  But not anymore. I ... 

575
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,920
  I want mom to be really happy. 

576
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,540
  I want her to live very happily. 

577
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,580
Seol Ah...

578
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:09,110
  Oppa. Find my mom, 

579
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,550
  and check if she's living happily. 

580
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,190
  Then I'll... 

581
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,650
  be ok even if I never meet her. 

582
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,890
I don't have any right to be happy.

583
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,760
Let's do it together. Seol Ah's revenge.

584
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,910
I'll take my punishment after.

585
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,960
I have no thoughts on taking your side.

586
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,400
No, just like I misunderstood you, you misunderstood me.

587
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,550
We... have the same goal.

588
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,500
You don't have any right. You should've taken responsibility for her.

589
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,620
You should've protected her no matter what!

590
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,110
I don't want to make excuses.

591
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,990
But I know a way to repay her. That's why I'm looking for the person who killed her!

592
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,860
I'll find them. And punish them ten millions times over.!

593
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,050
I will punish them that many times more painfully.

594
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,630
No. I don't trust you.

595
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,330
I risked my life for this.

596
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,500
I'm going to solve my Seol Ah's wrongful death.

597
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,470
I'm going to get rid of anyone in my path.

598
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,200
What are you doing here?

599
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,900
I'm asking!

600
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,260
Why are you coming out of Logan Lee's room?

601
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,090
Could you explain what's going on, Logan?

602
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:28,480
Why is my wife coming out of your room?

603
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,350
You have a very admirable wife, Mr. Ju.

604
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,200
What is that supposed to mean?

605
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,840
Well, to be honest,

606
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,790
because of the unfortunate event last night,

607
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,570
I was actually thinking about cancelling our contract.

608
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,290
But that was before your wife came in,

609
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:53,890
and apologized, for you instead.

610
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,060
This is what they call the wife's support.

611
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,430
Su Ryeon did a big job.

612
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,900
I was very touched by our conversation tonight.

613
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,830
I'll take a step back, and make a reconsideration.

614
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,770
I appreciate it.

615
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,470
We look forward to hearing from you soon.

616
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,800
To be honest, do you think we lent the money trusting Ha Yun Cheol?

617
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,370
We lent it because we trust you, Seo Jin.

618
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,880
We thought there would be no way that the daughter of Cheong Ah Foundation would not pay back our money.

619
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,470
I don't know about that money. This is the first time I heard about it.

620
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,250
That doesn't mean you have no responsibility.

621
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,300
You are a married couple anyway.

622
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,520
Why did you come here? If you have something to say, say it to me.

623
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,000
Hey. You were ignoring my calls.

624
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,590
Get out! I'll contact you later.

625
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,500
You as a doctor, why are you acting so lowly?

626
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,790
Repay me my money instantly, you conman!

627
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:06,500
Who's a conman? Why did you lend him money if you thought he was a conman?

628
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,100
I thought you were his hometown friends,

629
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,300
but is 5% interest reasonable? Why?

630
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,100
Were you trying to make yourself rich by extorting from your friend?

631
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,600
- Look at me! 
 - What do I look at?

632
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,280
Did you lend me your money? Why do you speak informally?

633
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,310
Don't make a scene at someone else's school, get lost right now.

634
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,220
Do you want to be dragged out?

635
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,040
We can't wait long.

636
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,990
Next time, we'll come back ready to stay with blankets whether it's in  the school or in the hospital.

637
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,840
Ha Yun Cheol.

638
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,250
You're gotten more courageous after living with me.

639
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,050
What did you do with that money. Did you start a business?

640
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,730
Or did one of your aunts cause trouble again?

641
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,990
None of your concern. I'll take care of it on my own.

642
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,450
I heard it was 7 billion won (about  $7 million) that you took from your friends' pockets.

643
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,800
How will you be able to repay that with your skills?

644
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,120
I'll take care of it for you.

645
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,860
It's your divorce alimony.

646
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,140
In return, the custody of Eun Byeol, the house,

647
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,060
our combined wealth, and the director position for Cheong Ah Medical center, give up all of them.

648
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:24,600
One more. Until I become Chairman, agree to cooperate.

649
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,830
Then I'll take on your debt.

650
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:33,120
You want to erase your wrongdoings with 7 billion won?

651
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,760
My wrong doings?

652
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,980
You sound like a husband.

653
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,980
Were we ever a married couple?

654
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,640
It's been over 10 years since we slept together.

655
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,570
I've never received money or love from you.

656
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,100
How are you going to compensate me for my misfortune?

657
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,520
Correctly speaking, you're the reason our marriage started falling apart.

658
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,500
For 17 years,

659
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,160
I've always been lonely. And I've never received a paycheck from you.

660
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,410
You've never cared or looked after me,

661
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,570
but now you want me to accept responsibility for hurting you?

662
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,540
The reason I'm seeing another man is because of you!

663
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,400
But I'm still offering you 7 billion won in alimony.

664
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,370
Isn't that appealing to you?

665
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,530
Is the selfishness of knowing only yourself an incurable disease?

666
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,720
There's no way. Things won't go the way you want it to.

667
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,750
Will it really not?

668
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,400
Open it. It's a gift.

669
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,270
I heard this is popular right now.

670
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,570
You're probably stressing out preparing for the midterms.

671
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,360
I got this so you can find some strength.

672
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,440
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

673
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:27,210
Why, you don't like it? Do you want to exchange it for a different one?

674
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,020
Who said I wanted this?

675
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,530
Who said I needed a  luxury wallet?

676
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,200
Bae Ro Na. What are you doing right now?

677
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,990
I'm so sick of it.

678
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,440
Why of all places did we come to Hera Palace?

679
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,120
It's so annoying.

680
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,500
Why is she acting like that?

681
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:06,430
Don't worry Mom, I'll do it.

682
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,090
It's no big deal.

683
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,600
I'll resolve it soon, bye.

684
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,610
The creditors must've gone to the orchard.

685
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,050
Your parents must be very worried.

686
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,460
That's why you shouldn't use someone else's money recklessly.

687
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,240
Give my suggestion some thought. The conditions are not bad.

688
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,520
I'll keep it a secret from Eun Byeol for the time being.

689
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,530
Since if she gets shocked, it can interfere with her studies.

690
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,680
Sign our divorce documents.

691
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,200
I'll deposit the money right away.

692
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,910
More hassling is not a solution.

693
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,200

 2020 Cheong Ah Arts School 
   
 Department of Vocal Music Class 1 Performance Test     

695
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,400
 German: Exzellent, jawohl.  
Excellent, yes. Perfect.

696
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Amazing. Ha Eun Byeol, your skills have greatly improved.

697
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,890
As expected, blood does not lie.

698
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,590
You resemble your mother's timbre.

699
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,960
Thank you, Teacher.

700
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,670
Something good recently happened so I'm in great condition.

701
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,080
Next, Bae Ro Na.

702
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,840
Come out.

703
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,310
  What? Mess up the performance test?  

704
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:14,300
  - You're telling me to sing badly on purpose?   
 - Yes.  

705
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,840
  On purpose.    

706
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,800
  But what if I don't want to?    

707
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,850
  Have you forgotten?    

708
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,380
  From now on, your mom's life is up to you.    

709
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,250
 2020 Cheong Ah Arts School 
   Department of Vocal Music Class 1 Performance Test   

710
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,980
  Bae Ro Na's mom is an adulteress!   

711
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,110
Bae Ro Na! Did you not practice?

712
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,470
You are truly a disgrace to Cheong Ah Arts.

713
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,520
What is this, huh?

714
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,960
My Je Ni, on the performance test

715
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,780
she placed third. Third place.

716
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,010
My Min Hyeok is fourth.

717
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,050
If he's fourth place, then he'll have no problems getting into Seoul National University of Music, right?

718
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:48,060
Of course.  No one in the top five fails admission to a SKY Music School.  ( SKY: Seoul National U, Korea U, and  Yonsei U) 

719
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,060
Did Teacher Cheon really show her ability?

720
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,620
I've definitely decided the path I will follow.

721
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,770
Until my Je Ni gets into Seoul National University of Music, unconditionally, to Teacher Cheon,

722
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:58,970
I'll be loyal.

723
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:04,070
Me too! It's not like she had an affair with my husband. I'll just close my eyes this once and forget it.

724
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,560
Loyalty!

725
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,990
Loyalty!

726
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,900
Director.

727
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:14,410
Ha Eun Byeol earned first place on the practical test by overwhelmingly better skills.

728
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,390
I gave special consideration to the children you mentioned.

729
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,510
Well done.

730
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,590
What about Bae Ro Na?

731
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:31,780
Bae Rona placed last.

732
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:39,490
- Teacher Ma, the kids are looking so you don't have to go that far. 
- No.

733
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,860
I didn't give her the worst grades intentionally.

734
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,560
I don't know what she ate wrong, but she sang out of tune.

735
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,660
Out of tune?

736
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,620
I don't know why the child who worked like she was possessed by a devil for a test

737
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:53,740
made such a mistake.

738
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,900
All right.  I appreciate her failing on her own.

739
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,600
Bae Ro Na.

740
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,820
- I heard. You received the worst grades? 
 - Yes.

741
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,400
I have no interest in what happened with you.

742
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,620
But I can't forgive you for not preparing for the exams and ruining the learning environment.

743
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,670
It could have a bad influence on the other kids.

744
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,660
  Dropout Letter    

745
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:27,590
That's why I'm going to dropout of this school.

746
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,460
What?

747
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,400
You were right.

748
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,580
Cheong Ah Arts School never suited someone like me from the start.

749
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,030
I'll get lost now.

750
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,490
Did you discuss this with your mom?

751
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:55,120
You need  a guardian's consent.

752
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,720
I'll tell her soon.

753
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,590
I'm sorry for being unfortunate to you.

754
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:23,700
 I was not qualified for Cheong Arts School from the start. 

755
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,830
 I'm a liar, I'm violent, 

756
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,760
  and because of my twisted personality,    

757
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,580
  school life is impossible, and I'll only cause harm to my classmates.    

758
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:39,430
  I decided that I cannot  continue my studies at Cheong Ah Arts School, and would like to leave the school.    

759
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:44,130
  I hereby submit my dropout application. Bae Ro Na.    

760
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:31,500
I have something to ask you.

761
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,430
How did you find out that I was Seol Ah's mother?

762
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:41,890
I heard from Director Min Hyeong Sik of Hope Orphanage.

763
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:46,120
I went to see him at the detention center before he died.

764
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,360
I haven't forgiven you.

765
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,550
I'm just holding back for a little while for my Seol Ah's sake.

766
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,920
Don't misunderstand.

767
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,100
I understand.  For now, let's deal with our common enemy.

768
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,100
What's next after that?

769
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:16,390
If you planned the fountain show, there should be a next move.

770
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,210
Do you think Ju Dan Tae is easy?

771
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,040
Of course not.

772
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,390
I will soon join hands with Chairman Ju on the Myeong-dong parcel of land.

773
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:34,950
From now on, do all your dealings with Ju Dan Tae through Oh Yun Hui.

774
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,870
Oh Yun Hui?

775
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,840
Oh Yun Hui is my person.

776
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,420
This is the list of everyone who visited Hera Palace on the day of the party.

777
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,430
Any suspicious persons?

778
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,850
There hasn't been any special person so far.

779
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,280
Does it make sense that there's no one?!

780
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,720
Then, does that mean the mannequin fall into the air on its own?

781
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,390
Identify all visitors on the list of visitors from the prior week.  Identify even the least significant.

782
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:07,420
Yes, Chairman.

783
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,550
I will ferret him out.  That rat!

784
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,110
Chairman Ju, Chairman Ju.

785
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,690
I've found him. Gyu Jin has found him.

786
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:19,120
After combing through the lobby CCTV,

787
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,900
I found out the face of the guy who stole the phone was caught on camera.

788
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,170
Who is that b*stard?

789
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,380
In the lobby, he was wearing a mask so you couldn't see him,

790
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,120
but his face was clearly caught on the CCTV from outside the building.

791
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:36,060
But that's a wow! It's a face you also know.

792
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,620
Gu Ho Dong this punk why—

793
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,340
He definitely has a connection to Min Seol Ah.

794
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,790
He must also be the one who put up the mannequin show.

795
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,870
  Spare me, please spare me.    

796
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:33,530

 The Penthouse: War in Life 

798
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,540
 Let's end it. I'll do what you want. 

799
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,340
  The most amazing thing has happened in my life.    

800
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,590
 Giving up the house and the right of custody of Eun Byeol 

801
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,950
  Bae Ro Na's stepdad!    

802
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,020
  I'm not going to school anymore.    

803
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,190
  Cancel the dropout application.    

804
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,370
  I'll process the dropout application right away.    

805
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,120
  Don't go.    

806
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,260
  On the night Min Seol Ah died    

807
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,430
  I wasn't quiet because I didn't know.    

808
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,310
  I think the culprit of the mannequin case will be caught soon.    

809
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,260
  Who is it?    

810
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,020
  You knew Min Seol Ah, right?
