00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,400
 Cheong Ah Arts School 2020 Matriculation Ceremony 

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,960
Pledge!  We solemnly swear as proud freshmen of Cheong Ah Arts School

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,780
to do our duty by obeying school rules and devoting ourselves to our studies.

4
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,240
To always display respect, honor, good faith,

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,050
and pride as members of Cheong Ah.

6
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,100
Pledged March 2, 2020, Representatives of Freshman Class, Ju Seok Hun

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,710
and Ju Seok Gyeong.

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:18,290


9
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,900
And now we will have a performance from the incoming students of the Vocal Arts Department.

10
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,430
You cannot enter after the concert begins.

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,580
- Out of my way. 
 - You cannot.

12
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,730
I am the soloist in this concert. I have to go inside.

13
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,040
You cannot, I told you!

14
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,580
Why is Eun Byeol standing in the center?

15
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,740
I know, wasn't the solo supposed to be sung by some kid named Bae Ro Na?

16
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,600
She was number one on the waiting list.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,250
Dr. Ha, what's going on?

18
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,170
I have no idea.  I haven't heard anything.

19
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,260
Eun Byeol's name is not in the program.

20
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,350
Maybe this Bae Ro Na caused trouble or something?

21
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,740
 I came to get the dress for Ju Seok Gyeong. 

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,860
 Yes, it's finished. 

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,540
 - Do you like it?
 - Yes. 

24
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,800
 Please wrap it. 

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,410
 Aren't you upset 

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,860
 that Seok Gyeong can't sing the solo due to her cold? 

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,880
 Yes, her cold is so severe. She's very upset, too. 

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,860
 So Eun Byeol is doing the solo, huh? 

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,390
 Pardon? 

30
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,050
 This is the dress that Eun Byeol's mother wore for her performance at the Seoul National University of Music. 

31
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,820
 She had it specially altered. 

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,860
 She said Eun Byeol will wear it at the matriculation ceremony. 

33
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,360
She's asking to go in!

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,470
Oh, really!

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,090
- Run. 
 - Get them!

36
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,750
♪ Die Lerche in blaue Höh entschwebt,

37

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,600
Mom!

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,940
Ro Na, are you alright?

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,150
No way.

43
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,850
- That's my spot, Mom. 
 - It's okay. It's okay.

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,200
Hold it in.  If you mess up the ceremony, things will get worse.

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,570
 Restore the  reputation of the school which you tarnished. 

46
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,300
 If you can't, I will give Cheong Ah Foundation for the Arts to your sister. 

47
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,610
 If her husband's chaebol family helps her out, it will be easier to operate the Foundation. 

48
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,860
 What are you saying? 

49
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,990
 You promised me that the school was mine. 

50
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,560
 Have you forgotten how Eun Byeol shamed our family? 

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,790
 Not to mention, she can't even sing the solo at the matriculation ceremony. 

52
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,360
 All the famous vocalists will be attending. What an embarrassment. 

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,540
 The granddaughter of the school's director is just a lady-in-waiting on stage? 

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,260
 Is this how I raised you? 

55
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,010
 Please give me one more chance. This time, 

56
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,370
 I will make sure not to disappoint you. 

57
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,240
 I know I should discuss your children with their mother, 
   

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,870
 but I thought it would be faster to discuss this with you, Chairman Ju. 

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,130
 What is this? 

60
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,500
 Seok Hun's and Seok Gyeong's answer sheets for the placement test. 

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,140
 As you can see, their right and wrong answers perfectly match. 

62
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,470
 And for their written answers, the handwriting is the same. 

63
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,350
 I'm sure you realize what this means? 

64
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,430
 Thanks for telling me about this first. I will speak to my children so they understand. 

65
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,370
 I don't intend to make a big issue out of this, 

66
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,930
 but it is too serious to just let it go. 

67
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,160
 So what is it that you want? 

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,810
 I can't allow a student who engaged in fraudulent behavior, which I have witnessed, 

69
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
 stand on the matriculation ceremony stage. 

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,790
 So you want Seok Gyeong to give up performing the solo? 

71
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,990
 So there won't be any rumors, you better find a plausible reason. 

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,690
 How about having her suffer 

73
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,670
 a serious cold? 

74
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,230
 Seok Gyeong, your cold has gotten worse. 

75
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,510
 Tomorrow is the matriculation ceremony. You cannot sing the solo. 

76
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,690
 You better go to the hospital. 

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,710
Bravo!

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,650
Milky skin Yu Je Ni!  I love you Yu Je Ni!

79
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,020
Whom does our Min Hyeok take after, that he is so attractively tall?

80
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,350
Whose son is he?  He is so handsome!s

81
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,020
But how does she sing so well? Like she practiced until her throat bled?

82
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,040
Someone might think that was her spot, originally.

83
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,750
Head of the Arts Department, Teacher Cheon Seo Jin, will address the parents with the closing remarks.

84
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,410
Good evening, I'm Cheol Seo Jin, Head of the Arts Department of Cheong Ah Arts School.

85
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,840
Cheong Ah Arts School with a 50-year tradition has been the cradle for Seoul National University admissions.

86
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,090
And at its center is the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

87
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,760
The Cheong Ah Arts Festival, comprised of music, art, and dance,

88
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,060
had served as the driving force in providing countless world-renowned artists.

89
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,590
But regrettably, 25 years ago,

90
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,020
due to an unfortunate incident, caused by cut-throat competition,

91
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,450
our festival was abolished.

92
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,730
I intend to revive that Cheong Ah Arts Festival tonight.

93
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,580
Up to now, every recipient of this trophy

94
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,230
has matriculated to Seoul National University at the top of their class

95
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,600
and their careers have been expectedly brilliant.

96
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,970
In the future, the revived festival will be expanded

97
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,110
from participation just for the senior class to participation for all classes.

98
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,730
An equal opportunity, a fair process,

99
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,250
and infinite glory await all of you!

100
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,190
If this happens, won't the Head of the Arts Department's voice be stronger in the future?

101
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,190
Teacher Cheon has now become

102
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,760
a "golden rope" (of opportunity) from heaven.

103
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,510
I guess maybe I was too harsh toward her?

104
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,290
I don't know about anything else, but I do know that you've won disfavor from her, Je Ni's mom.

105
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,930
"Bella voce"... 
   Beautiful voice in Italian 

106
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,100
You've worked hard. The matriculation ceremony was amazing.

107
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm sure you feel satisfied after having prepared for so long.

108
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,880
Of course, it is thanks to all the parents who have helped me with one heart. I thank you.

109
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,010
Eun Byeol's solo performance was perfect.

110
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,990
I'm sure that it left a strong impression among the attendees.

111
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,790
I congratulate you.

112
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,060
 The more I see you 

113
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,960
 the more attractive as a woman you become. 

114
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,580
 Thank you for simply accepting this. 

115
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,680
 Then, is our deal now complete? 

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,360
 I will let Seok Gyeong know that she should give up on the solo for the matriculation ceremony. 

117
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
 Oh, and 

118
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,800
 let's put an end to our relationship now, as well. 

119
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,390
 It's been fun. 

120
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,950
 That crazy jerk... Crazy jerk. 

121
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,650
Seok Hun's piano performance today was excellent as well.

122
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,150
From now on I'll rely on you a lot as the Chairman of the Cheong Ah Arts School Steering Committee, Seok Hun's father.

123
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,100
I will do my best.

124
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,930
Let's go now.

125
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,870
Bae Ro Na.

126
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,050
Come see me now.

127
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,370
Community service and ten demerits?

128
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,060
I was in an accident.

129
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,950
I would have come on time, but because I got into a car accident—

130
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,880
A performance is a promise to the audience. Don't you know punctuality is fundamental?

131
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,320
I can't handle business according to personal situations.  I disposed of it according to school regulations.

132
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,750
- You can't enter. 
 - I said I just need a minute!

133
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,600
Why do you think Ro Na was late?

134
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,700
Mom.

135
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,440
Don't you know the reason better than anyone?

136
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,650
What are you throwing a fit about now?

137
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,050
A car was following ours persistently ever since we left home.

138
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,890
 It stuck close to me every time I changed lanes. 

139
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,310
 In the end, that car crashed into our car at the intersection. 

140
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,650
 That accident was the reason my Ro Na was late. 

141
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,050
And your daughter Eun Byeol was standing on stage in her place.

142
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,410
Was all of this really a coincidence?

143
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,920
Not something you planned?

144
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,680
You sure have a wild imagination.

145
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,470
Indeed,

146
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,270
people do not change.

147
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,330
I'm the one who should be angry.

148
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,660
Because of your daughter, the matriculation concert that we had prepared two months for was almost ruined.

149
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,690
No, she would never have ruined it.

150
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,230
Because it had already been decided that your daughter was going to sing the solo.

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,510
Listen well, Cheon Seo Jin.

152
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,310
When Teacher Ma Du Gi made Ro Na study German songs for the admissions test,

153
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,680
when Ro Na wasn't accepted to Cheong Ah Arts School,

154
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,450
and when you tried to get Ro Na's acceptance rescinded at the PTA meeting,

155
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,990
I know that you were responsible for all of it.

156
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,900
It's not that I let you do that to me because I didn't know.

157
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,940
But that I knew everything and just let it happen.

158
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,900
Because I don't... have any power now.

159
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,090
My decision will not change because you throw a stubborn fit.

160
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:40,120
If you persist, I'll charge her with disobeying a teacher and add more demerits.

161
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,700
Please don't do that. I already have 10 demerits and school just started.

162
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,400
Mom, please stop it.

163
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,510
Sure, that little power you have...

164
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,420
make use of it to your heart's content.

165
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,510
But don't forget. If you mess with my daughter,

166
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,090
your own daughter will cry tears of blood.

167
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,410
I don't know what you mean but do your best.

168
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,210
Did you call us?

169
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,580
Father?

170
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,250
You've come.

171
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,310
Seok Gyeong, you said you wanted to study abroad?

172
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,060
If that is your fondest wish, of course, you should go.

173
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,990
Really?

174
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,170
You're really letting me go?

175
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm so happy.

176
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,040
But you will be going alone.

177
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,090
What... do you mean?

178
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,610
You cannot continue to live in your oppa's shadow.

179
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,940
You received your school grades by depending on your oppa.

180
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,990
How can your oppa continue to be harmed?

181
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,820
No, I can't let Seok Gyeong go by herself.

182
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,360
I did it because I wanted good grades.

183
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,950
I wanted you to think well of me,

184
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,450
but I wasn't confident about my studying. That's why I did it.

185
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,600
Then you should have not gotten caught!

186
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,590
This is tiresome. I would prefer not to discuss this further.

187
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,430
Please take your plane ticket and get lost.

188
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,530
If you've crushed your father's pride that much, you should have been prepared for at least this much consequence.

189
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,480
I've done wrong.

190
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,780
I was wrong and I promise I will never do it again!

191
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,120
In the future, I will live the life that you want for me, Dad!

192
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,100
There is no need for that.

193
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,550
If you want to be the shame of this family, I think it would be best if we just did not have to see each other.

194
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,020
Please no. I cannot be parted from Oppa.

195
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,200
If you will send Seok Gyeong away, please send me, too.

196
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,610
I will take care of Seok Gyeong and make sure that she studies.

197
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,080
She cannot be alone.

198
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,460
She can't even sleep when there's thunder at night. How can we send her abroad alone?

199
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,720
This is why I am separating you two!

200
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,560
You keep disappointing me because of Seok Gyeong's problems!

201
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,870
Please come to your senses. You, Ju Seok Hun, are not Ju Seok Gyeong's oppa,

202
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,330
but you are Ju Dan Tae's son!

203
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,890
Come in!

204
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,710
The preparations are done, Chairman.

205
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,230
Secretary Jo will take you to the airport. Take her now.

206
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,410
Oppa... Oppa...

207
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,340
Oppa! No!

208
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,170
Oppa! No! No!

209
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,800
Are you alright, Seok Hun?

210
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,720
Please let her go right now. Let go!

211
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,840
What are you doing?

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,980
She cheated on a test. If she did wrong, she needs to be punished.

213
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,640
Of course, but not like this.

214
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,440
This isn't your concern. This is between me and my children.

215
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,300
They are also my children!

216
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,440
You are the one who pressured them into making these wrong choices.

217
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,670
So don't just blame them.

218
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,570
And I will not send Seok Gyeong abroad.

219
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,830
I will educate her and discipline her properly at home.

220
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,780
If you still insist on sending her, I will go with her.

221
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,780
Are you threatening me?

222
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,540
You? To me?

223
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,940
I will study hard from now. I promise, Dad.

224
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,560
How can I trust you?

225
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,110
- Will that trophy be enough? 
 - What?

226
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,640
The Cheong Ah Arts Festival trophy.

227
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,080
- I will make sure to earn that. 
  - And how will you do that?

228
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,100
Is Ha Eun Byeol just going to give up and play around?

229
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,960
I can beat Ha Eun Byeol.

230
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,150
If I fail... then I will leave alone.

231
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,810
- Seok Gyeong! 
  - Don't worry.

232
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,530
I will make sure I get that trophy in my hands.

233
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,980
I will never let anyone else have it. I can do it, oppa.

234
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,670
Trust in me.

235
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,840
Please give Seok Gyeong one more chance, honey, I request you.

236
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,740
How dare you coddle this delinquent. This is my decision to make as her father!

237
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
You are too worked up right now.

238
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,630
If you must continue to say hurtful things to the children, I think you should be alone right now.

239
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,760
Let's go.

240
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,130
What are you doing right now? How dare you leave!

241
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,270
Min Seol Ah.

242
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,450
Father, did you kill her?

243
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,890
What nonsense are you babbling?

244
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,300
Min Seol Ah was in the machine room at Hera Palace that evening.

245
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,290
- I know about that. 
  - Ju Seok Hun.

246
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,910
Please stop tormenting my little sister.

247
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,590
I won't stand for it anymore.

248
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,920
Hey, Ahjumma.

249
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,730
We haven't received our interest yet.

250
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,000
When will you pay the principal and the interest?

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,700
I said I will deposit the money soon.

252
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,250
I didn't get my paycheck yet.

253
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,600
It's only a few days late, why are you coming to my home already?

254
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,570
You must not know that this is an illegal method of debt collecting.

255
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,720
Illegal? Hmm?

256
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,590
Illegal.

257
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,250
This is why we shouldn't lend money to people like this. Aigoo! Someone is dying here.

258
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,350
When you borrowed it, you were so desperate.  You didn't know how scary other people's money is.

259
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,440
Korea is such a great place to live, right?

260
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,510
Someone is dying!

261
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,940
Better not be late.

262
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,530
If you don't pay the principal within this week, I don't know what might happen.

263
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,360
Yes.

264
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,750
Mom, what is this?

265
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,760
Are we moving to Bosong Village?

266
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,590
Is this why you got a loan from a loan shark?

267
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,580
Where did you find this?

268
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,550
Why Bosong Village, of all places?

269
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,810
I hate that place. That is where Min Seol Ah died.

270
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,010
By chance... it's not the unit she used to live in, is it?

271
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,790
Hurry and tell me that it's not.

272
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,400
Well...

273
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,740
what's wrong with that, anyway?

274
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,620
What do you mean what's wrong? Are you crazy?

275
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,520
Why do you keep getting involved with her?

276
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,880
Because of some girl I've never even seen before,

277
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,000
I almost became an outcast at school.

278
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,770
And I almost got my admission canceled, too.

279
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,750
But you want me to move into that apartment?

280
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,150
What were you thinking when you bought that place?

281
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,700
I will not move there. I will never!

282
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,730
It's not like that, Ro Na.

283
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,390
The truth is, that place will be redeveloped if we wait just a little while.

284
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,560
Then the price of our house is going to rise really high.

285
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,590
Even if that happens, I don't like it!

286
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,730
I will never move in there even if I die.

287
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,440
Are you thinking that nothing has happened to me?

288
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,810
What did I do so wrong to you, Mom?

289
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,300
If you want to move there, go by yourself!

290
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,970
Ro Na.

291
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,170
Ro Na!

292
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,530
Grandpa praised me today.

293
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,440
Grandpa told me that my singing was great.

294
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,920
You've been a filial granddaughter. Good job.

295
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,540
It's too early for praise.

296
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,710
She just made up for a few of the mistakes she made.

297
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,330
Eun Byeol, you're not satisfied with just that much, are you?

298
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,320
What is your next goal?

299
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,000
Of course, the Cheong Ah trophy.

300
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,590
If I get the trophy, then Mom will finally praise me, I hope?

301
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,150
Eun Byeol, do you want Dad to grant you a wish to celebrate your matriculation concert?

302
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,360
Is there anything you want?

303
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,130
- Yes. 
 - What is it?

304
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,000
Dad, could you get along better with Mom?

305
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,300
What's wrong with Mom and Dad? We get along fine.

306
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,430
Don't lie. I know that you two fight all the time.

307
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,060
My wish is for you two to get along well and not fight.

308
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,490
Like you did before.

309
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,270
So you'll grant my wish, right, Dad?

310
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,330
Dad.

311
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,300
Good job today.

312
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,070
Useless words.

313
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,390
Are you bored?

314
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,030
No, but...

315
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,810
What are you doing tonight?

316
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,720
Shall we eat out tonight?  Just the two of us?

317
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,370
Eun Byeol wants to rest because she's tired.

318
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,870
I'll treat you to something delicious because you worked so hard.

319
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,010
I'm giving a lesson tonight.  It'll be finished at 9.

320
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,150
Oh, really? Then, let's go after that.

321
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,820
How about a cocktail? That's okay, right?

322
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,350
I will make a reservation wherever you want.

323
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,490
- Nice shot! 
 - Go.

324
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,000
 #1 Ju Dan Tae/ #2 Ha Yun Cheol/ #3 Lee Gyu Jin 

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,490
Go.

326
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,210
Go.

327
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,560
Go.

328
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Chairman Ju, you were completely off today.

329
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,220
There's no way Chairman Ju can be first all the time.

330
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,830
My condition wasn't up to par today.

331
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,010
Since you came in first place today, brief us on what we must do today.

332
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,620
Should I?

333
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,250
Not long ago, at my law firm— Damn that loser!

334
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,110
I have to work with a loser new lawyer.

335
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,710
How bad a loser could that be?  A lawyer needs to pay attention to a new lawyer?

336
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,260
He must be a real loser.

337
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,700
Recently that guy has become totally infatuated with a woman.

338
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,170
I see your taste overlaps.

339
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,490
- What?  How do you know? 
 - He's the one who should die, that jerk.

340
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,620
We have to show him properly.

341
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,050
Stop him from coveting someone else's item.

342
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,710
Good.

343
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,150
What is it?

344
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,740
If you see her again in the future, you will die!

345
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,580
Yes.

346
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,250
- This is for your diapers. 
 - Bye.

347
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,950
Chairman Ju, is something really wrong today? I think your mood wasn't good

348
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,860
Since we all have time, let's all have a drink.

349
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,580
Sorry, I have a prior engagement.  I'll leave first.

350
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,740
So late? Why?  With whom?

351
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,690
- Are you seeing your first love? 
 - What are you talking about?

352
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,450
- I have an appointment with my wife. 
 - With Teacher Cheon?

353
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,750
I guess the mood must be nice nowadays for you two.

354
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:41,950
Were we ever a couple which didn't get along?  I'm leaving. Then...

355
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,550
- Yes.  I'm leaving now. 
 - It's me. Shall we meet?

356
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,850
 I'm waiting.  I love you. 

357
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,950
 Dad made an urgent call. I don't think I can make it.  See you at home. 

358
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,150
Yes, Father-in-law.  This is son-in-law Ha.  Did you get home safely?

359
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,250
 No.  I didn't leave work yet. 

360
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,630
Oh, yes.  You worked hard today.

361
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,170
Seo Jin worked very hard.

362
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,440
On a good day like today, why don't you two go out together?

363
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,610
Yes, Father-in-law. We'll do that.

364
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,420
Have a nice evening.

365
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,080
I'll be a little late.  Something came up at work.

366
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,770
Don't wait up for me.

367
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,950
You're rude, Ju Dan Tae.

368
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,940
You broke up a relationship as you pleased,

369
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,510
but you summon a person like this.

370
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,330
Aren't you here because you also feel something?

371
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,050
Don't misunderstand. I came to warn you.

372
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,110
I realized today.

373
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,710
What kind of woman Cheon Seo Jin, the woman I like, is.

374
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,640
She is an attractive woman who takes whatever she wants and does everything she wants to do.

375
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,370
With you in front of me, I become the person most like myself.

376
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,250
That's good. Because I don't have to be someone else.

377
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,830
I don't really need a man,

378
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,280
because I am confident on my own.

379
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,400
I have no complaints living with a husband like everyone else has

380
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,750
to satisfy convention. 
 - Don't lie.

381
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:25,650
You're the kind of woman that is never satisfied with that dummy, Ha Yun Cheol.

382
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,130
You know you need me.

383
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,830
So, now,

384
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,230
don't miss the boat.

385
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,820
I'll be the one to end our relationship.

386
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,470
I will decide both meeting and breaking up, everything.

387
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,380
So, don't mess around, Ju Dan Tae!

388
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,330
 (Mobile Tracking App)  Name:  Ju Dan Tae 
  Phone number: 010-0213-5400 

389
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,650
 Ju Dan Tae / 111 JDT Villas, Mount Namha Street, Miseo Town, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Province, 30 km 

390
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:33,450
 Ceremony for the Completion of 2nd Jakomo Factory 
  April 11, 1989 

391
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,540
I have a confession to make.

392
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,150
What is it?

393
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,000
Saying those words

394
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,230
were a first since I was born.

395
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,990
Saying "I love you."

396
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,680
I also have a confession to make.

397
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,420
Today, we are breaking our rules.

398
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,670
I mean the rule that we must mutually end it

399
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:26,310
without tying each other down, without being emotional, if it is over for one of us.

400
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,890
You're the first to make me break a rule.

401
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,740
Dad, please change the tutor.

402
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,960
A different teacher from Eun Byeol's and the best one.

403
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,990
That is something a mom would do.   I'll look into it.

404
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,220
Seok Gyeong is saying she's resolved to study so of course, I should do that.

405
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,820
I'm going to school.

406
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,960
We'll be back.

407
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,270
Have a safe trip.

408
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,770
From now on, please let me handle the children.

409
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,480
It's a sensitive time for the kids and if you push them too hard, they will fall apart.

410
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,330
I will pay more attention to them while soothing them.

411
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,930
I need your consent.

412
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,130
I'm going to take charge now of the furniture business my mother used to run.

413
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,550
Now?  Why?

414
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,940
It's hard for me to fill my time since Hye In died.

415
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,020
It's been run well with the professional manager up to now.

416
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,030
All of a sudden, you're going to work?

417
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,130
It's the business my mother had put so much effort into all of her life.

418
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't want to put it into someone else's hands anymore.

419
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,000
Let me do it, honey. I'll make sure it causes you no harm.

420
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,760
What's gotten into you today?

421
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,750
You'll agree, won't you?

422
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,880
Hurry and eat. I'll get your clothing ready.

423
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,430
I bought you a new shirt. You will like it.

424
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,100
Stand in line.  Put your bags in front.

425
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,290
What should I do?

426
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,040
If I am tardy, I'm going to get another penalty point.

427
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,890
Are you late too?

428
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
Ju Seok Hun?

429
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,940
- Climb up. 
 - What?

430
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,990
Step on it and climb up.  Are you really going to be late on the first day of school?

431
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,610
Then, excuse me.

432
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,410
Hey, my bag. Please.

433
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,160
Thank you.

434
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,640
You, too, come over.

435
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,100
Hey! Ju Seok Hun, what are you doing? Hurry over.

436
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,500
Ha Eun Byeol!  Your video is already uploaded to the internet.  You were beautiful yesterday.

437
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,950
 That dress was a Vera Wang, right? 

438
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,700
My mother wore it at the Seoul University School of Music graduation ceremony. It was altered for me.

439
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,370
I knew it!  It looked so expensive.

440
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,740
Hey, Wait List #1.

441
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,830
Wait List #1, why are you always so late?

442
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,510
Tell me the truth.  Actually, you didn't come last night because you had stage fright.

443
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,060
Did you suddenly fall apart thinking of going on the big stage?

444
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,540
Move.

445
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,230
True

446
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,720
or false?

447
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,450
Was there really a traffic accident?

448
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,050
But why are you so well-looking?

449
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,670
Believe as you please.

450
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,700
This little...

451
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,280
Speak honestly.

452
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,300
Are you angry that #1 on the waiting list was going to perform solo

453
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,830
or are you angry that the talent of the #1 on the waiting list was better than yours?

454
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,190
 Speak honestly. Are you mad because you were taught by an orphan like me 

455
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,520
 or because you lost to me? 

456
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,200
Is that why you're behaving like a little kid on the first day of school?

457
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,380
I pity you.

458
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,670
 I pity you. I pity you and feel sad for you. 

459
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,710
Watch what you say. Who are you to pity us?

460
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,430
You are the ones who should watch what you say.

461
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,540
- This seat is taken. 
 - Is that so?

462
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,110
These too.

463
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,200
Sit over here. The one next to me is empty.

464
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,120
Thank you.

465
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,820
Who has time today?

466
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,990
What's happening?

467
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,960
My mom is throwing a party. Let's go to my house after school.

468
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,200
- I'm coming. 
 - Can I come too?

469
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,150
What are you asking?  Everyone is invited except one person.

470
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,660
Then everyone will come except for one.

471
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,230
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong, will you come?

472
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,680
Sorry, I can't go.

473
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,610
- Ro Na. Would you like to come to our house today? 
 - Me?

474
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,980
Yeah, you.  Let's study together.

475
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,900
What? What's with this best friend mode? Since when have you been friends?

476
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,180
Starting now.

477
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,080
You're coming, right?  Then I'm going home too.

478
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,950
Everybody take your seat.

479
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,740
 I am Ma Du Gi, your homeroom teacher for this year. 

480
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,640
 My subject is vocal music. 

481
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,440
Ma Du Gi?

482
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,600
 Didn't you see Cheong Ah High's notice? The change of entrance exam requirements? 

483
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,480
 Didn't you know they added a German song starting this year? 

484
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,640
 What is it? Teacher isn't answering his phone? 

485
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,330
  We were deceived. I don't think there ever was any requirement to sing a German song. 

486
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,770
Teacher.

487
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,080
Oh, Bae Ro Na. What is it?

488
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,490
Don't you have something to say to me?

489
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,510
Hmm... Say what?

490
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,740
Shouldn't you apologize at the very least?

491
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,640
You deliberately had me practice German songs for the entrance exam.

492
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,410
Oh... I did.  I must have been mistaken. I'm sorry.

493
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,880
Anyway, you're here. Isn't that enough? See you later.

494
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,240
Who asked you to do that? Was it Teacher Cheon Seo Jin?

495
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,290
So as payment were you hired here?

496
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,020
You're cheeky.  You'd better refrain from saying such dangerous things.

497
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,610
For the sake of your school life in the future.  Work hard.

498
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,770
 I'll kill you if you thoughtlessly say anything about my mom. 

499
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,600
I haven't said... anything wrong.

500
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,590
Don't speak recklessly without proof!

501
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,730
- Do you want to go to the police station again? 
 - What?

502
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:28,120
Hey #1 Wait List. Did you see this?

503
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,670
You've become a star from Day 1.

504
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,480
Bae Ro Na.  Freshman in the Voice Department.  10 hours of community service and ten demerits.

505
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,640
She's going to be very busy. Doing all that community service.

506
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,850
Good for you, #1 Wait List, making sure you don't have miscellaneous thoughts.

507
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,500
A real Wait List is...

508
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,150
It's not me.  Isn't it Ha Eun Byeol?

509
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,660
What are you saying?

510
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,920
What is it?  Did I say something wrong?

511
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,100
You stole my solo performance for the matriculation ceremony.

512
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,790
If that is not so, say it.

513
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:15,130
T... H... E... I... F.

514
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,080
It's going to be accomplished more easily than I thought.

515
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,330
 - Ahjusshi, stop the car. 
  - Why? 

516
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,660
 I have an idea.  A good idea. 

517
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,800
 Can you seduce that #1 Wait List?  I want to infuriate that bitch, Eun Byeol. 

518
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,640
 What a ridiculous thing to say. 

519
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,330
 If you treat that kind of girl nicely, she will fall for you easily. 

520
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,400
  I want to use her to shake Ha Eun Byeol's mentality.  You know Ha Eun Byeol likes you. 

521
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,090
 Forget it. I don't want to get involved with such a girl. 

522
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,870
 I'm begging you, oppa. I really want to beat Ha Eun Byeol.   

523
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,720
 I don't want to. Don't even bring it up again. 

524
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,620
 Will you be okay if I die? 

525
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,640
The more I see Bae Ro Na, the more I like her.

526
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,430
What are you doing?  Ha Eun Byeol!  Bae Ro Na! Aren't you stopping?

527
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,340
What are you doing as soon as you enter the school?

528
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,320
One penalty point for each of you.

529
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,030
That's not fair.  Ha Eun Byeol started it.

530
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:51,000
No.  Bae Ro Na swore at me first.  She called me a damn thief.

531
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,290
 Phony winner, Cheon Seo Jin. 

532
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:00,510
 Damn T... H I E F. 

533
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:06,880
 Did you really say that? You speak so crudely at school? 

534
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,070
Eun Byeol, blood!

535
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,530
- No. No. 
 - Je Ni, take her to nurse, room 6.

536
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,120
- Let's go. 
 - Are you okay?

537
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,370
Bae Ro Na, did you forget that you are on probation?

538
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,830
If there is always so much noise around you, perhaps the problem is you.

539
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,940
If you struggled so hard to get into Cheong Ah Arts School, then become someone worthy of Cheong Ah.

540
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,430
If you don't have the confidence to do that, you can quit today.

541
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,380
Why should I quit? What did I do wrong?

542
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,680
So you don't have any remorse, do you?

543
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,630
Three demerits and five more hours of community service.

544
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,480
Teacher!

545
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,160
Five demerits and ten more hours of community service.

546
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,210
Don't you hear the bell?

547
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,590
Everyone return to your classrooms. Now!

548
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,170
   
 Time: 1:34...00:06...00:14  

549
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,470
 Why are you so startled? 

550
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,250
 Where have you been at this late time? 

551
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,860
 I had a late lesson, so I was in the lesson room. 

552
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,610
 Dad made an urgent call. I don't think I can make it.  See you at home. 

553
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,000
 On a good day like today, why don't you two go out together? 

554
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,630
Doctor, the bleeding is serious!

555
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,140
The blood pressure keeps dropping.

556
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,950
- Increase oxygenation to maximum. 
 - Yes, I got it.

557
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,630
Increase the flow volume. Add more Phenytoin.

558
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,360
Clamp.

559
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,370
 Unknown Number 

560
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:33,590
 Your wife was at someone else's country villa last night. 

561
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,290
I think it'll be better if we use the same color

562
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,960
as that one.

563
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,150
After she stopped by the factory,  she's been in the showroom until now.

564
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,630
She didn't engage in any other notable activities.

565
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:09,970
 Sim Su Ryeon, just what are you thinking? 

566
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:13,940
Make sure to report to me any suspicious activity. Don't miss anything.

567
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,130
Yes, Chairman.

568
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,010
And this...

569
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,870
It's a forensic copy of the late Yun Tae Ju's notebook.

570
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,020
Got it. You can go now.

571
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,600
 Hope Orphanage Sponsors Event 

572
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,410
Min Seol Ah?

573
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,830
Why would he have a photo of her?

574
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,700
 Hope Orphanage 

575
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,360
This child gives me the creeps.

576
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,650
 How about talking now? 

577
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,410
 How long are you going to hold out? Where is your phone? 

578
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,250
 Seeing your expression, Ahjussi, makes me not want to give it to you even more. 

579
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:07,960
 Even if you die in this machine room, 

580
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,360
 no one would be interested at all. 

581
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,300
 Tomorrow, there might be one line in the news about it. 

582
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,080
 A 17-year-old orphan from Bosong Village was depressed about her life 

583
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,500
 and ended her own life. 

584
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,400
 The police who searched the home of the deceased 

585
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,910
 found a suicide note in which she expressed a big grudge against the world. 

586
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,900
 Before her death, the deceased was engaged in disguising herself as a college student 

587
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,120
 and scamming others. And when that fact was discovered, 

588
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,350
 she was driven into a predicament. 

589
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,780
 How about it? 

590
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,130
 Wasn't that convincing? 

591
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,110
 Do you think I came all this way without arranging some safeguards? 

592
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,800
 I have someone who will help me. 

593
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,940
 If something happens to me, my oppa will come to find you and will not leave you alone. 

594
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,080
 Oh, so you have an oppa from the orphanage or something? 

595
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,130
You shouldn't have acted up, should you?

596
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,370
 JAKOMO 

597
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,910
- Oh, hello, Eonni. Imagine seeing you here.
 - Oh my.

598
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,510
What brings you here? Are you shopping for furniture, too?

599
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,590
I guess she has a discerning eye because she was an art major.

600
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,890
This showroom is a 'hot place' for chaebol wives these days.

601
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,910
Actually, this company was... founded by my mother.

602
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,260
What? This belongs to your parents?

603
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:06,020
Wait, so you were the daughter of Simwun Construction?

604
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,770
Simwun, one of the top 30th richest companies in the world?

605
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,430
Oh my, we had no idea.

606
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:17,140
We never imagined that your family was so amazing, Su Ryeon.

607
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,230
Wow, your family is really wealthy.

608
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:30,110
Not really. We have enough to live, that's all.

609
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,760
What does your father do?

610
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,720
Well, he makes investments, and this and that. I actually don't really know.

611
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,950
Invite us to your home next time. I want to visit.

612
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,590
Sure.

613
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,160
Welcome. Your name was Ro Na?

614
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,560
Hello.

615
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,880
Stay for dinner. I don't know what you like, so I went ahead and decided on my own.

616
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,300
Thank you.

617
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,760
My room is that way. Go ahead and go in.

618
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,010
Oppa, can you help her?

619
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,990
Follow me.

620
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,940
Hello?

621
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,080
Who is this?

622
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,520
Yes, I am Ro Na's mom.

623
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,630
Who is this?

624
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,970
Welcome, Ro Na's mom. It's nice to see you.

625
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,260
Hello.

626
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,840
I didn't want to come empty-handed, so I bought some fruit.

627
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,740
You didn't have to.

628
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,310
Thank you, we will enjoy it.

629
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,460
Your home is so wonderful.

630
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:01,790
Thank you for inviting me.

631
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,350
How is your health? Were you injured?

632
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:11,130
I heard from Ro Na, that you both were in an accident on the day of the matriculation ceremony.

633
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,370
Yes, but fortunately, we're alright.

634
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,790
I heard that a car hit yours from behind suddenly.

635
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:20,220
Yes. That's why Ro Na couldn't make it on stage

636
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,550
and even received demerits.

637
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,850
It was all my fault.

638
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:28,120
How is that your fault, Ro Na's mom? Someone hit your car.

639
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,000
Thoroughly investigate your accident.

640
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,080
- And make sure to not easily settle with them.
 - Pardon?

641
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,760
Your child could have been seriously injured.

642
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,230
You must do absolutely everything to protect your child.

643
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,470
Because you are a mom.

644
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,500
A mom could even do evil if it is for her child's sake, isn't that true?

645
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,160
I'll call the Chancellor.

646
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,240
Hello, Teacher.

647
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,400
Ahjussi!

648
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,240
Yes, Madam?

649
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,250
What kind of job are you doing securing this place?

650
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,880
I believe I told you to pay attention to the 'blacklist' of who is allowed in here.

651
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,090
How can just anyone be wondering around in here?

652
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,190
Is our apartment building such a lax place?

653
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,450
We received invitations to be here, Teacher.

654
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,800
Please make sure to distinguish between the elevator for the residents and the elevator for the maids.

655
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,670
If you allow this to happen again, you will be held accountable.

656
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,400
Yes.

657
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,040
Ahjumma! How did you get back in here, anyway?

658
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,550
Are you determined to make us lose our jobs?

659
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,340
Get out now. Hurry!

660
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,970
Oh, alright.

661
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,500
We're leaving already.

662
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,970
Don't touch my daughter.

663
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,850
I told you, don't touch her.

664
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,420
Get out already!

665
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,790
Ah, please.  Don't push us!

666
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,810
Hurry get out!

667
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,160
I want to live in a place like this, too.

668
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,780
A place like Herapalace.

669
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,110
Mom will make that happen for you.

670
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:31,410
Even if I have to sell half of my heart,

671
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:35,970
I will make sure you can live here.

672
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,140
So no one can ever look down on you

673
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,500
and no one can take you lightly.

674
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,960
Then promise we won't move to Bosong Village.

675
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,060
We're moving tomorrow.

676
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,010
How can we not go now? We have to move out of our home tomorrow.

677
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,310
Mom, aren't you too much?

678
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,390
How can I go to school if my classmates find out?

679
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,480
I'm already having a hard enough time. Why are you doing this to me, Mom?

680
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,590
It's a place where people live.

681
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,790
We can't live in a rented house forever.

682
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:13,200
But this home belongs to us now even if it's shabby, and the values will rise.

683
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:17,570
You work in real estate, and you still don't know this?

684
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,870
That place will never rise in value.

685
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,250
And even if it does, I won't go there.

686
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,130
You're the one who caused trouble, why do I have to take responsibility for it, too?

687
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,570
I'm trying to improve our lives.

688
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,630
I'm not trying to give you a hard time. Would I do that?

689
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:35,830
Do you really not know how Mom feels?

690
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,740
I do not.

691
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,560
I hate you, Mom, and I hate Teacher Cheon Seo Jin, too. I hate everyone.

692
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,250
And my home and school life are both awful because of you, Mom!

693
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,880
Ro Na!

694
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,150
Ro Na.

695
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,610
Yes, Owner?

696
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,430
I'm the one who bought Unit 501 in Bosong Village.

697
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,140
Could I sell that unit?

698
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,970
I'm a bit desperate.

699
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,680
I'm sorry. Please sell it soon.

700
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,170
Yes, thank you.

701
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,620
Who is moving where?

702
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:54,420
What? That loser Oh Yun Hui is moving into the dead Min Seol Ah's home?

703
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,260
Why?

704
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,200
I heard it clearly from my husband.

705
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,020
That woman is really strange.

706
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,700
Doesn't that place give her the creeps?

707
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,870
It's making me shudder. I'm getting goosebumps.

708
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:13,340
That mother-and-daughter duo really are a couple of bad seeds.

709
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,670
Maybe those two really did something to Min Seol Ah?

710
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,540
I knew this would happen.

711
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,870
That woman, Oh Yun Hui, she endured for quite a while.

712
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:25,530
Tomorrow afternoon will be the announcement of the redevelopment.

713
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,830
Tomorrow?

714
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,150
That woman has such bad luck.

715
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,190
She endured for a few months and sold it right before the announcement.

716
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,320
I guess this is the fate of the poor?

717
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,300
When she signs the contract for sale tomorrow morning, it's all over.

718
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:49,940
Then we'll secure all 10 units from Bosong Village.

719
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,490
Ro Na, take this

720
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,170
Ro Na, here!

721
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,230
Oh, Ro Na.

722
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,130
At least take your sandwich.

723
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,270
If you skip meals, you can't sing.

724
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:15,770
After school, come to Bosong Village, Unit 501.

725
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:19,490
I'll arrange all our stuff and wait for you.

726
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,200
Yes, hello?

727
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,170
Yes, this is the real estate office. Can you come to sign the contract?

728
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,500
Someone is here with the money for the purchase.

729
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,100
You should hurry while there is still a buyer.

730
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,260
But I'm in the midst of moving right now.

731
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,490
Yes, I understand, I'll be there right away.

732
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,150
She's on her way here.

733
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,970
Your son at your late age?

734
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,770
Wow, Mr. Owner,

735
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,880
you're so young.

736
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:24,290
When the unit owner comes, can you take care of the contract in my place?

737
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,800
If the buyer and I meet each other... it wouldn't be a good thing.

738
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:41,300
♪ Lascia ch'io pianga mia cruda sorte ♪

739
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:47,660
♪ E che sospiri ♪

740
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,150
Ro Na, if you're going to fulfill your community service hours, you'd better give up lunch tomorrow

741
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:59,190
and come to school one hour earlier plus leave school one hour later.

742
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,090
I'll be watching you.

743
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:06,520
And make sure to correctly separate the trash from the recycling.

744
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,190
Ro Na.

745
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,770
 I told you to correctly separate the trash from the recycling. 

746
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,780
 Remove the vinyl from the PET bottles. 

747
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,930
   

748
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,500
Ah, she is doomed.

749
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,920
Who did this?

750
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,040
I heard you live in Bosong Village?

751
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,450
That isn't the main point, I told you.

752
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:40,620
The main point is that she's living in Min Seol Ah's home.

753
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,430
Wow, that makes me shudder. Is that true?

754
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,420
You are something.

755
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:47,800
Look at that, she can't deny it. I told you it was true.

756
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,630
So Bae Ro Na stole Min Seol Ah's spot in admissions and her home.

757
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,920
Wow, her mental state is no joke. Her mind is completely different from ours.

758
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,180
Maybe your mom really did kill Min Seol Ah?

759
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,620
Bingo.

760
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,770
Bae Ro Na is Min Seol Ah's killer, of course.

761
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,760
She's definitely connected to Min Seol Ah in some way.

762
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,280
- Goosebumps. 
 - Hey.

763
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,910
Get lost.

764
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:13,470
It is a disgrace to study in the same room as you.

765
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,030
What are you guys talking about?

766
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,640
Are you really living in Min Seol Ah's home?

767
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,180
Bae Ro Na? We asked you if that is true!

768
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,050
Where are you going, Ro Na?

769
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,800
Trying to run away? You coward.

770
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,060
Someone like you never belonged at Cheong Ah Arts School in the first place.

771
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,690
Don't ever come near our school again, you beggar dog.

772
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,740
What should you do?

773
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,210
Where are you going, you beggar?

774
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,490
You're the ones who are like beggars!

775
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,850
Sorry.

776
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,260
- Ahjussi. 
 - I didn't do it on purpose.

777
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,730
But still... How can you...

778
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,980
Sorry, we didn't mean to.

779
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,840
Sorry.

780
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,180
How can you do that?

781
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,670
Why isn't she coming? The announcement is this afternoon.

782
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:44,600
Elder, I'll push it for you, so be strong.

783
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,460
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

784
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,330
Don't come here.  I'll be doing my stuff so take care of her.

785
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,550
Hello.

786
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,740
I'm sorry for being late.

787
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,320
Sit here, please.

788
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,800
I got hit with water on the way here, suddenly.

789
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,340
Ah, I'm so out of breath.

790
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:16,070
 Come on, just stamp your seal on the contract first, Ahjumma. 

791
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:22,810
The buyer suddenly had something come up at his home.

792
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,630
Pardon?

793
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,650
But he left the money for purchase and the contract is complete, too.

794
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,320
All you need to do, as the seller, is to stamp your seal.

795
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,390
Ah, yes.

796
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,240
Ah, yes, my seal.

797
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:39,210
Excuse me, for a second.

798
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,600
- All I need is to stamp, right? 
 - Yes.

799
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,000
So stamp it right here?

800
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,570
Yes, here.

801
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,820
 Hurry and stamp it. 

802
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,200
 This is driving me crazy. 

803
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,420
 This is breaking news. 

804
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,730
 The government announced a plan today that Bosong Village, the deprived area,  

805
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:20,690
 will be redeveloped extensively. 

806
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,720
 Because the plans of redevelopment had been canceled several times, it has become a long wished for project by everybody. 

807
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,340
 As news of Bosong Village's redevelopment was revealed, 

808
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:30,570
 people in the construction and real estate fields couldn't hide their excitement. 

809
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,360
 Bosong Village, that'll be extensively redeveloped, will turn into the landmark of Seoul  

810
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,650
 that has everything, such as housing, educational, cultural, and living conveniences.   

811
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:43,890
 As the plan for redevelopment was announced, developers are preparing to compete in the bidding fiercely...  
 - Ro Na!

812
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,360
Ro Na.  We are saved.

813
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:49,770
We are saved!

814
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,880
Ahjussi, I'm rich now!

815
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,660
I just became rich!

816
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,030
Everyone come at me! What? Are you scared?

817
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,190
Come at me!

818
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,920
Get her!

819
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,340
Fine, I live in Min Seol Ah's house.

820
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,970
So what about it? How does that hurt any of you?

821
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,900
What did you all do to Min Seol Ah?

822
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,250
Did Min Seol Ah die because you tortured her just like me?

823
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,730
Do you want me to die like Min Seol Ah, too?

824
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,750
But... I will never die stupidly like she did.

825
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:46,460
I will make sure the world finds out what you guys did to me and punish you for it!

826
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:20,760


827
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,480
 The Penthouse 

828
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,150
 That loser 

829
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,930
 is going to be rich now? 

830
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:29,770
 Who are you? 

831
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,220
 I'm a teacher here. 

832
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,050
 I request your advice and counsel. 
   

833
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:36,310
 What is it that you want? 

834
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,660
 Don't ask and don't even be curious. 

835
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,710
 Yun Hui, don't hate me too much. 

836
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,170
 - How about Hera Palace? 
 - What? 

837
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:46,160
 Didn't I say that a mom should do whatever she can for her child? 

838
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,370
 Min Seol Ah died at Hera Palace, didn't she? 

839
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:51,260
 I met Min Seol Ah at Hera Palace. 

840
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,630
 What if Min Seol Ah is still alive...
