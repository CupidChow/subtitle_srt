  Episode 2  

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,590
Cheon Seo Jin.

3
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm not going to run away, anywhere, anymore.

4
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,710
Get out of my room immediately.

5
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,840
 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by The Penthouse Tangles Team @ Viki.com  

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,510
You will... never win against me even if you're born again.

7
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,340
Fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.

8
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,940
Thieving, bitch.

9
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,290
Mom! I'll go get security!

10
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,170
That's not necessary.

11
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,090
Are you crazy?

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,580
What are you doing in front of the kids?

13
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,750
Are you still playing around with trophies? Then and now.

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,360
Do I look like I'm joking around?

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,920
Even after seeing this?

16
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,660
You must be acting this way because you want your daughter to receive lessons from me,

17
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,730
but my classes are already full. And I don't want to get involved with you again.

18
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,200
If that was a good enough answer, can you leave now?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,510
Who said I wanted my daughter to receive lessons from you?

20
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,110
Who knows what you'd do with my precious daughter.

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,710
Mom! Why are you being like this!

22
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,160
No matter how great you are at teaching,

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,580
to me, you are nothing.

24
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,350
My Ro Na...

25
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,200
will get accepted proudly with her own skill, as long as you're not interfering with it.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,700
You're totally a megalomaniac and a full victim mentality.

27
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,600
Get out immediately, before I report you for a disturbance.

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,130
I'll come back to get... this trophy.

29
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,170
I just came to tell you that.

30
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,760
Let's go, Ro Na.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,010
Mom! Who is that lady? Who is she that she acts like that?

32
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,610
I went to high school with her.

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,880
She asked me to give her daughter lessons, but when I refused, she threw a fit.

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,480
She was like that when we were in school too, but it seems she's gotten worse since her life is so harsh.

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,660
It's okay though.

36
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,170
Things like this commonly happen all the time.

37
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,950
Will that woman's daughter also be attending Cheong Ah Arts School?

38
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,320
I told you that will never happen!

39
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,680
Her singing skill is already not good enough, she's just bluffing.

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,710
Eun Byeol, you're confident about entering Cheongah Arts School at the top of your class, aren't you?

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,880
- The top of the class? 
 - You have to be the top to sing a solo at the entrance ceremony!

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,930
Grandpa will also attend the entrance ceremony and I even invited famous overseas vocalists. For you!

43
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,560
Seok Gyeong must have done great at mid-term exams, so you should do properly in singing at least to beat  her!

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,090
I'm going to win. I want to win like crazy!

45
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,180
I did my best to make you the best!

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,970
Do you know how many kids in this world don't receive any support?

47
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,070
You are Cheong Ah Arts Chairman's granddaughter.

48
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,670
You were born with a ticket to Seoul University, that's harder to get than a gold spoon in your mouth.

49
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,830
Do you know how much of an advantage that is?

50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,940
I know.

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,860
You only have to practice.

52
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,080
Sing, sing, and keep on singing until you make possible what you can't do.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,240
Plant whole music sheets in your head!

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Sing from when you open your eyes until you go back to sleep. Sing even in your dreams!

55
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,590
If Seok Gyeong is practicing 100 times, you'll do it 200 times!

56
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,400
That's the way you'll win.

57
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,870
Practice.

58
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,830
Mom, did you really mean it?

59
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,130
Can I go to Cheong Ah Arts School? Are you allowing me to sing?

60
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,780
Of course!

61
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,370
Alright my daughter, sing.  You said that's your wish.

62
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,850
There isn't much time, but I'll do my best to support you.

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm really going to do my best. I'm going to make sure I get in Cheong Ah Arts School.

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,910
No, I can even become the top in class.

65
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm going to prove to you that I didn't make the wrong choice.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,520
Okay, let's do it

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,220
Ro Na, from the time you were born your voice has been extraordinary.

68
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,260
In order to let no one disturb you, you have to compete with your skills. Are you confident?

69
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,860
Yes. I'm confident.

70
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,740
But why did you do that to Teacher Cheon Seo Jin?

71
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,800
Begging her help wouldn't be even enough, but why did you attack her?

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,220
There was a situation

73
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,360
between Cheon Seo Jin and me.

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
We can find a different teacher.

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,180
I will find you the best teacher. Don't you worry.

76
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,430
Through any means, I'll stop the disciplinary action at school too.

77
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,290
Wouldn't it be easier if the Principal got kicked out?

78
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,810
It's not like we have money or any other things like Je Ni's family.

79
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,380
Just trust me.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,830
Your life... can never be ruined.

81
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,540
How brazen!  Where do you think you are now?

82
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,800
Violent and wild, like mother, like daughter!

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm really sorry, Mr. Principal.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,970
I must have been crazy back then.

85
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,780
It's my fault, so I'll take whatever punishment.

86
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,510
I will also pay for the whole treatment.

87
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,250
So please forgive Ro Na.

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,250
My Ro Na must get a diploma.

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,960
Is this a crime that can just be forgiven?

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,060
This?  This is a perfect example

91
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,130
of infringement on a teacher's right!  You know, with this incident,

92
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,150
I will... I will never let it pass!

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,880
If she broke two of your perfectly fine front teeth,

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,510
that is almost attempted murder.

95
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,010
Both the mother and her daughter must be properly punished so that we can nip the bud completely.

96
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,530
You ruined your daughter's life. You! Did you get that?

97
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,690
Right now,

98
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,130
I came to apologize to the Principal. I didn't come to apologize to you!

99
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,980
What did you just say? Are you out of your mind?

100
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you think I don't know your daughter is putting on an act?

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,300
Alright,

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,540
watch over your daughter. I will protect my daughter.

103
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,920
Don't you think Ro Na's mom noticed something?

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,610
Mr. Principal, are you able to pay back all the bribes I've given you so far?

105
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,480
Otherwise, pull yourself together. Okay?

106
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,490
Why did I do that?

107
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,430
 Pure Chaos 
 Heraclair 

108
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,910
Where are you?  I'm already here.

109
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,320
It's just that you're reaping what you sow, so don't blame me, Jo Sang Heon.

110
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,620
From now on, I will do anything if it's for my daughter.

111
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,460
Yes, she's preparing to enter Cheong Ah Arts School.

112
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,350
Yes?  You have a spot open for lessons?

113
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,720
Thank you!

114
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,830
Yes, her name is Ba Ro Na, a ninth grader at Hwayeong Middle School.  I'll visit you with her tomorrow.

115
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,380
Pardon me?

116
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,290
You don't have any spot...

117
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,950
What are you saying? You just said that there was one available.

118
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,680
Hello? Hello?

119
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,310
What the...

120
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,560
No way...

121
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,950
I've circulated the information about Bae Ro Na to all the top-notch teachers available for lessons.

122
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,980
Did you find out Bae Ro Na's grades?

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Yes. Here they are.

124
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,200
Her grades are at A level?

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,160
 Cheon Seo Jin.  It's no one else but you who would do such shameless sabotage.  

126
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,060
What am I going to do if I can't find a teacher?

127
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,700
- Sorry for being late. 
 - It's alright. 
   

128
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,530
See you.

129
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you taking them again?  The boss will scold you for that.

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,860
The expiration date has already passed, anyway.

131
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,850
I'll pay for these things.

132
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,070
This is the annual schedule for freshmen's mathematics at Cheong Ah Arts School.

133
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,800
If you can see here, the students are usually good at polynomial expressions and factorization,

134
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,650
so we will focus more on inequality and the quadratic function.

135
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,350
Because it can be endlessly difficult if they try to twist the questions about inequality and the quadratic function.

136
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,600
Seok Gyeong, can you stop using your cellphone?

137
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,310
All right.

138
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,860
Why is this workbook so clean?

139
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,690
Didn't you say you're the first or second in the school?

140
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,380
Is being rude your concept?

141
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,430
The reason why I checked your workbook was because I wanted to check your level as you refused the level test.

142
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,100
So you want to prove that you're worthy of your salary?

143
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,410
Then, just pretend you're working until your time's up, as other tutors do.

144
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,860
Eun Byeol. Oh really? Yeah.

145
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,740
Let's take a break.

146
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,910
So what did you tell her?

147
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,050
You really said that?

148
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,900
Well, good job, you did well. Yes.

149
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,100
I'll call you again later.

150
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,150
Although your mid-term exam is done, aren't you too relaxed?  You shouldn't be rude to your tutor.

151
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,370
Hang up and concentrate on your lesson.

152
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,100
- Please mind your own business.  
 - Seok Gyeong!

153
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,730
Seok Hun, is there something going on with Seok Gyeong these days?

154
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,350
Think about why Seok Gyeong might be acting like that.

155
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,090
 You ...  will never win against me even if you're born again. 

156
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,480
 Fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin. 

157
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
 Thieving bitch! 

158
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,290
I guess you didn't get my text.

159
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,080
I told you to meet me at Hotel Shine.

160
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,720
You and I, Chairman Ju ...

161
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,970
both have a lot to lose.

162
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,970
In such a place where many people can see,

163
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,470
I think we're going to get in trouble.

164
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm relieved that you and I are thinking alike.

165
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,260
You dropped this.

166
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,080
It's a master key to give you access to every place in Herapalace.

167
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,730
I guess it would be more convenient if it's somewhere we both know?

168
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,910
Butler Yang!  Butler Yang, whose shoes on earth are these?

169
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,490
The tutor is here.

170
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,280
The entrance hall became a mess!  Throw them away immediately!

171
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,170
Yes, sir.

172
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,680
She's the new math tutor for the kids.

173
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,230
Well, please take good care of them.

174
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,050
I'll leave now.

175
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,170
Does tutoring have to be done at home?

176
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,070
You know very well that I hate to encounter strangers!

177
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,920
We never know where outside or what those shoes stepped on.

178
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,240
And when I think that those hands, which might have touched all sorts of things, are now touching our house!

179
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,060
Throw these contaminated things away, as well as the cups she used.

180
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,000
- Please also clean the bathroom again too. 
 - Yes, sir.

181
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Honey, let's discuss it later.

182
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,440
Tutor Lee!

183
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,580
I'm sure your feelings must be hurting a lot.  The kid's dad  has mysophobia.  (Irrational fear of dirt and contamination) 

184
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,560
I apologize on behalf of him.

185
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,440
No, you don't have to.

186
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
- My kids are not easy to handle, are they? 
 - It's alright, it's my job.

187
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,900
Since they are going through puberty these days, it's hard for me too.

188
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,640
If you need anything, please tell me anytime, Tutor Lee.

189
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,070
Yes, I will.

190
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,580
   

191
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,390
Hello, Mr. Principal.  I should've contacted you more often since my kids are in your hands.

192
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,030
Seok Gyeong did...

193
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:06,120
Ju Seok Gyeong? I just heard something unbelievable.

194
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,140
I heard you submitted a blank answer sheet during today's exam.  Is that true?

195
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,570
Seok Gyeong, what does that mean?  Father, it's probably not true.

196
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,230
I didn't ask you, Ju Seok Hun.  Please answer me, Ju Seok Gyeong.

197
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,310
Until yesterday, you were at the top with perfect 100% scores, but today it's a blank sheet.

198
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,920
It's not true, is it?  I heard it wrong, right?

199
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,330
It's true.

200
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,810
I don't want to go to Cheong Ah Arts School.

201
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,050
- That's why I did it. 
 - What did you just say?

202
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,470
Seok Gyeong! What's wrong with you?

203
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't want to sing!

204
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,150
I don't want to sing just because you order me to do it!

205
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,870
I think that my family needs to have at least one famous classical music singer.

206
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,900
That has been my goal for a very long time.

207
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,500
Even so, why should I sing?

208
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,920
You've never asked me, not even once!

209
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,210
What I want to do!

210
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,900
I hate singing on stage.  I hate it more than death!

211
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,480
I won't do it. I hate school, singing, and everything about this house!

212
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,030
I'm telling you, it feels suffocating and it's killing me!  I feel like I'm going crazy!

213
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,570
Then, what do you want to do,

214
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,820
my dear daughter?

215
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,330
Please send me with oppa to study abroad.

216
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,690
Study abroad?  Did you just say study abroad?

217
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,290
We haven't done it for a while, right?  You should spend some time with me.

218
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,950
Father. I did wrong.

219
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,340
I should've taken better care of Seok Gyeong. I'll scold her so that she won't do it again, so please...

220
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,630
Hmm, you're too noisy.  You know very well

221
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,470
that I detest a man crying and begging.

222
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,350
I'll change Seok Gyeong's mind, so plea...

223
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,330
Didn't I warn you?  That I detest noise?

224
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,250
You two must live according to the rules I make. Did you forget that?

225
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,700
You must be fully aware of what will happen if you break those rules, right?

226
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,280
You promised that you wouldn't beat her!!

227
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,040
Rather than her, please beat me! Me!

228
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,600
If that's your wish, I should do that.

229
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,300
When a twin sister does wrong, her brother getting punished instead of her might look beautiful too.

230
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,710
No, please, Dad!  Dad!

231
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,700
Dad, I did wrong.

232
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,400
Oppa, tell him you did wrong!

233
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,300
Hurry!

234
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,840
Come here.

235
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,780
Oppa... Oppa.

236
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,590
Dad, I am to blame!

237
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,420
Oppa.  Oppa!

238
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,290
Oppa. Oppa, are you alright?

239
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,670
Answer me, oppa!

240
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,560
Dad, I'm sorry...

241
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,180
Please stop it, please.

242
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Stop it!

243
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,650
Stop!

244
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,430
 After the beep, please leave your message... 

245
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,940
Why is no one answering the phone?

246
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,750
Who knows?

247
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,650
Ma'am.

248
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,430
What's wrong, Seok Hun? Are you hurt somewhere?

249
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,850
Where have you been again?

250
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,980
You're always absent at the perfect time as if you know all.

251
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,600
What do you mean?

252
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,210
What happened?  Tell your mom.

253
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,660
Are you even interested in us?

254
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,460
Get out of my way.

255
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,710
What happened to the kids?

256
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,270
I don't know well.

257
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,070
Honey, did something happened to the kids?

258
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,170
Well, the kids were arguing so I scolded them.

259
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,500
They argued?

260
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong don't argue with each other.

261
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,900
That's why I scolded them.  I guess they are really in puberty.

262
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,170
They don't give you a hard time, do they?

263
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,970
No, they don't.

264
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,930
Did it hurt a lot?

265
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,540
I'm okay, don't worry.

266
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,410
You know, right?

267
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,780
You're the only one I have.

268
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,320
You're the only person on my side.

269
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,070
I'll protect you, no matter what.

270
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,560
No one can hurt you.

271
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,960
Sorry...

272
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
The tumor is getting bigger, it's dangerous to leave it as it is.

273
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,570
The breast tumor is an aggressive one too.

274
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,230
I've prepared money, please proceed with the surgery.

275
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,170
You said it's 2 million Won, right?

276
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,510
Where did you get money?

277
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,400
Didn't you say you don't have parents?

278
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,420
You said you're a middle school student, right?

279
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,310
I think you're mistaken

280
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,080
but the surgery costs ₩2 million.  Including all procedures, hospitalization, and recuperation, it will be ₩6 million in total.

281
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,730
But as it seems you're in a tight situation, I'll make it  ₩5 million

282
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,740
and you must bring it in cash.

283
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,650
That much?

284
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,350
Well, that's because it's quite a difficult surgery.

285
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,930
If you miss the timing, she might lose her life.

286
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,580
No, you must save her life, please.

287
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,160
I'll get the money ready somehow.

288
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,100
Why aren't you eating, Sugar?

289
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,890
Alright, I'll eat it too.

290
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,800
Sugar, eat it now.

291
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,220
Here we go, say 'ah'.

292
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,680
Good girl, you're eating well.

293
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,350
Today, your sister went to Herapalace,

294
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,440
which is the most luxurious apartments for the rich people in Korea.

295
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,290
The entrance hall is super luxurious

296
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,700
and the fountain is super big.

297
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,850
You can go in only when you turn in your ID card.

298
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,850
It's really amazing, isn't it?

299
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,620
The kids living there are at the same age as me,

300
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,170
but they can't do anything against me.

301
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,670
Because I'm their tutor.

302
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,540
So, you don't have to worry about me.

303
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,720
You should only think about getting the surgery and getting better, Sugar.

304
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,500
The Italian lesson teacher is coming, so be prepared.

305
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,290
Right now?

306
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,040
It's after 11 PM.

307
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,270
Alright, I'll get ready.

308
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,280
Aren't you pushing her too much?

309
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,350
There are not many days left until the singing test.

310
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
Aren't you the one who keeps pushing her to win against Seok Gyeong every day?

311
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,440
That's because... Ju Dan Tae, that bastard, is too annoying.

312
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,270
While pretending to be humble, he shows off at every word.  I'm sick of it.

313
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,530
He has money, sure, but not that much.

314
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,930
How dare he orders me around?  I'm also the Chief at Cheong Ah Medical Center!

315
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:16,010
Thanks to Chairman Ju, you can say your hospital gained many VIP clients.

316
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,100
That's why I tolerate him, as he's still useful for something.

317
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,810
This is the Bordeaux wine that Chairman Ju likes, right?

318
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,440
It's not that delicious, anyway,

319
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,260
so why does he drink this one all the time?

320
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,350
Then, don't drink it!

321
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,470
Why are you copying him while badmouthing him?

322
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,350
The apartment where Chairman Ju lives, the wine he drinks,

323
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,400
and even the T-shirt he's wearing.  You're copying him for all that, so why are you badmouthing him?

324
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,550
You know, Honey,

325
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,690
that's your inferiority complex.

326
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,360
If you say such a thing one more time,

327
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,100
I'll file our divorce papers, got it?

328
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,050
By the way,

329
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,700
does our Eun Byeol have the skill to win against Seok Gyeong?

330
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,520
There are many other competitors besides Seok Gyeong.

331
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,070
Other than the twins, who else?

332
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,320
 Propolis 

333
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,400
 Mozart 

334
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,360
 Don't give up the acceptance to Cheong Ah Arts School. 

335
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
 Fighting, Bae Ro Na! 

336
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,170
Ro Na, I'm sorry.

337
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,500
I didn't have any right to stop you, but I tried to stop you.

338
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,770
I'm so sorry for that.

339
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,090
I'll somehow straighten out this situation.

340
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,990
For my saying that you're worse than my dead Dad ...

341
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,020
I'm sorry, Mom.

342
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,840
  I missed you so much. 

343
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,950
 - Really? 
 - Yes. 

344
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,500
 Been well? 

345
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,870
Did you take this video? Are you crazy?

346
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,670
There's a lot of people watching. Will you be okay?

347
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,860
You dare to threaten me?

348
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,870
Do you think you'll be able to survive in this field after this?

349
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,150
I don't care about anything anymore.

350
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,030
Let me put it simply.

351
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,110
If you want to get elected for your third term in the next election, silence me with money.

352
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,930
You don't... know how scary the world can be?

353
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,910
I can make someone like you

354
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,940
silently disappear with one phone call. Do you know that?

355
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,090
Should I send this video to the broadcasting stations and news reporters?

356
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,660
Having an affair, evading my commission, and even harassing me sexually.

357
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,610
You've lived well as a scumbag, then you should consider it fortunate to be able to block this with money.

358
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,380
Hey...

359
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,560
Hey.

360
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,770
 Energy Drink - N 

361
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,930
You're asking me to forgive you with this box of drinks?

362
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,960
Ro Na's mother, you really don't know how the world works.

363
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Why don't you open it first and then talk.

364
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,510
You've probably received these quite often, so you can tell how much it is, right?

365
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,170
You're going to get me in trouble saying things like that!

366
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,270
When would I have ever received something like this?

367
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,210
Probably from Je Ni's mother and in many other instances.

368
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,830
But... I'm going to turn a blind eye,

369
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,210
if you let my Ro Na graduate,

370
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,220
Both my eyes and ears never saw or heard anything.

371
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,960
Please take care of this, Principal.

372
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,690
Ah yes.

373
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:23,000
   

374
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,560
   

375
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,600
Congratulations, Seok Gyeong.

376
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,150
Lower your chin just a bit. Smile so your teeth show. 
    

377
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,820
One, two, three. Thank you.

378
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:49,030
Thank you for your great help in the school's development,  Chairman Ju.

379
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,730
I had asked for my children's names to be omitted from the scholarship list.

380
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,490
Of course, they should have been included.

381
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,950
They are ranked top in the school. They deserve to receive the scholarships.

382
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,390
I'm thinking of replacing all of the air conditioners and computers in the school.

383
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,170
I've also drafted something for the construction of the gym. Please take a look.

384
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,340
Even the gym? It must be quite expensive.

385
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,560
Don't worry about the money.

386
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,830
This is where my children are. How could it be a waste of money?

387
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,270
Thank you so much, Chairman.

388
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,120
Seok Gyeong's blank sheet incident was wrapped up well.

389
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,790
Thankfully, I was able to persuade the test proctor.

390
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,300
Good.

391
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,890
Please arrange for me to have a meal with that proctor.

392
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,540
Yes, sir.

393
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,170
   
   

394
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,120
Let's go!

395
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,900
 Glass Building 

396
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,700
 Glass Building Sales Plan 

397
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,100
Why are you doing this to us?

398
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,890
You bastards!  You damn bastards!

399
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,680
 Don't do this, you bastards! 

400
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,790
The first step is in progress. You may start, Doctor Ha.

401
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,080
Okay!

402
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,800
 Cheong Ah Medical Center VIP 

403
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,870
How are you, President Chu! The back surgery went perfectly. 
    

404
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,770
You'll be fine for the next 50 years.

405
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,190
By the way,

406
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,140
I have something to report to the media.

407
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,170
What?

408
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,020
You know Sinae Street in Myeonwon-dong?

409
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,030
The tenants refusing to move out were hindering the re-development recently.

410
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,710
The media has laid out the plates, so you take care of the rest.

411
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,380
In the end, the law

412
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,390
is what's at the top.

413
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,060
The owner of the building has a reckless son.

414
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,010
He's on trial for assault and battery, but there's going to be a huge settlement.

415
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,060
Because the victim's lawyer was my father's classmate at the Judicial Research and Training Institute,

416
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,350
I've pushed the settlement amount up to the maximum.

417
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,510
At this point, if we file a complaint and they go through a tax investigation, they won't last long.

418
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,320
Half of the collateral is mortgaged and any further bank loans are blocked.

419
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,110
Bingo. It'll be a maximum of a month.

420
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:57,650
Lawyer Lee, you need to be a good son, seeing as everything is served on a silver platter to you.

421
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,820
It also requires the ability to accept what he gives me.

422
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,020
Damn it.

423
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,220
How much are we going to get this time? The profits?

424
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,960
At least fifteen large ones.

425
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,540
I got the gold bars already as an additional deposit on the Yongsan building.

426
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,610
There's nothing as honest as gold.

427
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,790
   

428
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,640
Let's finish this up quickly and get started with the next deal.

429
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,210
The next one is pretty big.

430
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,240
Cheers.

431
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,890
For the principal to act like that, exactly what kind of sleight of hand did you do?

432
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,380
At this rate, isn't it as though nothing ever happened to my child?

433
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,530
Don't even dream of it. I'm going to follow you to hell!

434
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,990
Well then, go right ahead!

435
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,390
- Let's take Je Ni to the hospital now. 
 - What?

436
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,990
Let's test her to see if there really is something wrong with her voice.

437
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,930
If her throat is bleeding, we should find out what ingredient on earth made her that way.

438
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,690
Then we can compensate and apologize to you,

439
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,770
or else we should receive the apology, shouldn't we?

440
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,650
This woman, really.

441
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,290
Are you saying my Je Ni did something that warrants an apology?

442
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,020
You should know that better than me, Je Ni's mother.

443
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,210
I don't usually interfere with other families' parenting,

444
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,850
but you shouldn't educate your child like that.

445
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,860
You can't make your child successful by hurting someone else's child.

446
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,880
If you make an issue of this incident, let's see who will lose more.

447
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,130
Hmm, think about it carefully.

448
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,650
Hey! Hey!  Stop right there! Hey!

449
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:29,430
I'm not done talking! I was in the middle of talking!

450
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:37,430
♫ Lascia ch'io pianga  ( In Italian  )

451
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:44,150
♫ Mia cruda sorte

452
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:52,340
♫ E che sospiri...

453
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
Ro Na's mother.

454
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
Do you remember me?

455
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,720
Yes, you're Je Ni's tutor, right?

456
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,070
I was... let go. She's taking lessons from Soprano Cheon Seo Jin now.

457
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,420
She was taking lessons from me while waiting for an open spot from her.

458
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,940
I see.

459
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,470
Her voice is really good.

460
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,580
No wonder Je Ni is jealous.

461
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,050
Is Ro Na getting ready for entrance exams too?

462
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,540
Lessons? Is she taking them?

463
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,950
- No, she's still practicing on her own. 
 - Why?

464
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,370
There are no teachers willing to teach her.

465
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,620
There have probably been some rumors.

466
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,530
The Committee Against School Violence held a hearing because of that incident with Je Ni.

467
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,100
But Ro Na didn't do anything wrong, really!

468
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,190
I know very well that she was wrongfully blamed.

469
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,960
I felt really sorry about it at the time.

470
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,190
I wasn't in the position to come right out and help. I couldn't do anything.

471
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,300
It's okay.

472
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,540
If you had gotten involved, you would've gotten into trouble.

473
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:01,610
Someone who sings really well like Ro Na would get accepted even with minimal lessons.

474
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,820
What about... letting me teach Ro Na?

475
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,150
Pardon? Really?

476
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,940
Ro Na has a lot more potential than Je Ni.

477
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,590
She has a beautiful voice and perfect pitch.

478
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,090
I want to try to help her.

479
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:21,030
But if you were looking for someone well known like Cheon Seo Jin, then I can't be that person.

480
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,530
That's not a problem. Thank you so much!

481
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,970
Thank you! Thank you!

482
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:01,450
Excellent!  You're doing well as I expected.

483
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,780
I think this will do for the Italian song.  What is the German song?

484
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,780
What do you mean a German song? Shouldn't we prepare two Italian songs?

485
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,290
Didn't you see Cheong Ah High's notice? The change of entrance exam requirements?

486
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,100
Didn't you know they added a German song starting this year?

487
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,320
What am I going to do? I don't know any German!

488
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,260
Oh my gosh! Je Ni heard the rumor already and practiced German songs a lot.

489
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,530
This won't do. Let's concentrate only on practicing a German song from today.

490
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,390
Let's start with interpreting a song.

491
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,350
Won't it be too late to start right now?

492
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,960
You're smart, so you'll catch on quickly.

493
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,420
Instead, you'll have to practice hard and do whatever I ask you to do.

494
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,620
I will do my very best.

495
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:50,210
Then shall we start with Schubert's "Die Forelle"?  Ms. Jennifer, please.

496
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,520
♫ In a clear little brook, there darted, about in happy haste

497
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,250
Let's try that line first...

498
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:24,370
♫ Hear, gods of revenge, hear a mother's oath! ♫

499
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,880
That's not it! Your pitch keeps going flat!

500
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,590
I told you to resonate with your maschera and push the sound forward.

501
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,160
Don't connect the sound of each note, separate them!

502
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,620
Why do you keep making the same mistakes?

503
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,580
I'll do it again. I can do better. I won't make the same mistake.

504
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,360
   

505
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,850
I, Gyu Jin, am all done with work today!

506
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:05,740
Oh my! Min Hyeok is getting tutored right now. You can't take off your clothes in here!

507
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,870
Didn't you say you're going to be late preparing for the trial?

508
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,770
My dad left work early, so I kept on the lookout and escaped as fast as I could.

509
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,670
In any case, we can't prepare for the trial without my dad.

510
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,640
Now you need to start showing your father you are doing things on your own,

511
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,800
so he can entrust the law firm to you.

512
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,600
Until when are you going to be an salaried lawyer under your father?

513
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,820
It's mine anyway. My noonas have no interest in the law firm at all.  (Noonas - Older sisters for a male) 

514
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,930
What do you mean they have no interest?

515
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,680
Your second sister keeps asking me lately to introduce her to Lawyer Park.

516
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,300
What? It hasn't been long since she got a divorce.

517
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,450
It's obvious. She's trying to get in on your father's law firm, one way or another.

518
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,220
You really don't know anything.

519
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,290
Honey. Are you badmouthing my noona now?

520
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,190
She's my noona.

521
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,790
No.  I acted like that because you look at your noonas in a too naive way.

522
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,470
- I'm upset. 
 - Your sisters are too...

523
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,870
Make up with me or I'm going to tell my mom everything!

524
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,910
Why are you upset?

525
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,510
- Excuse me... 
  -  Oh gosh.

526
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,720
I'll get going.

527
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,060
- I'm Min Hyeok's father. 
 - I see.

528
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,270
Come here!

529
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,780
   

530
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,570
She should have told me earlier.

531
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:06,340
There was a place like this in Herapalace that I never knew about? How surprising.

532
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,570
I participated in the architectural design. You can come relax here whenever you need to.

533
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,230
You are giving lessons to my children, so you certainly deserve it.

534
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,960
Are you bribing me?

535
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,300
I don't think my children's skills are so lacking that I need to bribe anyone.

536
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:27,520
So, who will be at the top of the class of the admittees of Cheong Ah Arts School?

537
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,170
Will it be my Seok Gyeong or Eun Byeol?

538
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:34,350
In any case, isn't it something that's already been decided by the insiders?

539
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:38,650
That will be fairly decided on the day of the exam.

540
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,850
Fairly? How fresh and new.

541
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,140
What are you doing?

542
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,640
I thought this might suit you better.

543
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,380
The one that your foolish husband bought you is not so great.

544
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:48,420
What does this necklace... mean?

545
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,200
You don't intend to possess me, do you?

546
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,310
How could I dare?

547
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,170
I want a simple liaison.

548
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,170
No confining ourselves only to each other, no clinging.

549
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:09,040
And when one of us is done, it's over for both.

550
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,050
How about it?

551
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,910
It seems that the rules between us have just been made.

552
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,110
How about ending early for today?

553
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,740
Did you forget that we began this session late?

554
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,380
Just end it early and get paid for another tutoring session, then.

555
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,230
You like money, don't you, Teacher?

556
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,380
You saw it correctly. I do like money and I need to earn it.

557
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,900
So we have to do this lesson. If I breach the contract, I have to pay a penalty.

558
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,790
Is that enough of an answer for you?

559
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,830
 Application for Admission to Cheong Ah Arts School 

560
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,760
Solve it quickly.

561
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,820
I said I didn't want to solve this math problem. Why are you doing this?

562
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,870
Don't you mean that you can't?

563
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:57,160
I don't know how you scored 1st and 2nd place in class at Cheong Ah Arts Middle School.

564
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,330
but in my honest opinion, you aren't quite that good.

565
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,460
Get out of my room right now.

566
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,820
Right now.

567
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,960
I think it would be best to end our session early for today.

568
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,990
We have to fill out our Application for Admission to Cheong Ah Arts School.

569
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,450
We got permission from our mom, too.

570
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:24,260
Fine. But today is the only exception.

571
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,140
What are you doing?

572
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,450
People like that need to be stepped on.

573
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,510
That way they will know their place and stop acting arrogant.

574
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,750
Teacher... You've worked hard.

575
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,790
This is just a small gift from me...

576
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,550
My keyring is gone.

577
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,540
It's a designer label limited edition that Dad gave me for my birthday. Did you take it by any chance, Teacher?

578
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,100
It was definitely on my desk until just a little while ago.

579
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,730
I'd never do that. Go look for it again.

580
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,120
You can just show me what's in your bag if you don't want to be misunderstood.

581
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,180
That's fine, isn't it?

582
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,920
 Conquering School Grades: Math 

583
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,730
Are you still going to say you didn't do it?

584
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,750
You are a thief! You even stole snacks from our home.

585
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,200
Stop it, Seok Gyeong. I'm sorry, Teacher.

586
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,450
Why should I stop?

587
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,740
A teacher stole from us, how can I not get upset?

588
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,160
Mom, how can you say that when you saw it with your own eyes?

589
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,250
Please don't be concerned. I'll make sure to punish her for this.

590
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,410
Mom, whose side are you on? You won't believe your own daughter but you'll defend the thief?

591
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,000
And you call yourself a mother?

592
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,820
Seok Gyeong!

593
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,150
How can you speak that way to your mother?

594
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,660
Mom is defending the tutor after she stole from us.

595
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,120
I did not do that. I really didn't take it.

596
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,970
There is no reason for me to steal from you.

597
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,700
But it seems you would have plenty of reasons.

598
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,130
I think you should leave now, Teacher.

599
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,530
From this point on, it is a family matter.

600
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,830
Let me explain, honey.

601
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,840
Let's hear what Seok Gyeong has to say first. She seems very upset.

602
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,940
Teacher Anna Lee?

603
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,760
Yes?

604
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,340
We've received a report, so please wait for a moment.

605
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,750
What do you mean?

606
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:55,360
We received a report of theft from the penthouse.

607
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,030
Please confirm it again.

608
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,940
I did not do it. I did not steal it.

609
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:05,570
I think that's for the police to decide.

610
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:09,690
When one sees an expensive item, it is natural to want to have it.

611
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,230
I understand.

612
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:16,750
We recovered the stolen item. So if you apologize, we will get past this incident quietly.

613
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,100
I don't want to apologize for something that I didn't do.

614
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,820
If you do not, that will cause a big problem.

615
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,310
Isn't it strange?

616
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,260
Did my daughter's item suddenly grow feet and walk into your bag?

617
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,150
Seok Gyeong could have put it in my bag.

618
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:33,580
What are you saying? Why would I do that?

619
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,460
Your words are too harsh.

620
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,630
How dare you insult my family by voicing such a wild speculation!

621
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,770
You should... apologize.

622
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,990
For accusing my daughter of such shabby behavior

623
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,640
and for her item being found in your bag, apologize right now.

624
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,100
Please send an e-mail to the Chief of Police at Gangnam Station.

625
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,510
Yes.

626
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:02,460
If you take even one step from here, you will face an additional charge of fleeing the scene of a crime.

627
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,800
 I didn't steal it. It was someone else! 

628
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,200
 - I'm not a thief! 
 - Shut up! 

629
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,110
 Oppa, oppa, please say something! 

630
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,270
Wait.

631
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,910
I will apologize.

632
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,060
I will.

633
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,890
   

634
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,390
The math tutor stole?

635
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,080
Isn't that crazy?

636
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,600
That's so funny.

637
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,230
So try it. Apologize.

638
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,210
I'm sorry

639
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,760
for speaking of you that way.

640
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,850
And? Shouldn't you also apologize for stealing?

641
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,020
I'm sorry.

642
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,660
I will never touch any of your belongings again.

643
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,860
Sure, I'll accept your apology,

644
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,690
although I can't say I'm completely satisfied.

645
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,790
Where are you going?

646
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,640
But you know, Teacher...

647
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,210
Do you know that you are very smelly?

648
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,940
I really want to vomit.

649
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,260
I can't swim.

650
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,790
 Imagine if that we adopted a thieving bitch like that! 

651
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:20,800
 You will be deported from the U.S.! 

652
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,620
You should have told us if you were hungry.

653
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,290
Even stealing snacks? Doesn't that make you look too poor?

654
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,490
I guess she likes imported cookies, huh?

655
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,770
Really?

656
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,310
What's up with that?

657
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,500
Teach!

658
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Teach? Teach?

659
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:57,130
Use that to pay the cleaners. It's okay for you to take that.

660
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,820
Let's go.

661
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,100
Bye, Teach.

662
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,580
That tutor is fired, starting today.

663
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,320
Whether she stole or not, I didn't like her from the start.

664
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
Why did you do that, Seok Gyeong?

665
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,980
- What? 
 - You put that in Teacher's bag.

666
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,470
What are you saying?

667
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:20,220
Ju Seok Gyeong! Mom just asked you why you did that.

668
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,170
Does my daughter only amount to this?

669
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:26,010
Are you a bad kid who hurts others?

670
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,560
So? What are you going to do about it?

671
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,090
Go and apologize properly to Teacher Anna. I will drag you to do it if I have to.

672
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,220
I don't want to!

673
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,560
Who are you to say that? What right do you have?

674
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,670
How can you speak to your mother that way?

675
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,460
Mother?

676
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,750
You're not my real mom.

677
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,180
Seok Gyeong, what are you saying...

678
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,340
Did you think I wouldn't know...

679
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,790
that you're not my real mom?

680
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,680
That someone else gave birth to me and oppa?

681
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,320
Seok Gyeong, I don't know what you heard, but I am your mom.

682
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,900
You weren't born from my stomach, but I raised you since you were a baby and I love you just like any other mom.

683
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,210
There isn't a single day when my love for you isn't sincere.

684
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:16,170
Sincere? At my elementary school graduation,

685
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,910
my performances, and my birthday last year,

686
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,670
you were never there when I needed you!

687
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:25,430
It must have all been because of that girl, right?

688
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,460
Your real daughter that's lying in the hospital right now?

689
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,320
How did you know about that?

690
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,250
I liked you so much,

691
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:45,980
but you deceived me.

692
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,240
Because of your real daughter,

693
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,120
you abandoned me every time!

694
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,430
No, no, Seok Gyeong!

695
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,430
Mom never abandoned you!

696
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,290
Mom loves you so much.

697
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,640
I've never once thought that you were not my true daughter.

698
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,930
I'm being sincere, Seok Gyeong.

699
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,330
Don't even act like you are my mom again.

700
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,830
It disgusts me and makes me want to vomit.

701
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,360
Seok Hun, Mom...

702
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,150
Please don't interfere in our lives from now on.

703
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,920
So that was why the kids were acting so sensitive.

704
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,290
I had no idea.

705
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:13,010
They would have found out sooner or later, so don't blame yourself.

706
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:15,170
Some day, the kids will understand.

707
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,460
I will speak to them.

708
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,490
I'm so sorry to you, too.

709
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:30,070
You've had a hard time, taking care of a sick child for 16 years.

710
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,590
And she's not getting any better.

711
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,160
Don't ever say that around Hye In, just in case she hears you.

712
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,160
She can't speak, but she's a sensitive girl. She probably hears and feels everything.

713
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,340
I'm just sorry that I'm not capable enough to help her get back up.

714
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,060
How can you say that?

715
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,490
Even if you were her biological father, you couldn't have done more.

716
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,500
Hye In is my child, no matter what anyone says.

717
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,860
Your child is my child, isn't that right?

718
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:14,190
Seok Hun, Seok Gyeong, Hye In, they are my children, all the same.

719
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,330
So let's fight through this.

720
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:23,230
But...  how did the kids find out?

721
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,100
I'm not sure. That is strange to me, too.

722
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,400
Ahjumma, you were right.

723
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,030
Disgusting. I thought a woman who didn't share a single drop of blood with me was my mom.

724
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,990
Please throw this photo away.

725
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,410
I think the time has come to end this charade.

726
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,710
Ju Hye In, you've worked hard pretending to be someone's daughter.

727
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,670
Has it really been 16 years?

728
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,760
Yes, Chairman.

729
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,720
You've endured well in the place of a dead child. Perfect.

730
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,060
   

731
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,920
   

732
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,510
Lower your larynx and modulate your vocal cords to regulate your breathing, I told you!

733
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,630
Can you ever beat Seok Gyeong this way?

734
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:42,520
Could you be the top of class among the admittees?

735
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,240
Keep going.

736
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,140
♫ In einem Bächlein helle, ( In German )

737
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,800
♫ Da schoss in froher Eil’

738
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,580
That was good. It was good, but,

739
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:05,430
Here, sing "in froher Eil’" a little slower.

740
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,580
♫ In einem Bächlein helle,

741
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,770
♫ Da schoss...

742
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,760
 My daughter, you're so good. 

743
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,990
♫ Die launische Forelle

744
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,590
♫ Vorüber wie ein Pfeil.

745
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:26,470
♫ Ich stand an dem Gestade

746
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:31,340
 The dream that your mom couldn't realize, please make it come true for yourself. 

747
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,960
  
   
   

748
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,860
   

749
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,320
 Let's Go Seonbaes, You Will Pass!! 

750
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,010
Min Hyeok.

751
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:50,460
Son, drink this. It's good for your voice.

752
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,140
- Driver Oh! 
 - Yes.

753
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,000
Take this!

754
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,230
You should take this, Seok Gyeong.

755
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Mom.

756
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,660
Mom, what do I do?

757
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,140
What is it, Ro Na, what's wrong?

758
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,440
Look at this.

759
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,890
   

760
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,470
It's alright.

761
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,530
  
   

762
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,970
   

763
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:49,660
What is it? Teacher isn't answering his phone?

764
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,710
I let my guard down. We were deceived.

765
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,820
I don't think there ever was any requirement to sing a German song.

766
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,680
What do I do, Mom?

767
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,940
Ro Na? Ro Na.

768
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,240
Don't cry.

769
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,570
If you cry, your can't sing well. It's alright.

770
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:10,480
So I assume the tutor was taken care of, there won't be any problems?

771
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,250
Yes. Measures were taken so they cannot contact him.

772
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,290
Ro Na, it's alright.

773
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,190
Don't cry.

774
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,230
Oh, Teacher Cheon, you're here.

775
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,870
Teacher Cheon.

776
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,560
She's been practicing so much,

777
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,910
my Je Ni...

778
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,960
I will judge fairly.

779
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,900
Of course.

780
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,970
Please take good care of us.

781
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,020
Ro Na. Bae Ro Na, get a hold of yourself.

782
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:51,480
Everything's ruined already.

783
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,840
I can't remember anything.

784
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,590
So it's already all over for me.

785
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,040
No, that's not true.

786
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,000
The one song that is left, that is a song you love.

787
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,110
You sang it behind my back countless times, and I heard it countless times.

788
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:12,960
But I didn't even get to practice it properly.

789
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,230
I'm not confident. I can't do it.

790
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,690
Ro Na, you can do it.

791
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:22,660
Are you going to give up like this? Are you going to give up on Cheong Ah Arts School?

792
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,730
You said you would relieve my lifelong resentment.

793
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,230
But don't sing for me.

794
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,330
Sing for yourself.

795
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,230
Don't you feel like it's unfair? Aren't you mad about having been fooled?

796
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,470
You need to at least do all that you can!

797
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,870
Ro Na, don't forget.

798
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:45,260
You have... the best voice.

799
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,860
No one can ever... imitate that.

800
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:54,680
I can't.

801

♫ Lascia ch'io pianga (  In Italian )

802
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:19,500
♫ Mia cruda sorte,

01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,970
♫ E che sospiri

804

Fighting!

814
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:06,560
♫ Mia cruda sorte

815
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:13,680
♫ E che sospiri

♫ E che sospiri

01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:36,090
♫ E che sospiri

820
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:42,460
♫ La liberta

821
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:50,370
♫ Lascia ch'io pianga

822
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,430
Merciful Buddha...

823
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Jesus...

824
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,460
I think Ha Eun Byeol messed up.

825
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:18,430
Why would she worry? Her grandfather is Chairman of this school board.

826
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,200
Just worry about yourself.

827
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,250
Way to go, Seok Gyeong!

828
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,920
Mom!

829
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,690
Ro Na!  How was it? Did you do well?

830
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:34,090
I think I did.

831
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,610
You did well!

832
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:42,290
You worked hard. Let's go.

833
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:46,860
You must not have any worries because Seok Gyeong and Seok Hun will do well.

834
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,790
I wasn't even this nervous when I was taking the announcer test.

835
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:54,270
Really. It feels like my insides are shrinking away.

836
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,630
I'm really nervous too.

837
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:00,840
Honestly, wouldn't the twins pass by just breathing?

838
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:07,130
Think about all the bricks Chairman Ju laid at this school and the meters of grass he laid on the ground.

839
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,250
Your words are making me feel uncomfortable.

840
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:13,400
Why would that make you uncomfortable? I'm only saying the facts.

841
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,690
For both Eun Byeol and the twins,

842
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:19,930
they've got a pre-pass for entry and after them, only a few entry tickets remain

843
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:23,160
and the riff-raff are viciously fighting each other over them.

844
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,590
Such a competitive entry exam, huh?

845
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:28,230
Riff-raff?

846
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,620
Why would my Min Hyeok be among them?

847
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,270
Please don't compare him to your Je Ni.

848
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:36,530
She's not even attending Cheong Ah Arts Middle School.

849
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,640
Did you think Min Hyeok was a "pregnant herring?" 
  (Person who is considered to be quite worthy.) 

850
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,650
Teacher Cheon looks down on you more than me, you know?

851
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,800
You don't know anything.

852
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,700
You wouldn't get looked down on if he was actually great at something, like singing or studying.

853
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,220
Why would a former announcer lack such a sense?

854
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,160
What did you say?

855
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,950
Are you finished talking?

856
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:04,200
Why are you two acting like this?

857
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,350
So let me ask you,

858
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,910
what's wrong with saying, "riff-raff," anyway?

859
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,330
How can you say that about my Min Hyeok?

860
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,950
There can be no comparison.

861
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,530
If you don't like it, then fine, he is a "pregnant herring."

862
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:15,580
Yes, be a "pregnant herring."

863
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,590
A "pregnant herring." 
    

864
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,020
  
  
   

865
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,500
 This is the last student for the entrance exam.

Oh, Mom.

879
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,190
No, it hasn't been announced yet.

880
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:02,880
I don't know why it's so late.

882
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,840
Make the announcement.

883
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,070
Oh, Teacher, it's been a while.

884
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,190
Hello.

885
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,770
The announcement is out.

886
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,790
- Of course, you were accepted too, right? 
 - Yes.

887
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:42,460
But who is the top in the class for Vocal Music?

888
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,310
Oh, Mom.

889
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,280
Mom.

890
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,680
Mom, Mom, Mom.

891
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,090
The announcement is out, but I'm too scared to look at it.

892
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,110
Why come down? You'll get wet in the rain. Let's go up, let's look at it together.

893
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,310
   

894
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,860
   

895
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,870
   

896
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,240
So that means Seok Gyeong is not the top scorer either.

897
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,510
So who is it? It's not Eun Byeol with the squeaky voice, is it?

898
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:16,550
Someone named Min Seol Ah, she passed with a GED. ( GED - General Equivalency Diploma for High School).

899
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,730
Min Seol Ah?

900
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,430
   

901
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,060
It's you, right? So I wasn't mistaken.

902
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,370
Seo Gyeong, how can you treat Teacher that way?

903
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:49,100
She's not a teacher. I saw her clearly at the Cheong Ah exam.

904
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,150
   

905
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,220
Min Seol Ah?

906
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,720
   

907
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,640
   

908
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,090
Number 1 on the waiting list?

909
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,020
   

910
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,650
No way. Why wasn't I accepted?

911
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,250
I didn't make any mistakes. So why?

912
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,840
Ro Na, it's alright.

913
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,690
Ro Na! Ro Na!

914
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:37,190
Ro Na, where are you going?

915
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,090
Ro Na, that's dangerous!

916
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,240
Ro Na!

917
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:07,940
   

918
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:11,270
Are you really the same age as our Seok Gyeong, a middle school student?

919
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:16,480
Don't you know after you've seen this? We are the same age and she's not even a middle school student.

920
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,130
We don't know where she came from.

921
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:24,030
We called this con artist a teacher and received tutoring from her. Does that make sense?

922
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:25,370
    
    

923
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:30,910
You live in Jewelry Village, but you lied that you studied abroad.

924
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,140
Why did you do such a thing?

925
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,310
Answer me.

926
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:37,750
I'm sorry for lying.

927
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:42,540
But I returned all my tutoring fees when you fired me and I'm no longer Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong's tutor.

928
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,770
So you've done nothing wrong?

929
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:47,460
I taught diligently to earn what you paid me and I was always on time.

930
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,820
Seok Gyeong was the one who wasn't sincere about her studies.

931
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:52,860
And she's the one who insulted me by framing me as a thief.

932
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,370
- Shut up.
 - Seok Gyeong!

933
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,760
How did you become the top scorer for the Cheong Ah Arts admissions?

934
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,860
Is it a sin to become accepted fairly based on my skills?

935
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,940
How would anyone know what a con artist like you did?

936
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:10,030
Maybe you deliberately came into our home to get some information?

937
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:14,570
Would there be any worthwhile information I could get from you?

938
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,870
Seok Gyeong!

939
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,930
This is for lying to and messing with our family.

940
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:22,790
What are you doing?

941
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,900
And this is my warning to you, to live your life properly.

942
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,520
What? Is this unfair?

943
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,520
If you ran wild like an untied horse, you should be punished.

944
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,290
Give me your parents' contact information right now.

945
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:38,150
Please stop.

946
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,800
I don't have parents.

947
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,850
You don't? So you are an orphan?

948
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:44,950
Not even the fundamentals?

949
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,070
Min Seol Ah has nothing to do with us anymore.

950
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,690
She already apologized.

951
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,210
You gave me a bad feeling from the start.

952
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:56,400
Someone who isn't honest gives off a special vibe.

953
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,340
A disgusting vibe that makes others feel unpleasant.

954
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:11,160
But it doesn't seem like you live such an honest life either, Ahjussi.

955
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,450
What did you just say?

956
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:21,800
If you have nothing more to say, I'll be going now.

957
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,990
Where are you going? Hey!

958
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:32,880
Such a vulgar thing. How could you let such a crude person into our lives?

959
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,930
We can't let things end here.

960
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,020
  
    

961
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,040
   

962
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,400
   

963
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,490
   

964
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:56,110
   

965
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,380
   

966
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,920
   

967
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,930
   

968
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:08,920
    

969
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:13,990
 Wait, Student Min Seol Ah. 

970
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,560
I'm sorry, Seok Gyeong's mother.

971
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,210
I did want to apologize to you properly.

972
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:27,570
May I ask what's going on?

973
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,730
Teacher Anna...

974
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:35,290
I mean, Min Seol Ah, you don't seem like a bad person.

975
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:40,670
I don't know if you will believe me, but I needed some money desperately.

976
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:43,110
It was not spent on anything bad.

977
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:47,200
Alright, I will believe you.

978
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,120
But I think you should apologize to the other families, too.

979
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:57,000
If you just run away like this, you are not taking responsibility for what you did.

980
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,660
I understand.

981
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,460
I will do as you ask.

982
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:11,600
I have something to give you, can you wait here for just a moment?

983
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,310
Yes.

984
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,540
Who are you guys?

985
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,850
You should just stay still if you want to stay safe.

986
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:04,140
Why are you so brazen when you're the one who did wrong?

987
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,150
Are you really our age?

988
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:09,200
She took the GED and she lives in Jewelry Village?

989
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,410
And she's an orphan, too.

990
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,570
I'm sorry. I apologize sincerely.

991
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:23,170
Sorry? After stabbing someone in the back. "Oh, sorry" is enough?

992
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,600
I'll make sure to return all the tutoring fees.

993
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,380
I will pay everything back, so please give me a little time.

994
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,890
Wow, so shameless. You're giving me chills.

995
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:35,480
The fact that you tried to even teach us anything is a crime.

996
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,200
I heard you stole Seok Gyeong's keyring.

997
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,490
A total thief and con artist, aren't you?

998
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:43,770
How can she be the top scorer at Cheong Ah Arts?

999
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:45,320
That devalues the school.

1000
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,510
This piece of trash bitch.

1001
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,670
Let me tell you just the facts.

1002
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:53,850
Someone like you cannot attend the same school as us.

1003
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,840
So your top score acceptance at Cheong Ah Arts is, of course, canceled.

1004
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,750
Do you think a top school like Cheong Ah Arts would accept a con artist like you?

1005
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:04,700
You are the top scorer in this nation for delusion.

1006
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:10,210
Yes, I took the GED and I am a poor orphan who lives in Jewelry Village.

1007
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:14,370
I never properly attended school and obviously, I couldn't even dream of vocal lessons.

1008
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:17,620
I worked part-time jobs all day long to earn money.

1009
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:22,640
So what about it? What about you guys, losing to someone like me?

1010
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:25,550
Speak honestly.

1011
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,030
Are you mad because you learned from an orphan like me? Or because you lost to me?

1012
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:33,660
Who lost to you?

1013
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,660
You guys have everything.

1014
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,990
A nice house and parents who gave you a reliable background.

1015
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,490
You have everything you want.

1016
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:47,180
So why are you all crazy about crushing someone like me?

1017
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:51,420
I pity you.

1018
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:55,070
I pity you and I feel sad for you.

1019
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:05,630
Pity? Who are you to pity us?

1020
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,900
Who are you to do that?

1021
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,930
You brought it, didn't you?

1022
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:14,840
Of course.

1023
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:18,730
Ta-da.

1024
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:21,110
What are you planning to do?

1025
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:24,940
You said you were a college student, on leave from UCLA.

1026
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,460
As an adult, you must enjoy some champagne from time to time, right?

1027
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,010
Please don't do this.

1028
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,900
Please let me go home, huh? I beg you.

1029
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:39,580
Don't be afraid.  Starting now, we're just throwing a celebration party.

1030
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:46,080
A grand party to congratulate our Teacher Anna for her top-scoring admission.

1031
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:53,640
Ro Na!

1032
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,000
Ro Na, where are you?

1033
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,260
Ro Na!

1034
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,670
Look at you!  But you said we were pitiful?

1035
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:18,180
Your parents left you because of the way you are!

1036
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:21,230
Top student?

1037
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,460
You can't forget about the cake at a congratulatory party.

1038
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,860
We'll let you go as long as you do everything we ask of you.

1039
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,600
Preparations are complete!

1040
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,190
Save me! Please!

1041
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:43,860
Look over here!

1042
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,410
I'll take some good shots. Your pose is great!

1043
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,700
The visuals are amazing.

1044
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:52,830
This is what Min Seol Ah from Jewelry Village really looks like.

1045
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,450
It suits you so well!

1046
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,630
Why don't you consider changing your career path?

1047
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,800
Let me go.

1048
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:03,500
How dare you act like a teacher when you were nothing?

1049
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,500
Congratulations!

1050
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,290
Congratulations!

1051
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,370
Bae Ro Na was put first on the waiting list.

1052
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:32,430
♫ E che sospiri 

1053
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:35,850
 This voice is... Bae Ro Na? 

1054
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:44,200
♫ La liberta 

1055
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,590
What about Teacher Kwon?

1056
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:02,690
He received the amount you said.

1057
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,520
I said we would sponsor his solo concert.

1058
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,110
Good work. You may go now.

1059
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,840
Teacher Cheon! Teacher Cheon.

1060
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,230
Teacher Cheon, have you heard?

1061
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:22,080
What's the matter?

1062
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,970
Min Seol Ah... the kid who was the top scorer.

1063
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:28,400
She was the kids' math tutor.

1064
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,940
What does that mean...

1065
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,230
Anna Lee, the math tutor.

1066
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:36,800
She is Min Seol Ah, the top scorer for admission to Cheong Ah Arts.

1067
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,900
What?

1068
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,410
Just what is going on here?

1069
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:44,660
It should be a happy day celebrating our children's admissions, but now it's all ruined.

1070
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,520
Teacher Cheon, you should have found out more before hiring her.

1071
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,900
What a humiliation this is.

1072
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:53,420
If there are rumors, we will look so ridiculous.

1073
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,630
We were totally fooled by a 16-year-old girl.

1074
01:30:56,630 --> 01:31:00,670
She forged her school attendance records and even her Citizen ID, how could I know?

1075
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:05,040
If you are going to blame me, everyone hire their own tutors from now on.

1076
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,590
Of course, it's not your fault, Teacher Cheon.

1077
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:12,270
How can we win over such a cunning and wicked person? She schemed to con us.

1078
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:16,390
Kids these days are so scary.

1079
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,450
Su Ryeon, didn't you study abroad in the U.S., too?

1080
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:23,600
You should have felt that something was off after exchanging just a few words with her. But you really had no idea?

1081
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,000
If not, maybe you knew and covered for her anyway?

1082
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,990
I did not know.

1083
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:33,870
But I did think that she had a backstory.

1084
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:37,180
And she promised to apologize to everyone.

1085
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,330
Apology? Did she say that to you, Su Ryeon?

1086
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:43,550
You're not believing such a deceitful scammer, are you?

1087
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:46,730
Shouldn't we come up with some plan to deal with this?

1088
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:50,500
Could this girl really stand up as the top scorer at the admissions ceremony?

1089
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,400
To think, such an evil child attending the same school as our children.

1090
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,740
It's making me shudder.

1091
01:31:55,740 --> 01:32:01,420
That's right. I'm worried that our innocent children will be negatively affected.

1092
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,000
Ro Na!

1093
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:11,230
Ro Na!

1094
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,460
Ro Na!!

1095
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,300
Why are you here like this?

1096
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,500
I looked for you so much.

1097
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,030
Let's go home.

1098
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:45,740
What if you get a cold?

1099
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:47,590
Who cares if I get a cold!

1100
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,890
I don't have any reason to sing anymore.

1101
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,960
I don't need this voice anymore!

1102
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,930
Ro Na, don't do this, please!

1103
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:02,300
Why aren't we rich?

1104
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:05,500
Why do you have a bad relationship with Teacher Cheon?

1105
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,860
It's all your fault.

1106
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:12,090
If it wasn't for you, I would have received lessons from Teacher Cheon.

1107
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:17,010
And I wouldn't have been conned and would've gotten accepted to Cheong Ah Arts!

1108
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:19,810
But you are Number 1 on the waiting list.

1109
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:21,670
We still have hope.

1110
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:23,130
It's all over.

1111
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,870
I don't want to see your face, Mom,

1112
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,950
so please leave me alone!

1113
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:36,470
Mom is so sorry, Ro Na.

1114
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:40,130
I'm sorry Mom has nothing.

1115
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:42,170
I'm so sorry to you.

1116
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:48,430
I'm so sorry I have no power.

1117
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,570
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

1118
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,330
I worked myself to death.

1119
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:56,040
I would really rather die!

1120
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,430
I really don't want to live!

1121
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,170
I'm sorry, Ro Na, I'm sorry.

1122
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:09,470
I'm sorry.

1123

 The Penthouse 
 Preview 

1125
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,830
 Talent? Who needs it? 

1126
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:41,520
 - Money and background is talent.
 - I just need to keep my mouth shut. 

1127
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,730
 How about killing someone to get your daughter admitted? 

1128
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:46,030
 You're a vicious person, aren't you? 

1129
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,700
 Mother and daughter are both quite spectacular. 

1130

 35th Floor. Garden. Penthouse Ahjussi. 

1131
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:53,670
 What a pretty necklace. I haven't seen that one before. 

1132
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:55,770
 I can no longer lie about my feelings. 

1133
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:59,910
 She pretends to be smart. I'm sure she will try to use whatever card she has. 

1134
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:04,260
 But she has no idea that it will backfire on her.
