1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,860
  This is breaking news.  Today, the government announced plans for  a major redevelopment  

2
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,600
 of the underdeveloped Bosong Village district. 

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 The plans are expected to accelerate the project for development in the district 

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,660
 which had been previously scuttled several times. 

5
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,370
We are saved!

6
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,230
We are saved!

7
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,300
 Episode 8 

8
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,880
Ahjussi, I'm rich now!

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,800
I just became rich!

10
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,360
I hit it big!

11
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,820
Did Min Seol Ah die because you tortured her just like me?

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,070
Do you want me to die like Min Seol Ah, too?

13
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,090
I will never die stupidly like she did.

14
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,460
I will make sure the world finds out what you guys did to me

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,510
and punish you for it!

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,100
- Who is that?  Who is it? 
 - I don't know.

17
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,900
Someone take her to the nurse's office.

18
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,310
I'm okay. I can go by myself.

19
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,770
You guys are really incredible.

20
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,910
Do all rich kids fool around like this at school?

21
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,130
Who are you?

22
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,070
Did you  enter someone else's school without permission?

23
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,600
Me?

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,100
- I'm your teacher. 
 - What?

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,300
What are you doing?  Be on the playing field in ten minutes.

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,100
Aren't you going to change into your PE uniforms?

27
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,630
My name is Gu Ho Dong.

28
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm in charge of physical education from now on.

29
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,280
But my temper has a very short fuse

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,070
and I can't stand not being ready for PE class.

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,300
Well. This school is in a mess. A child hanging in mid-air!

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,590
No matter what, I can't just let it slide.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone, ten laps around the field.  Start!

34
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,340
I don't think that's reasonable discipline.

35
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,320
We didn't do anything wrong.

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Bae Ro Na suddenly threatened us and was violent.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,020
Really?

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,290
Then what should I do? This is a teacher's prerogative.

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,260
If you have a problem with it, you guys should become teachers.

40
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,440
What a shit.

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,450
What about how you're dressed, Teach?

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,600
That shabby sweatsuit all stretched out.  How embarrassing.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,830
Well, if you feel sorry for me, buy me something then complain. Huh?

44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,690
Anyone who isn't running right now will be penalized.

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay.  I get it.

46
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,520
Everybody.  One demerit.

47
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,460
Are you still not going to run?

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,700
Everybody two demerits.

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,430
What?

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,400
Everybody three demerits.

51
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,430
That's it,  good running.

52
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,990
Good, good, way to go! One, two.

53
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,330
How can a student be watching TV all day instead of studying?

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,570
It's all ruined.

55
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,810
A few seconds before stamping the contract, the announcement came out.

56
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,540
But that woman Oh Yun Hui is one lucky bitch.

57
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,550
What a truly annoying woman.

58
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,850
All right.  I'll talk to you later.

59
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,810
Oh, did you come? Why did you come when you're busy?

60
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,980
Of course, I should come when my wife has started to work.

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,340
Since you've started, keep up the good work.  Even if you quit anytime, I don't care.

62
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,630
I brought the flowers you like.

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,200
These are black roses. Thanks.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,600
- Do you know what they mean?  
 - I can't say.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,160
You are mine forever.

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,440
 And one more meaning:  Hatred. 

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
What?  You have the strength to fight with a friend but not to run?

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,570
Good.  Six more laps to go.

69
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,570
Seok Gyeong. Seok Gyeong. Wake up

70
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,160
Seok Gyeong, what's the matter?  Wake up. Seok Gyeong.

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,220
That's enough.  Stop it.

72
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,440
All of you. Stay still.

73
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,650
Kid, don't put on a show.

74
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Get up at the count of three. If you don't get up, ten demerits.

75
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,950
One.   Two.  Three.

76
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,650
What kind of teacher are you? Will you be responsible if something is wrong?

77
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm taking her to the nurse's room immediately.

78
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,530
Seok Gyeong. Get up.

79
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,750
Elegant and lovely, it is perfect for you.

80
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,660
That design is too pedestrian.

81
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,140
Did you get the dress Kendall Jenner wore

82
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,800
for the closing of the haute couture collection?

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,360
- Give it to me.  
 - Yes, this way, Madam.

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Just how many bags, clothing, and shoes has she bought?

85
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,470
Is she opening a department store?

86
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,100
 The redevelopment project of Bosong Village, in Gangnam, Seoul, 

87
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,810
 which is the largest ever, is truly beginning. 

88
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,810
 Prior to the selection of the contractor, major construction companies 

89
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,360
 are participating in fierce public relation campaigns 

90
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,660
 and signs of mudslinging, slander, and bribes are appearing. 

91
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,050
It's really being developed?

92
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,920
Does this mean that unlucky bouquet is going to sit on a pile of money?

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Who is the unlucky bouquet?

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,530
It's Bae Ro Na's mother.  Who else would it be?

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,340
Bosong Village is being redeveloped.

96
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,650
What in the world!  Don't say she knew?  That woman.

97
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,820
No way. Even with my intel sources, I didn't even catch it but...

98
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,760
How and with what kind of skill could that unlucky wench do that?

99
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,500
Our more well-off friends can't have missed it.

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,460
Right! Oh Yun Hui, you can start all over again here.

101
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,380
Ro Na, be patient for a little while.

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,640
I will make it so you can live there for sure.

103
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,290
Write everything truthfully.

104
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,190
Why did you break the sculpture,

105
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,100
why did you climb on the hall railings,

106
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,380
and why did you swing a mop at the kids?

107
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,490
 Psychological Counseling. 

108
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,610
Ro Na, are you okay?

109
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,650
What happened? Did you get hurt?

110
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,100
What happened to your throat?  Did it get hurt?

111
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,140
Of all places, the throat. How badly hurt is it?

112
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,660
Don't care. It's not a big deal.

113
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,080
She put on a suicide show.

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,720
You.  Why are you here?

115
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,920
Hello.  I'm Ro Na's homeroom teacher.

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,140
What?  Homeroom teacher?

117
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,510
If you're a con artist, how can you be a teacher?

118
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,360
It's good to see you, bastard.

119
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Ten laps around the playing field?

120
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,370
Don't you know the bodies of the kids in the Vocal Music Department are their instruments?

121
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,770
They said they wouldn't take physical education,

122
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,250
so what's the issue over the simple penalty I gave them?

123
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,730
Cancel the demerits immediately.

124
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,830
The parents are already complaining.

125
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,700
I don't think it's a good idea to cause problems like this at your first class.

126
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,080
Yes. I'll be careful, Department Head.

127
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,700
But the thing is...

128
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,350
Isn't giving demerits a teacher's prerogative?

129
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,510
Teacher Gu Ho Dong.

130
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,100
Why don't we have a chat, Art Department Head, Cheon Seo Jin?

131
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,960
- About what? 
 - Teacher Ma Du Gi—,  no,

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,040
explain why this con-artist is at this school.

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,500
What's the problem of a good vocal teacher being at Cheong Ah Arts School?

134
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,900
That person almost prevented Ro Na from being accepted at this school.

135
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,320
- He intentionally gave us false information— 
 - Do I have to know about such personal matters?

136
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,090
If there is a problem with him, the two of you should resolve it.

137
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,820
More important than that,

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,590
Ro Na caused another incident today.

139
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,900
Exactly how did you educate that child?  She put on a suicide show

140
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,830
and daily incidents that destroy the school atmosphere, including the destruction of school property.

141
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,660
Even though you know that you still dare to raise your voice at me?

142
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,990
Perhaps the Disciplinary Committee will issue a severe punishment.

143
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,380
I think you'd better get ready for it.

144
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
Don't you care about my daughter being injured?

145
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,350
Is this chick a teacher?

146
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,580
This is the teachers' room.  Don't make idiotic noises.

147
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,840
If you feel bad about your daughter's injury, why don't you receive her punishment as her mother?

148
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,650
She has a lot of demerits accumulated, so I don't think a full day of cleaning will be enough.

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,790
Hey, Bae Ro Na!  Because of you, we had to run laps for no reason.

150
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,250
Because of you, we all got demerits. How are you going to take responsibility for it?

151
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,230
Why should I be responsible for your demerits?

152
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,260
How is it you are doing something just like your mother?

153
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,710
Why are you bringing up my mother?  Isn't it enough to go after me?

154
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,230
Don't you know?

155
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,110
Your mom did a suicide show when she was a student at Cheong Ah too.

156
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,480
It's because of her there wasn't anymore Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

157
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,090
A girl, who was jealous of the winner,

158
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,120
cut her own throat with the trophy.

159
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,030
Slash!

160
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,230
For real?

161
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,940
The one who slit her own throat was...

162
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,240
Oh jeez, goosebumps!

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
Stop lying.

164
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,530
If you can't believe us, ask her yourself.

165
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,580
In any case, she may be too embarrassed to tell you the truth.

166
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,600
What?

167
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,410
Ha Eun Byeol is the daughter of Department Head, Cheon Seo Jin?

168
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,800
So, for your future at this school, behave yourself.

169
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,850
- Teacher Gu's life at this school depends on which line you get into. 
 - Yes.

170
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,890
Our music department is the main department of the school.

171
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,700
You can say it's an opportunity that you're a deputy homeroom teacher in the music department.

172
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,300
Yes, I almost made a huge mistake.

173
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,890
Here.

174
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,590
- This is the list of special students. 
 - Really?

175
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,790
At a glance, you look like a country bumpkin,

176
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,230
but if you want to stay with our foundation until retirement,

177
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,500
you understand what needs to be done, don't you?

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,710
But of course. I am a quick learner.

179
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,870
Aigoo, thank you, thank you.

180
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,570
Please give me a lot of guidance in the future, Teacher Ma.

181
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,150
Brush your teeth first.

182
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,930
Ju Seok Hun, Ha Eun Byeol, Lee Min Hyeok,

183
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,200
Yu Je Ni.  Memorized.

184
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,990
-   Dr. Ha, welcome. 
 - I'm sorry.  Because of a late surgery...

185
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,850
That must be tough.

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,150
I asked to see you in a rush because of our investment.

187
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,480
The magnitude of this investment is different from anything we've done before.

188
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,510
- This will be our best ever. 
 - How much will it be?

189
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,790
- ₩150 billion ($150 million). 
 - What?

190
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,850
It's the site of the best land in the area which will be worth ₩300 billion ($300 million) in six months.

191
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,810
No way. Is that land we were talking about available?

192
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,950
Here.

193
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,700
The country's largest shopping village will be built right here.

194
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,920
Bring money as much as you can,

195
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,850
the investment is guaranteed to gross five times more.

196
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,720
Five times as much...  If we invest 1 billion, then we will earn 5 billion?

197
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,800
Ten billion will become 50 billion.  500 times, 100 million!  100 million! 100 million!

198
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,530
The sound of 100 million is really coming out!

199
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,420
But, there is a problem in the middle of that area.  There is an obstinate old geezer holding out.

200
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,310
It had been impossible to develop because the old geezer wouldn't sell his house, wasn't it?

201
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,080
It's up for auction now.

202
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,190
I put pressure on the bank to block his cash flow and he couldn't do anything else.

203
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,080
If I put in the winning bid, it'll be game over.

204
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,820
Now there's no obstacle blocking this plan.

205
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,000
You're the best!

206
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,530
 Who is our Chairman Ju? 

207
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,420
 He's the god who can make something out of nothing. 

208
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,700
 Recording 

209
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,820
I'm considering wagering all the profits I've earned up to now.

210
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,760
 Jokomo CEO Sim Su Ryeon 

211
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,730
Ju Dan Tae.

212
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,190
You'll meet her soon.

213
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,490
Your enemy,

214
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,410
but becoming your ally.

215
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,680
That's something worth seeing!

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,930
It's tear-jerking to see a mother taking care of the demerits of the daughter who caused trouble.

217
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,110
Is it true that you moved into Min Seol Ah's house?

218
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,500
You're very nosy about other people's business.

219
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,280
Anyway, both mother and daughter have gotten so lucky. Now they just have to watch the money roll in.

220
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,920
Even so,  how could anyone alive live in a dead person's house like that?

221
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,600
Even if you like money ...

222
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes, I like money. What of it? Why?

223
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,110
If you're envious that our apartment jumped in value five times, say so!

224
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,160
Why would I be envious of you?

225
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Would I be envious of your cleaning the restroom or living in a tiny Bosong Village apartment?

226
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,000
- Or envy your daughter's demerits? 
 - So, then...

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,540
Mind your own business. If you have nothing to do, go sit at home and count your money.

228
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,370
The bell is ringing.  Aren't you picking up your kid?

229
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,530
That woman!  I'd like to punch her in the mouth!

230
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,200
Sorry!

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Oh, my princess is calling me. Sorry.

232
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,370
- It's me. 
 - Yes, tomorrow I can leave early.  Do you have time?

233
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,490
Mmm, I really like that. I'll make a reservation at a hot restaurant.

234
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,580
 See you tomorrow. 

235
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,030
Oh, you startled me!

236
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,790
Who was on the phone?

237
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,750
Someone who sets up performance events.  They suggested I have a solo recital.

238
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,820
You seem to be in a good mood.

239
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,930
By the way, what happened when you went to meet Father-in-law since he suddenly called you late at night?

240
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:01,040
It was about the foundation. He must have been worried since he let me be in charge of it.

241
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,760
But why are you suddenly curious about it?

242
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,930
You have a problem with my being curious and you don't like my being indifferent.

243
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,240
What the hell do you want then?

244
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,630
If you're so crazy about wanting to do me a favor,  don't do anything.  Don't ask and don't wonder.

245
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,490
That will be enough.

246
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,860
 Eobujirl Sushi  Bar:  Hello, Guest Cheon Seo Jin.   - Confirming your reservation.

257
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,280
Then, come on, Mi Ja!   Wire some allowance to me, coolly!

258
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,130
I know you have some money hidden from your husband!

259
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,350
This is Oppa Gyu Jin's wish!  You will grant my wish, won't you?

260
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,880
I got it, Oppa!  How much do you need?  How much?

261
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,990
Have you ever seen your mommy not granting your wish?

262
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,810
Mi Ja, shall I sing one more song?

263
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,680
It's tiring, isn't it? Drink this red ginseng then continue studying.

264
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,110
- Does the new teacher teach well? Do you like it? 
 - He isn't too bad.

265
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:44,800
 Did you kill her? Min Seol Ah was locked in the mechanical room that day. 

266
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,510
 I know. 

267
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,050
Shouldn't you explain? Why did you say such a strange thing to me?

268
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,070
That I killed Min Seol Ah? Just on what grounds?

269
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,250
Min Seol Ah died at Herapalace.

270
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,880
Didn't she?

271
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,900
Did you lock her in the mechanical room?

272
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,000
Who the hell said so? How dare you say such nonsense.

273
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,570
Before you hear my response, why don't we start with your answer?

274
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,550
Did you really kill Min Seol Ah?

275
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,460
Why would I?

276
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,580
Why would I get blood on my hands getting rid of something so trivial?

277
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,500
If not, never mind.  Good night.

278
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,770
Ju Seok Hun.

279
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,290
What the hell did he see!

280
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,600
 No one is going to visit Min Seol Ah in the mechanical room, right? 

281
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,890
 What if she reveals our relationship? 

282
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,910
 Who would believe her? They would think the crazy kid is struggling desperately. 

283
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,110
 All we have to do is find her damn cellphone. 

284
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,100
 She's not an ordinary child. 

285
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,880
 If we don't take her seriously, we'll suffer for it. 

286
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,060
Both my father and Teacher Cheon Seo Jin,

287
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
they are all filthy.

288
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,460
 What did you do to Min Seol Ah? Did she die after you tortured her like me? 

289
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,270
 Do you want me to die like Min Seol Ah, too? 

290
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,840
Get your act together, Ha Eun Byeol. Ignore everything.

291
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,720
  Eun Byeol. I'm so happy your math grades improved.  Math isn't a big deal, is it? 

292
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,690
 Don't be concerned about Seok Gyeong.  Do it at your own pace. 

293
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,860
  I really like that you are so diligent.  - Anna 

294
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,160
 Why are you ripping that up? 

295
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,170
- Go away, Min Seol Ah.  
 -  Eun Byeol. 

296
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,790
- Don't come near me! 
 -  What's the matter? 

297
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,690
I'm innocent.  Get out of here right now!

298
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,130
 Get your act together, Ha Eun Byeol! 

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,420
Min Seol Ah...

300
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,020
What are you talking about? What do you mean Min Seol Ah?

301
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,740
Did you see something like a ghost?

302
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,070
It was definitely Min Seol Ah. I am scared.

303
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,300
I am so scared that I will go crazy.

304
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,910
Min Seol Ah died, you know that.

305
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,140
No, no. I saw her!

306
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,030
She entered my room for sure.

307
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,190
The fact that Bae Ro Na moved into Min Seol Ah's house began bothering me.

308
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,810
Perhaps, Bae Ro Na and Min Seol Ah are somehow related?

309
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,180
What if Bae Ro Na is attending Cheong Ah Arts School in order to get revenge for Min Seol Ah?

310
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,280
No. What if Min Seol Ah is still alive?

311
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,330
Come to your senses, please!

312
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,570
I am scared, I am so scared.

313
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,550
Get up. Get up now!

314
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,020
Get up! Follow me!

315
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,310
Where are we going?

316
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,510
I don't want to. Min Seol died in here.

317
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,330
Right!  She died in here!

318
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,040
But as you said, she died!  She can't come back again!

319
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,770
Mum, I don't want to.

320
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,960
I am scared. I really don't want to.

321
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,180
Do as I say!

322
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,300
Now listen to me carefully.

323
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,950
You can't do anything forever if you don't erase Min Seol Ah from your life.

324
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,810
You have to overcome her by yourself.

325
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,370
If not, you'll lose to Min Seol Ah or Bae No Ra.

326
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,120
I told you what kind of ill fate there was between Bae Ro Na's mom and me, didn't I?

327
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,380
She stabbed her own neck then tried to frame me for the stabbing.

328
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,810
That's how this field is going.  People will do anything to win.

329
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,720
How can you beat Bae Ro Na with such a weak mentality like yours?

330
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,260
You can't even control yourself so you see things and struggle.

331
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,310
At this rate, how will you ever win the grand prize at the Cheong Ah Art Festival?

332
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,270
Overcome it yourself.  Break free of Min Seol Ah.

333
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,740
So then you can beat Bae Ro Na.

334
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,870
I don't care about anything else.

335
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,470
But I can't forgive you if you lose to Bae Ro Na.

336
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,320
I want to beat her too.  I also want to beat her to the point of I'm going crazy.

337
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,060
Then beat her. That's all!

338
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,590
You know "Sempre Libera" from Verdi's opera, right?

339
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,710
Min Seol Ah sang that song for her entrance examination.

340
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,300
Practice that song here from now on.

341
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,740
Here? How can I sing here?

342
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,230
You have to. Only then, can you get over this.

343
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,890
You can't even dream of getting into Seoul National University School of Music with a mentality that's fragile as glass.

344
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,500
In order for me to become a Chairwoman at the Cheong Ah Foundation, you must become the best.

345
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,270
Do you understand me?

346
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,900
Still... I can't...

347
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,490
You can do it, right?

348
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,080
I'll go outside.

349
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,850
You have to sing loud enough for me to hear it outside.

350
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,110
If I don't like what I hear, I'll lock you up in here all night. So you'd better do it right.

351
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,390
Mom, Mom!

352
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,870
What will I do if you leave me here, Mom?

353
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,800
Mom!

354

357
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,030
Hello?

358
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,650
Ro Na's mom?

359
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,600
 Ro Na hasn't come home yet. 

360
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,510
 I think something might have happened to her at school today. 

361
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,080
By chance, if she might think of doing something bad...

362
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,130
I'm going crazy worrying about her.

363
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,790
 Didn't you know that? Your mom put on some suicide show when she was attending Cheong Ah Arts School. 

364
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,990
  Well, it is an embarrassing past, so it's better your daughter doesn't know 

365
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,240
 just how greedy humans can be...  

366
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,750
 You were punished after trying to grab too much.  

367
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,900
That's why...

368
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,480
Teacher Cheon hates me so much.

369
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,310
Poor thing.

370
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,130
You don't have a home either?

371
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,280
Did someone abandon you?

372
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,630
Where are you going? It's dangerous!

373
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,540
Ro Na!

374
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,310
Ahjumma.

375
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,790
What are you doing here? Your mom is so worried.

376
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,600
What's wrong?

377
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,310
Ah, nothing. Let's hurry in.

378
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,250
Thank you for today, Ahjumma.

379
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,730
Take these.

380
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,930
You'll need them from now on.

381
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,540
Thank you very much.

382
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,210
Ro Na.

383
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,780
Can you sometimes send me pictures of this dog?

384
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,550
I think I'm going to wonder about it.

385
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,230
Of course.

386
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,200
Goodbye.

387
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,440
Go in.

388
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,530
Ro Na!

389
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,450
What on earth happened to you?

390
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,240
Thank you!

391
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,190
Do you know how worried I was? Where were you?

392
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,170
Why did you turn off your phone?

393
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,680
What is with this dog?

394
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,100
It doesn't have a home. From today on I will raise it.

395
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,410
What?  How can we keep a dog in such a small apartment?

396
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,090
It's the price for me living here, so don't fight it.

397
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,660
Ah...

398
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,430
What?

399
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,270
I heard it all, the reason why you have a bad relationship with Teacher Cheon Seo Jin.

400
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,010
Why you quit singing and also that neck scar... I know it all.

401
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,860
From the start.

402
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,500
Ro Na.

403
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,550
At the Cheong Ah Arts Festival, you injured yourself to get the trophy, I heard.

404
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,800
No, it never happened like that, really. I—

405
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,080
Why did you stop in the middle of speaking?

406
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,180
Was it really like that?

407
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,170
Did you stab your own neck because you were jealous of Teacher Cheon?

408
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,330
Is that why?

409
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,660
You don't believe me either.

410
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,690
Also then, now too... no one believes me.

411
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,700
If even you don't believe me...

412
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:50,890
It's not like that, I believe Mom... I believe that Mom would never do something like that.

413
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,430
I will get you that trophy.

414
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,350
It was originally yours.  Yours got stolen.

415
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,260
I know you won against Teacher Cheon with your voice.

416
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,690
Thank you, my daughter. Thank you for believing me.

417
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,590
I am your daughter.

418
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,330
If I don't believe my mom then, who will?

419
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,950
About today's incident as well, I had to be like that.

420
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,880
Somehow, I have to hang in there.

421
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,800
Let's go.

422
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,440
Let's go, Eun Byeol.

423
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,670
Since the midterm chorus has been decided, I will test you again to distribute the parts.

424
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,150
- Ah, Teacher! 
 - Ah, Teacher!

425
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,860
Don't complain, just get ready.

426
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,880
Bravo!  Bravo! Bravo!

427
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,710
As I expected, it's you, Ha Eun Byeol.   Maintain your soprano.

428
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,740
Yes, Teacher.

429
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,620
Next, Bae Ro Na.

430
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,120
♪ Ah — ♪  
 - Cut! Cut! Cut!

431
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,500
Bae Ro Na, you'll sing mezzo. 
  (Mezzo-soprano - A singing voice between soprano and alto) 

432
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,880
Pardon?  Why am I singing mezzo?

433
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,590
If anyone hears my song, they can tell I sing soprano.

434
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,220
Who will hear it? I, as your teacher, decide which part you're doing.  How dare you insolently insist on something?

435
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,310
Your voice is better suited to mezzo.

436
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,640
No!  I don't agree with it.

437
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,360
I think my voice sounds most beautiful when I sing high notes.

438
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I can't understand why my voice is mezzo.

439
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,070
Alright.

440
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,140
Then if you perfectly sing the song I suggest, I'll admit you're a soprano.

441
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,470
Can you do that?

442
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,250
Yes.  I'll give it a try.

443
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,040
From the Mignon opera,

444
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,020
the last part of "Je Suis Titania".

445
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,050
- Oh, my! 
 - Ohhh!

446
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,990
How can she sing that song?

447
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,520
It would be hard even for an experienced prima donna of an opera troupe to sing the song, right?

448
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,330
Are you ready?

449
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,160
Teacher Catherine?

450
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,450
So you didn't make Bae Ro Na sing mezzo after all?

451
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,340
I had no choice.

452
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,650
She sang the soprano parts so well.

453
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,130
She even had scale and technique so perfect that it's hard to believe a high schooler was singing.

454
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,680
Do you call that an excuse right now!

455
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,190
I asked you to make sure Eun Byeol did not overlap with her.

456
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,820
All the other kids were watching as well, there was no other way.

457
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,750
I'm sorry.

458
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,670
Keep an eye on Seok Gyeong too.  The person Eun Byeol competitively cares the most about is her.

459
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,570
Eun Byeol's skill dramatically increases day by day, so you don't need to worry about Seok Gyeong.

460
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,210
Then, bye.

461
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,470
Bae Ro Na...

462
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,820
I should nip her in the bud.

463
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,390
Hello.

464
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,750
If that is the case, I am very curious about it.

465
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,570
Why did Bae Ro Na get on Teacher Cheon's bad side?

466
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,700
I didn't know you're working.

467
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,630
I've been busy eating and living, I haven't even seen such a classy place.

468
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,500
Is this something you've always been doing?

469
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,420
It was something my mom started, but now I am in charge.

470
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,350
Oh and congratulations.

471
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,310
I heard Bosong Village's redevelopment has been decided

472
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,910
and you just moved in there.

473
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,790
Luckily, it happened that way.

474
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,370
I'm very envious.

475
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,080
It's nothing to be envious of, it really happened because of sheer luck.

476
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,640
I want to start some biding to earn some pocket money.

477
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,110
By any chance, can you help me?

478
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,850
What do I know about it?  I'm not an expert.

479
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,680
Where are you planning to move to next?

480
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,090
You can't keep living in Bosong Village, once the residents start moving out once the redevelopment phase is announced.

481
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,080
Yes, I've been thinking of moving out quickly for No Ra's sake.

482
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,170
How about Hera Palace?

483
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,660
What?

484
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,510
How am I qualified to live there?

485
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,790
What kind of qualification is needed? The places people live in are all the same.

486
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,580
No... it's different.

487
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,380
The place a person lives in represents their character, position,

488
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,380
and power in this world.

489
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,070
Then you have more reason to move into Hera Palace.

490
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,960
For Ro Na's sake.

491
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,120
I told you a mom should do anything for her child's sake.

492
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,850
Ah, are you free tonight?

493
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:28,650
I had a movie booked today, but my husband suddenly has an appointment.

494
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,500
Do you want to go together?

495
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,260
 Eobujirl Sushi  Bar:  Hello, Guest Cheon Seo Jin.   - Confirming your reservation. 
 - Date: 2020/03/05  - Party of 2 

496
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,050
Where are you?  I'm already here.

497
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,520
Customer, do you have a reservation? May I help you?

498
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,980
O-Oh...

499
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,610
- Is someone there? 
 - It's nothing.

500
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,860
Enjoy the meal.

501
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,030
We want some privacy, so you don't need to come until we call you.

502
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,040
Yes, understood.

503
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,540
I missed this scent.

504
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,060
Do you know you're getting bolder?

505
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,400
I think you don't know me well.  I haven't even started yet.

506
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,060
After dinner, what are we going to do?

507
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,260
I'm looking forward to tonight's main course.

508
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,010
  I think I will be a little late, would you mind going in first?  

509
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,910
Wow, awesome!

510
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,380
It's really good.

511
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,070
I can't believe I'm here.

512
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,470
Where is my seat?

513
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,200
Here it is.

514
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,170
It's really Cheon Seo Jin.

515
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,410
Who on earth is he?

516
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,800
Seok Gyeong's father!

517
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,760
-  You're inside the movie room, aren't you?  I'm on my way in.   
 - No, no.

518
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,670
I'm leaving right now, just wait there for me.

519
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,930
Those crazy people.

520
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,020
Are you here to meet up with me?  Let's go inside.

521
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,010
No, you can't go in, Seok Gyeong's mom.

522
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,030
Why not? Did something happen?

523
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,690
That is...

524
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,300
Please speak.

525
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,530
No... Seok Gyeong's father is inside.

526
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,730
Why would he be here?

527
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,970
He told me that he would be having a meeting late into the night

528
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,380
You must have seen it wrong.

529
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,060
No!

530
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,120
He was with a woman.

531
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,710
What are you talking about?

532
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,260
Seok Gyeong's mom.

533
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,700
At a time like this, soju is the best medicine.

534
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,600
Just drink it all in one sip first.

535
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,350
Good.

536
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,400
I know well how you feel.

537
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,430
Ro Na's late dad acted like that.

538
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:52,630
He got completely drunk, fell from a railing to his death.

539
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:58,700
But until the moment he died, he was having fun with another woman.

540
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,660
He had never given me a penny for the living expenses.

541
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,370
But he bought her expensive clothes and got a store for her by taking out a loan against our house.

542
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,300
All he left for me was debt. Only debt.

543
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,900
Oh my.  How could he do that?

544
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,750
He had already died so I couldn't take it out on him properly, not even once.

545
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,230
After burying him,

546
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,100
I carried deep resentment in my heart.

547
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,900
Drink slowly.  Because of me...

548
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,220
How could he leave such a kind and pretty woman like you?

549
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,780
How could he have an affair with a wench like Cheon Seo Jin?

550
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,470
I'm just so upset.

551
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,940
You're like an older sister to me.

552
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,770
Since I brought it up, can I call you Unni from now on?

553
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,580
Unni, you also just call me Yun Hui, casually.

554
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,400
I'll help you, Unni.

555
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,870
You're up against Cheon Seo Jin.

556
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,850
You said the two of you were classmates, right?

557
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,100
We attended the same high school.

558
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,750
If a deity really exists and says he won't punish me for killing someone,

559
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:35,640
she is the one I really want to kill with my own hands for sure.

560
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,170
 Search: Cheon Seo Jin 
 Daily Focus, Today Daily, Today Magazine... 

561
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,760
 Interview 1: Trauma occurred in an incident when Cheon Seo Jin was almost stabbed with a trophy by her high school rival.  

562
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,010
 ...the day Cheon Seo Jin can't forget...  a friend in the same class took the world away from her... 

563
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,030
   

564
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,310
 3.17.2020, 16:08:11 Move Cinema Theater Tickets Purchased, 
 ₩160,000 

565
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,810
 Do you have time tonight?  

566
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:18,020
 I have movie tickets, but my husband suddenly has an appointment. 

567
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,000
 Will you come with me?  

568
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,440
   

569
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,570
It was also Cheon Seo Jin who made my Ro Na miss the stage in the Matriculation Ceremony.

570
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,460
Although I don't have any evidence, I'm sure of it, since she has always been like that.

571
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,680
When there was something she wanted to have, she had to have it

572
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,710
and by all means, she took it.

573
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,300
You must have your eyes wide-open.

574
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,310
If not, you might lose your husband and all that wealth to her.

575
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,920
Unni...

576
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,770
In fact...

577
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,130
Not long ago, my daughter died.

578
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:22,230
Unni, did you have another daughter, other than Seok Gyeong and Seok Hun?

579
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,260
I barely managed to pull myself together and move on...

580
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,070
That son of a b**ch...

581
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,580
Don't cry, it's not worth your tears.

582
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,570
Seriously, because of that s**tty bastard,

583
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,760
why are you suffering by yourself?

584
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,460
I've done it all before,

585
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,200
but even if you cry, they will treat you like an idiot.

586
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,190
Cheer up, Unni.

587
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,420
Who is this?

588
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,420
Hello?

589
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,280
Who is this?

590
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,680
What is this for?  It's already late.

591
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,050
Thanks for coming.

592
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,500
Why are you so drunk?

593
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,930
Is there something going on between you and Seo Jin?

594
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,420
No... Nothing...

595
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,000
We are very happy, you know.

596
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,910
Then, why did you call me?

597
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,980
If you have something to tell me, hurry up and go ahead.

598
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,530
I don't want to get any unnecessary misunderstandings.

599
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,350
I'm sorry.

600
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:26,300
At that time and even now, to you, I'm always sorry.

601
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,560
Is that what you wanted to say?

602
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,540
You're drunk, so go home.

603
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,350
Yun Hui...

604
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,320
Don't hate me too much.

605
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,290
Just to live like this,

606
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,780
did you dump me?

607
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,290
How much on earth did you drink?

608
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,290
Ha Yun Cheol, come on, stand up.

609
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,220
They must be crazy!

610
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
 Here's the payment, thanks. 

611
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,060
Thank you!

612
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,420
Miss, Miss? Oh...

613
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,350
What's this?  This two-shot is too dangerous, though.

614
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:37,980
This late at night, past midnight, with the first love, just two of you...

615
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,760
Come on, don't just stand there, help me.  He's so heavy.

616
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,490
All right, come here.

617
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,690
Our Dr. Ha is totally wasted.

618
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,390
He usually doesn't drink this much, though.

619
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:55,950
To think you two had drinks together, you look too perfectly sober.

620
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,700
Or is your alcohol tolerance super huge?

621
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,450
Please take care of him.

622
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,950
You two, are you really seeing each other?

623
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,130
It's not something like that.

624
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,360
Crazy bastard, why is he smirking?

625
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,300
Dr. Ha is subtly romantic, isn't he?

626
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,620
He even paid the settlement fee of ₩100 million, eh?

627
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:26,060
When he gave that money to his first love behind his wife's back,

628
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,600
that already showed that it was true love!

629
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,760
What do you mean by that?  Settlement fee?

630
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,120
At that time, you told me that Cheon Seo Jin dropped the charge...

631
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,200
Wasn't that the case?

632
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,190
Dang, you fool.  Did you believe that?

633
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,360
Teacher Cheon, with her sh**ty temper, would never do such things.

634
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,180
Dr. Ha, you're even very good at keeping a secret.

635
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,040
He is a man... a true man.

636
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:59,020
Next time, have a drink with Gyu Jin too, please.

637
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,880
Crazy bastard...

638
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,190
Ms. Oh Yun Hui, have a good night!

639
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:10,290
What on earth... What's her devilish charm to even swallow ₩100 million?

640
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,390
Stand up straight, please!

641
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,790
Ah, dang!

642
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,660
Why did he drink so much?  Oh my god...

643
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,440
What happened to him?

644
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,830
I know, right?  He was already drunk when I met him.

645
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:29,090
By any chance, have you two fought?

646
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,120
Why would we?

647
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,160
Honey?

648
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,760
Never mind, if not.

649
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,580
Ah, about Dr. Ha... No, forget it.

650
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,370
Forget it.

651
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,530
You should keep an eye on him.

652
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:51,230
By his nature, a person with a twisted mind (inferior complex) is really good at womanizing.

653
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,220
Well, I just heard about it before.

654
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,090
What am I talking...  I've got to go.

655
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,300
I should have ramen.

656
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,510
Seriously.

657
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,680
Sorry, Yun Hui...

658
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,930
Oh Yun Hui?

659
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,840
- Are you feeling better? 
 - Yeah...

660
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,300
Last night, whom did you drink so much with?

661
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,960
Well... who would that be?

662
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,800
Of course, I was with Chairman Ju and Attorney Lee.

663
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,450
I see.

664
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,320
Drink moderately or you will ruin your stomach.

665
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,200
Have some hangover food before leaving.  I'll head out first.

666
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,900
- Eun Byeol, let's go. 
 - Yeah.

667
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,100
- Eun Byeol, have a nice day.  
 - Okay.

668
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,900
It's for the fighting spirit.  You need to have something to eat to cheer you up,

669
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,270
I don't have any appetite.

670
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,370
It's so hard to meet his eyes.

671
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,610
You can't get weak at a time like this.

672
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,650
I said you must prepare for the worst.

673
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:55,880
I thought all night about what we talked about yesterday.

674
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,860
- What? 
 - You said you wanted to bid at the auction.

675
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,160
Let me help you, Unni.

676
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,240
Really?  Will you help me?

677
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,760
I'll try my best.

678
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,200
So, don't ever let a woman like Cheon Seo Jin get the best of you.

679
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,960
Actually, I've seen the auction material in my husband's study.

680
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,460
I think my husband is trying to buy something.

681
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,680
Where is it?

682
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,140
A new apartment will be built around here.

683
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,370
If you get in...

684
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:41,990
As you see, here is an intersection...

685
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,930
 A 32-floor building will stand out at the center of the business district. 
 You're guaranteed to get paid at least ₩700 thousand per month. 

686
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,900
Unni, I saw it. It's awesome.  Awesome.

687
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,760
No.  There is a rumor there is going to be a shopping center built nearby.

688
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,510
It's almost certain.

689
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:08,400
Unni, we absolutely must have the winning bid.

690
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,700
Okay. I will trust only you.

691
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,250
I'm sorry, Yun Hui.

692
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,120
I'm going to take advantage of you.

693
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,170
We completely signed the contracts with all the nearby buildings.

694
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,160
The giant project that the three of us put as much as

695
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,000
₩150 billion on has been completed.

696
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,100
The auction is scheduled for tomorrow.  What do you think, shall we go together?

697
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,720
No.  Go by yourself, Attorney Lee.

698
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,990
If too many people gather, worthless small fry will get too excited.

699
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,830
That's true.  How much should I spend?

700
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:54,900
You don't need to bid too much since it came out cheap for the auction due to the owner's bankruptcy.

701
00:59:54,900 --> 01:00:01,200
Just add 10 million to the base price and it will fall into our hands.

702
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,780
What is this?

703
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:32,900
Now we will become the  cash-richest people in South Korea.

704
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:46,390
It's 10 minutes prior to the deadline of accepting applications! 
    

705
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,430
Awake, you bastards!

706
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,050
What are you doing, you bastards?

707
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,280
You rotten bastards!  the house that I inherited from my ancestors—

708
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,000
You're here again!

709
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,300
How can you hit a person?

710
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,100
Take him out!

711
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,140
Kill me, you bastards!

712
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,890
- No! 
 - Take him out!

713
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,910
 Biding Envelope 

714
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,690
   

715
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,130
Go away!  Go away!

716
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,200
Wow, he really lives his life very hard.

717
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:48,220
Unni. The bid went in under my name,

718
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,770
because your husband shouldn't find out.

719
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,880
It should be a piece of cake because I added 30 million to the base price.

720
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,910
Who did you say? Oh Yun Hui?

721
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,920
Don't say.  How did she know the building?

722
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,620
Without a doubt, it was Oh Yun Hui!

723
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,100
We can't develop the entire site without that house.  What are we going to do now?

724
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,410
If construction is delayed, it will naturally become a money pit.

725
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,290
How will you handle the interest which is piling up?

726
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:20,460
It's my friends' money which was obtained at high interest.

727
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:25,300
We put 150 billion in there!  One hundred and fifty billion!

728
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:29,100
My money is 90 billion of that! So shut up!

729
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,050
Who organized this in the first place?

730
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,150
I also put in as much as thirty billion!

731
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,270
By begging my mother I scraped that money together!

732
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,200
If that money is lost, I'll be killed by my mom, understand!

733
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:45,080
Take your hands off me!  How dare you!

734
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,190
What the hell are you doing!

735
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,820
I believed only you and I invested, so you should take responsibility for this, no matter what!

736
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,060
"You?"  Did you just say "you"? 
 ( TN - Saying "you" in the form used is considered rude.) 

737
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,450
Yes. You. Right now I can't see anything so I don't care about manners.

738
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,900
- You bastard!  
 -  What?  Bastard?

739
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:04,720
You're blowing up my entire fortune and my friends' money but you are cursing me?

740
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,100
We don't have time to do this. Quickly we need to come up with a solution!

741
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,660
Do you want to see me in handcuffs?

742
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,130
I said to shut your traps!

743
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,710
It's not over yet.  But you show how low you are like this?

744
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,300
I'll solve it!

745
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,980
I'll meet with that woman, Oh Yun Hui, personally.

746
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,070
Bravo.

747
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:46,560
I am so nervous.  I didn't know you would really win the bid.

748
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,720
But will that building really make money?

749
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,340
In order to redevelop there, structurally, that building is absolutely necessary.

750
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,280
Your husband also knew it so that was why he jumped in to buy it.

751
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,730
That holdout's  house is really in the center.

752
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,130
Thanks.

753
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,290
I feel like I really have a sister now.

754
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,760
After disposing of what was bought at the auction, I'm going to split the profit with you.

755
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,540
But I wanted to express my feelings right away, so I prepared this.

756
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,320
Please accept this, Yun Hui.

757
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,680
I would really like to be cool and decline,

758
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,770
but I am a little short on cash right now, Unni.

759
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:30,060
I will really put it to good use, Unni.  Thank you.

760
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,670
Shall we toast?

761
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,090
Shall we?

762
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,040
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

763
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,110
Mom's here.

764
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,900
Mom, why are you so—  Have you been drinking alcohol?

765
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,650
Ro Na, do you know what this is?

766
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:54,770
It's your present.

767
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,400
- What's all of this? 
 - Clothing.  You don't have a Burberry.

768
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,210
I bought you a trench coat.

769
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,830
Why did you buy so much?

770
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,900
Wait a moment.  There is a flowery dress.

771
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:13,900
It's pretty, isn't it? It looks wonderful.

772
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:19,850
Ro Na.  I'm really going to do everything for you which I couldn't do all this time.

773
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:25,110
From now on,  I'm only going to open a rosy path for you, so trust me.

774
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:27,180
Okay?

775
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,090
My daughter, may I give you a hug which I  haven't done for a long time?

776
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,080
My daughter.

777
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,640
Oh, the smell of alcohol!

778
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,520
Go away.

779
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,870
Kiss Mom.

780
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,560
Why are you moving away? Ro Na, kiss me.

781
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,020
Mom, I don't like being next to you.

782
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,690
It's nice.

783
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,600
I love you, my daughter. I love you very much.

784
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,940
I love you too.

785
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,800
 Please help me.  Please save me, Ahjumma. 

786
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,740
Right.  I remember.

787
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:35,790
At Herapalace that day

788
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,430
I saw Min Seol Ah.

789
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,300
Sugar, what's the matter?

790
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,200
If you bark late at night, you will get people up.

791
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,630
Stop it. I said to stop it.

792
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,530
Sugar, where are you going?

793
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,030
Oh my.

794
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,300
Ahjumma, I asked you to help me.

795
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,000
Mom, Mom. What's the matter?

796
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,740
Ro Na.

797
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:35,970
Mom, Sugar is strange.

798
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,000
She's not breathing.

799
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,760
What do you mean? Up until now, she kept on barking.

800
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,860
Sugar, you can't die.

801
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,740
Mom, what should I do?

802
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,200
Sugar. Sugar. Wake up.

803
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,630
Sugar.

804
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,930
 Min Seol Ah 
 010-0498-3208 

805
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:06,800
 Is Sugar Min Seol Ah's dog? 

806
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,500
Sugar. Sugar. Wake up.

807
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:24,500

809
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,230
 Let's move. 

810
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:39,830
 Chairman Ju Dan Tae is very angry right now. 

811
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,780
 I know all, that you met Oh Yun Hui. 

812
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,320
 This means there is someone who gives her the real estate information and watches her back. 

813
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,850
 I think, Sim Su Ryeon, that woman is putting on a play. 

814
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,690
  Maybe he knows your wife's secret. 

815
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:53,360
 If you don't want to die, shut up your mouth and talk to me. 

816
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,170
 She is being threatened? 

817
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,730
 Are you Min Seol Ah's murderer? 

818
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,960
 I will believe you.
