1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,740
That night, she was with me.

2
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,560
At Hera Palace. 
    

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,610
Everything should've been recorded on the security footage.

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,090
You should all stop this witch hunt already.

5
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,810
How exactly is pushing the blame onto an innocent person for the benefit of Cheong Ah Arts?

6
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,060
Min Seol Ah's death has already been confirmed to be suicide!

7
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,510
Must you really create another victim to sleep soundly at night?

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,070
Why did Dr. Ha step in when everything was perfectly set?

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,170
So annoying.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,790
I understood completely.

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,450
What if our kids face disciplinary action?

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,090
Nonetheless, we have to minimize it.

13
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,330
Are you all right?

14
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,900
Yes.

15
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,150
I believe you.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,660
That you didn't have ill intentions.

17
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,960
You have to pull through, for your daughter at least.

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,790
Ro Na... please make sure to protect her.

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,990
I will... Thank you.

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,010
 The worker for the nation, Jo Sang Heon will protect you. 

21
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,250
 You may send your support payments to this account, 320-61-055893. 

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,770
 From The Happy Future Party for Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon 

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,360
This bastard.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,350
I don't think I'll be able to have lunch until the meeting is over. Is that okay?

25
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,820
Of course.

26
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,150
I'm excited at the thought of going on a date with you. It's been so long.

27
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,540
Don't worry about me and take your time with your work.

28
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,690
Okay then. I'll be back soon.

29
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,410
What are you doing?

30
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,630
Please leave or I will alert the Chairman.

31
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,830
Please help me! Help me just one more time!

32
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,170
Jo Sang Heon knows that Seol Ah is my daughter!

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,800
He's threatening me right now!

34
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,940
I need to find dirt on him.

35
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,430
My husband has to know something.

36
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,390
I need to know what Jo Sang Heon did to my Seol Ah.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,630
Please help me just one more time.

38
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,710
I had been doing background checks on Jo Sang Heon per the Chairman's orders.

39
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,060
He was too snake-like.

40
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,580
   

41
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,520
That devil!

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,230
You should start by releasing this.

43
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,320
 Managing Editor 

44
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,510
Everybody, gather here!  Quickly!

45
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,040
It's about Jo Sang Heon!

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,790
It's about Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon!

47
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,050
Jo Sang Heon, this is only the beginning.

48
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,840
 Last night, one media company reported 

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,180
 an adultery scandal between the two-term 

50
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,530
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon and an actress. 

51
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,810
 Assemblyman Jo is insisting that this is groundless fake news. 

52
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,530
 He has announced that he will file a lawsuit 

53
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,060
 against the people who spread this rumor. 

54
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,310
 Reporter Song, please tell us the details. 

55
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,780
 This wave of controversy will greatly affect the future election. 

56
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,370
Oh Yun Hui. This was your doing, wasn't it?

57
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,920
If you took my money, you should've kept your mouth shut for the rest of your life.

58
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,240
What are you talking about, Assemblyman Jo?

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,590
You released the news! How dare you act innocent!

60
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,830
Come here right now and return every cent I gave you

61
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,060
or I'm going to ruin your daughter's life forever!

62
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,780
H-Hello? Hello?

63
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,900
Hello? Assemblyman Jo?

64
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,620
She's not afraid of anything, is she?

65
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,270
How dare she stab me, Jo Sang Heon, in the back!

66
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,690
I'll never go down alone.

67
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,020
I worked so hard to make my way up here.

68
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,830
 Oh Yun Hui's Family Report 

69
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
 Oh Yun Hui's Whereabouts 

70
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,260
What took you so long!

71
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,820
You're so dead.

72
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,450
How... did you know I was...

73
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,330
You must have been in a hurry, Madame.

74
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,870
May I come in?

75
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,600
Are you here to negotiate? But it's too bad, I'm actually busy.

76
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,720
I'll call you later, without Chairman Ju's knowledge.

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,380
- Let's talk now. 
- I said I would call you!

78
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,980
Did you like it? My gift?

79
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,240
It was the headline news all night.

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
How does it feel to receive the public's attention?

81
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,590
It was you. The informant.

82
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,440
Then, shall we begin? The negotiation?

83
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,890
 Hope Orphanage 
Overseas Adoptions 
Individual List of Primary Children 

84
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,370
- What is this? 
- You remember, right?

85
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,730
The orphans you personally adopted out.

86
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,360
The disgusting crimes you've committed until now.

87
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,710
How is that a crime?

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,330
They were adopted to rich families where they could get whatever they wanted, thanks to me.

89
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,380
You used these poor children to run a business?

90
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
You can't call yourself human.

91
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,630
What bullshit is this?

92
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,700
These kids all had their adoptions canceled.

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,650
Just like my Seol Ah.

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,200
 Where are we going, Dad? 

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,340
 We're going to see your older brother. 

96
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,950
 My older brother? 

97
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,190
 Yes. He's a bit ill. 

98
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,030
 So you'll have to help him out, Anna. 

99
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,140
 You can do that, right? 

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,920
 That was the day I learned 

101
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,230
 that I had a sick older brother. 

102
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,470
 I didn't steal it! It was someone else! 

103
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,530
 Shut up! 

104
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,970
 Oppa! Oppa, say something! 

105
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,320
 All those kids were returned the moment the bone-marrow transplantation was completed. 

106
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
They were forcefully deported!

107
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,180
Did you adopt these children out to use them as bone marrow donors?

108
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,510
And once their job was done, they were framed with a crime so they would be deported, right?

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,980
Look here. I have no idea what you're talking about.

110
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,740
How am I supposed to know what those families did with the kids?

111
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,470
You set them up with this plan from the start.

112
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,390
That's how you built a ₩10 billion building, isn't it?

113
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,910
Do you have any proof?

114
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,350
Do I need proof...

115
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,620
for this to be a crime?

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,440
These are the papers that connect you to Director Min.

117
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm also well aware that he's been laundering your slush fund money.

118
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,980
Well, you do work hard Madame Sim.

119
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,030
Are you that desperate to make sure you're not kicked out of your house?

120
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,960
But, did you know...

121
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,420
You're the one who made that child end up that way. You're the one who killed her.

122
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,500
Because you abandoned her!

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,130
What do you know to be blabbing?

124
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,390
You'd better beg for forgiveness and receive punishment for the inhumane acts you've done.

125
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,290
Because I'm going to reveal to the world what you did to my Seol Ah.

126
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,880
I've been a politician for so long. You really think I don't have my own connections?

127
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,080
And one of them is your husband, Ju Dan Tae.

128
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,770
If you're curious, why don't we call him directly to find out?

129
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,840
Let go! I said, let go!

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,900
Let go!

131
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,370
Damn it!

132
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,360
You...

133
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm going to kill you!

134
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,000
Assemblyman Jo, I'm here!

135
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,160
Assemblyman Jo? It's me, Oh Yun Hui.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Are you inside?

137
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,080
Assemblyman Jo, I'm coming in!

138
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,800
Assemblyman Jo, are you here?

139
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,450
Assemblyman Jo?

140
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,160
    
   (Ambulance Service in South Korea) 

141
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,960
   

142
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,370
Why are Ro Na's pictures here?

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,230
 Come to my house right now, and return every single penny I gave you 

144
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,960
 or I'll make sure to ruin your daughter's life! 

145
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,660
She's someone I know.

146
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,430
You have to get out of here first. I'll take care of the rest.

147
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,570
A person is dead.

148
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,190
Trust me and leave. Go now.

149
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,010
Get out of here.

150
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,950
   

151
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,680
 Your call cannot be connected. 

152
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,290
Where the hell is she!

153
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,340
I-I d-didn't see anything.

154
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,470
I don't know anything. I didn't see anything.

155
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,490
Are you sure it's all taken care of?

156
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,360
The school's reputation almost hit bottom.

157
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,220
What's this about a "group lynching?" And it happens to involve my, the Chairman's, granddaughter?

158
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,610
What kind of school do you think this is?

159
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,870
It's been the greatest private school for the past 50 years.

160
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm sorry Father. Something like this will never happen again.

161
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,780
Why did Eun Byeol do such a thing?

162
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,830
Stop it, Mom and Dad. My husband

163
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,150
prepared this especially for the two of you today.

164
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,150
Right. I heard your resort is receiving many compliments.

165
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,620
Yes, we reached the highest number of sales last month.

166
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,190
You take after your father-in-law, so your business will really take off.

167
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,410
This is why the family household is important.

168
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,250
I'll excuse myself first. I have to return to the hospital.

169
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,500
- Sit down. 
- Enjoy your meal, everyone.

170
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,810
I said, sit down.

171
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,210
We're not finished eating.

172
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,940
What did I tell you? I said brother-in-law probably won't like a full course meal.

173
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,960
Seo Jin, did something happen? Did you two have a fight?

174
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,200
I heard your father's vineyard isn't doing so well.

175
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Do you need money? Is this why you're rebelling in front of us?

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,510
- Father-in-law. 
 - Goodness.

177
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,670
It's useless for a man's courage to be the size of a chick's belly.

178
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,660
I apologize, since that is all I can amount to,

179
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,960
I'll get going first.

180
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,910
If you keep disappointing me like this, I'm going to give Cheong Ah Arts to Seo Yeong.

181
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,690
What do you mean by that? Why her?

182
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,320
That can't happen. I'm supposed to receive it. I'll wrap everything up and step in.

183
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,940
To make the foundation prosper properly, your sister, with a well-off husband's family,  may be more suitable.

184
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,170
I'm confident I can make you proud if you give it to me, Father.

185
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,040
Don't get greedy, that position is mine.

186
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,600
So why did you have to go marry a guy like him?

187
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,300
He never lets anything go, does he, that father of yours?

188
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,830
That father of yours?

189
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,910
You heard me. That oh-so-great mother and father of yours.

190
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,480
How does he never fail to miss a day to make it so obvious that he hates his first son-in-law?

191
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
What the hell is your problem?

192
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,040
We got rid of the dirty smell of your family, so you should make an effort, also!

193
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,460
When have I never made an effort!

194
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,660
I did as much as I could, too. What exactly does he hate about me so much?

195
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,550
That my parents are poor and uneducated? That they run a vineyard?

196
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,680
If he hated it so much, he should've opposed this marriage.

197
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,960
If I had known he would attack me like this, I would've opposed this marriage myself!

198
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,330
You must be regretting everything. After you were caught paying ₩100 million in Oh Yun Hui's place,

199
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,780
you have nothing to hide anymore, is that it?

200
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,870
The one who abandoned his first love and came to me was you!

201
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,460
You made that choice all by yourself!

202
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,010
Do you know how much more pathetic you get as the days pass?

203
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:25,450
I hate everything about you, but that inferiority complex that exists deep inside your bones...

204
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,580
I hate that the most.

205
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey! Hey! Stop right there!

206
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,750
You're back now?

207
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,270
How long were you home?

208
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,020
Not long. You called me, right?

209
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,280
I ended up falling asleep during a massage. I'm sorry.

210
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,520
You must be very tired. If you went to get a massage at this time.

211
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,290
On top of that, you even fell asleep.

212
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,780
I haven't slept much these days. I guess my body finally had enough.

213
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,760
Lawyer Lee came, he's waiting for you.

214
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,510
I prepared some wine and light snacks.

215
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,490
Okay, thanks.

216
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,230
- Give it to me. 
- Thank you.

217
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,830
I'll enjoy it.

218
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,700
I was shocked because you called me out of the blue. What happened now? Did something happen with the kids?

219
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,720
No, today is strictly about business.

220
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,990
In three months time, Bosong Village will receive a redevelopment notice. 
  Plans for Redevelopment of Bosong Village 

221
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,540
I plan on building a second Hera Palace there.

222
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,000
Haven't redevelopment plans for Bosong Village been made many times?

223
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,630
There's been a lot of talk about the cost of their land.

224
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,900
I heard Changryong Village is the better option.

225
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,520
There are 7 houses for sale at Bosong Village right now.  It's possible we can buy 10 houses if we try our best.

226
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,410
You can invest ₩2 billion and get ₩8 billion in profit after a very short period. A beautiful opportunity.

227
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,880
That much? But, in whose name?

228
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,770
Of course, we will have to use the borrowed names. I've already gotten the people who'll lend their names.

229
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,320
Chairman Ju, your momentum is killer. You're like my mom.

230
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,070
But Bosong Village,

231
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,320
isn't that where that kid, Min Seol Ah, used to live?

232
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,090
That's correct. And that is why Dr. Ha won't be a part of this project.

233
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,500
Due to Min Seol Ah, our children received 20 hours of community service as punishment.

234
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,060
He should pay for having disappointed us.

235
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,800
You did well. "Please stop this witch hunt."

236
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,790
"Accusing an innocent person as the perpetrator, how does that help our Cheong Ah Arts School?"

237
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,970
 Yangjae Flower Market: Let's meet in the garden.  
 - Oh, he was so heated up.

238
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,720
Even if she was his first love, his wife is staring right at him with both her eyes open.

239
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,610
I think he went crazy after being abused by his in-laws for so long. Jeez, loser.

240
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,330
Our talk isn't finished yet.

241
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,110
The unit that Min Seol Ah used to live in is included.

242
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,880
But someone died in there... must we?

243
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Since someone committed suicide in this unit by setting fire to it, the owner put it up for sale at a rock bottom price.

244
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,770
They are desperate to sell, so I plan on buying it by the end of the week.

245
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah...

246
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,850
 This is a great opportunity for us. Let's erase Min Seol Ah's existence completely. 

247
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,140
Okay, let's do it.

248
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,410
I guess that girl was also beneficial to us.

249
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,420
Ju Dan Tae.

250
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
Things will not turn out the way you want.

251
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,300
I will not let that happen.

252
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,550
What's with you?

253
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,890
Feeling reckless today?

254
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,080
For today, don't say anything and just do whatever I want.

255
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,170
Why did such an attractive woman like you marry someone like Ha Yun Cheol?

256
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,280
I wanted him because I couldn't have him

257
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,210
and I mistakenly thought that was love.

258
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,760
I was foolish and inexperienced.

259
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,600
Come this way.

260
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,860
There will no longer be anything you cannot have.

261
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,550
 Caught in an adulterous scandal with Actress A 

262
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,900
 Assemblyman for the Happy Future Party, Jo Sang Heon, was found this morning 

263
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,730
 dead in his bathtub. 

264
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,480
 The police theory is that Assemblyman Jo slipped in his bathtub while drunk 

265
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,750
 and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. They are currently investigating. 

266
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,550
 It has been revealed that no signs of homicide have been found. 

267
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,280
 The National Forensic Service intends to investigate to confirm the cause of death. 

268
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,120
He was found in his bathtub?

269
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,050
But that's not what happened...

270
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,730
Hello?

271
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,370
 This is Songpa Police Station. 

272
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,240
 We're investigating the death of Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon. 

273
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,180
 Can you come to the station? 

274
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,950
 His last phone call before he died was with you, so can you please come right away? 

275
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,120
 Oh Yun Hui? Oh Yun Hui? 

276
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,060
If you scream, you will die.

277
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,540
Don't look behind you.

278
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,300
Yes.

279
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,290
Who are you?

280
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,280
Just answer my questions.

281
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,920
Why did you run away from Jo Sang Heon's home?

282
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
This...

283
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,930
But I didn't kill him.

284
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,100
When I went there, he was already dead. It's true, please believe me.

285
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,780
Why did you go there?

286
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,330
I was being threatened.

287
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,820
He mistakenly thought that it was my fault that his adultery became a scandal.

288
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,290
So I went to explain myself to him.

289
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,960
Someone else was in the house.

290
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,930
I heard that person's cell phone ringing.

291
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,220
And there was a purse on the coffee table.

292
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,560
It's not... important what you saw.

293
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,900
Just go to the police and testify that you saw Jo Sang Heon dead in his bathtub.

294
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,140
Aside from that, you saw nothing and heard nothing.

295
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,200
Why must I tell such a lie?

296
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,380
If you

297
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,350
and your daughter want to live, you have to do what I told you.

298
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,210
In turn,

299
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,540
I'll give you some important information.

300
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,350
You're so pretty,

301
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,140
my daughter.

302
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,880
 Deceased - Min Seol Ah 
Born: 11.03. 2004 
Died: 11.14. 2019 

303
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,570
You're no longer alone.

304
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,170
Mom will always be with you.

305
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,560
- My son, you're the best.
 - My princess, only one serving of snacks, please.

306
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,790
You must diet.

307
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,980
Mom loves you too.

308
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,740
Su Ryeon, how happy you must be.

309
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,530
Seok Hun is the solo pianist and Seok Gyeong is the vocal soloist for the school matriculation (admission) concert.

310
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,940
And this concert has an amazing guest list, too.

311
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,340
Teacher Cheon! Teacher Cheon! Teacher Cheon!

312
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,810
What's with your husband, Dr. Ha?

313
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,860
How can he take her side? Our plans went awry because of Dr. Ha!

314
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,850
I spoke to the Chairman and they were given the absolute minimum punishment.

315
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,820
So let's just say leave it, and move on.

316
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,250
But I heard it was 20 hours of community service.

317
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,860
How can my Je Ni be expected to do such rough work?

318
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,670
Teacher Cheon, you've disappointed us so many times after we trusted you.

319
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,070
Then please draw clearer boundaries from now on.

320
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,850
Don't involve me in your affairs.

321
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,990
Well, fine, then! Draw a clear line.

322
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,310
Do you think we scared that we can't find any teachers to give lessons besides you, Teacher Cheon?

323
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,510
Please begin the class, Arts Department Head.

324
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,740
Have all the kids gathered?

325
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,110
Hey.

326
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,610
Head of Arts Department? Who?

327
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,300
Cheon Seo Jin has been appointed as our Head of Arts Department starting this semester.

328
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,700
- What? 
 - What?

329
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,550
I'm the Head of Arts Department and I'm in charge of your matriculation (admission) concert.

330
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,110
As everyone knows, there is no one at the top of the matriculating class this year.

331
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,980
So the vocal soloist will be the runner-up, Ju Seok Gyeong.

332
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,940
Applause, please.

333
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,290
The enrollment concert at Cheong Ah Arts School is steeped in tradition and a very important event.

334
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,030
Many famous people from the music world will attend, and make the event shine even more.

335
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,410
So not only Seok Gyeong, but all the other students, please be faithful in practicing.

336
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,550
 Frühlingsstimmen (Voices of Spring)

341
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,840
 The true face of Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon, a supporter of   many orphanages for years,   

342
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,770
 is being revealed and causing shock waves. 
   

343
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,920
 Assemblyman Jo, after harvesting the bone marrow of children who were adopted in foreign countries, 

344
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,050
 then had the adoptions dissolved, after receiving several millions of dollars. 

345
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,620
 The man who worked with the late Assemblyman Jo using these adoption procedures, 

346
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,800
 is Mr. Min, the Director of Hope Orphanage. The police have arrested him and are planning to indict him. 

347
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,380
 Let me give you some important information. 

348
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,160
 Two days later, there will be news of the redevelopment of Bosong Village. 

349
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,480
 Purchase Unit 501 in Building 3 by tomorrow. 

350
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,340
 Plans for Redevelopment of Bosong Village 

351
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,170
Bosong Village is being redeveloped?

352
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,630
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon Discovered Deceased in Bathtub in His Secret Home. 'Illegal System of Bone Marrow Donor Trafficking' Is Revealed. 

353
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,930
Make sure that nothing about me in relation to him is revealed.

354
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,350
You don't have to worry, Chairman.

355
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,590
Director Yun?

356
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,650
Why didn't you... answer my phone call last night?

357
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,730
I was distracted because Hye In's health was suffering.

358
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,480
I apologize.

359
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,620
So you were at the hospital?

360
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,540
Director Yun, you never disappoint me.

361
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,760
If I tell you to bark, you bark. And if I tell you to bite, you bite. A very loyal dog.

362
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,790
Aren't you?

363
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,670
Has it been 20 years now, that you've been working for me?

364
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,830
A lot of hardships for you, day and night.

365
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,910
You can leave now.

366
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,900
Yun Tae Ju.

367
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,770
Maybe I've kept an old dog for too long?

368
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,130
Your usefulness has come to an end.

369
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,080
You've worked hard.

370
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,330
Ju Hye In.

371
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,440
Honey, our Hye In...

372
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,560
Our Hye in...

373
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Patient Ju Hye In died at 11:30 pm on December 17th, 2019.

374
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,190
Honey, I'm sorry.

375
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm so sorry that I couldn't protect Hye In.

376
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,360
 Temple - Manwolbo Hall 

377
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,890
 Deceased Ju Hye In 
 Born: 11.02.2004 
 Died: 12.17.2019 

378
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,850
We should let her go now.

379
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,450
You've had a tough time, all these years.

380
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,230
I want to be alone for a while.

381
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,480
Yes, of course. Okay, I'll be in the car with the kids.

382
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,170
Let's go.

383
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,800
 Ha Min Hospital 

384
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,930
One, two, shock!

385
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,730
Charge to 250 joules.

386
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,180
Charged to 250 joules.

387
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,950
One, two, shock!

388
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,610
The rhythm has returned.

389
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,340
 Hye In is in danger. 

390
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,110
 I think the Chairman will get rid of her himself. 

391
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,680
 Please kill Hye In. 

392
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,310
 Just like my husband wants. 

393
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,750
 That is how you and Hye In can both survive. 

394
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,880
 It's a medication that can temporary stop the heartbeat. 

395
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,490
 Director Yun, after she is put in her casket 

396
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,230
 please transport Hye In to a safe location. 

397
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,020
 If you're even a little late, she may never wake up. 

398
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,660
Hello?

399
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,180
She resumed breathing.

400
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,390
She has been given heavy doses of sleep inducers all this time.

401
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,190
She needs to receive  intensive treatments for a while longer.

402
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,520
Thank you.

403
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,910
I will never forget what you did for me.

404
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,550
I am really grateful. Thank you.

405
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
 Bosong Village Dalhyeon Real Estate 

406
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,990
Really? Building 3, Unit 501 is really a distress sale?

407
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,560
Well, it's listed at a very cheap price.

408
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,770
So we had a lot of inquiries.

409
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,140
But it hasn't been sold yet?

410
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,730
But you already know, right?

411
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,630
That there was an incident there?

412
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,370
Incident?

413
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,620
A young girl lived there alone.

414
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,670
She set fire to the place and committed suicide.

415
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,810
It was on the news.

416
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,650
Then... that place...

417
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,730
Well, the owner agreed to reconstruct the place.

418
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,110
So when they fix it, it will be like new. And it gets a lot of light.

419
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,850
No, it's fine.

420
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,560
Yes, thank you.

00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,890
 So why would you let them do it? It makes my heart hurt. 

426
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,550
 Then what am I supposed to do? 

427
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,510
 What if I hit them wrong and they demand another settlement fee? 

428
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,820

I'll try believing in him, as if I've gone crazy.

435
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,040
Who cares if someone died in there? She lived her life diligently.

436
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,780
What's so bad about that?

437
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,390
There is no verification of income for three months

438
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,290
and you have a history of late payments,

439
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,530
so you don't qualify for a loan at our bank.

440
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,410
Who would lend you as much as ₩20 million, taking a townhouse or a multiplex unit as collateral?

441
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,700
You don't even have a permanent job. Who will give you a credit loan?

442
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,760
While appraising the house, they'll compute its value.

443
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,860
So I think it's hard to lend you money today, right away.

444
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,380
   

445
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,620
 You must sign the contract by today midnight. 

446
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,880

You're up already, Honey?

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,750

Yes, I feel much better after getting some sleep. Thank you.

471
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,300
Did you go to Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon's funeral?

472
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,450
Not even a single ant came.

473
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,800
Adultery scandal and an adoption scandal, too.

474
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,240
This is why people should live their lives properly. I'm going to the gym.

475
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,550
What about you, honey?

476
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,680
What?

477
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,490
Nothing. I guess you switched your fragrance.

478
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,630
It smells good.

479
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,010
What did you say?

480
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,560
Someone bought that house?

481
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,420
I came as soon as the door opened this morning.

482
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,820
But only that one unit was sold yesterday.

483
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,200
But do you know who bought it?

484
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,010
Oh Yun Hui?

485
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,620
- That woman... 
 -  Wow, what kind of woman is she? 

486
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,620
 She couldn't have known about the redevelopment plans. 

487
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,830
But for me, no matter how cheap it is,

488
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,900
I can't believe she could ever think about buying this place, considering the ethical implications.

489
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,010
Her daughter even got into school in the place of Min Seol Ah.

490
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,050
And how even her unit? Oh, she will receive divine punishment.

491
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,740
Let's talk later.

492
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,710
She is quite a profound and mysterious woman, the more I get to know her.

493
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,750
Oh Yun Hui...

494
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,430
quite bothersome, since that last time.

495
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:40,010
Darn. Why aren't there any articles? It's driving me crazy.

496
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,360
Maybe today isn't the day it's supposed to be announced?

497
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,080
But it is.

498
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:56,250
If something goes wrong with this, my daughter and I will really die.

499
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,670
Gyu Jin is here.

500
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,470
Hey, punk. Why are you eating crackers in the office in the morning?

501
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,180
What was your name again?

502
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,740
- Attorney, you've received mail. 
 - Miss Kim, your clothes are nice today.

503
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,420
It's so light, it's practically summer! Who said you could turn up the heater so much?!

504
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,340
Just because you're spending someone else's money? You punks?

505
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,500
Doing whatever you want to. Why is there so much?

506
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,130
Why isn't there a name on this?

507
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,810
What is this?

508
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,350
Mommy!

509
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,590
What is that?

510
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,550
 I know what you did at this time! 

511
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,930
Crazy.  Cheong Ah Medical Center VIP Section 

512
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,700
Hello.

513
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,550
 From Unknown Caller: I know what you did at this time! 

514
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,760
"I know what you did at this time!"

515
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,280
What do we do, honey!?

516
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,500
This guy even knows where my office is. I'm going crazy!

517
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,540
But that creepy eye.

518
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,500
I definitely saw that somewhere.

519
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,720
Why didn't you tell me that you lost your watch?

520
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,880
Is that important right now?

521
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,110
I'm the only one who will be suspected!

522
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,580
- Chairman Ju. 
 - Jeez, really!

523
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Dr. Ha! Why didn't you find my watch that fell in the flower bed at the time?

524
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,910
What do you have eyes for, anyway?

525
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,840
You're the owner and you couldn't find it, so why blame me?

526
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,790
- Hey! You were on the ground, pushing me up! 
 - Ah, really!

527
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,580
You're really a piece of bad luck! 
  I know what you did at this time! 

528
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,870
Even those words left at the fountain before

529
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,110
and someone uploading that recording to the school's homepage, too.

530
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,840
Something chilling is going on.

531
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,960
Maybe Min Seol Ah didn't commit suicide? Maybe one of us really killed her?

532
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
Isn't that why someone is threatening us like this?

533
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,230
The truth is, isn't Chairman Ju the one who took the lead in this whole matter?

534
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,650
And he's the first one who suggested that we move Min Seol Ah's body to her apartment.

535
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,030
Maybe you wanted to take care of it quickly because you had a guilty conscience?

536
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,790
And dragging all of us into it for no reason, even setting fire to Min Seol Ah's apartment.

537
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,020
You even set her house on fire?

538
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,580
Goodness, you are such a scary man, Chairman Ju.

539
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,590
And isn't your family the one who benefitted the most from all this?

540
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:09,270
Min Seol Ah died so Seok Gyeong became the highest-ranked in the matriculating class and even got a solo part.

541
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,240
What this guy wants is exactly this.

542
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,780
To make us suspect each other and sow division.

543
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,040
What's important right now is the fountain, the recording file, and the pocket watch!

544
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,590
So that means someone knows what we did. Someone!

545
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,010
That means there is a witness.

546
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,140
We must find who that person is.

547
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,310
Finding the person who is pressuring us is the priority.

548
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,960
There is someone who is the most suspicious.

549
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,050
Who is that?

550
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,740
The person who has the recording file. The person who is not here.

551
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,990
And the person who was perfectly exempt from that night at the party.

552
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,360
You don't mean Su Ryeon, do you?

553
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,330
Why would Su Ryeon do that? When her own children are involved?

554
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,180
It must be her.

555
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,610
She was the only one who wasn't there.

556
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,430
And she protected Min Seol Ah whenever anyone talked about her.

557
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:58,190
And she was not at the party that night. She also left during the lighting ceremony.

558
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,860
Maybe... Su Ryeon really saw us?

559
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,470
She said... she was not feeling well that day...

560
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:21,500
 Your wife, Sim Su Ryeon, also kept calling her. 

561
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,980
 I'm excited to go on a date with you, it's been so long. 

562
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,570
 Don't be concerned about me, and take your time with your work. 

563
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,450
Chairman Ju, where are you going?

564
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,480
 CAMTECH VIEWER 
 Video File 

565
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,510
So how long have you been betraying me?

566
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,450
I guess you didn't know that CCTV was installed in my office?

567
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,720
I apologize, Chairman.

568
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,080
Tell me what you planned with my wife!

569
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,110
I took a beggar and made a man out of you, and you dare to betray me?

570
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:44,610
So hurry and speak. What did you tell my wife?

571
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,070
Even after you die, you cannot escape my grasp, do you know that?

572
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,570
I am grateful for you taking care of all this time.

573
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,170
 End Call 

574
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,380
Secretary Jo, get in here!

575
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,670
Find Yun Tae Ju and drag him here right away. I don't care if he's alive or dead, bring him to me!

576
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,580
Yes, Chairman.

577
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,010
What happened to what I wanted you to find out?

578
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,880
This is Madam's cell phone records.

579
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,730
Anything special?

580
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,310
I inquired about a phone number she's called many times recently.

581
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,930
It was an errand service.

582
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,780
Errand service?

583
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:39,690
Must we really go this far?

584
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,890
We look ridiculous.

585
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,400
What are you saying? She's definitely suspicious.

586
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,200
And you should take the lead on something like this, Attorney.

587
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,130
There she comes.

588
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,950
If we delay, she'll get away.

589
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,220
I'm going. Put your belts on.

590
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,170
 Aram Detective Agency 

591
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,780
Who are you guys?

592
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,010
What did this person ask you to find out?

593
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,210
Let me put it another way. Why did she come to ask you for help?

594
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:39,230
That information is confidential, and sharing it would violate the ethics of our profession.

595
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,820
Hurry and say it before I break your arms and legs.

596
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,130
I-I-I will tell you.

597
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,070
I will tell you everything, please just let me live.

598
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,210
Have you been well?

599
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,880
I'm sorry for not coming often.

600
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,740
We've caught you!

601
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,560
What are you doing here, Sim Su Ryeon?

602
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,180
How did you know about this place?

603
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,690
What? Did you even find a resting place for Min Seol Ah?

604
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,710
Why are you so fixated on Min Seol Ah, anyway?

605
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,940
What is your relationship with her?

606
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,840
What are you talking about?

607
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,030
Were you the one who's been threatening us?

608
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,110
Did you release that recording file of our children?

609
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:42,300
Su Ryeon, I didn't think you'd do that! Aren't you too much?

610
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,430
Calm down.

611
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,670
Goodness, you even have her ashes in here.

612
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,660
Su Ryeon, are you Min Seol Ah's mom or something? Huh?

613
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,970
That's not Min Seol Ah's face.

614
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,350
Who is she?

615
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,840
She is my daughter.

616
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,930
Huh?

617
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,760
My daughter died recently.

618
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,520
- What... ?
 - Huh... ?

619
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,510
Oh, dear...

620
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,610
Oh my.

621
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,110
Ma Ri, you're terrible.

622
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,310
Oh, really.

623
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,100
What's with you?

624
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,650
What did you just say? Adultery?

625
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,620
Yes, the woman in that picture you showed me asked me to find out about her husband's adultery.

626
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,340
That she suspected him of cheating on her.

627
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,010
But this is

628
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,730
private information and I'm really not supposed to tell anyone.

629
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,100
But that's really everything.

630
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,280
 J King Holdings Chairman Ju Dan Tae 

631
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,540
If this man comes to see you, please respond that I suspected my husband's adultery.

632
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,850
 I met J King Holdings Chairman Ju Dan Tae. 

633
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,970
So, did you find anything?

634
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,110
No, we gave up after looking.

635
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,860
This man was very well secured, so we couldn't find out anything.

636
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,080
Chairman Ju is really too much.

637
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,600
How can you hide away a sick daughter like that?

638
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,610
I know.

639
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,310
Su Ryeon, your heart must have hurt so much.

640
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,930
I'm so sad for you.

641
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:52,130
So all that time you were busy was all because of your daughter?

642
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,610
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier.

643
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,800
Why would you be sorry to us, Su Ryeon?

644
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,430
Your husband is the abnormal one for saying you can't tell anyone.

645
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,120
I heard that Seol Ah committed suicide.

646
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,970
But my daughter was so sick that I couldn't pay any attention.

647
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,080
You've been through so much.

648
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,080
Think of me as your big sister and rely on me.

649
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,040
We've known each other for years, after all.

650
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,870
Is this child a product of adultery, by any chance?

651
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,660
If not, there isn't any reason for Chairman Ju to completely hide her away, is there?

652
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,740
Isn't that true?

653
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,640
Teacher Cheon, how can you say that right now?

654
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,290
A parent heartbroken over her child's loss. How can you say something so harsh—

655
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,640
You were here?

656
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,070
Why didn't you answer my calls?

657
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,100
Let's go.

658
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,750
I'm sorry.

659
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,000
They chased me to the charnel house, I didn't have any choice.

660
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,450
Hye In already left us, so I should have kept quiet about her until the end.

661
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,660
They are the wrong ones, for having followed you.

662
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,320
It would be nice if this were an opportunity for you to become closer to the HeraClub ladies.

663
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,820
And I'm fine with all this, so don't worry about me.

664
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,210
Where are you right now?

665
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,730
I think my husband has caught on to something. I think it would be best for you to leave right away.

666
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:07,730
Take the next flight—

667
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:12,440
I was actually on my way to the airport, after having settled my affairs.

668
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,480
That's a relief.

669
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,030
Please contact me after you arrive.

670
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:20,370
No, I think this is the end of all business between us.

671
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:24,260
There won't be any reason for me to contact you again.

672
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,190
Please be well.

673
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:33,140
I am grateful, Director Yun.

674
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:48,980
Chairman, this is my last act of loyalty to you.

675
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,970
 Two Months Later 

676
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,910
What is this?

677
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,280
This phone was in that air conditioning vent.

678
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,000
Who is that? She's not a resident here.

679
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,230
I'm sure the owner will come looking for it.

Seok Gyeong, your cold has gotten worse.

683
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,840
Tomorrow is the matriculation ceremony. You cannot perform a solo like this.

684
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,690
Go to the hospital.

685
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,060
I think Seok Gyeong will have to give up.

686
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,970
You practiced diligently, so this is regrettable, but what can we do?

687
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,870
We cannot ruin an important concert because of you.

688
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:30,920
Someone else will have to sing Seok Gyeong's solo part and we don't have time.

689
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,320
Is there anyone who can do it?

690
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,020
I will do it.

691
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,520
Will you? Are you confident?

692
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,280
Yes, let me try it.

693
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,770
Then Eun Byeol will sing the solo.

694
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:47,020
Please... give me a chance, too.

695
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,470
Bae Ro Na, are you crazy?

696
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,570
How dare you, not knowing your place?

697
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:08,600
Is that so? Then let's hear both of you sing and choose fairly?

698
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,690
Who will go first?

So I'll decide.

707
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,150
This song...

708
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,200
Ro Na sang it better than Eun Byeol, in every aspect.

709
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,490
Bae Ro Na, you will sing the solo tomorrow.

710
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,350
Thank you, Teacher. I will work really hard.

711
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,100
The matriculation concert must be the best. You can do well, can't you?

712
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,860
Yes.

713
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,670
I'll look forward to it.

714
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,450
I borrowed it on such short notice, but it fits so well.

715
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,210
Your are so pretty, my daughter.

716
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,660
Am I really going to sing solo at the Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Concert?

717
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,880
Mom, this isn't a dream, is it? A bunch of famous vocalists are coming this year, I heard.

718
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,740
I will do really well, just like you, Mom.

719
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,520
I will flatten the noses of all those kids who made fun of me for being on the waiting list.

720
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,990
Yes, I'm proud of you.

721
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:56,010
My daughter makes me smile.

722
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,500
Thank you.

723
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,820
But Mom, why do you look so down lately?

724
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,910
Do you have any worries?

725
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,340
No, of course not.

726
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,950
Let's hurry.

727
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,900
Are you ready? We just have to get out of this traffic jam.

728
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,490
Yes.

 2020 Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Ceremony 

731
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,440
Yes, what's going on?

732
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,670
Got it.

733
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,770
Alright, good work.

734
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,180
Ha Eun Byeol, get ready.

735
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,090
That solo part was always yours.

736
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:20,840
Your grandfather is here.  This is is your chance to show him

737
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,650
that you are the future owner of Cheong Ah Arts School.

738
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,920
Ro Na? Are you alright, Ro Na?

739
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,410
Ro Na? Let me see?

740
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,180
Let's go to the hospital.

741
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:53,250
Mom, I'm alright. I have to go to the concert.

742
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,080
Ro Na, you're badly hurt, we have to go to the hospital.

743
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,650
I told you, I am fine!

744
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,040
Hurry, I have to go to school.

745
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,540
I can't be late, hurry, please.

746
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,300
What do I do?

747
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:39,900
Ro Na, hold on tight.

748
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,120
 We will begin the Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Ceremony for 2020 now. 

749
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,610
You cannot enter after the concert begins.

750
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,710
Out of my way, I have to get on stage.

751
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,500
The concert hasn't begun yet.

752
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,580
You cannot.

753
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,860
I am a soloist for this concert. I have to go inside.

754
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,240
You cannot, I told you!

755
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:38,950
Oh really! I have to go inside!

756
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,970
She's asking to go in!

757
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,150
Oh really!

758
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,640
Let's go.

759
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,770
Get them!

760
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:00,340
Here.

761

769
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,150
 It was the first time in my life, the words, "I love you."

 Oh Yun Hui, that loser, bought the dead Min Seol Ah's unit?

 She is definitely somehow connected to Min Seol Ah.

 Did you kill Min Seol Ah, Father? 

776
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,350
 I want to live in a place like this, too. Like Hera Palace.
