1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,740
That night, she was with me.

2
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,560
At Hera Palace. 
    

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,610
Everything should've been recorded on the security footage.

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,090
You should all stop this witch hunt already.

5
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,810
How exactly is pushing the blame onto an innocent person for the benefit of Cheong Ah Arts?

6
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,060
Min Seol Ah's death has already been confirmed to be suicide!

7
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,510
Must you really create another victim to sleep soundly at night?

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,070
Why did Dr. Ha step in when everything was perfectly set?

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,170
So annoying.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,790
I understood completely.

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,450
What if our kids face disciplinary action?

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,090
Nonetheless, we have to minimize it.

13
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,330
Are you all right?

14
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,900
Yes.

15
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,150
I believe you.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,660
That you didn't have ill intentions.

17
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,960
You have to pull through, for your daughter at least.

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,790
Ro Na... please make sure to protect her.

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,990
I will... Thank you.

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,010
 The worker for the nation, Jo Sang Heon will protect you. 

21
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,250
 You may send your support payments to this account, 320-61-055893. 

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,770
 From The Happy Future Party for Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon 

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,360
This bastard.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,350
I don't think I'll be able to have lunch until the meeting is over. Is that okay?

25
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,820
Of course.

26
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,150
I'm excited at the thought of going on a date with you. It's been so long.

27
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,540
Don't worry about me and take your time with your work.

28
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,690
Okay then. I'll be back soon.

29
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,410
What are you doing?

30
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,630
Please leave or I will alert the Chairman.

31
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,830
Please help me! Help me just one more time!

32
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,170
Jo Sang Heon knows that Seol Ah is my daughter!

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,800
He's threatening me right now!

34
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,940
I need to find dirt on him.

35
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,430
My husband has to know something.

36
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,390
I need to know what Jo Sang Heon did to my Seol Ah.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,630
Please help me just one more time.

38
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,710
I had been doing background checks on Jo Sang Heon per the Chairman's orders.

39
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,060
He was too snake-like.

40
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,580
   

41
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,520
That devil!

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,230
You should start by releasing this.

43
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,320
 Managing Editor 

44
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,510
Everybody, gather here!  Quickly!

45
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,040
It's about Jo Sang Heon!

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,790
It's about Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon!

47
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,050
Jo Sang Heon, this is only the beginning.

48
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,840
 Last night, one media company reported 

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,180
 an adultery scandal between the two-term 

50
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,530
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon and an actress. 

51
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,810
 Assemblyman Jo is insisting that this is groundless fake news. 

52
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,530
 He has announced that he will file a lawsuit 

53
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,060
 against the people who spread this rumor. 

54
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,310
 Reporter Song, please tell us the details. 

55
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,780
 This wave of controversy will greatly affect the future election. 

56
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,370
Oh Yun Hui. This was your doing, wasn't it?

57
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,920
If you took my money, you should've kept your mouth shut for the rest of your life.

58
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,240
What are you talking about, Assemblyman Jo?

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,590
You released the news! How dare you act innocent!

60
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,830
Come here right now and return every cent I gave you

61
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,060
or I'm going to ruin your daughter's life forever!

62
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,780
H-Hello? Hello?

63
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,900
Hello? Assemblyman Jo?

64
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,620
She's not afraid of anything, is she?

65
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,270
How dare she stab me, Jo Sang Heon, in the back!

66
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,690
I'll never go down alone.

67
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,020
I worked so hard to make my way up here.

68
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,830
 Oh Yun Hui's Family Report 

69
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
 Oh Yun Hui's Whereabouts 

70
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,260
What took you so long!

71
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,820
You're so dead.

72
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,450
How... did you know I was...

73
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,330
You must have been in a hurry, Madame.

74
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,870
May I come in?

75
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,600
Are you here to negotiate? But it's too bad, I'm actually busy.

76
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,720
I'll call you later, without Chairman Ju's knowledge.

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,380
- Let's talk now. 
- I said I would call you!

78
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,980
Did you like it? My gift?

79
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,240
It was the headline news all night.

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
How does it feel to receive the public's attention?

81
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,590
It was you. The informant.

82
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,440
Then, shall we begin? The negotiation?

83
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,890
 Hope Orphanage 
Overseas Adoptions 
Individual List of Primary Children 

84
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,370
- What is this? 
- You remember, right?

85
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,730
The orphans you personally adopted out.

86
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,360
The disgusting crimes you've committed until now.

87
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,710
How is that a crime?

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,330
They were adopted to rich families where they could get whatever they wanted, thanks to me.

89
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,380
You used these poor children to run a business?

90
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
You can't call yourself human.

91
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,630
What bullshit is this?

92
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,700
These kids all had their adoptions canceled.

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,650
Just like my Seol Ah.

94
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,200
 Where are we going, Dad? 

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,340
 We're going to see your older brother. 

96
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,950
 My older brother? 

97
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,190
 Yes. He's a bit ill. 

98
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,030
 So you'll have to help him out, Anna. 

99
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,140
 You can do that, right? 

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,920
 That was the day I learned 

101
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,230
 that I had a sick older brother. 

102
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,470
 I didn't steal it! It was someone else! 

103
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,530
 Shut up! 

104
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,970
 Oppa! Oppa, say something! 

105
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,320
 All those kids were returned the moment the bone-marrow transplantation was completed. 

106
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
They were forcefully deported!

107
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,180
Did you adopt these children out to use them as bone marrow donors?

108
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,510
And once their job was done, they were framed with a crime so they would be deported, right?

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,980
Look here. I have no idea what you're talking about.

110
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,740
How am I supposed to know what those families did with the kids?

111
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,470
You set them up with this plan from the start.

112
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,390
That's how you built a â‚©10 billion building, isn't it?

113
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,910
Do you have any proof?

114
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,350
Do I need proof...

115
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,620
for this to be a crime?

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,440
These are the papers that connect you to Director Min.

117
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm also well aware that he's been laundering your slush fund money.

118
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,980
Well, you do work hard Madame Sim.

119
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,030
Are you that desperate to make sure you're not kicked out of your house?

120
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,960
But, did you know...

121
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,420
You're the one who made that child end up that way. You're the one who killed her.

122
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,500
Because you abandoned her!

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,130
What do you know to be blabbing?

124
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,390
You'd better beg for forgiveness and receive punishment for the inhumane acts you've done.

125
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,290
Because I'm going to reveal to the world what you did to my Seol Ah.

126
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,880
I've been a politician for so long. You really think I don't have my own connections?

127
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,080
And one of them is your husband, Ju Dan Tae.

128
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,770
If you're curious, why don't we call him directly to find out?

129
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,840
Let go! I said, let go!

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,900
Let go!

131
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,370
Damn it!

132
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,360
You...

133
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm going to kill you!

134
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,000
Assemblyman Jo, I'm here!

135
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,160
Assemblyman Jo? It's me, Oh Yun Hui.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Are you inside?

137
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,080
Assemblyman Jo, I'm coming in!

138
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,800
Assemblyman Jo, are you here?

139
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,450
Assemblyman Jo?

140
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,160
    
   (Ambulance Service in South Korea) 

141
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,960
   

142
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,370
Why are Ro Na's pictures here?

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,230
 Come to my house right now, and return every single penny I gave you 

144
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,960
 or I'll make sure to ruin your daughter's life! 

145
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,660
She's someone I know.

146
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,430
You have to get out of here first. I'll take care of the rest.

147
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,570
A person is dead.

148
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,190
Trust me and leave. Go now.

149
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,010
Get out of here.

150
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,950
   

151
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,680
 Your call cannot be connected. 

152
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,290
Where the hell is she!

153
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,340
I-I d-didn't see anything.

154
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,470
I don't know anything. I didn't see anything.

155
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,490
Are you sure it's all taken care of?

156
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,360
The school's reputation almost hit bottom.

157
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,220
What's this about a "group lynching?" And it happens to involve my, the Chairman's, granddaughter?

158
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,610
What kind of school do you think this is?

159
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,870
It's been the greatest private school for the past 50 years.

160
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm sorry Father. Something like this will never happen again.

161
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,780
Why did Eun Byeol do such a thing?

162
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,830
Stop it, Mom and Dad. My husband

163
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,150
prepared this especially for the two of you today.

164
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,150
Right. I heard your resort is receiving many compliments.

165
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,620
Yes, we reached the highest number of sales last month.

166
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,190
You take after your father-in-law, so your business will really take off.

167
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,410
This is why the family household is important.

168
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,250
I'll excuse myself first. I have to return to the hospital.

169
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,500
- Sit down. 
- Enjoy your meal, everyone.

170
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,810
I said, sit down.

171
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,210
We're not finished eating.

172
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,940
What did I tell you? I said brother-in-law probably won't like a full course meal.

173
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,960
Seo Jin, did something happen? Did you two have a fight?

174
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,200
I heard your father's vineyard isn't doing so well.

175
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Do you need money? Is this why you're rebelling in front of us?

176
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,510
- Father-in-law. 
 - Goodness.

177
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,670
It's useless for a man's courage to be the size of a chick's belly.

178
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,660
I apologize, since that is all I can amount to,

179
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,960
I'll get going first.

180
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,910
If you keep disappointing me like this, I'm going to give Cheong Ah Arts to Seo Yeong.

181
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,690
What do you mean by that? Why her?

182
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,320
That can't happen. I'm supposed to receive it. I'll wrap everything up and step in.

183
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,940
To make the foundation prosper properly, your sister, with a well-off husband's family,  may be more suitable.

184
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,170
I'm confident I can make you proud if you give it to me, Father.

185
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,040
Don't get greedy, that position is mine.

186
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,600
So why did you have to go marry a guy like him?

187
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,300
He never lets anything go, does he, that father of yours?

188
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,830
That father of yours?

189
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,910
You heard me. That oh-so-great mother and father of yours.

190
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,480
How does he never fail to miss a day to make it so obvious that he hates his first son-in-law?

191
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
What the hell is your problem?

192
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,040
We got rid of the dirty smell of your family, so you should make an effort, also!

193
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,460
When have I never made an effort!

194
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,660
I did as much as I could, too. What exactly does he hate about me so much?

195
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,550
That my parents are poor and uneducated? That they run a vineyard?

196
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,680
If he hated it so much, he should've opposed this marriage.

197
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,960
If I had known he would attack me like this, I would've opposed this marriage myself!

198
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,330
You must be regretting everything. After you were caught paying â‚©100 million in Oh Yun Hui's place,

199
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,780
you have nothing to hide anymore, is that it?

200
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,870
The one who abandoned his first love and came to me was you!

201
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,460
You made that choice all by yourself!

202
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,010
Do you know how much more pathetic you get as the days pass?

203
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:25,450
I hate everything about you, but that inferiority complex that exists deep inside your bones...

204
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,580
I hate that the most.

205
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey! Hey! Stop right there!

206
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,750
You're back now?

207
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,270
How long were you home?

208
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,020
Not long. You called me, right?

209
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,280
I ended up falling asleep during a massage. I'm sorry.

210
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,520
You must be very tired. If you went to get a massage at this time.

211
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,290
On top of that, you even fell asleep.

212
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,780
I haven't slept much these days. I guess my body finally had enough.

213
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,760
Lawyer Lee came, he's waiting for you.

214
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,510
I prepared some wine and light snacks.

215
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,490
Okay, thanks.

216
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,230
- Give it to me. 
- Thank you.

217
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,830
I'll enjoy it.

218
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,700
I was shocked because you called me out of the blue. What happened now? Did something happen with the kids?

219
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,720
No, today is strictly about business.

220
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,990
In three months time, Bosong Village will receive a redevelopment notice. 
  Plans for Redevelopment of Bosong Village 

221
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,540
I plan on building a second Hera Palace there.

222
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,000
Haven't redevelopment plans for Bosong Village been made many times?

223
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,630
There's been a lot of talk about the cost of their land.

224
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,900
I heard Changryong Village is the better option.

225
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,520
There are 7 houses for sale at Bosong Village right now.  It's possible we can buy 10 houses if we try our best.

226
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,410
You can invest â‚©2 billion and get â‚©8 billion in profit after a very short period. A beautiful opportunity.

227
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,880
That much? But, in whose name?

228
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,770
Of course, we will have to use the borrowed names. I've already gotten the people who'll lend their names.

229
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,320
Chairman Ju, your momentum is killer. You're like my mom.

230
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,070
But Bosong Village,

231
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,320
isn't that where that kid, Min Seol Ah, used to live?

232
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,090
That's correct. And that is why Dr. Ha won't be a part of this project.

233
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,500
Due to Min Seol Ah, our children received 20 hours of community service as punishment.

234
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,060
He should pay for having disappointed us.

235
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,800
You did well. "Please stop this witch hunt."

236
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,790
"Accusing an innocent person as the perpetrator, how does that help our Cheong Ah Arts School?"

237
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,970
 Yangjae Flower Market: Let's meet in the garden.  
 - Oh, he was so heated up.

238
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,720
Even if she was his first love, his wife is staring right at him with both her eyes open.

239
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,610
I think he went crazy after being abused by his in-laws for so long. Jeez, loser.

240
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,330
Our talk isn't finished yet.

241
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,110
The unit that Min Seol Ah used to live in is included.

242
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,880
But someone died in there... must we?

243
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Since someone committed suicide in this unit by setting fire to it, the owner put it up for sale at a rock bottom price.

244
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,770
They are desperate to sell, so I plan on buying it by the end of the week.

245
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah...

246
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,850
 This is a great opportunity for us. Let's erase Min Seol Ah's existence completely. 

247
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,140
Okay, let's do it.

248
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,410
I guess that girl was also beneficial to us.

249
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,420
Ju Dan Tae.

250
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
Things will not turn out the way you want.

251
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,300
I will not let that happen.

252
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,550
What's with you?

253
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,890
Feeling reckless today?

254
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,080
For today, don't say anything and just do whatever I want.

255
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,170
Why did such an attractive woman like you marry someone like Ha Yun Cheol?

256
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,280
I wanted him because I couldn't have him

257
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,210
and I mistakenly thought that was love.

258
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,760
I was foolish and inexperienced.

259
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,600
Come this way.

260
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,860
There will no longer be anything you cannot have.

261
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,550
 Caught in an adulterous scandal with Actress A 

262
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,900
 Assemblyman for the Happy Future Party, Jo Sang Heon, was found this morning 

263
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,730
 dead in his bathtub. 

264
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,480
 The police theory is that Assemblyman Jo slipped in his bathtub while drunk 

265
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,750
 and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. They are currently investigating. 

266
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,550
 It has been revealed that no signs of homicide have been found. 

267
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,280
 The National Forensic Service intends to investigate to confirm the cause of death. 

268
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,120
He was found in his bathtub?

269
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,050
But that's not what happened...

270
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,730
Hello?

271
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,370
 This is Songpa Police Station. 

272
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,240
 We're investigating the death of Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon. 

273
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,180
 Can you come to the station? 

274
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,950
 His last phone call before he died was with you, so can you please come right away? 

275
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,120
 Oh Yun Hui? Oh Yun Hui? 

276
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,060
If you scream, you will die.

277
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,540
Don't look behind you.

278
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,300
Yes.

279
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,290
Who are you?

280
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,280
Just answer my questions.

281
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,920
Why did you run away from Jo Sang Heon's home?

282
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
This...

283
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,930
But I didn't kill him.

284
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,100
When I went there, he was already dead. It's true, please believe me.

285
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,780
Why did you go there?

286
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,330
I was being threatened.

287
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,820
He mistakenly thought that it was my fault that his adultery became a scandal.

288
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,290
So I went to explain myself to him.

289
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,960
Someone else was in the house.

290
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,930
I heard that person's cell phone ringing.

291
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,220
And there was a purse on the coffee table.

292
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,560
It's not... important what you saw.

293
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,900
Just go to the police and testify that you saw Jo Sang Heon dead in his bathtub.

294
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,140
Aside from that, you saw nothing and heard nothing.

295
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,200
Why must I tell such a lie?

296
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,380
If you

297
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,350
and your daughter want to live, you have to do what I told you.

298
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,210
In turn,

299
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,540
I'll give you some important information.

300
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,350
You're so pretty,

301
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,140
my daughter.

302
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,880
 Deceased - Min Seol Ah 
Born: 11.03. 2004 
Died: 11.14. 2019 

303
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,570
You're no longer alone.

304
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,170
Mom will always be with you.

305
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,560
- My son, you're the best.
 - My princess, only one serving of snacks, please.

306
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,790
You must diet.

307
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,980
Mom loves you too.

308
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,740
Su Ryeon, how happy you must be.

309
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,530
Seok Hun is the solo pianist and Seok Gyeong is the vocal soloist for the school matriculation (admission) concert.

310
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,940
And this concert has an amazing guest list, too.

311
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,340
Teacher Cheon! Teacher Cheon! Teacher Cheon!

312
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,810
What's with your husband, Dr. Ha?

313
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,860
How can he take her side? Our plans went awry because of Dr. Ha!

314
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,850
I spoke to the Chairman and they were given the absolute minimum punishment.

315
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,820
So let's just say leave it, and move on.

316
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,250
But I heard it was 20 hours of community service.

317
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,860
How can my Je Ni be expected to do such rough work?

318
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,670
Teacher Cheon, you've disappointed us so many times after we trusted you.

319
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,070
Then please draw clearer boundaries from now on.

320
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,850
Don't involve me in your affairs.

321
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,990
Well, fine, then! Draw a clear line.

322
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,310
Do you think we scared that we can't find any teachers to give lessons besides you, Teacher Cheon?

323
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,510
Please begin the class, Arts Department Head.

324
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,740
Have all the kids gathered?

325
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,110
Hey.

326
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,610
Head of Arts Department? Who?

327
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,300
Cheon Seo Jin has been appointed as our Head of Arts Department starting this semester.

328
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,700
- What? 
 - What?

329
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,550
I'm the Head of Arts Department and I'm in charge of your matriculation (admission) concert.

330
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,110
As everyone knows, there is no one at the top of the matriculating class this year.

331
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,980
So the vocal soloist will be the runner-up, Ju Seok Gyeong.

332
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,940
Applause, please.

333
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,290
The enrollment concert at Cheong Ah Arts School is steeped in tradition and a very important event.

334
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,030
Many famous people from the music world will attend, and make the event shine even more.

335
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,410
So not only Seok Gyeong, but all the other students, please be faithful in practicing.

336
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,550
 FrÃ¼hlingsstimmen (Voices of Spring) 

337
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:39,100
â™ª Die Lerche in blaue HÃ¶h entschwebt, der Tauwind weht so lau  â™ª

340
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,740
â™ª alles Leid, entflohn ist es weit â™ª

341
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,840
 The true face of Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon, a supporter of   many orphanages for years,   

342
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,770
 is being revealed and causing shock waves. 
   

343
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,920
 Assemblyman Jo, after harvesting the bone marrow of children who were adopted in foreign countries, 

344
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,050
 then had the adoptions dissolved, after receiving several millions of dollars. 

345
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,620
 The man who worked with the late Assemblyman Jo using these adoption procedures, 

346
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,800
 is Mr. Min, the Director of Hope Orphanage. The police have arrested him and are planning to indict him. 

347
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,380
 Let me give you some important information. 

348
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,160
 Two days later, there will be news of the redevelopment of Bosong Village. 

349
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,480
 Purchase Unit 501 in Building 3 by tomorrow. 

350
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,340
 Plans for Redevelopment of Bosong Village 

351
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,170
Bosong Village is being redeveloped?

352
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,630
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon Discovered Deceased in Bathtub in His Secret Home. 'Illegal System of Bone Marrow Donor Trafficking' Is Revealed. 

353
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,930
Make sure that nothing about me in relation to him is revealed.

354
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,350
You don't have to worry, Chairman.

355
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,590
Director Yun?

356
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,650
Why didn't you... answer my phone call last night?

357
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,730
I was distracted because Hye In's health was suffering.

358
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,480
I apologize.

359
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,620
So you were at the hospital?

360
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,540
Director Yun, you never disappoint me.

361
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,760
If I tell you to bark, you bark. And if I tell you to bite, you bite. A very loyal dog.

362
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,790
Aren't you?

363
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,670
Has it been 20 years now, that you've been working for me?

364
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,830
A lot of hardships for you, day and night.

365
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,910
You can leave now.

366
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,900
Yun Tae Ju.

367
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,770
Maybe I've kept an old dog for too long?

368
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,130
Your usefulness has come to an end.

369
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,080
You've worked hard.

370
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,330
Ju Hye In.

371
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,440
Honey, our Hye In...

372
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,560
Our Hye in...

373
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Patient Ju Hye In died at 11:30 pm on December 17th, 2019.

374
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,190
Honey, I'm sorry.

375
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm so sorry that I couldn't protect Hye In.

376
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,360
 Temple - Manwolbo Hall 

377
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,890
 Deceased Ju Hye In 
 Born: 11.02.2004 
 Died: 12.17.2019 

378
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,850
We should let her go now.

379
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,450
You've had a tough time, all these years.

380
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,230
I want to be alone for a while.

381
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,480
Yes, of course. Okay, I'll be in the car with the kids.

382
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,170
Let's go.

383
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,800
 Ha Min Hospital 

384
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,930
One, two, shock!

385
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,730
Charge to 250 joules.

386
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,180
Charged to 250 joules.

387
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,950
One, two, shock!

388
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,610
The rhythm has returned.

389
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,340
 Hye In is in danger. 

390
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,110
 I think the Chairman will get rid of her himself. 

391
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,680
 Please kill Hye In. 

392
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,310
 Just like my husband wants. 

393
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,750
 That is how you and Hye In can both survive. 

394
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,880
 It's a medication that can temporary stop the heartbeat. 

395
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,490
 Director Yun, after she is put in her casket 

396
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,230
 please transport Hye In to a safe location. 

397
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,020
 If you're even a little late, she may never wake up. 

398
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,660
Hello?

399
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,180
She resumed breathing.

400
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,390
She has been given heavy doses of sleep inducers all this time.

401
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,190
She needs to receive  intensive treatments for a while longer.

402
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,520
Thank you.

403
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,910
I will never forget what you did for me.

404
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,550
I am really grateful. Thank you.

405
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
 Bosong Village Dalhyeon Real Estate 

406
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,990
Really? Building 3, Unit 501 is really a distress sale?

407
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,560
Well, it's listed at a very cheap price.

408
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,770
So we had a lot of inquiries.

409
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,140
But it hasn't been sold yet?

410
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,730
But you already know, right?

411
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,630
That there was an incident there?

412
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,370
Incident?

413
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,620
A young girl lived there alone.

414
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,670
She set fire to the place and committed suicide.

415
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,810
It was on the news.

416
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,650
Then... that place...

417
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,730
Well, the owner agreed to reconstruct the place.

418
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,110
So when they fix it, it will be like new. And it gets a lot of light.

419
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,850
No, it's fine.

420
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,560
Yes, thank you.

421
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:24,910

â™ª ah alle Pein zu End mag sein â™ª

424
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,820
 I'm just letting them do it. You think I can't fight? 

425
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,890
 So why would you let them do it? It makes my heart hurt. 

426
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,550
 Then what am I supposed to do? 

427
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,510
 What if I hit them wrong and they demand another settlement fee? 

428
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,820
 You want to sell this house, too? 

429
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,600
â™ª ah, alles lacht, ach, ach, erwacht â™ª

430
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,490
 If you don't believe in this information which could change your life, 

431
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,860
 that's up to you. The choice is yours. 

432
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,990
 Bosong Village Redevelopment Plan 

433
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,600
Sure.

434
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
I'll try believing in him, as if I've gone crazy.

435
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,040
Who cares if someone died in there? She lived her life diligently.

436
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,780
What's so bad about that?

437
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,390
There is no verification of income for three months

438
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,290
and you have a history of late payments,

439
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,530
so you don't qualify for a loan at our bank.

440
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,410
Who would lend you as much as â‚©20 million, taking a townhouse or a multiplex unit as collateral?

441
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,700
You don't even have a permanent job. Who will give you a credit loan?

442
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,760
While appraising the house, they'll compute its value.

443
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,860
So I think it's hard to lend you money today, right away.

444
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,380
   

445
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,620
 You must sign the contract by today midnight. 

446
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,880
 

447
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,610
You seem quite desperate. 
  Yong Ho Loans

 - â‚©20 million won.  ($18,000) 

449
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,050
- Do you have collateral? 
 - What about the lease of my house as collateral?

450
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,340
Did you bring the documents?

451
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,670
Our interest is a bit high, though.

452
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,570
Can you handle it?

453
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,130
Yes.

454
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,530
Please give me the loan.

455
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,510
Here.  Sign here.

456
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,530

458
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,970
Mr. Owner!

459
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,750
I'm desperate! Mr. Owner?

460
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,560
Mr. Owner Choi!

461
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,510
Mr. Owner...

462
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,710
Mr. Owner?

463
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,550
Oh, so noisy.

464
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,140
What's the matter? It's so late.

465
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,860
Oh Yun Hui signed the contract last night.

466
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,610
Good work.

467
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,250
I'll call you later.

468
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,960
You're up already, Honey?

469
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,750
You should have stayed in bed. Do you feel alright?

470
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,680
Yes, I feel much better after getting some sleep. Thank you.

471
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,300
Did you go to Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon's funeral?

472
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,450
Not even a single ant came.

473
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,800
Adultery scandal and an adoption scandal, too.

474
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,240
This is why people should live their lives properly. I'm going to the gym.

475
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,550
What about you, honey?

476
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,680
What?

477
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,490
Nothing. I guess you switched your fragrance.

478
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,630
It smells good.

479
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,010
What did you say?

480
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,560
Someone bought that house?

481
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,420
I came as soon as the door opened this morning.

482
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,820
But only that one unit was sold yesterday.

483
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,200
But do you know who bought it?

484
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,010
Oh Yun Hui?

485
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,620
- That woman... 
 -  Wow, what kind of woman is she? 

486
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,620
 She couldn't have known about the redevelopment plans. 

487
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,830
But for me, no matter how cheap it is,

488
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,900
I can't believe she could ever think about buying this place, considering the ethical implications.

489
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,010
Her daughter even got into school in the place of Min Seol Ah.

490
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,050
And how even her unit? Oh, she will receive divine punishment.

491
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,740
Let's talk later.

492
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,710
She is quite a profound and mysterious woman, the more I get to know her.

493
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,750
Oh Yun Hui...

494
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,430
quite bothersome, since that last time.

495
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:40,010
Darn. Why aren't there any articles? It's driving me crazy.

496
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,360
Maybe today isn't the day it's supposed to be announced?

497
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,080
But it is.

498
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:56,250
If something goes wrong with this, my daughter and I will really die.

499
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,670
Gyu Jin is here.

500
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,470
Hey, punk. Why are you eating crackers in the office in the morning?

501
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,180
What was your name again?

502
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,740
- Attorney, you've received mail. 
 - Miss Kim, your clothes are nice today.

503
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,420
It's so light, it's practically summer! Who said you could turn up the heater so much?!

504
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,340
Just because you're spending someone else's money? You punks?

505
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,500
Doing whatever you want to. Why is there so much?

506
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,130
Why isn't there a name on this?

507
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,810
What is this?

508
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,350
Mommy!

509
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,590
What is that?

510
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,550
 I know what you did at this time! 

511
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,930
Crazy.  Cheong Ah Medical Center VIP Section 

512
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,700
Hello.

513
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,550
 From Unknown Caller: I know what you did at this time! 

514
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,760
"I know what you did at this time!"

515
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,280
What do we do, honey!?

516
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,500
This guy even knows where my office is. I'm going crazy!

517
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,540
But that creepy eye.

518
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,500
I definitely saw that somewhere.

519
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,720
Why didn't you tell me that you lost your watch?

520
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,880
Is that important right now?

521
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,110
I'm the only one who will be suspected!

522
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,580
- Chairman Ju. 
 - Jeez, really!

523
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Dr. Ha! Why didn't you find my watch that fell in the flower bed at the time?

524
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,910
What do you have eyes for, anyway?

525
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,840
You're the owner and you couldn't find it, so why blame me?

526
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,790
- Hey! You were on the ground, pushing me up! 
 - Ah, really!

527
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,580
You're really a piece of bad luck! 
  I know what you did at this time! 

528
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,870
Even those words left at the fountain before

529
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,110
and someone uploading that recording to the school's homepage, too.

530
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,840
Something chilling is going on.

531
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,960
Maybe Min Seol Ah didn't commit suicide? Maybe one of us really killed her?

532
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
Isn't that why someone is threatening us like this?

533
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,230
The truth is, isn't Chairman Ju the one who took the lead in this whole matter?

534
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,650
And he's the first one who suggested that we move Min Seol Ah's body to her apartment.

535
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,030
Maybe you wanted to take care of it quickly because you had a guilty conscience?

536
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,790
And dragging all of us into it for no reason, even setting fire to Min Seol Ah's apartment.

537
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,020
You even set her house on fire?

538
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,580
Goodness, you are such a scary man, Chairman Ju.

539
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,590
And isn't your family the one who benefitted the most from all this?

540
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:09,270
Min Seol Ah died so Seok Gyeong became the highest-ranked in the matriculating class and even got a solo part.

541
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,240
What this guy wants is exactly this.

542
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,780
To make us suspect each other and sow division.

543
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,040
What's important right now is the fountain, the recording file, and the pocket watch!

544
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,590
So that means someone knows what we did. Someone!

545
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,010
That means there is a witness.

546
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,140
We must find who that person is.

547
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,310
Finding the person who is pressuring us is the priority.

548
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,960
There is someone who is the most suspicious.

549
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,050
Who is that?

550
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,740
The person who has the recording file. The person who is not here.

551
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,990
And the person who was perfectly exempt from that night at the party.

552
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,360
You don't mean Su Ryeon, do you?

553
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,330
Why would Su Ryeon do that? When her own children are involved?

554
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,180
It must be her.

555
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,610
She was the only one who wasn't there.

556
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,430
And she protected Min Seol Ah whenever anyone talked about her.

557
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:58,190
And she was not at the party that night. She also left during the lighting ceremony.

558
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,860
Maybe... Su Ryeon really saw us?

559
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,470
She said... she was not feeling well that day...

560
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:21,500
 Your wife, Sim Su Ryeon, also kept calling her. 

561
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,980
 I'm excited to go on a date with you, it's been so long. 

562
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,570
 Don't be concerned about me, and take your time with your work. 

563
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,450
Chairman Ju, where are you going?

564
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,480
 CAMTECH VIEWER 
 Video File 

565
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,510
So how long have you been betraying me?

566
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,450
I guess you didn't know that CCTV was installed in my office?

567
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,720
I apologize, Chairman.

568
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,080
Tell me what you planned with my wife!

569
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,110
I took a beggar and made a man out of you, and you dare to betray me?

570
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:44,610
So hurry and speak. What did you tell my wife?

571
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,070
Even after you die, you cannot escape my grasp, do you know that?

572
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,570
I am grateful for you taking care of all this time.

573
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,170
 End Call 

574
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,380
Secretary Jo, get in here!

575
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,670
Find Yun Tae Ju and drag him here right away. I don't care if he's alive or dead, bring him to me!

576
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,580
Yes, Chairman.

577
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,010
What happened to what I wanted you to find out?

578
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,880
This is Madam's cell phone records.

579
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,730
Anything special?

580
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,310
I inquired about a phone number she's called many times recently.

581
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,930
It was an errand service.

582
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,780
Errand service?

583
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:39,690
Must we really go this far?

584
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,890
We look ridiculous.

585
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,400
What are you saying? She's definitely suspicious.

586
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,200
And you should take the lead on something like this, Attorney.

587
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,130
There she comes.

588
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,950
If we delay, she'll get away.

589
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,220
I'm going. Put your belts on.

590
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,170
 Aram Detective Agency 

591
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,780
Who are you guys?

592
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,010
What did this person ask you to find out?

593
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,210
Let me put it another way. Why did she come to ask you for help?

594
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:39,230
That information is confidential, and sharing it would violate the ethics of our profession.

595
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,820
Hurry and say it before I break your arms and legs.

596
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,130
I-I-I will tell you.

597
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,070
I will tell you everything, please just let me live.

598
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,210
Have you been well?

599
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,880
I'm sorry for not coming often.

600
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,740
We've caught you!

601
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,560
What are you doing here, Sim Su Ryeon?

602
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,180
How did you know about this place?

603
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,690
What? Did you even find a resting place for Min Seol Ah?

604
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,710
Why are you so fixated on Min Seol Ah, anyway?

605
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,940
What is your relationship with her?

606
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,840
What are you talking about?

607
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,030
Were you the one who's been threatening us?

608
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,110
Did you release that recording file of our children?

609
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:42,300
Su Ryeon, I didn't think you'd do that! Aren't you too much?

610
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,430
Calm down.

611
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,670
Goodness, you even have her ashes in here.

612
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,660
Su Ryeon, are you Min Seol Ah's mom or something? Huh?

613
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,970
That's not Min Seol Ah's face.

614
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,350
Who is she?

615
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,840
She is my daughter.

616
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,930
Huh?

617
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,760
My daughter died recently.

618
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,520
- What... ?
 - Huh... ?

619
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,510
Oh, dear...

620
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,610
Oh my.

621
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,110
Ma Ri, you're terrible.

622
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,310
Oh, really.

623
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,100
What's with you?

624
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,650
What did you just say? Adultery?

625
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,620
Yes, the woman in that picture you showed me asked me to find out about her husband's adultery.

626
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,340
That she suspected him of cheating on her.

627
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,010
But this is

628
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,730
private information and I'm really not supposed to tell anyone.

629
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,100
But that's really everything.

630
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,280
 J King Holdings Chairman Ju Dan Tae 

631
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,540
If this man comes to see you, please respond that I suspected my husband's adultery.

632
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,850
 I met J King Holdings Chairman Ju Dan Tae. 

633
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,970
So, did you find anything?

634
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,110
No, we gave up after looking.

635
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,860
This man was very well secured, so we couldn't find out anything.

636
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,080
Chairman Ju is really too much.

637
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,600
How can you hide away a sick daughter like that?

638
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,610
I know.

639
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,310
Su Ryeon, your heart must have hurt so much.

640
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,930
I'm so sad for you.

641
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:52,130
So all that time you were busy was all because of your daughter?

642
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,610
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier.

643
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,800
Why would you be sorry to us, Su Ryeon?

644
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,430
Your husband is the abnormal one for saying you can't tell anyone.

645
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,120
I heard that Seol Ah committed suicide.

646
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,970
But my daughter was so sick that I couldn't pay any attention.

647
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,080
You've been through so much.

648
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,080
Think of me as your big sister and rely on me.

649
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,040
We've known each other for years, after all.

650
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,870
Is this child a product of adultery, by any chance?

651
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,660
If not, there isn't any reason for Chairman Ju to completely hide her away, is there?

652
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,740
Isn't that true?

653
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,640
Teacher Cheon, how can you say that right now?

654
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,290
A parent heartbroken over her child's loss. How can you say something so harshâ€”

655
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,640
You were here?

656
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,070
Why didn't you answer my calls?

657
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,100
Let's go.

658
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,750
I'm sorry.

659
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,000
They chased me to the charnel house, I didn't have any choice.

660
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,450
Hye In already left us, so I should have kept quiet about her until the end.

661
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,660
They are the wrong ones, for having followed you.

662
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,320
It would be nice if this were an opportunity for you to become closer to the HeraClub ladies.

663
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,820
And I'm fine with all this, so don't worry about me.

664
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,210
Where are you right now?

665
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,730
I think my husband has caught on to something. I think it would be best for you to leave right away.

666
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:07,730
Take the next flightâ€”

667
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:12,440
I was actually on my way to the airport, after having settled my affairs.

668
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,480
That's a relief.

669
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,030
Please contact me after you arrive.

670
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:20,370
No, I think this is the end of all business between us.

671
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:24,260
There won't be any reason for me to contact you again.

672
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,190
Please be well.

673
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:33,140
I am grateful, Director Yun.

674
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:48,980
Chairman, this is my last act of loyalty to you.

675
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,970
 Two Months Later 

676
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,910
What is this?

677
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,280
This phone was in that air conditioning vent.

678
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,000
Who is that? She's not a resident here.

679
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,230
I'm sure the owner will come looking for it.

680
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:52,130
â™ª Die Lerche in blaue HÃ¶h entschwebt, der Tauwind weht so lau â™ª

682
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,250
Seok Gyeong, your cold has gotten worse.

683
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,840
Tomorrow is the matriculation ceremony. You cannot perform a solo like this.

684
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,690
Go to the hospital.

685
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,060
I think Seok Gyeong will have to give up.

686
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,970
You practiced diligently, so this is regrettable, but what can we do?

687
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,870
We cannot ruin an important concert because of you.

688
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:30,920
Someone else will have to sing Seok Gyeong's solo part and we don't have time.

689
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,320
Is there anyone who can do it?

690
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,020
I will do it.

691
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,520
Will you? Are you confident?

692
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,280
Yes, let me try it.

693
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,770
Then Eun Byeol will sing the solo.

694
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:47,020
Please... give me a chance, too.

695
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,470
Bae Ro Na, are you crazy?

696
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,570
How dare you, not knowing your place?

697
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:08,600
Is that so? Then let's hear both of you sing and choose fairly?

698
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,690
Who will go first?

699
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,040
â™ª Die Lerche in blaue HÃ¶h entschwebt,

705
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,350
I heard your singing well.

706
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,080
So I'll decide.

707
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,150
This song...

708
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,200
Ro Na sang it better than Eun Byeol, in every aspect.

709
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,490
Bae Ro Na, you will sing the solo tomorrow.

710
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,350
Thank you, Teacher. I will work really hard.

711
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,100
The matriculation concert must be the best. You can do well, can't you?

712
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,860
Yes.

713
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,670
I'll look forward to it.

714
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,450
I borrowed it on such short notice, but it fits so well.

715
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,210
Your are so pretty, my daughter.

716
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,660
Am I really going to sing solo at the Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Concert?

717
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,880
Mom, this isn't a dream, is it? A bunch of famous vocalists are coming this year, I heard.

718
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,740
I will do really well, just like you, Mom.

719
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,520
I will flatten the noses of all those kids who made fun of me for being on the waiting list.

720
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,990
Yes, I'm proud of you.

721
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:56,010
My daughter makes me smile.

722
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,500
Thank you.

723
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,820
But Mom, why do you look so down lately?

724
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,910
Do you have any worries?

725
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,340
No, of course not.

726
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,950
Let's hurry.

727
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,900
Are you ready? We just have to get out of this traffic jam.

728
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,490
Yes.

729

 Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Ceremony

01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:52,220
 2020 Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Ceremony 

731
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,440
Yes, what's going on?

732
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,670
Got it.

733
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,770
Alright, good work.

734
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,180
Ha Eun Byeol, get ready.

735
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,090
That solo part was always yours.

736
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:20,840
Your grandfather is here.  This is is your chance to show him

737
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,650
that you are the future owner of Cheong Ah Arts School.

738
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,920
Ro Na? Are you alright, Ro Na?

739
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,410
Ro Na? Let me see?

740
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,180
Let's go to the hospital.

741
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:53,250
Mom, I'm alright. I have to go to the concert.

742
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,080
Ro Na, you're badly hurt, we have to go to the hospital.

743
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,650
I told you, I am fine!

744
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,040
Hurry, I have to go to school.

745
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,540
I can't be late, hurry, please.

746
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,300
What do I do?

747
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:39,900
Ro Na, hold on tight.

748
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,120
 We will begin the Cheong Ah Arts School Matriculation Ceremony for 2020 now. 

749
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,610
You cannot enter after the concert begins.

750
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,710
Out of my way, I have to get on stage.

751
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,500
The concert hasn't begun yet.

752
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,580
You cannot.

753
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,860
I am a soloist for this concert. I have to go inside.

754
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,240
You cannot, I told you!

755
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:38,950
Oh really! I have to go inside!

756
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,970
She's asking to go in!

757
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,150
Oh really!

758
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,640
Let's go.

759
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,770
Get them!

760
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:00,340
Here.

761
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,220
Mom!

 Sim Su Ryeon, just what are you thinking? 

769
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,150
 It was the first time in my life, the words, "I love you." 

770
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,820
 Oh Yun Hui, that loser, bought the dead Min Seol Ah's unit? 

771
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,700
 She is definitely somehow connected to Min Seol Ah. 

772
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,670
 Did you kill Min Seol Ah by torturing her like you are doing to me? 

773
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:41,450
 Do you want me to die like Min Seol Ah did? 

774
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,370
 I have to do whatever I can to protect my child. 

775
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,630
 Did you kill Min Seol Ah, Father? 

776
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,350
 I want to live in a place like this, too. Like Hera Palace. 

777
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,890
 Even if I have to sell half of my heart, I will let you live here.
