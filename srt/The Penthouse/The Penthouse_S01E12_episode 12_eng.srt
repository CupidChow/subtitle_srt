2
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,070
You're trying to stop me with that?

3
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,310
That's all you learned from your mom, isn't it?

4
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,950
What did you just say?

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,200
I won't let you attack me again!

6
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,120
What...

7
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,470
Did you just say?

8
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,790
You have your own daughter separately.

9
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,270
Who are you?

10
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,640
Are you curious about who I am?

11
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,460
Min Seol Ah's mother?

12
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,330
What's your identity?

13
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,040
Me?

14
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,870
Director!

15
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,070
  Episode 12 

16
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,630
Fortunately, no one saw.

17
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,090
- Ow. 
 - What are you doing right now?

18
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,020
The final audition is coming up, why do you look like this?

19
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,910
I did nothing wrong. Ha Eun Byeol started it first.

20
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,460
She tried to stab me with her hair pin!

21
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,370
I'm going to report her for school violence.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,340
- Did anyone see it happen? 
 - What?

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,220
Is there any proof that you are right?

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,580
If there are no witnesses, you could be lying right now.

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,060
Because you've always been jealous of Eun Byeol.

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,850
The situation right now,

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,890
it looks like you are the perpetrator.

28
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,020
Looking at you right now,

29
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,780
20 years ago, my mom must've felt so lonely and frustrated, and it was unfair.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,540
I understand now.

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,390
If you had acknowledged your mistakes and apologized,

32
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,060
then your daughter would've been raised into a proper person.

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,100
What did you say?

34
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,770
How rude of you, why are you glaring at her!

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,830
Watch your words. I'm the Director of Arts at this school.

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,170
Today's incident could result in a suspension.

37
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,870
It will be good for you to remember that.

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,860
Let's go, Eun Byeol.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,500
Don't run away and tell me.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,160
Who are you? How do you know Seol Ah?

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,990
No. How do you know Seol Ah is my daughter?

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,810
Where are you placing those dirty hands, Ajumma?

43
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,760
And why are you so confident?

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,570
Is this something the whole world can know?

45
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,330
Then why did you hide it for so long?

46
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,640
I don't care who you are.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,650
But don't think about getting in the way of my plans.

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,650
If you say a single word about Seol Ah, I won't tolerate it.

49
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,930
If you don't tolerate it,

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,000
is this how you got rid of everyone who knew your identity?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,230
Like Jo Sang Heon and Director Min?

52
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,100
Don't think that I'll stay still like an idiot and let you get rid of me like they did.

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,560
But I'll give you a chance.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,160
A chance for you to tell the truth with your own mouth.

55
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,570
Reveal the truth that Min Seol Ah is your daughter.

56
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,730
To your dear and precious husband and kids.

57
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,330
This isn't an issue for you to get involved with.

58
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,670
She's my daughter, and my problem.

59
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,950
How interesting.

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,730
You don't want to break up your sweet family.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
Maybe this is what aggravated me to get involved.

62
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,450
  Oppa, you said you would find my mom, right? 

63
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,460
 You have to find her. 

64
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,580
  Why are you looking for your mom after all this time?  She abandoned you. 

65
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,540
  I have something I want to check. 

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,130
  I want to know how she's living. 

67
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,750
  How do you you want her to be living? 

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,220
  I wish Mom is as unhappy as I am. 

69
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,700
  I wish Mom is as unhappy as I am. 

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,710
  I wish Mom is as unhappy as I am. 

71
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,910
Do you understand now?

72
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,840
How much Seol Ah hated you?

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,690
My Seol Ah,

74
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,840
was looking for me?

75
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,390
She was looking for you immensely!

76
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,790
She didn't even know her mom who abandoned her was right in front of her.

77
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,400
She looked and looked, and looked for you!

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,930
You didn't even recognize your own daughter's face.

79
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,200
You're not a mom.

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,750
I'm going to fulfill Seol Ah's last wish.

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,350
I'll follow you until the ends of hell, and make you miserable.

82
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,830
So that you'll never have a smile on that face again.

83
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
I'll give you ten days.

84
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,710
To tell the truth to your family.

85
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,030
That's more than enough time to think about it.

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,270
If you don't, I'll take matters into my own hands.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,870
Seol Ah.

88
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,610
  Logan, say hi to Anna. 

89
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,260
 Oppa, hi. 

90
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,470
  Isn't it pretty? 

91
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,470
  Eat it Oppa, it's really good. 

92
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,560
  Get rid of it. 

93
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,870
  I'm not scared at all. 

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,630
 1.5 milliters of novocaine. 

95
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,500
  Aspiration. 

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,980
  Punch. 

97
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,850
- Oppa. 
 - Anna.

98
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,760
 Oppa, it didn't hurt at all. 

99
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,950
  Let's heal quickly and go home together. 

100
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,510
  I didn't steal it! 

101
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,060
  It was them! 

102
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,250
  - I didn't steal! 
 - Shut up! 

103
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,520
 Oppa! Oppa, say something! 

104
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,690
  You said Anna stole this. 

105
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,360
  Logan. 

106
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,260
  There was no other choice. 

107
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,300
  Anna is an obstacle in your future. 

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,700
  She'll uselessly become an issue with the inheritance! 

109
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,170
  How could you do this? 

110
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,050
  How could you do this to Anna? 

111
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,300
  How can a person do this? 

112
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,560
  Seol Ah, your mom's happiness, 

113
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,120
  is something I can't let happen. 

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 Cheong Ah Arts School Parking Lots 

115
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,820
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

116
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,590
Look into a person for me.

117
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,530
His name Gu Ho Dong. He's the PE teacher at Cheong Ah Arts.

118
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,360
 He rides a sports bike, and he could be from Hope Orphanage. 

119
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,440
 The faster you find information, the more I pay you. 

120
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,230
  I have to hurry. 

121
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,500
  My plans could turn to dust if Gu Ho Dong opens his mouth first. 

122
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,580
Seol Ah committed suicide?

123
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,910
No!

124
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,250
Seol Ah would never. She would never commit suicide.

125
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,810
Teacher Gu Ho Dong hit Seok Hun?  Why?

126
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,300
Teacher said Oppa hit Ahn Eun Hu so he got back at Oppa for him.

127
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Who did he think he was? He even accepted my money but...

128
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,450
No matter how much I think about him, he is still weird.

129
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,180
He often makes us run laps in the schoolyard and gives us demerits.  He especially treats Oppa harsher.

130
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,070
As if he has a grudge against him.

131
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,250
Please let him get fired right away.  I feel awful.

132
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,060
I'll take care of it.

133
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,980
It's me, Teacher Gu Ho Dong.

134
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,850
By chance, are you free now?

135
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,190
Wow!

136
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,890
Do you like baseball?

137
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,970
We're going to loosen ourselves up with my precious Dongsaeng. If you join us, it'll be fun.

138
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,510
Baseball?

139
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,660
Wow, just looking at the bats, these are for the pros.

140
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,390
Wow.

141
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,050
Just looking at us, Teacher Gu is the youngest. You have an advantage.

142
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,860
Since you're a PE teacher, you must have good athletic ability, of course.

143
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,340
Let's be a winner who hits the most score hits from 3 pitches.

144
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,330
Are you betting on something?

145
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,350
How about the winner's wish being granted?

146
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,630
For me, I like to have a blank check.

147
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,020
Well, I don't usually enjoy betting with money.

148
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,090
Who is the pitcher?

149
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,430
Who is that person?

150
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,140
BK, Player Kim Byeong Hyeon?

151
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,590
He is like Chairman Ju's brother.

152
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,460
The legendary player Kim Byeong Hyeon, who throws a submarine pitch?

153
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,210
Aigoo, Hyeong-nim, it's nice to meet you.

154
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,150
 Gu Ho Dong vs. Ju Dan Tae vs. Lee Gyu Jin] 

155
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,000
 Gu Ho Dong vs. Ju Dan Tae 

156
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,740
Take it easy on throwing the balls to Hyung-nim.

157
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,650
 Gu Ho Dong vs. Ju Dan Tae 

158
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,310
Teacher Gu, you're out! Out!

159
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,300
Holy!

160
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,320
It's a home run!

161
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,770
Oh my! I feel so sorry.  I won.

162
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,010
Teacher Gu, did you cheat us?  You're completely a pro.

163
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,220
Strangely, the ball was seen so big today.

164
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,880
Chairman Ju, I'm disappointed in you.  Was your ability just up to it?

165
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,460
That's enough.  Just tell me your wish.

166
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,570
I just sent you a text.

167
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,170
You too, Hyung-nim.

168
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,270
What the heck?  What are you doing right now?

169
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,070
You told me you erased all at the time!

170
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,030
- It was a lie. 
 - Lie—

171
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,490
My wish is that this video clip will be disclosed to the world.

172
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,700
How dare you try to wipe your mouth after swallowing my money?

173
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,640
Money?  What money?

174
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,560
Ah, are you talking about the golden turtles?

175
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,020
I left them intact in your sofa.

176
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,400
Haven't you seen them yet?

177
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,160
You fearlessly fooled me like this?

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,840
Don't you think you have a nasty temper, Hyung-nim?

179
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,380
How am I your hyung-nim?

180
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,970
Anyway, a bet is a bet.  So keep your promise for sure.

181
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,010
I'm get going because I have a class tomorrow morning.

182
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,070
- Hey! 
 - T-That...

183
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,610
Are you sure he is just a school teacher?

184
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,710
He is completely a wacko!

185
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,820
That insolent bastard!  I should've nipped him in the bud in the beginning.

186
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,280
Wow, really!

187
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,880
Honey, how do I look?  Am I pretty?

188
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
Don't stare at me like that.  It makes me embarrassed.

189
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,650
Again?

190
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,730
Your beard is poking me, Mr. Dan Tae.

191
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,760
Honey, stop it.

192
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,540
This product is very safe but there is no guarantee for the big return.

193
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,550
Just consider it as a kind of bank account.

194
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,600
I don't have income right now so I want to earn some money.

195
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,610
Have you heard "high risk, high return".

196
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,280
Yes.

197
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,350
This is a product that only we know about.

198
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,850
If everything goes well, this product will be a big hit.

199
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,010
Big hit?

200
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,550
This is called Dr. BioGen. 
    

201
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,950
This is the company that is developing the first genetic therapy for respiratory disease in Korea.

202
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,470
As you see...

203
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,060
Tomorrow is the audition.  What are you doing without practicing?

204
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,800
Mom, what should I do if No Ra does better than me?

205
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,500
No Ra enunciates words precisely and she is pretty.

206
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,320
She doesn't get nervous easily.

207
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,390
If I stand in front of people, I'll get scared and my heart will explore.

208
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,260
That's why you did that to Ro Na.

209
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,130
I heard you attacked No Ra with a hair pin.

210
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,630
What would you do if it got into a big problem?

211
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,260
She kept getting on my nerves.

212
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,110
I can't live with her even for a day!

213
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,440
I don't like her living at Hera Palace and I don't like us attending the same school, either!

214
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,400
You saw she talked back to you earlier!

215
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,430
I wish Bae Ro Na would disappear in front of me forever!

216
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,500
How can you be the best classical vocalist with a glass-like mentality?

217
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,890
You have to be audacious in front of audiences with tens of thousands if you want to stand on a European opera stage.

218
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,500
My daughter can do only this much?

219
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,270
I'm scared.  What if I make a mistake in front of the examiners tomorrow?

220
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,770
I heard all of them used to be the renowned announcers.

221
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,220
I really don't want to lose to Bae Ro Na.

222
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,900
Read this.

223
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,930
What is this?

224
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,170
It's an audition script.

225
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,550
Where did you get it?  This is supposed to be disclosed at the audition.

226
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,870
 2020 Cheong Ah Publicity Model Audition Script 

227
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,850
 I really shouldn't do this. 

228
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,540
 This won't be a problem, will it? 

229
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,040
 Don't worry. 

230
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,240
 Sunbae, you are always so cool, even at the time of studying abroad. 

231
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,440
 You're still beautiful after quitting your news anchor job. 

232
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,920
 Can you, the great Cheon Seo Jin, make such an obsequious remark? 

233
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,400
 They say even Buddha would sway in front of his child.  I think a child must be important to a parent. 

234
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,010
 It's not my child is lacking.  I just want to make sure of everything. 

235
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,410
 It's your plan that I was recommended as an examiner, right? 

236
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,330
 I chose you to take care of all the events for Cheong Ah Foundation this year. 

237
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,040
 I think this would be enough for me to pay you back. 

238
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,180
But... is the test conducted in English?

239
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,000
Everybody is busy practicing the Korean pronunciation.

240
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,360
The important part for the audition test is English. That's the key point.

241
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,550
You are confident of your English pronunciation, aren't you?

242
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,500
Yes.  I won't lose to Seok Gyeong for sure, either.

243
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,530
Even more to a beggar-like Bae Ro Na.

244
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,500
Your grandfather is the chairman of Cheong Ah.

245
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,570
Who dares to attempt to get that position?

246
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,010
When is the best time to set a meeting?

247
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,720
I can meet you at anytime you please.

248
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,450
Okay then. How about we meet at the hotel coffee shop around 4?

249
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,380
Fantastic. Okay.  Have a good night.

250
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,470
Well.

251
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,940
Have a cup of tea.  It seems the work went well.

252
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,490
I think the business that gave me a headache for the past few days will go well.  How about your work?

253
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm getting used to it.

254
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,220
When you say it's good, I'm also happy.

255
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,360
   
 Let's meet at my lesson room right now. 

256
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,010
Something just came up so I have to leave.

257
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,530
I may come home late, so you go to bed first.

258
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,480
Are you still upset because of Oh Yun Hui?

259
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,560
You boasted that you could kick Oh Yun Hui out, but what's this?

260
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,540
Even the vote at Steering Committee didn't go as we wanted.

261
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,980
I didn't know there would be unexpected traitors.

262
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,520
This isn't a time to say that so carelessly.

263
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,510
Oh Yun Hui and her daughter keep getting on my nerves. It drives me crazy.

264
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,140
I can't live in this way, seriously.

265
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't worry, as I've prepared something for you.

266
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,990
This time, the heavenly luck wouldn't be able to help Oh Yun Hui.

267
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,690
- Are you sure? 
 - Don't you trust me?

268
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,250
I do.

269
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,280
That's why... I'll get a divorce soon.

270
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,660
What?

271
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,830
What's this?  Why are you looking at like that?

272
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,740
If I'm freed, it will be better for you too, won't it?

273
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm not asking you to give me the seat of Lady of your Penthouse right away,

274
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
so don't be so shocked.

275
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,060
I heard Dr. Ha went to a seminar, but I guess it wasn't the case.

276
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,230
As soon as I become the chairwoman of Cheong Ah Foundation, I'll proceed with the divorce.

277
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,890
Ha Yun Cheol is just nothing more than a burden,

278
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,050
as I'm just too busy to divorce now.

279
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,990
I don't want to get tired any longer because of such a guy like him.

280
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,140
I've done everything I could.

281
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,450
You must have suffered a lot in many ways.

282
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,690
Wow, your face became quite drawn.

283
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,840
I'll give you perfect service tonight.

284
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,420
 2020 Cheong Ah Arts School - Speech Contest for PR Model 

285
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,130
 Thank you for your precious time despite your busy schedule. 

286
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,100
For the evaluation of this contest, I'd like to ask your fair judgement more than ever.

287
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,250
There should never be any outside pressure or corruption.

288
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,180
As we maintained its security as tight as CSAT's,

289
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,060
you don't have to worry at all, Ms. Cheon.

290
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,300
We'll now begin the audition for PR models of Cheong Ah Arts School (CAAS).

291
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,830
You will come forward in the order of names I call,

292
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,330
and read the script on the prompter.

293
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,140
Yu Je Ni, to the audition hall, please.

294
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,310
- Am I the first one? 
 - Yeah.

295
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,940
Oh, no... Dang, I'm so nervous!

296
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,180
Hello, I'm Yu Je Ni, a freshman from Music Department, Class 1.

297
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,060
 Speech Test for CAAS PR Model 
  No one knows but wonder! 

298
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,150
 The schools that teach well, the schools that take the lead ... 

299
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:21,360
T-The s-school that... t-take the lead...

300
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,260
And the... schools that...

301
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,340
What's this?

302
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,580
J-Je Ni...

303
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,970
Hey! How was it?  Was it difficult?

304
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,250
I'm screwed. I totally blew it.

305
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,840
The script was in English!

306
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,720
- English? 
 - English...?

307
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,000
Up to now, the speech test's script has never been in English before.

308
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,510
But it doesn't matter, though.  What's wrong with it being in English?

309
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,550
Next, Bae Ro Na, to the audition hall.

310
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,690
I'm Bae Ro Na, a freshman from Music Department, Class 1.

311
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,880
You can read the script on the prompter in front of you.

312
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,200
 Challenge!  We're Looking For The New Face of Cheong Ah Arts School (CAAS) 

313
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,280
I can't do this.

314
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,390
What? You can't?

315
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,420
Then, alright, you may leave.

316
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,010
I'm not saying that I give it up,

317
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,480
but I'm saying that I can't take this corrupted audition.

318
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,140
Because the script was leaked in advance.

319
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,120
I heard it clearly

320
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,500
that someone was practicing the speech with this script.

321
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,580
 - What? 
 - How could it be... 
 - It doesn't make sense! 

322
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,410
 How could it happen? 

323
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,480
 (in English) Cheong Ah Arts High School is training creative artists 

324
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,680
 by systematically executing progressive art education. 

325
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,660
 On the one hand, we increased students musicality  

326
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,410
 with practical lessons and tailored professional... 

327
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,910
 It's okay, Ha Eun Byeol. 

328
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,080
 You can do it well. 

329
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,750
 Such a mere girl like Bae Ro Na, I'm going to crush her. 

330
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,100
 She was clearly practicing it in English. 

331
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,750
If the script wasn't leaked in advance,

332
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,980
she wouldn't have any reason to practice the script in English.

333
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,010
Who are you saying leaked the script?

334
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,100
Even we, the judges, received the script

335
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,140
just before the audition was started.

336
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,200
About that, obviously I don't know.

337
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,230
However, as the suspicion was raised,

338
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,510
don't you think you should change the script?

339
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,140
For the fair audition, I mean.

340
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,120
If you don't have any confidence, you can just drop out.

341
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,920
How dare you nitpick on some nonsense?

342
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,870
Alright, stop stalling any more time but leave immediately, Bae Ro Na.

343
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,480
I think what Ro Na said is right.

344
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,250
The audition's script is posted on the school's homepage,

345
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,990
 - What is this? 
 - What?  

346
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,460
 - Oh my... 
 - She's right. 

347
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,210
 This isn't right! 

348
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,180
 - Gosh... 
 - It's completely the same! 

349
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,930
 2020 CAAS PR Model - Audition Script 

350
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,920
She's right.

351
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,910
It's exactly same as the one on the prompter.

352
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,920
What's this, what's going on?

353
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,440
No way.  Did you know about this in advance, Teacher Cheon?

354
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,380
No, I didn't.  I didn't know about it either.

355
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,740
As the script was leaked in advance, it doesn't make sense to proceed the audition as is.

356
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,090
In this case, to get everyone's approval,

357
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,630
you'd better change the script for this audition.

358
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,010
For the sake of proving your innocence too, Teacher Cheon,

359
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,440
you wouldn't object, would you?

371
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,940
Were you surprised?

372
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,220
I guess you didn't know the script was changed.

373
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,010
What are you trying to say?

374
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,780
Earlier, at the restroom,

375
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,460
I heard everything that you were practicing in English.

376
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,470
Is it you again?  Is it your hobby to keep messing with me?

377
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,180
Can you get it now?

378
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,950
You can't do anything  with your own skill only, without your mom's help.

379
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,270
You ran away in tears after stuttering,

380
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,290
and that's exactly your level. 
 - Shut up!

381
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,830
Tell me,

382
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,630
it was you who put cigarettes in my pencil case, wasn't it?

383
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,550
Were you so unsure of yourself?

384
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,620
Is that why you did such a thing to make me give up?

385
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,200
Say something if I'm wrong!

386
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,570
Bae Ro Na, this is because of you!

387
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,050
It's all because of you!!

388
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,430
You're playing a trick again, aren't you?

389
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,640
You think I would fall for it?

390
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,250
Hey, Eun Byeol!

391
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,490
- Oh my... 
 - Eun Byeol, Ha Eun Byeol!

392
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,060
Eun Byeol, wake up!

393
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,170
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

394
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,240
- Eun Byeol!  Ha Eun Byeol! 
 - What should we do?

395
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,740
Open your eyes!

396
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,140
Hey, Ha Eun Byeol, what's wrong with you?

397
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,620
Wake up!

398
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,300
Ha Eun Byeol!  Wake up!

399
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,310

 CAAS PR Model - The Final Winners - Male: Ju Seok Hun, Female: Ju Seok Gyeong 

402
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,600
Yes, our dear Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong,

403
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,060
the first twins PR models in CAAS history!

404
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,080
Let's give them a big hand!

405
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,940
I guess the energy of penthouse is indeed great,

406
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,380
as it's not easy for both siblings to be excellent.

407
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,610
I have nothing to envy others about,

408
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,710
but for your kids, I do envy you.

409
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,860
Thank you for congratulating them.

410
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,010
With Hera Club members, shall we have a proper party this weekend?

411
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,350
- Yay! 
 - Great!

412
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,750
 Welcome. This way please. 

413
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,260
Why are you so late? I've been waiting for you.

414
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,290
Welcome, Ro Na.

415
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,250
Bae Ro Na, I heard your role at today's audition was great.

416
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,390
Thanks, it was all thanks to you.

417
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,680
You become the model because you did a good job.

418
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,450
I sincerely congratulate you, Seok Gyeong,

419
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,510
and you too, Seok Hun.

420
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,970
Min Hyeok, what are you doing?  You should give them the gifts.

421
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,720
Je Ni, you too.

422
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,670
As you guys have everything, it was hard to choose the item.

423
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,200
Ta-da!  This is for you, Seok Gyeong.

424
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,850
- Thank you! 
 - This is the hottest perfume.

425
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,990
When are you going to give yours?

426
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,200
It's not expensive, though.

427
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,190
It's pretty.

428
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,530
Should we go to the community room?

429
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,140
Let's go.

430
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,960
- Go have fun. 
- Have fun Ro Na!

431
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,310
Yun Hui, Yun Hui come over here! Let's have a drink together. It's so nice seeing you like this.

432
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,320
Oh my.

433
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,510
Since when were you two friends? Don't tell me. Min Hyeok's mom, did you oppose her eviction?

434
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,750
What are you talking about?

435
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,550
I thought you voted for me, Je Ni's mom. Did you not?

436
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,950
Why would I vote in your favor?

437
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,240
Hatred is still a form of affection.

438
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,840
I thought you liked me, I guess not.

439
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,510
Our kids have known each other since middle school,

440
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,630
and now we live across the hall, so let's get along, Unni.

441
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,030
Is this how you always get people on your side?

442
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,560
By kissing up to them.

443
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,270
Honey.

444
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,810
She's a guest who came to congratulate our kids.

445
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,940
It's ok.

446
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,680
I kiss up to the people I chose to. I don't do it to just anyone.

447
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,570
- What did you say? 
 - This time you were a bit rude, Chairman Ju.

448
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,670
Your words weren't very classy, and it wasn't funny either.

449
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,400
Aigoo! What happened to our Eun Byeol? I heard she fainted.

450
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,940
Aigoo, Teacher Cheon is probably very upset right now.

451
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,020
She was suspected for cheating the audition, Eun Byeol failed,

452
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,540
and Doctor Ha packed his stuff and left—

453
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,750
What do you mean he packed his stuff? Why would Doctor Ha do that?

454
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,530
What is it?

455
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,770
Honey, Honey. You tell them.

456
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,580
Why did you uselessly bring that up?

457
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,430
That household is very spectacular. How do I explain it?

458
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,850
A rose. And thorns, it hurts! Then tears.

459
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,090
The certainty that she'll be my client, and then Doctor Ha!

460
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,100
Where's Eun Byeol?

461
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,780
She's sleeping, see her later.

462
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,530
Eun Byeol, you should sleep properly—

463
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,870
Stop laughing! I said stop laughing!

464
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,410
Eun Byeol! What's wrong?

465
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,280
This sound. Their laughter!  Are you sneering at me?

466
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,610
It's so loud! Stop it!

467
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,390
Eun Byeol, get it together!

468
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,860
What sound are you talking about?

469
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,380
Eun Byeol, look at me. Eun Byeol!

470
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Dad, when did you get here? Are you done with your symposium?

471
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,250
Eun Byeol, are you ok?

472
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,770
What do you mean? I'm completely normal.

473
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,110
Dad, I failed to become the school ambassador, sorry.

474
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,350
But don't worry! I'll be first place in the midterm exams.

475
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,580
And I'll also win the trophy at the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

476
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,230
Then you won't hate me right?

477
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,620
Why would I hate you?

478
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,400
You don't have to be first place.

479
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,370
I don't like that, I won't allow it.

480
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,620
I like that you're here now.

481
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,070
Ha Eun Byeol, if you woke up, you should start studying.

482
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,670
You have to make up for this mistake during the midterm exams.

483
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,230
Ok.

484
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,660
I set everything up for you, yet you couldn't finish it properly?

485
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,310
You should've been careful so it wouldn't leak out, how could you let that happen and embarrass me?

486
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,500
Stop it. She's a patient right now. How could you say that after seeing her in this state?

487
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,190
How can you live in this jungle-like world without being cruel?

488
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,780
Eun Byeol, you have to rest, don't do anything.

489
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,630
No, I have to study.

490
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,820
I can't become first place if I rest like others. I'm ok, Dad.

491
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,230
Are you out of your mind? She's sick right now!

492
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,510
She was saying strange things in her sleep earlier.

493
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,440
She ruined the audition, how dare she make excuses?

494
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,570
Do you know how embarrassed I was in front of the parents?

495
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,120
She should repay by placing first in her midterm exams if she embarrassed her grandfather's name like that.

496
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,170
Is that exam important right now?

497
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,810
Are you even worried about Eun Byeol?

498
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,450
That's not something you would say after leaving her in the house like that.

499
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,970
I won't raise Eun Byeol into a loser like you.

500
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,120
So don't get involved in my child's education.

501
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,450
How... how did you become like this?

502
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,950
No, Cheon Seo Jin was always this kind of person.

503
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:16,720
Stop being a hypocrite, acting like you are noble and have a conscience.

504
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,940
The moment you abandoned Oh Yun Hui and chose me,

505
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,150
you became a clump of greed worse than me.

506
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,060
I don't care if you treat me like an idiot or not.

507
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,230
But I won't allow you to ruin Eun Byeol.

508
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,820
So have you returned?

509
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,190
That's good.

510
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,020
If you're going to divorce her, find some evidence and then stab her in the back.

511
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,110
Are you having fun?

512
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:03,930
Aigoo, your face looks rough, Doctor Ha.

513
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,560
That medical lawsuit looks like it's going to end well. Your wife—

514
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,020
Ah, Mrs. Seo Jin, met with the patient and took care of it.

515
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,740
Doctor Ha is lucky to have his wife.

516
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,100
Ow, seriously?

517
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,170
Why are you doing that? So savage.

518
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,790
Let's watch our words in front of the man with the knife.

519
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,660
Did I say something wrong?

520
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,230
Isn't it natural to be happy if I compliment your wife?

521
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,990
It's been a while since you said you would take care of the Myeongdong case, why haven't we heard anything?

522
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,500
If it's not something you can resolve, then tell us.

523
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,740
Doctor Ha, you keep pushing the boundaries. Hera club's teamwork shouldn't be this bad.

524
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,700
I have an appointment with Logan Lee this afternoon.

525
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,360
While we're on the subject,

526
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,440
after this Myeongdong case is done, I'm leaving the Hera club.

527
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:12,130
I asked to meet you today to tell that. So hurry up and use those great skills.

528
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,780
That bastard, how dare he be so rude.

529
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,260
Calm down.

530
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,590
Doctor Ha is going through puberty right now.

531
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:27,120
Is that my fault? Why is he letting his anger out on me?

532
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,750
No, let's eat before we leave.

533
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,190
Why is he getting mad at me?

534
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,060
And it is your fault.

535
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,380
Wow, that bastard is more brazen than I imagined.

536
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,790
Should I unveil this? Should I?

537
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,580
 D-8 

538
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,470
  I'll give you ten days. To tell the truth to your family. 

539
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,730
- A family picture is missing in my study. Have you seen it? 
- No.

540
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,380
Ask the maid Yang to put it back in.  I like that picture.

541
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,210
I will.

542
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,940
 D-8 

543
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:39,980
  Only eight days left. There's not much time, I have to hurry. 

544
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,750
Dr. BioGen? You're talking abut the medicine  to treat the respiratory disease, right?

545
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,530
  This is something only we know about, but it's going to  make big money soon. 

546
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,120
  Its called Dr. Bio Gen. 

547
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,030
If it's awaiting FDA approval, then we should hurry.

548
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,090
As it's your words, Mr. Assemblyman, it must be a certain information, of course.

549
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,230
I'll buy it right away. Yes.

550
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,400
 Dr. BioGen (Corporation) Investment Analysis by Sinnara Investment Consultant 

551
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,630
That's right. Dr. BioGen.

552
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,020
I want to withdraw everything.

553
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,150
If I break my savings account and mortgage my apartment, I can gather about 1 billion won (1 million USD).

554
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,700
It's all the money I have.

555
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,020
You made a good choice.

556
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,440
I'll buy you a good meal.

557
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,600
He's staying at this hotel?

558
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,790
This is a six star, very high end hotel.

559
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:05,830
It is. And he stays in a very expensive suite room that costs several thousand dollar per day.

560
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,230
He's known as a moocher among the school teachers,

561
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,480
I wonder if he extorts money from someone.

562
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,250
Is he not from Hope Orphanage?

563
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,800
No. There's no one named Gu Ho Dong at Hope Orphanage.

564
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,170
Look into it more. Gu Ho Dong may not be his real name.

565
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,280
As fast as you can.

566
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,260
That's all for today.

567
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,830
Attention. Bow.

568
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,470
- Goodbye. 
 - Thank you.

569
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,780
I love you.

570
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,390
  Min Seol Ah: Hey guys? 

571
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,430
 How have you been? 

572
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,420
Seok Gyeong, what's wrong?

573
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,310
It's nothing.

574
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,780
What's with this text?  No way, did Min Seol Ah send it?

575
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,650
What are you talking about?  Of course, someone is playing a prank.

576
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,690
Who plays such a prank using a dead person's name.  I feel awful.

577
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,390
I keep on being invited even if I leave the chat.

578
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,080
I'm so frightened.

579
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,480
  Min Seol Ah, Ju Seok Hun, Yu Je Ni, Ju Seok Gyeong, Lee Min Hyeok (6) 

580
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,300
 Min Seol Ah invites Ju Seok Hun,  ... Yu Je Ni,  ... Ju Seok Gyeong, ... Lee Min Hyeok. 

581
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,690
 Now. Look over here! 

582
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,600
 I'll take some good shots. 

583
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,030
 Your pose is great.  The visuals are amazing. 

584
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,400
 Finally you look as the true Min Seol Ah of Bosong Village. 

585
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,120
 It really suits you so well. 

586
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,200
 Why don't you consider changing your career path? 

587
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,450
 How dare you act like a teacher when you are nothing? 

588
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,660
Turn it off! Turn it off right now!

589
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,800
Isn't this a file which we deleted already?  Who would ...

590
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,330
Cell phone.  It must have been recorded on Min Seol Ah's phone.

591
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,310
Then it's real? Are you saying Min Seol Ah didn't die?

592
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,540
Stop talking nonsense. She's dead.

593
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,620
Have you forgotten she killed herself in Bosong Village?

594
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,770
The person who found her phone is playing a prank.

595
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,020
Everybody get your heads on straight. Get out of the chat room immediately and block it.

596
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,110
And don't tell anyone, especially any adult.

597
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,080
What's the matter with you?

598
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,730
Come to think about it, you were strange at the time as well.

599
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,730
You're hiding something about Min Seol Ah, aren't you?

600
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,340
No way, did you kill Min Seol Ah?

601
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,930
No! I don't know!

602
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:36,250
Ha Eun Byeol, look at me in the eyes and tell me honestly.

603
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,410
What do you know?

604
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,290
What is it?

605
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,770
Hera Palace...

606
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,140
The place where Min Seol Ah fell down and died was Hera Palace.

607
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,660
Hera Palace, not Bosong Village!

608
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,120
 Ju Seok Gyeong left the chat room. / Lee Min Hyeok left the chat room. / Ha Eun Byeol... / Yu Je Ni... / Ju Seok Hun... 

609
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,740
Do you think you can run away by doing this?

610
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,000
 Oppa 

611
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,860
 Seol Ah, long time no— 

612
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,890
 Let go of me, let go! 

613
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,330
 What's going on? 

614
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,060
 Seol Ah! 

615
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,080
 Who are you guys? 

616
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,090
 IYou should just stay still if you want to stay safe. 

617
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,850
 Why are you so brazen when you're the one who did wrong? 
   

618
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,710
 Are you really our age? 

619
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,290
 She took the GED and she lives in Bosong Village? 

620
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,530
 And she's an orphan, too. 

621
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,030
 Oppa... 

622
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,950
 Seol Ah, where are you now?  Are you alright? 

623
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,230
 I'm okay. 

624
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,240
 What do you mean, okay? I heard everything! 

625
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,000
 They are the kids you tutored, right? 

626
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,800
 I won't let them get away with this. 

627
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,970
 How could they do this to you?  Freaking bastards! 

628
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,060
 I'm going to kill them all! 

629
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,790
 That sounds so assuring,  

630
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,060
 as you're taking my side. 

631
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,900
 I'm coming over to Korea right now, okay? 

632
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,520
 So, stay still. 

633
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,190
 This is why I told you not to do that tutoring job. 

634
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,540
 I told you I would send you money.  Why didn't you listen to my advice, 

635
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,950
 and why did you suffer such things? 

636
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,130
 I don't want to receive your help. 

637
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,080
 That's all from your father's money. 

638
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,460
 I'm sorry, Seol Ah. 

639
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,840
 I shouldn't have let you go like that, really. 

640
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,390
 You didn't know it either. 

641
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,920
 Even so, I don't regret it. 

642
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,890
 Because of me, you got healthier so I'm very happy. 

643
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,710
 I'll go to you.  Got it? 

644
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:38,460
 Once I go there, I'm going to tell all of them off. 

645
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,650
 So you stay still, okay?  I'm coming over. 

646
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,870
 Oppa, make sure to reprimand them 

647
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,920
 For sure, okay? 

648
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,170
You wench, you'll see the hell from now on.

649
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,220
Look forward to it.

650
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,770
It's the time.

651
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,610
Push him properly so we can complete the contract today.

652
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,450
Yes, Chairman.

653
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:17,750
 Logan Lee 

654
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,330
 Negotiations are temporarily suspended. 

655
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,990
How on earth did you handle the business so that the guy never shows up at all?

656
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,790
Did you properly send the proposal?

657
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:32,160
I provided every item perfectly, even including the projections after investment.

658
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,900
If you wanted to say a "perfectly" word, Logan Lee should show up in front of us right now.

659
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,330
Team Leader Kang, you look like you're not a useful person to me any more.

660
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,460
Please give me one more chance.

661
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,660
- Please give me one more chance. 
 - I've already given you enough chances.

662
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,570
There are so many more competent people than you.

663
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,260
If the negotiation falls apart, be ready to write a resignation letter.

664
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,580
Seriously!

665
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,500
Who played a prank on it?

666
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,710
My housekeeper did it.

667
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,360
That's why you can't just hire any person. Can you restore it?

668
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,950
Don't worry.  I'll put your face and compose your photo neatly, Madam.

669
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,020
Your children are very handsome.

670
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,990
Is that right?  All took after me...

671
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:29,850
Seok Gyeong is going to be a classical vocalist.  Her voice is really a masterpiece.

672
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:35,320
Seok Hun has even a good brain so he is always a top student at Cheong Ah Art School.

673
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,060
You must be happy that your children excel.

674
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,650
Here is it.  It's done.

675
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,620
Madam.

676
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,390
Now, our family became perfect.

677
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,590
It really looks like a real one.

678
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,760
Who are you?

679
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,120
Y-You...

680
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,860
You look great in the photo.

681
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,600
Housekeeper Yang.  If your boss found out this, how creepy she would feel.

682
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,880
In Penthouse, you take a role of housekeeper and outside you play a role of madam.

683
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,490
Please keep this secret, Teacher.  I beg you like this.

684
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,450
You've done this not just once or twice.

685
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,650
It's been almost 20 years since you started working at that house.

686
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:30,800
Then if so...  Wow, no way...

687
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Do you adore Chairman?

688
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,660
My only sin is that I love him.

689
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,430
I've never covet anything.

690
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,220
The clothes you're wearing are Madam Sim Su Ryeon's, aren't they?

691
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,200
Even so, you said you didn't covet anything?

692
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,690
Oh my.  What should I do?

693
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,070
I'm very close to Chairman.

694
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,890
I can't really let it slide.

695
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,520
What do you want, Teacher?

696
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,950
Everything that you know about Ju Dan Tae and Sim Su Ryeon.

697
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,930
And about the dead Min Seol Ah,

698
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:14,020
no I mean, should I call Teacher Anna?

699
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,320
How did Min Seol Ah die at Hera Palace?

700
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,650
Even it came out at the news that she fell to death at Bosong Village.

701
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:28,220
If she really died at Hera Palace, how was she found at Bosong Village?

702
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,270
Someone must've moved her to Bosong Village.

703
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,220
On the day of the fountain lighting ceremony.

704
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,560
Do you remember November 14th last year?

705
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,830
I heard there was a lighting ceremony at the fountain that evening.

706
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,270
I remember that.

707
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,390
It was the first anniversary of Hera Palace

708
00:54:53,390 --> 00:55:00,260
so there were a lot of guests invited, and it was very fancy and grand.

709
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,070
Can I see any photos from that day?

710
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,900
Yes, yes, of course.

711
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,300
That's the sneaker I bought for her.

712
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,380
Where is this sneaker right now?

713
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,160
What is this? So dirty. You picked up trash from somewhere?

714
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,580
This belonged to Min Seol Ah.

715
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,250
- I found it in the lost and found of our apartment building. 
 - What?

716
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,300
It was stuck at the fountain on the one year anniversary celebration of Hera Palace.

717
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,760
It was in one of the photos I took with my phone.

718
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,590
I remember! The dirty sneakers that Min Seol Ah always wore.

719
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,850
They looked so shabby.

720
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:06,830
So did Min Seol Ah really fall and die at Hera Palace?

721
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,760
Let's report this to the police right now.

722
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,770
This is a homicide.

723
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,040
Maybe the person who keeps sending us text messages knows who the killer was.

724
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,070
So they should find the killer first.

725
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,330
Are you stupid?

726
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:27,060
The person who killed Min Seol Ah was one of our parents.

727
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,940
What... what nonsense are you saying?

728
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,380
That's right. Someone killed Min Seol Ah at Hera Palace.

729
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,160
If not, there wouldn't have been any reason to move her body.

730
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,530
Schubert  composed as many as 1,200 pieces

731
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,920
in every category of instrumental and vocal music.

732
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:16,030
His most creative works among them were his  'lieder' , which were more than 620 songs.

733
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,230
His lieder changed the German music trend which originated from  Singspiel (German-language music drama), 

734
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,110
and expanded the potentialities of the genre.

735
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,440
That is the end of class for today.

736
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,960
 Text from Min Seol Ah 

737
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,730
 Min Seol Ah: I finally found my shoe. 

738
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,980
Who is it? Who is playing this joke?

739
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,000
Come out!

740
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,780
I'm sure this person is near us.

741
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:23,100
 This confirms that Seol Ah was murdered at Hera Palace. 

742
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:30,310
 ...especially anyone with cardiovascular disease should be very careful. 

743
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,820
 Dr. Biogen, the company which was developing the first genetic therapy in Korea to treat respiratory diseases 

744
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,610
 failed the first round of clinical trials. 

745
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,820
 As a result, the company stocks have hit rock bottom. 

746
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,980
 The stock exchange has immediately halted all trades of Dr. Biogen stocks 

747
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,700
 and KOSDAQ plans a public committee meeting 

748
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,720
What is he saying?

749
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,180
Stock delisting?

750
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,150
 ... financial investment firms did... 

751
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,550
 The phone is turned off... 

752
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,370
Answer the phone.

753
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:02,620
 After the beep, you will be connected to voice mail ...  

754
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,960
Why aren't you answering?

755
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,030
Answer the phone you son of a b**ch!

756
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,070
No...

757
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,020
My money! My money!

758
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,920
It was just announced on the news.

759
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,240
Oh Yun Hui must have found out by now.

760
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,970
Did she think she'd be safe after stealing money from me?

761
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:51,470
I wasted too much time lately on this nothing woman.

762
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,020
JAKOMO

763
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,290
I'm an idiot, a fool.

764
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,800
Stop it, nothing changes if you blame yourself.

765
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,890
How much did you invest?

766
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,520
The money I earned from auctions

767
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,020
and even got a loan with my home as collateral and gave them all of it.

768
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:21,380
Unni, my one billion won ($1 million) turned into tissue paper.

769
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,210
Who suggested this investment to you?

770
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:33,180
There's an investment consultant in the Hera Palace community, right?

771
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,390
 Dr. BioGen? You're talking abut the genetic therapy for respiratory disease, right? 

772
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,350
 If it's awaiting FDA approval, then we should hurry. 

773
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,060
 As it's your words, Mr. Assemblyman, it must be a certain information, of course. 

774
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,670
I saw that your husband was being advised over the phone.

775
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:59,170
So I saw that and felt secure, so I invested, too.

776
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,450
   

777
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,620
That man... on purpose...

778
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,710
He did, right?

779
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,950
He planned to deceive me, right?

780
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:19,660
This damned... he deserves to die... I am really going to... !

781
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,120
What will you do? Without evidence, you'll be the one in the wrong.

782
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,660
So you want me to just do nothing?

783
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,840
He planned all this on purpose to make me lose my money.

784
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,410
How can I not be furious?

785
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:36,480
It was the first big money I ever had in my life.

786
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,210
I will help you put out the urgent fires.

787
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,390
So please calm down.

788
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,660
I was so happy to live free of debt.

789
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:57,190
There is a way to get back the money that Ju Dan Tae stole from you.

790
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,310
How?

791
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,710
Want to give it a try?

792
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:06,410
I don't have time, so can you do it for me?

793
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,860
How will we do it? I'll do anything you ask me to, Unni.

794
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,340
I'll do anything you ask me to, Unni. Just tell me.

01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:46,560

 You were paying attention to the ruby ring, right? 

805
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:35,640
 That is huge, how much did that cost? 

806
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,810
I am honored to finally meet you in person.

807
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:04,000

Seo Jin?

817
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,600
Do you have some time? I have something to talk about with you.

Yes. I'll meet you in your lesson room in one hour.

Hello, my name is Oh Yun Hui.

825
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,770
You always defy expectations and surprise me.

826
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,320
It's quite unpleasant.

827
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,220
That is my strength as well as my weakness. You'll get used to it soon.

828
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:08,440
I heard you were looking to hire an experienced member in your investment team, so I am here to apply for the position.

829
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,230
I also really dislike how shameless you are.

830
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:14,490
Your courage is admirable, but this interview ends now.

831
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,900
I don't have any more questions for you. Next.

832
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,170
You will regret this.

833
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,770
How could that be? I don't have time to deal with the likes of you.

834
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,860
So please get lost now.

835
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,350
Come in, please.

At last, we finally meet, Mr. Ju.

837
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:48,280
I may be the Logan Lee that you're looking for.

838
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,290
Logan Lee?

A flower bouquet was just delivered for you.

840

It's from Chairman Ju Dan Tae.

841
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:15,230
From Chairman Ju?

842
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,120
How beautiful.

843
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,850
The image of a woman being loved.

844
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,890
Do I seem that way?

845
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,440
A gift of flowers is always nice to receive.

846
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,900
Have a seat. I'm curious to know what you want to speak to me about.

847
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,600
Go ahead and open that first.

848
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,980
Looks like there's a gift, too.

849
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,450
Shall I?

850
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,910
 Indeed, it was you. 

851
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,760

 This ring is really sharp. 

856
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,730
 Someone knows what we did. 

857
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,750
 Do you think the penthouse will always be yours? 

858
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,350
 The suspects who killed Seol Ah. 

859
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:51,150
 I plan to have a party with our Hera Club family. 

860
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,560
 Tell everyone that you are Min Seol Ah's mom. 

861
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,870
 Keeping things secret and hidden isn't good. 

862
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:58,840
 Just wait and see, it will be an unforgettable party.
