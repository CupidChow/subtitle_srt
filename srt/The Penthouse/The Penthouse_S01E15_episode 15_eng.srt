1
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,790
 Spare me!  Please spare my life! 

2
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,400
 So, you should've behaved in moderation, MIn Seol Ah. 

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,120
 Min Seol Ah. 

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,280
 I have someone to help me.  

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,230
 If something wrong happens to me,  

6
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,640
 my oppa will find you and make you pay for this! 

7
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,900
Then, Gu Ho Dong, that bastard is that wench's brother...?

8
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,300
Did you say there is a brother? Did Min Seol Ah have a brother?

9
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,490
You said she was a orphan.

10
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,220
Don't you think she might have some brother who grew up with her at the orphanage?

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,190
Then, do you mean Cheong Ah Arts School's teacher and Min Seol Ah were from the same orphanage?

12
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,120
Why are you asking me that?

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,250
You should use your legs to look for any information yourself!

14
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,370
I told you to immediately find Min Seol Ah's cell phone first!

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,700
Am I just slacking here?! Hey, Iâ€”

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,760
I will do my best.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,630
I told you I would find it.

18
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,880
Wow, if he is the high school teacher,

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,770
it might be easy to handle it. Don't you agree, Secretary Jo?

20
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,340
Please let this Gyu Jin handle the task.

21
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,760
I'll clean up the mess I created.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Chairman Ju, I'm Lee Gyu Jin. You trust me, don't you?

23
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,660
- Secretary Jo. 
 - Yes, sir.

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,300
Keep a close watch on Gu Ho Dong, that bastard.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,390
Find every detail about him, what he is doing here and what he did in the past.

26
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,450
 No one can tarnish my life.  

27
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,730
 Somehow I've come so far ... 

28
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,530
 My life must be perfect.  

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,770
- Yes? 
 -   Bae Ro Na's mother? 

30
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,540
This is Cheon Seo Jin, the Head of Art Department of CAAS.  (Cheong Ah Arts School) 

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,210
Student Bae Ro Na expressed her intention to drop out of this school.

32
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,350
 Did you know that? 

33
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,870
Although she csn have 2 weeks to reconsider her decision,  if she doesn't need it,

34
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,750
she can leave the school immediately.

35
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,120
What happened to you, huh?  What do you mean, dropping out?

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,470
I don't want to go to school.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,390
What are you talking about?  How hard it was for you to get in there!

38
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,830
Why are you acting like this suddenly? Why, all of a sudden?

39
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,430
Why, all of a sudden?

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm sick of everything.

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,410
I'm sick of everything.  Of both the school and music.

42
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,250
Ro Na, something happened to you, didn't it?

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,510
Tell me, to your mom. Tell me, and I'll take care of all!

44
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,400
I told you there is no reason!  I just hate everything now!

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,870
So, why do you hate everything all of a sudden?

46
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,720
When your mid-term exam is coming soon, what's with this nonsense?

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,140
You said you would bring me the CAAS Trophy.

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,870
You said you would go to Seoul National University, go study abroad and stand on opera stages!

49
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,740
But now, why are you suddenly acting like this?!

50
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,930
I guess I was out of my mind then!

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,330
- What?  
 - Why did we move into Hera Palace?

52
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,610
Why did you let me enter Cheong Ah Arts School?

53
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,060
This is all because of you, Mom!

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,030
Chairman Ju is home, Ma'am.

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,970
You're late.

56
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,960
I think the culprit of the mannequin incident will get caught soon.

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,560
Did you find the culprit?

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,610
Who was it?

59
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,940
Not yet.  Once it's confirmed, I'll tell you.

60
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm going to find that bastard no matter what,

61
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,590
and establish that I had nothing to do with Min Seol Ah.

62
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,430
Relax.

63
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,910
 To Logan Lee] Be careful, 

64
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,220
 my husband is looking for the culprit of the fountain accident. 

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,020
   Thank you.  You should be careful too. 

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,110
Ju Dan Tae, I guess it's getting on your nerves quite a lot.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,450
What did you want to talk about?

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,750
I feel uncomfortable sitting with you at the same table like this.

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,910
I heard from our tax accountant today

70
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,050
that you still haven't processed Hye In's death report.

71
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,510
I know you're having a hard time but clinging on to her like that

72
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,760
isn't going to bring her back to life.

73
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,380
You're now sounding as if you've been looking forward to Hye In's death.

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,150
Your words are a bit harsh.

75
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,780
She's a child that's been bedridden for 16 years.

76
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,980
What's the rush for processing her death?

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,910
Hye In has a lot of rights to land and inheritance under her name and it's complicated.

78
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,080
That land was given to her by my deceased father.

79
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,570
It's not yours or mine.

80
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,850
Hye In is dead. We're her parents.

81
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,090
If we want to, we can sell the land at a good price

82
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,020
and put it toward a good cause.

83
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,820
Who says you can sell that land?

84
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,140
I'm not ready to let Hye In go.

85
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,100
And I'll figure that issue out myself.

86
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,090
 Divorce Declaration (Designation of Custodial Parent) 

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,990
Let's end it.  I'll do what you want.

88
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,650
You made up your mind more quickly than I expected you would.

89
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,570
I guess your creditors are harassing you harshly.

90
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,820
Just keep your promise. You should never let Eun Byeol know about this.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,140
You're the one that should keep your promise.

92
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,560
This should be kept as a secret to my father for a while.

93
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
If this divorce causes any problem for my chairwoman position,

94
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,440
you will have to pay back all the settlement money and alimony.

95
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,240
I've booked an appointment for psychological counselling for Eun Byeol.

96
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,800
She's completely normal, why?

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,150
I'm a doctor!

98
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,950
It's a decision I made for my daughter so you should cooperate.

99
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,750
If you keep refusing, I won't give you the custodial rights.

100
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,950
Fine, if you really want to confirm.

101
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,980
Process the papers early tomorrow morning. There's no reason to delay it when it's benefiting both of us.

102
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,380
If it pays 7 billion won for alimony, it'll be a pretty good award.

103
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,850
Am I supposed to thank you?

104
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,860
Are you sure you won't regret it?

105
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,340
Why would I regret?

106
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,330
Marriage was the first inferiority complex that I've ever experienced since my birth.

107
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,190
For a different experience such as being called a poor vineyard's daughter-in-law,

108
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,030
I paid too harsh a price.

109
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,100
Now I think I finally go back to my real Cheon Seo Jin.

110
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,790
Seo Jin. My daughter can't drop out.

111
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,760
I'll never agree to that, not even in a dream.

112
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,650
Your kid doesn't want to. Who are you to stop her?

113
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,750
There's definitely a reason behind it.

114
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,970
If you give me some time I can convince her.

115
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,410
So just please wait a short while.

116
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,990
You know how much my daughter wanted to sing.

117
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,020
- Are you sure it's not your greed? 
 - What?

118
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,000
The way I see it,

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,050
you're forcing your daughter to do something you couldn't.

120
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,670
You don't care about your tired daughter.

121
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,870
Seeing you, such a pathetic one, who tries to get vicarious satisfaction,

122
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,530
I can understand why Ro Na was having such a hard time.

123
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,140
Stop saying nonsense.

124
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,290
I'm going to convince my daughter.

125
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,400
Dropping out? I won't allow it.

126
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,440
I couldn't get my diploma because of you and your father,

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,940
but I'm going to make sure Ro Na graduates from Cheong Ah School.

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,620
I will. I'll make that happen for sure.

129
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,680
I think a way for her is to take the GED.

130
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,790
She isn't stupid so I'm sure if you look there's a path she can take.

131
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,240
 Letter Of Acceptance 

132
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,700
 If you choose, take responsibility for that. 
 Let's be accepted to Seoul National University School of Music! 

133
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,300
What is all this outsideâ€”

134
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,390
I'm throwing it out.

135
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,590
I don't need music sheets anymore.

136
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,910
Bae Ro Na. What are you wearing when you should be going to school?

137
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,250
And what's with all the makeup?

138
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,550
I told you. I dropped out.

139
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,550
For the mean time, I'm not going to do anything but chill.

140
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,370
Seriously, why are you being like this?

141
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,440
Are you doing this because you want to see me go crazy?

142
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Whatever the reason,

143
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,020
nothing changes.

144
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,150
- I'm not going to school anymore. 
 - Why not?

145
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,700
You said you wanted to go to Cheong Ah Arts School.

146
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,270
How many times have I told you that I don't want to anymore?

147
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,970
I don't want to sing anymore.

148
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm sick and tired of looking at music sheets.

149
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,590
Please, just leave me alone.

150
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,270
I can't give up on you.

151
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,960
Follow me.

152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,440
- Come here! 
 - Let go!

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,900
If you don't want to see me go insane, follow me!

154
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,520
- I told you to let go of me! 
 - Hurry!

155
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,730
Cheon Seo Jin! Cheon Seo Jin, where are you?

156
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,550
Bae Ro Na's mother, what are you doing here?

157
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,900
You get out of the way. Cheon Seo Jin!

158
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,700
At the sacred school, why are you running wild right now?

159
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,780
Get out immediately before I call the police.

160
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,450
Please have some manners, Bae Ro Na's mother.

161
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,000
This is a teacher's office. Other students are watching.

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,910
Cancel my daughter's drop out application.

163
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,200
I've never given permission.

164
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,790
Bae Ro Na. Do you also feel this way?

165
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,710
No. I already made up my mind. I'm going to drop out.

166
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,980
No, Ro Na!

167
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,400
Say it's not true. Tell them you're going to go back to school!

168
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,530
I've already done everything I could.

169
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,790
It's too hard for me to do any more.  I've lost all the strength to hang in there.

170
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,740
I already messed up the singing test, and I can't go to the School of Music at Seoul National University anyway.

171
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,560
You just heard her, didn't you?  We respect our students' intentions.

172
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Moreover, Ro Na admitted, for herself, that she's not a suitable student for CAAS.

173
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,710
I guess she realized her own value.

174
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,490
No, you guys are unsuitable as teachers.

175
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,330
When a student is struggling, why do you not think about guiding her towar the right direction,

176
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,290
but push her to the edge of cliff?  Why?

177
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,060
Do you know how hard my Ro Na worked to get in CAAS?

178
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,050
I know my daughter the most.

179
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,350
She's definitely not a person to easily give up.

180
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,030
Whether it's bullying or school violence,

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,350
or teachers' harassment, shouldn't we investigate it further?

182
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,740
Who are you trying to blame now?

183
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,700
That obsession and inferiority complex of yours,

184
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
don't you think those things are pushing your daughter into death, Ro Na's mother?

185
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,800
At the end, you're the one who ruined your child.

186
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,110
Ro Na is that proof.

187
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,600
Ro Na!

188
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Ro Na, where are you going?

189
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,530
Ro Na!

190
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,820
Ro Na!  Ro Na, where are you going?

191
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,380
What are you doing?  Let go!

192
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,160
Is it true that you submitted your letter to dropout?  Why, all of a sudden?

193
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,920
It's boring with this lousy school.

194
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,590
You guys won.

195
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,370
Don't leave.

196
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,350
You did nothing wrong. Why do you have to give up?

197
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,660
Min Seol Ah also did nothing wrong.

198
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,610
But she's dead.

199
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Do you see now what you've done?

200
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,200
Let go of me.

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,290
Even if you see me at Hera Palace, don't act like you know me.

202
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,160
Don't even say my name. It's disgusting.

203
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,980
 Seoul Family Court 

204
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,020
I wired the 7 billion won into your account. Confirm it.

205
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,560
Your calculations are always accurate.

206
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,160
Should we at least shake hands and part ways?

207
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,760
Shaking hands? My butt.

208
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,740
We're going to see each other at home for the time being anyway.

209
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,480
Let's live freely as each of us pleases from now on.

210
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,570
That's the first time we both agree on something.

211
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,130
I'll move out of the house after Eun Byeol gets better.

212
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,650
I'm looking for hospitals near my hometown.

213
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,190
I would appreciate it if you would wrap things up quickly.

214
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,500
I have class so I'll be on my way.

215
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,660
He doesn't need this anymore.

216
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,040
Wow, Doctor Ha.

217
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,900
Now that you've signed your divorce papers, your face looks better.

218
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,870
Has word gotten around already?

219
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm here to get a few documents notarized.

220
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,780
Seo Jin is kind of a perfectionist.

221
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,300
Giving up the ownership of the house and the custodial rights for Eun Byeol.

222
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,000
Resigning from Cheong Ah Medical and no more requesting additional money.

223
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,000
Wow, sorry.

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
I prepared the documents.

225
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,530
So you just stamp your seal at a few places.

226
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,960
Whatever you want.

227
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,850
What a shame.

228
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,890
You should come out more messy

229
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,650
and play dirty so that I can make more of a living.

230
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,850
Don't you think you settled too easily?

231
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,170
Don't you know how much Cheong Ah Arts School is worth?

232
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,960
But then again because of the Myeong-dong project

233
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,390
you needed the money.

234
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,240
Watch your mouth. My daughter doesn't know.

235
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,990
If you open your mouth in a wrong way, I'll make sure you can't work as a lawyer anymore.

236
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,430
I'm so scared. The man with no house or rights

237
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,010
has a strong mouth.

238
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,800
Doctor Ha.  You're broke now.

239
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,150
A beggar.

240
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,050
I'm envious of your freedom a bit,

241
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,830
but I don't like the freedom with no money.

242
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,110
Oh my.

243
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,680
Worry about yourself, Lawyer Lee.

244
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,860
Your father's law firm building is about to fall into someone else's hands because the Myeong-dong project is stuck.

245
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,580
It's not that we have only one building.

246
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,590
Look,  my family's completely different from yours in sizeâ€”  Never mind.

247
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,170
Now what are you going to do with Oh Yun Hui?

248
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,390
You guys are both single now so there's nothing to be afraid of.

249
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,470
No way. Bae Ro Na's step dad!

250
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,740
That's right!

251
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,440
That's why Bae Ro Na dropped out!

252
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,650
To leave with her new step dad.

253
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,890
Dropped out?

254
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,180
 Cheong Ah Arts School &amp; Foundation For The Arts 

255
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,330
The Chairman is urgently looking for you.

256
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,560
- Father, did you call for me? 
 -You're here.

257
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,330
I see you're here too, Mother.

258
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,590
I'm here too, Seo Jin.

259
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,480
Oh, you're here.

260
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,990
What are we meeting for?

261
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,910
Today, I made a very important decision.

262
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,770
Since your father has been suffering from a cold for a long time,

263
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,590
he must've gotten weak, mentally.

264
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,410
He's decided to he's going to step down from

265
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,970
the Cheong Ah Foundation Chairman position.

266
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,450
Is that true, Father?

267
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,010
Yes.

268
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,250
You waited a long time. Now you should take over Cheong Ah Foundation.

269
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,070
Father.

270
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,860
What about me? Why can't it be me?

271
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,090
You have a reliable husband's family.

272
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,770
Seo Jin made a big commitment to take Cheong Ah School as far as it is now.

273
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,550
Rather than gaining fame as a vocalist,

274
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,060
her coming back to Korea to take care of school was praiseworthy.

275
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,510
Before coming here, I already finished all paper work with Attorney Park.

276
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,190
Father.

277
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,980
Thank you so so much.

278
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,220
I'll do my best.

279
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,790
I won't disappoint you.

280
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,500
Developing Cheong Ah Foundation in the future,

281
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,320
I'll make it the best and the most respectable private school foundation in our country.

282
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,630
Of course you should.

283
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,500
I've devoted my whole life to Cheong Ah Medical Center and Cheong Ah Foundation

284
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,180
I can't forgive any wrongdoing.

285
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,340
Behave well in order to not be a subject of people's gossip.

286
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,410
Yes.

287
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,750
I'll keep that in mind, Father.

288
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,770
Congratulations.

289
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,690
I hated that you married Doctor Ha over our objection,

290
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,500
but still, I'm proud of you that you've maintained your family well.

291
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,060
As you know, keeping your family sound is the most important to your father.

292
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,530
Seo Jin, are you doing okay with your husband these days?

293
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,070
I heard he often slept at the hospital.

294
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,870
Weren't you two not getting along well?

295
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,870
He hasn't been home for a few days because there's been an increase in surgeries.

296
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,500
Thanks for worrying about us. But

297
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,090
we're doing just fine.

298
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,490
Really...

299
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,350
I will work hard, Father.

300
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,200
â™«  FÃ¼hlt nicht durch dich, Sarastro Todesschmerzen  â™«

301
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,500
â™«  Sarastro Todesschmerzen  â™«

302
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,400
â™«  So bist du meine Tochter nimmer mehr  â™«

303
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:41,570
â™«  So bist du meine Tochter nimmer mehr  â™«

304
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,400
It looks like something good happened to you.

305
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:53,290
The best thing in my life happened to me today.

306
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,010
What could that be?

307
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,030
I finally divorced Ha Yun Cheol.

308
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,640
We submitted the documents to the court.

309
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,900
That's great. Congrats.

310
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,260
That's not all. There's something more shocking.

311
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,700
Father decided to leave Cheong Ah Foundation in my hands.

312
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,390
I'll finally become the next Chairperson.

313
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,880
Is that true?

314
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,330
You've been anxious about it.  But it's completely a good news.

315
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,610
I still can't believe it.

316
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,730
Seo Yeong has come up as a competitor with her husband's wealth on her back.

317
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,010
I was nervous that my father might've changed his mind.

318
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Now everything is settled.

319
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,590
On top of that, Bae Ro Na has been on my nerves but is finally leaving.

320
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,150
How can so many good things be happening to me all at once?

321
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,460
- Bae Ro Na is leaving school? 
 - She wants to drop out.

322
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,030
Oh Yun Hui intruded into school in the morning and caused a commotion.

323
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,630
What can she do? Her kid insists on leaving.

324
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,840
Is that why Oh Yun Hui was so out of it all day?

325
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
She's probably not in her right mind.

326
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,310
How long are you going to keep her at your company? I don't like it, why haven't you gotten rid of her yet?

327
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,180
If Oh Yun Hui disappears from my life,

328
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,980
then everything will be perfect.

329
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,290
Don't worry. Once Logan Lee signs the contract, I do not intend to keep her with me

330
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,400
When it's a great day, we can't have our mood ruined by such a woman.

331
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,820
Here. Congratulations, Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.

332
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,580
Thank you.

333
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,510
You're the first person I told.

334
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,310
I love you.

335
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,310
Hey. Follow him closely.

336
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,030
Why is he going in here?

337
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,390
-  Yes? 
 - Chairman Ju, I'm tailing Gu Ho Dong.

338
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,580
This guy parked his bike in front of the hotel where Logan Lee is staying.

339
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,650
Why is he there?

340
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,460
That's what I'm saying.  Why here, of all places?

341
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,200
Is it because he is going to see Logan Lee?

342
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,470
I mean, if he checked us  out, of course he would know Logan Lee is our VIP.

343
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,670
What if he wants to disclose anything about us so he is going to meet himâ€” 
 - No way.

344
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,990
What do I do? Gu Ho Dong is talking to Logan Lee's secretary right now.

345
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,420
I'm right!

346
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,920
Bring that bastard here instantly!  Never let him meet Logan Lee.  Stop him no matter what.

347
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,160
What?  Something happened? Something was gotten into the trouble?

348
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,280
Sorry.  I need to go now.  I'll call you later.

349
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,420
Just leaving?

350
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,330
- Are you okay?  We're sorry. 
 - I'm fine.

351
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,980
- Are you hurt? 
 - No, it's really fine.

352
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,780
I told you I'm fineâ€”

353
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,860
Hey, lay him down.

354
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,840
Put this over him.

355
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,470
Let's go.

356
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,890
Doesn't this look better?

357
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,260
Teacher Cheon's living room will be upgraded.

358
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,050
Teacher Cheon's sense of style is very good.

359
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,650
The color needs to be unique, but not bland...

360
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,630
This one! What do you think about this one? If we're going to get her a gift, let's make it expensive.

361
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,440
Je Ni's mom, you're a cheapskate sometimes.

362
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,460
Is money important right now when Je Ni placed third?

363
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,220
What are you talking about?

364
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm ready to buy this whole store, I not worried about saving money right now.

365
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,730
I want to give her half of all my money.

366
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,620
My father made a promise.

367
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,470
If Min Hyeok gets into Seoul University, he said he would give us the building in Songpa.

368
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,720
Really? That old man is usually a miser.

369
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,770
Are you going to get a load of money when Min Hyeok gets into that school?

370
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,200
We shouldn't do this.

371
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,400
Should we bring the price of the present up more?

372
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,350
You're here?

373
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,630
You should've contacted me before. I stepped out for a minute.

374
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,630
We just got here too. We're thinking about changing sofas for a change of mood.

375
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,350
- Our house. 
 - Me too.

376
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,390
Is that so? Take your time looking around.

377
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,240
But, how is that household doing right now? It's a mess right?

378
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,390
- Pardon? 
 - Ro Na's home. I heard she dropped out of school.

379
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,110
Why did she do that?

380
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,370
It seems like she was attending school well, but why did she suddenly drop out?

381
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,630
Tell us. I'm sure you know because you two are close.

382
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,660
By any chance, did Teacher Cheon make it happen? For Eun Byeol?

383
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,640
After the practical exams, I realized that Teacher Cheon's words can change the colleges they go to.

384
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,750
Min Hyeok used to be last place all the time, but he placed fourth, so enough said.

385
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,130
Teacher Cheon's power reaches the heavensâ€”

386
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,090
What are you talking about right now?

387
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,780
Ro Na won't drop out.

388
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,680
What? So was it a show?

389
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,840
Seo Jin has nothing to fear, so why was she wary of Ro Na?

390
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,520
It means Ro Na's skill is that great.

391
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,420
So she should go to Seoul National University School of Music.

392
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,050
- Team Leader Lee. 
 - Yes.

393
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,550
Recommend them to a gray tone.

394
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,860
I will.

395
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,450
That looks better in Seo Jin's house.

396
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,460
Chairman Ju, your posture is very nice.

397
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,780
You must've learned shooting somewhere.

398
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,990
Are you awake now, Teacher Gu Ho Dong.

399
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,210
What's going on? This is a kidnapping.

400
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,970
I told him to bring you here carefully.

401
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,360
I guess Lawyer Lee went overboard. I apologize in his place.

402
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,650
That's fine. But explain to me why I'm here.

403
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,540
I saw your records coincidentally.

404
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,820
I picked it up on the street.

405
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,800
I saw you won a national competition award for shooting.

406
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,060
Then we should see your skill, right?

407
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,690
Shoot it.

408
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,970
It just happens to be that I recently took up the hobby of shooting.

409
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,940
What do you say? Can you show us?

410
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,750
Did you run a background check on me?

411
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,230
But what can we do?

412
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,610
It's been a  while since I shot. By mistake, I could shoot incorrectly,

413
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:02,530
and plant a bullet in your head.

414
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,040
Not Min Seol Ah?

415
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,920
You know Min Seol Ah, don't you?

416
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,190
Are you filming a horror movie right now?

417
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,510
Why did you put a person's face on there? It's scary.

418
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,440
I'm not playing around, so tell me. What kind of person are you, what's your identity?

419
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,260
Hey. You're the one who pickpocketed my bag, aren't you?

420
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,880
I almost died at Chairman Ju's hands because you took that phone.

421
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,370
I have no idea what you are talking aboutâ€”

422
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,060
Are you playing right now?

423
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:54,270
Give me the phone. Give me Min Seol Ah's phone that you stole from my bag.

424
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,580
So who is this Min Seol Ahâ€”

425
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:03,530
Min Seol Ah? Min Seolâ€” Are you talking the genius girl who was admitted first into Cheong Ah Arts school?

426
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,280
Why are you looking for her phone here?

427
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,850
What kind of relationship do you have with Min Seol Ah?

428
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,260
Did you grow up together at the Hope Orphanage?

429
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,820
You stole an identity to come into CAAS, didn't you?

430
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,710
And the fountain incident was your work. Explain right now!

431
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,220
Oh!

432
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,750
Oh my.

433
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,940
It seems like you have a deep misunderstanding about me.

434
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,860
I don't know if this will be an answer for you.

435
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,100
Why thatâ€”

436
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,750
Wow, that's art.

437
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,630
He shot all around the face.

438
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,450
Something is familiar about him.

439
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,910
Where is his house?

440
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,780
â™ª Lalalala  lalaâ™ª

441
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,050
What is this smell?

442
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,920
It's nice. You don't know the smell of cheongguk stew?

443
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,650
Here Eun Byeol, have a wrap.

444
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,970
Here you go.

445
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,110
I told you not to let smelly foods in the house for the kid.

446
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,390
You're letting a vocal musician eat this kind of food?

447
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,950
It's all spicy and salty. And it's covered in red pepper flakes.

448
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,250
Stop overreacting. Your throat is fine even after some cheongguk stew and kimchi.

449
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,950
Eun Byeol, eat more. This is a real nutritious meal.

450
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,850
Your grandma in Yeongwol sent this especially for you.

451
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:11,440
Eun Byeol, this smell will permeate your clothes so go to your room. I'll make you a salad.

452
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,650
What are you doing right now? How can she sing when she eats salads everyday?

453
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,810
Eun Byeol, are not not listening?! Go to your room.

454
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,760
Ok.

455
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,900
What are you doing right now? Do you have to make it so obvious?

456
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,820
What's wrong with making it obvious? I'm a countryside boy, showing off his roots.

457
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,040
I was always wary of you, so I ate cereal and bread, even though I hated it.

458
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,060
I couldn't eat one bowl of stew or one piece of kimchi on my own.

459
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:53,580
Red pepper flakes are bad for your throat, no salt seasoning, no coffee or soda, I put up with all that!

460
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,970
But now we're strangers. So can't I do what I want now?

461
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,230
Since we're strangers, we should not cross any lines.

462
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,500
It smells. You can't eat that kind of food in my house.

463
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,580
If you want to eat it, take your stuff and go back home to the countryside.

464
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,650
I'm taking Eun Byeol to Yeongwol during the weekend anyway.

465
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,190
My mother says she misses Eun Byeol.

466
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:22,850
Hey, now that I think about it, it's over 7 years since I visited home.

467
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,010
Where are you taking Eun Byeol? She's a sensitive child!

468
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,600
The restrooms there are uncomfortable and smelly. Don't ruin her condition.

469
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm not your husband anymore. Don't tell me what to do.

470
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,350
I worked like a slave as the Cheon family's son-in-law for 17 years.

471
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,680
That mere 7 billion won doesn't seem excessive as my alimony.

472
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,150
Even if I rolled in some dirt, I'm Korea's best doctor son-in-law. Don't you agree?

473
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,010
You're subtly quick at calculating.

474
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,170
Eun Byeol has a counseling session today, my junior set aside time for her.

475
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,170
We're going to be late.

476
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,720
Where are you taking her at the time for her tutor to come? The midterms are next week!

477
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,940
Fine. I just need to endure this until the chairperson inauguration.

478
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,370
There's no need to aggravate him before a big event.

479
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,110
Eun Byeol, she's just checking your school stress so don't be scared.

480
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,860
Just tell her the feelings you feel right now honestly.

481
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,140
Don't worry. I have a lot of friends who are getting counseling too.

482
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,320
Good luck, my daughter.

483
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,100
  Counseling Center 
 Psychiatrist Lee Yun Gyeong 

484
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,680
My daughter  is very sensitive. I'm curious to see if other kids are like that too.

485
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,870
It's hard to study and sing at the same time, isn't it?

486
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,900
I like singing very much.

487
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,290
Rather than the pressure of having to go to Seoul National University School of Music,

488
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,660
I tend to study harder because I like singing.

489
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm proud of you. By any chance, when you have an upcoming test, does the pressure of doing well

490
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,320
cause insomnia, or loss of appetite, or nightmares?

491
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,390
Is there anything like a jinx?

492
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,440
That can occur when you worry about making mistakes.

493
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,590
I'm not sure. My personality is very calm.

494
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,310
I sleep and eat well. There's nothing else I have a hard time with.

495
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,600
Oh, there's a saying I like. "When it's dark, turn on the light".

496
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,140
I try not to fall into negative thoughts.

497
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,890
 Memorandum   

498
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,100
  1. All the threats related to Min Seol Ah were done by me. 

499
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,760
 2. I won't tell anyone about what happened last night at the community center. 

500
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,740
 3.  I will do everything Ha Eun Byeol tells me to do.] 
2020.4.10 - Bae Ro Na

501
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,920
  That's why Bae Ro Na dropped out of school! 

502
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,050
How are you with your friends? Is there anyone you don't like?

503
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:21,750
There's nothing like that. Everyone has their pros and cons.

504
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,870
I'm not the type to hate or be jealous of someone.

505
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,850
If my friend does something I don't like, I can just tolerate it.

506
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,070
I don't get stressed easily either.

507
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,530
Dad, I'm done. She said for you to go in for a short time.

508
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,720
What are you doing? Hurry up and go in.

509
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,550
I didn't eat dinner properly so I'm hungry.

510
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,440
I wanted to eat ali oli, Dad.

511
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:00,630
 She seems like a bright, positive, and selfless person. 

512
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,580
 - But, that's all fake. 
 - What do you mean it's all fake? 

513
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,310
 Imposter syndrome. Because of the high expectations around her, 

514
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:14,000
 it can be caused by the fear of failure. 

515
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,370
  It's a shield for the shock to come in case of failure. 

516
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,310
Dad why aren't you eating? We have to eat quickly so I can go back home and study.

517
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,550
I placed first in the practical exams, so I should be first for the written exam.

518
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,870
I'm going to make mom and grandfather happy.

519
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,430
My Eun Byeol, are you sure you did the counseling session properly?

520
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,040
- Of course. 
 - You said everything truthfully?

521
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,380
I did. Dad you're too much.

522
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,960
Dad, are you upset that I'm normal? Are you wishing me to be sick or what?

523
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,320
You. What is this?

524
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,680
Dad, are you crazy? Why did you go through my clothes?

525
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,460
Explain what this is, Eun Byeol. Why do you have a Ro Na's memorandum?

526
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,930
Did you tell her to write this? What's with Min Seol Ah, and what happened in the community center?

527
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,800
I did nothing wrong. She scared us first by impersonating Min Seol Ah.

528
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,890
So you made her write this? Don't say.  Did you threaten her with this?

529
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,340
Is that why she dropped out?

530
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,300
Yes. I did it.

531
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,270
I threatened her to quit school.

532
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,870
If she didn't, I told her I would spread a rumor about her mom flirting with my dad.

533
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,580
What?

534
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:51,560
Why? I can't? I don't like her. She drives me crazy!

535
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,770
I hate that you and mom fight because of her, and I hate that you guys might get a divorce.

536
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,280
And I hate that you're taking her side, it drives me crazy!

537
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,210
So I want to kill her.

538
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,590
I want to make her disappear from my eyes.

539
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,590
Eun Byeol.

540
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,190
If her dropping out worries you so much, take her and go live with her.

541
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,400
Abandon me and Mom, and go live as Bae Ro Na's dad!

542
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,710
Hey, Eun Byeol. Ha Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol!

543
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,730
Ro Na, are you now getting home? It's late.

544
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,320
Your mom is working late tonight, so I came to make you dinner.

545
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,820
Thank you.

546
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,610
Ro Na.

547
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,970
I heard about you dropping out. But,

548
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,430
why does it feel like that's not how you really want?

549
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,670
Am I asking too much? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

550
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,640
Make sure you eat dinner. Your mom will worry if you don't eat.

551
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,070
I'm going to go.

552
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,990
Ahjumma.

553
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,450
My mom...

554
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,090
Is a adulterer.

555
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,380
What?

556
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,200
I don't who said this to you, but you're misunderstanding.

557
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,450
Ro Na, you trust your mom, right?

558
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,500
I don't know. I really don't know.

559
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,450
I believe your mom. She loves you so much.

560
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,970
She'll do anything in the world for you.

561
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,410
And she's a lot stronger and honest than you think.

562
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,310
- She would never do what you're thinking about. 
 - No.

563
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,220
The day I slept over at your house,

564
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,100
my mom was with Ha Eun Byeol's dad.

565
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,070
I saw Ha Eun Byeol's dad coming out of our house.

566
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,740
- Ro Na, that isâ€” 
 - Why is she seeing someone's husband.  Why, of all people, Eun Byeol's dad?

567
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,650
Is she seeing Eun Byeol's dad to get revenge because she hates Teacher Cheon?

568
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,750
It's pathetic and embarrassing. I don't know about other people, but Mom shouldn't do that.

569
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,920
She said she lived through hell because of Dad's cheating, so why would she do the same thing?

570
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,620
Ro Na, don't cry. It's not what you think.

571
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,890
Ro Na, you're misunderstanding.

572
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,310
So, what about this? 
   Memorandum 

573
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,110
You don't think anything of this? When our daughter did such a thing?

574
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,510
It's a prank during puberty.

575
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,440
You brought Eun Byeol's mood down over this? Next week is her first exam.

576
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,770
Is that midterm so important right now? This is a serious crime!

577
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,290
I heard everything from Eun Byeol.

578
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,670
Bae Ro Na impersonated Min Seol Ah and bullied the kids from Hera Palace.

579
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,160
And she already confessed to all of it.

580
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,540
So, this isn't her fault?

581
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,950
Are you really a teacher?

582
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,350
As long as you close your mouth, this can end quietly.

583
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,460
This is how everything returns to its place.

584
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:09,110
Bae Ro Na and Oh Yun Hui.

585
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,100
Now we can live without seeing them again.

586
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,240
- That's the end of it. 
 - The important thing is!

587
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,150
Eun Byeol is misunderstanding my relationship with Yun Hui.

588
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,430
- So that's why she made No Ra drop outâ€” 
 - Then,

589
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:31,640
why did you create that issue in the first place? You did wrong.

590
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,180
Cheon Seo Jin. Do you have any right to say that?

591
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,490
This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't spewed that nonsense to Eun Byeol!

592
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,360
Then you can go tell Eun Byeol.

593
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,870
Your mom  had an affair too. Her partner is Ju Seok Gyeong's dad.

594
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,980
Shut up you dirtyâ€”

595
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,550
We are divorced.

596
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,030
Now whomever I meet  or like

597
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,720
is not a reason to get struck by you.

598
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,140
Get out of my room. Right now!

599
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,980
I forgot about this.

600
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,740
This ring belongs to you, right?

601
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,650
You threw it in the trash.

602
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,960
I must have dropped it by mistake.

603
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,010
But you threw out this ruby ring before.

604
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,100
On the night Min Seol Ah died.

605
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,100
- What? 
 - I saw you throwing it is in the trash.

606
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:14,550
But why did this ruby ring come back to you?

607
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,660
I don't know what you're trying to say.

608
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,340
You must be mistaken. Why did I throw away a ring? I've never done that.

609
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,850
You have something to do with Min Seol Ah's death, don't you?

610
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,690
What does that mean?

611
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,030
It's not that I was staying quiet  because I didn't know.

612
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,930
I couldn't say anything because you were my wife.

613
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,960
But there's no reason to do that any more.

614
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,780
A reason to protect you.

615
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,250
Attorney Lee said

616
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:58,110
that you and Ju Dan Tae are the prime suspects of Min Seol Ah's death.

617
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,210
That you were being threatened by Min Seol Ah

618
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,850
Adulterers Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin!

619
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,600
What are you trying to do?

620
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,950
You didn't know that I'm a jerk?

621
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,390
To be a son-in-law of a rich family,

622
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,280
I was such a rogue who abandoned a woman whom he had dated for 6 years.

623
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,490
I was trash who ditched a poor woman who had paid my medical school tuition!

624
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,410
But I plan on becoming a real son of a bitch this time.

625
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,760
So you're going to have to be careful.

626
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,340
This cowardly jerk

627
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,830
What in the world did he see?

628
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,650
Yun Hui

629
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,230
I have something to say.

630
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,760
Another time, I'm tired.

631
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,760
Eun Byeol misunderstood the relationship between you and me.

632
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,380
What does that mean?

633
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,910
It seems Eun Byeol threatened Ro Na because of that.

634
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,820
I'm sorry.

635
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,310
Say it so that I understand. What misunderstanding?

636
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,680
What did your daughter do to my Ro Na?

637
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,240
Ro Na. Ro Na!

638
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,260
Ro Na just fell asleep.

639
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,170
I waited for you because I have to talk to you.

640
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,010
She said that she saw Doctor Ha leave your house that morning.

641
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,130
She saw Doctor Ha's pictures and text messages on your phone.

642
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,350
I'm crazy.

643
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,400
I'm crazy. Why didn't I erase that photo?

644
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,010
I'm a crazy wench.

645
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,800
I don't deserve to be a mom.

646
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,040
I deserve getting punished.

647
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,920
It's a situation that can be misunderstood.

648
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,030
Even if it isn't true, it'll be difficult to convince her.

649
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:40,140
But why did Cheon Seo Jin tell her daughter something like that?

650
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:45,040
What would be helpful to her daughter as Seo Jin drove her dad into a womanizer?

651
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,140
Probably to cover up her own wrong doings.

652
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,760
Or...

653
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,630
Or?

654
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,110
To make Eun Byeol hate Ro Na.

655
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,290
But why?

656
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:03,760
By doing so, Eun Byeol would win against No Ra out of her competitiveness.

657
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,370
She's someone who cut your throat with a trophy because she was jealous of you.

658
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,710
She can do so much more than that.

659
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,890
You're right.

660
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:21,570
But I didn't even know that and said mean things to Ro Na and yelled at her.

661
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:26,110
I feel so bad, what should I do?

662
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:32,760
My heart feels like it'll tear to pieces thinking about how my  Ro Na suffered through this hardship alone.

663
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,280
Calm down.

664
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,200
I'm sorry too.

665
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,530
Unni. I can't just sit back and do nothing anymore.

666
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:52,400
Cheon Seo Jin, that wench needs to go through the same thing, to know how it feels.

667
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,550
You can just come to the school to sign the dropout application.

668
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,840
Why did you want to see me here?

669
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,600
There are too many watchful eyes at school.

670
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,810
Since everything's ending, I wanted to have a meal with you while we're at it.

671
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,030
Do we have a relationship where we can sit facing each other and share a meal?

672
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,760
This is the dropout application Ro Na wrote so read it over. All it needs is a parent's signature.

673
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,270
Let's do it slowly and talk things over.

674
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:44,430
There is so much that I felt while going through this.

675
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:49,350
I think you've realized how much a parent could ruin

676
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,340
her child because of her greed.

677
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,940
Dreaming of Cheong Ah Arts High in the first place was the beginning of your misfortune.

678
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,150
Aren't you talking about yourself?

679
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,250
What?

680
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:10,800
Wasn't it a true misfortune that you made your underqualified daughter admitted to Cheong Ah Arts?

681
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,200
You were very self-conscious of your father so you wanted to make her the best by admitting her no matter how.

682
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,020
So you bribed the admission judges,

683
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,630
manipulated the practical test scores, and incited a car accident to someone else's daughter.

684
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,330
Are you insane? What are you saying?

685
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,020
While we're at it, let's just be honest with each other, Seo Jin.

686
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,620
Like a fool, I just recited the things you done to me all of this time.

687
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:45,300
It made me realize once again how powerful you really are.

688
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:52,160
But even so, I didn't expect you'd go as far as to tell your daughter that.

689
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,730
That Ha Yun Cheol and I were each other's first love.

690
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:00,610
That Ha Yun Cheol is having feelings  for me again.

691
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:04,320
What about it? It's true that you two met up secretly.

692
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,880
I see you really don't have any feelings left for your husband.

693
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,390
Considering the fact you're admitting yourself that your husband still hasn't forgotten about me.

694
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,860
But then again, you do have a man you're having an affair with.

695
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,500
Chairman Ju Dan Tae.

696
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,420
Even to me, he seems charismatic.

697
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,690
Why is his name coming out of your mouth?

698
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,720
Are you acting like you two are close just because you work at the same company?

699
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,180
Is he someone I can't talk about?

700
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,350
He's not yours.

701
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,890
How shocking.

702
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,760
You ... no way.  Do you actually love him?

703
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,790
As an adulteress, you're too daring.

704
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,430
Is there any reason I should  not be proud?

705
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,480
Ju Dan Tae is my man.

706
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,900
I already divorced Ha Yun Cheol.

707
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,800
Divorce?

708
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,950
You guys already split?

709
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:12,890
Then Eun Byeol should get ready to meet her new step dad.

710
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:17,430
If the people at Hera Palace find out, they'll be shocked to the core.

711
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,840
What are you trying to pull?

712
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,100
Everyone already knows about my relationship with Ju Dan Tae!

713
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:29,550
Everyone knows but there's still one person who doesn't.

714
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:36,320
I thought that person should really know so I brought him here.

715
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,980
What?

716
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,670
Father.

717
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,570
Do you see?

718
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:10,170
Your well-off daughter has been living like this the whole time.

719
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,620
You've raised her truly well.

720
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,800
A divorcee who had an affair. Congratulations.

721
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,620
F-F-Father.

722
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,770
That's not it.

723
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,100
I'll explain everything, Father.

724
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,390
Twenty-five years ago,

725
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,730
Because you covered up your daughter's wrong doings,

726
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,780
your daughter turned out like this.

727
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:52,070
You knew all along, didn't you?

728
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,120
The person who cut my throat with the trophy

729
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,690
was Cheon Seo Jin.

730
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,450
Even so, you suspended me from school.

731
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:10,400
Thanks to you, I couldn't receive my diploma.

732
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,740
Why did you do that?

733
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,900
Was it because your daughter asked you to?

734
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:23,940
Or was it because you thought getting rid of me was going to benefit your daughter?

735
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,770
Oh Yun Hui, you haven't changed at all.

736
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,700
Your actions are still lowly and rude.

737
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,010
What does that mean?

738
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:44,670
It seems like you think coming at me like this will put a scratch on my daughter,

739
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,000
but don't kid yourself.

740
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,480
We're not a family that you can pushover and drag down. Got it?

741
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,900
Let's go.

742
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,180
What a waste of my time.

743
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,830
Yes, Father.

744
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,470
Are you shocked?

745
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:15,220
Then and now, my dad is still on my side. There's nothing you can do.

746
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,360
You probably wouldn't know what a father's protection is like since you don't have one.

747
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,610
Father. Father.

748
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,610
I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

749
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,500
That's enough.  I guess your destiny with Son-in-law Ha is up to there.

750
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,200
Was the divorce finalized well?

751
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,560
Yes, you don't need to worry.

752
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,750
We agreed I would raise Eun Byeol.

753
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,190
And I took care of the division of assets cleanly so there will be no future problem.

754
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,130
Then that's fine.

755
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,810
Oh Yun Hui. No matter how hard you try to bring me down,

756
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,430
you can never win against me.

757
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:56,850
Yes, Lawyer Park. I was just about to call you.

758
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,370
I have something to discuss about the chairperson succession procedure.

759
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,560
The Chairman just called me.

760
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,800
He said he would change the next chairperson.

761
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,600
W-What do you mean?

762
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,270
He's decided to give the Chairperson position to your younger sister.

763
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:14,640
 He also told me he wanted to revise the will. 

764
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,020
There's no way.

765
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,950
 Appointment of Chairperson 
 Name: Cheon Seo Yeong 

766
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,890
Father.

767
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,960
Is it because of what happened before?

768
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,310
You said it was okay, but whyâ€”

769
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,350
You dare spit in my face?

770
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,870
As if getting a divorce wasn't enough, you have an affair?

771
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:02,170
How dare you desire Cheong Ah Foundation when you've disgraced our family?

772
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,690
Do you think I'll forgive you?

773
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:11,130
I was wrong Father. Please forgive me this once.

774
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:15,400
While getting to this position, I've never once gone against your words.

775
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,330
I got into Seoul National University School of Music just as you wanted

776
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:22,460
and slept for three hours everyday trying to be the best.

777
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,250
I've never been defeated by Seo Yeong in studying or something else.

778
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,260
You've disappointed me.

779
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,930
If you went through with a marriage I opposed, you shouldn't have failed.

780
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,980
I didn't fail because I wanted to!

781
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,330
Nothing is compatible between us! What do you want me to do?

782
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,550
All my life, I never received love from him.

783
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,960
But still, I tried my best.

784
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,520
Because of you, I held it in for 17 years.

785
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,730
Who are you trying to blame when you made that decision!

786
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,230
From now on,

787
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,180
you're removed from a director position at Cheong Ah Foundation.  And quit Cheong Ah Arts School too.

788
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,010
I'll take back all your inheritance that I'm planning.

789
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:10,940
Father. Father please don't abandon me!

790
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,230
Cheong Ah Foundation is everything to me!

791
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,890
Without Cheong Ah, I don't have a life!

792
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,390
You've always told me ever since I was little,

793
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:21,860
that I'm the owner of Cheong Ah Foundation. That I'm Cheong Ah Foundation!

794
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,260
How dare you raise your voice as someone who had a divorce and an affair!

795
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,090
I already finished talking with Lawyer Park!

796
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,860
Father! Father!

797
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,230
Father! Father!

798
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,600
Father! Father I was wrong!

799
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,270
Please give me one more chance!

800
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:41,360
I won't ever disappoint you again!

801
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,430
There are no more chances. Let go!

802
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,430
Father.

803
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,630
Father! Father!

804
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,550
Father!

805
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,880
Father! Father!

806
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,720
If you want to go, kill me first then go!

807
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,340
You can't just go!

808
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,930
You're so pathetic! Look at yourself!

809
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,980
You want to take my Cheong Ah with such a weak look?

810
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,500
Don't mention what would never happen!

811
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,190
Cheong Ah will belong to Seo Yeong!

812
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,910
That's enough!

813
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,430
If I did something wrong, it's all because of you!

814
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:30,060
You kept comparing me with her and made me compete against her over and over.

815
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,300
You kept pushing on and pushing on!

816
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,060
You never gave me a heart full of love!

817
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:40,680
You used your children as your life tools!

818
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:45,850
I was always hungry for love.

819
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:49,130
That's why I met another man.

820
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,960
How dare you talk back, how rude!

821
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,980
You! You're no longer my daughter!

822
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,920
No!

823
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,420
No! Cheong Ah Foundation is mine!

824
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,400
I can't give in it to anyone!

825
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,980
Let go! I said let go!

826
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,090
Let go!

827
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,890
Let go!

828
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,000
- Seo Jin. 
 - Father.

829
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,890
Seo Jin.

830
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,960
Father.

831
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,390
Father!

832
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,390
Father!

833
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,240
Father!

834
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,500
Seo Jin.

835
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,470
Seo Jin.

836
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,070
Seo Jin.

837
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,260
Seo Jin.

838
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,720
You made me like this, Father.

839
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,990
So don't feel too wronged.

840
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:57,280
At least, you did one thing for me before dying.

841
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:15,950

 The Penthouse: War In Life 

843
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,550
 Cheon Seo Jin would take the penthouse? 

844
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,390
 Someone who got the most benefits was Cheon Seo Jin. 

845
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,440
 The day your father died... 

846
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,700
 Mom and Dad got a divorce? 

847
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,060
 It looks like you were waiting for the father to pass away. 

848
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,750
 I've never opened my heart to you! 

849
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,320
 Love?  We can start love from now on. 

850
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,260
 Did you run away from your home? 

851
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,400
 What kind of man Ju Dan Tae is... 

852
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,190
 Why are you here?  

853
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:50,540
 Who do you dare to covet? 

854
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:56,200
 The old saying is a concubine can't stand another concubine.  You're just an adulteress!
