00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:02,530


3
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,310
Hello.

4
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,970
Where did you say?

5
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,380
Cheong Ah Arts School? Yes, so?

6
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,730
W-What—

7
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,750
W-What did you just say?

8
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,340
 Student Bae Ro Na is accepted and added to the Department of Vocal Music at Cheong Ah Arts School, I said. 

9
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,680
A-Accepted and added to?

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,320
Wh - Why... How?

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,460
 One of the accepted students died yesterday.  

12
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,280
N-N-No way... D-Did I...

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,740
 14 Hours before 

14
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,150
Where is my wife?  She didn't answer her phone.

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,090
She's in the shower.

16

 Hope Orphanage 2005 New Admissions

 Find a child found in December 2004, wrapped in a navy jacket.

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,700
  Surprising Santa delivered a lovely supportive donation

 Adoption Record: Name: Min Seol Ah 
 English Name: Anna Lee 
 Blood Type: B Rh +  

21
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,390
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

22
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,580
We had trivial noise but forget about it for now.  Let's celebrate our kids' acceptance to Cheong Ah Arts School.

23
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,730
Speaking honestly, it's not trivial noise.

24
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,550
If the girl opens her mouth outside,

25
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,360
it'll become a social issue like an affluent kids' group lynching or something.

26
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,600
Indeed, these days it is the era when owning a lot puts you at a disadvantage.

27
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,780
But...

28
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,760
thinking that girl is in Herapalace, I'm not getting excited even though I'm part of the party.

29
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,620
- Enjoy! 
 - I'm going to go to the maintenance room right now—

30
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,240
Damn it.

31
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,710
"The mouth is the cause of disaster."   Watch your mouth.

32
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,420
Honey!  This, this watch—

33
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,910
I'm using this today for the first time.

34
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,240
Ah, this.  Today is a special day.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,430
I'm wearing this for a special occasion.

36
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,620
It's an antique skeleton pocket watch.

37
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,820
This is a hand-made watch that was auctioned off by Onri Watch.  The biding price was—

38
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,900
As much as 1.5 billion Won!  Wow!

39
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,580
1.5 billion?  What would he do if he lost it?  He must've put too much stress on showing off.

40
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,970
Here!  Let's have a good time, everybody.

41
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,750
Let's throw away the depressed mood and loosen ourselves up excitingly!

42
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,980
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

43
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,020
 Adoption in 2015 and adoption dissolved in 2017 

44
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,740
If you've finished your business, leave here quickly. Please!

45
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,270
Min Seol Ah.  What's the reason that her adoption was dissolved?

46
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,260
She was adopted in the States but why did she return? What was the reason?

47
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,700
Why is that still remaining? Damn it.

48
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,890
I don't know either!

49
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,990
I guess she did something wrong.  That's why she was kicked out.

50
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,690
This person.  He is Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon, right? 
   Surprising Santa delivered a lovely supportive donation  

51
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,370
Why did he take pictures with Min Seol Ah?

52
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,520
Ah, damn it!  What is so odd about an assemblyman taking pictures with an orphan?

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,350
Gosh!

54
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,540
I raised an abandoned child at most, but why are you harassing me?

55
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,890
There must be a reason that her adoption was dissolved.

56
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,480
Who took that girl?

57
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,590
Let go of me! Please!

58
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,570
What kind of people were they?  Please tell me something.

59
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,240
Ah really!  Are you a leech or what? Seriously!

60
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,900
When was it that you abandoned your own kid? Now, you're here to talk bullshit?

61
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,920
You guys, what did you do to Seol Ah?

62
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,490
I'm asking what you did to her?

63
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,300
 If you need anything, please tell me. 

64
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,150
 Okay. I will. 

65
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,640
 What are you doing? 

66
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,080
 Not even the fundamentals? 

67
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,420
 I'm sorry, Seok Gyeong's mother. 

68
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,600
 You treated me well, but I'm sorry that I deceived you. 

69
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,080
 My baby, I'm sorry. 

70
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,440
 My baby, I didn't recognize you. 

71
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,140
  Missing calls: 8 from husband  

72
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,470
 Tutor Min Seol Ah   

73
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,490
 Please pick up the phone, Seol Ah. 

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
 This phone is not reachable so it'll connect to voice mail. 

75
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,910
What's this, really?

76
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,510
No one would go to the maintenance room to see Min Seol Ah, right?

77
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,160
If that girl reveals our relationship...

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,500
Who would believe her?  They would think of it as just a desperate claim made by a crazy kid.

79
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,610
If only we can find that damned phone...

80
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,590
Only, finding the phone won't solve all the problems.

81
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,210
She is not an ordinary girl. If you consider her too easy, we'll get attacked.

82
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,300
Where is my wife?  Make her answer the phone immediately!  Immediately!

83
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,090
What are you doing in here?

84
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm sorry, Ma'am. You didn't answer my knock so I thought you might have fainted.

85
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,360
The chairman is looking for you.

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,700
Ah, I'm very late, aren't I, honey? I'm sorry.

87
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll come down right away. Yes.

88
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,500
- Please get my dress ready. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

89
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,100
 To Min Seol Ah, Math Tutor:  Student Seol Ah.  I'm Seok Gyeong's mom. 

90
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,070
 I must tell you something. Please call me. 

91
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,380
 Just wait a little bit, Seol Ah.  This mom will bring you soon. 

92
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,270
It's fantastic, isn't it?

93
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,850
How much does this kind of thing cost?

94
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,800
Wow, fantastic!

95
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,190
Aw, so pretty! Pretty!

96
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,650
Wow!

97
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,490
H-H-Honey, Honey!  Honey!

98
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,720
What is it?

99
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,130
Dr. Ha! Dr. Ha, come here, hurry!

100
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,730
What is it?

101
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,660
Wow!

102
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,590
It seems she died instantly.

103
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,100
That is... It's her! Hey! You know that girl!

104
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,030
Who is it?  Who?

105
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,170
Min Seol Ah, our kids' fake teacher!

106
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,800
Crazy! Why... did she die?

107
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,790
How expensive that statue is!

108
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,060
Why, of all places, did she fall down on it and die there?  Why?

109
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,200
She's a troublemaker until the very end, anyway! On such an important day.

110
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,640
She fell down and died on there on purpose, to screw us up!  Displaying herself there!

111
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,030
You boasted and told us not to worry!  You locked her up, didn't you?

112
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,770
Did you let that thing go?

113
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,260
You think I'm crazy?  Why would I?

114
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,110
Then, who was it that released her?

115
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,240
That's not important at the moment.

116
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,010
Us suspecting each other doesn't help anything to resolve this incident.

117
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,030
For now, we should take care of that corpse.

118
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,450
In two hours, the ceremony to celebrate the first anniversary of Herapalace will be held right in front of that very fountain.

119
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,210
We've invited many public figures and celebrities.  Do you want to show them this mess?

120
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,240
That's why we should report it to the police first!

121
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,400
If the police come, we, as well as our kids will be the first ones on the suspect list,

122
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,770
Why our kids? No way, suspecting that we killed her?

123
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,820
Of course, we all know it wasn't us, but the police will have a different opinion.

124
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,890
If her cell phone is found, unfortunately,

125
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,030
that'll be the end of our kids' lives and future!

126
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,310
Please listen to me carefully.

127
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,710
Remember Min Seol Ah hadn't come to our Herapalace at this moment.

128
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,930
What do you mean?

129
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,040
What I'm saying is that the place where Min Seol Ah fell down and died is not here.

130
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,280
You said that Min Seol Ah lived in Jewelry Village, correct?

131
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,160
Are you suggesting to dump the corpse?

132
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,590
Article 161 of the Criminal Code; A person who destroyed, abandoned, hid, or took possession of

133
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,810
any corpse, remains, hair, or any objects placed in the coffin

134
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,300
will get a maximum of 7 years imprisonment.

135
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,950
To protect our children, this is an unavoidable choice we have to make.

136
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,190
She won't come back to life anyway. Because of that one girl, however,

137
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,620
we can't let this stain of shit pour over us!

138
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm in!  We must protect our children and Herapalace.

139
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,300
Let's follow the majority vote.

140
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,240
Instead, whatever the result may be

141
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,040
all of us must unconditionally follow that opinion.

142
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Let's vote by show of hands. Those agreeing?

143
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,160
Good.  Until the ceremony, we have 1 hour and 50 minutes left.

144
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
We can't waste a single minute or a second.

145
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,490
Gentlemen, we'll move the body.  Ladies, please take care of this fountain.

146
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,690
Let us handle this, I can do it.

147
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,600
Then, Je Ni's mother, please lead the group and the work process.

148
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,970
Please keep in mind.  Before the ceremony, by all means,

149
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,260
- we must turn things back to perfectly normal. 
 - Hold on a sec!

150
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,060
Why do we have to follow your orders, Chairman Ju?

151
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,890
Because no one here is completely innocent... of Min Seol Ah's death.

152
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,570
This would be big enough, right?

153
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,400
Great.  Let's move the corpse first.

154
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,180
Don't we have to call 119 even if it's a bit late? 
  ( 911 in the U.S.)

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,400
How many more times should we tell you we can't?

156
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,390
If the news breaks that a child died at our Herapalace,

157
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,660
the value of our property will drop instantly!

158
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,060
Moreover, her cell phone has the voice recording of our children's prank on it.

159
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,970
Doesn't it even matter to you if Min Hyeok gets expelled from Cheong Ah Arts School?

160
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,710
Even if he has to live with the scarlet letter of 'Assailant' in a group lynching for his lifetime?

161
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,120
Who... said I'm okay with it?

162
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,700
First, let's wipe the water off her.

163
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,670
There is no weather forecast of rain until tomorrow.

164
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,620
If she's found soaking wet, it will draw suspicion.

165
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,860
What are you doing?  Come on and wipe it off together!

166
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh my!

167
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,580
Even me!

168
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,410
For now, we should leave.

169
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,510
 1 hour 25 minutes 15...14... seconds left until the ceremony 

170
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
What is this? Why isn't it moving?

171
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,800
Excuse me, I'm a policeman.

172
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,070
You all are dressed up splendidly.

173
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,190
 Sugar and me 

174
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,640
I heard an assemblyman is also attending the first anniversary ceremony.

175
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,570
Since Attorney Lee here requested the local patrol station to set up security,

176
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,990
I came here in advance.

177
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,150
Oh right, there was a report that a scream was heard inside this apartment (complex)

178
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,660
At the time of the fireworks, the cheers of the residents were very loud.

179
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,350
Maybe the report was made by mistake because of that.

180
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,220
As for the security detail of the assemblyman, I hired a separate security team,

181
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,280
so you may go back.

182
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,210
Oh, I see, okay if that's the case.

183
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,400
By the way, you must be going on a golf trip. Oh, dear.

184
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,170
Yes.

185
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,230
 - (mouthing) Me?   
 - Yes, I'm leaving this weekend, but wanted to put it in the car in advance.

186
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,120
I see.  A golf trip...

187
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,230
- Are you alright? 
 - Oh, dear.

188
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,440
You're quite drunk, my fella.

189
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,350
 - (mouthing) What the heck? 
 - Stay there! 

190
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,440
You are all dressed up nicely, but ill-suited,

191
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
why are you wearing latex gloves?

192
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,780
We helped to move bottles of champagne for tonight's party.

193
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,510
These days, we must be wary of employees' feelings too.

194
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,540
You have such good manners, sir.

195
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,960
- I see.  
 - Yes.

196
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,150
Oh, you may leave first, since you must be busy with your work.

197
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,960
Shall I, then?

198
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,270
Damn!

199
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,600
Let's go.

200
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,190
This is Min Seol Ah's bag.

201
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,820
- Her note, I wrote her suicide note.  Please set it up together. 
 - Her suicide note?

202
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,060
Indeed, it's our Seo Jin. You not only have a pretty face, but also a quick-witted brain.

203
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,140
"Someone like me shouldn't have been born."

204
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,740
"I wish all of them would just die."

205
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,420
This sentence is great.

206
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,180
Oh, how is it going with the fountain?

207
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,210
Why, of all places, did she have to die here? 
  59 minutes 55...54 seconds left until the ceremony 

208
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,190
Making us go through so much trouble!

209
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,150
I didn't like her from the very first moment anyway!

210
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,810
Even so, weren't you too harsh to the dead girl?

211
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,390
She was still a child, you know.

212
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,800
This is strange. Why do you keep taking her side since earlier?

213
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,050
Are you feeling guilty about something?

214
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,410
What are you talking about?

215
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,310
Seriously, do you want to come at me now? Huh?

216
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,530
- Wait, wait! Hold on! 
 - Come at me! Bring it on!

217
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,600
Come on, we don't have time to fight now!

218
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,450
When are you going to clean up the blood stain?

219
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,100
We have to rush, but why is the traffic so bad at this late hour?

220
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,880
It's not a traffic jam, but a DUI traffic stop.

221
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,060
Why didn't we think about that? Huh?

222
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,870
We've all been drinking!

223
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,780
Should we have called a substitute driver?

224
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,130
- We're all done for, game over! 
 - Come on, calm down.

225
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,610
If there is any problem, I'll take care of it somehow.

226
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,990
Good evening, this is a DUI traffic stop.

227
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,100
Please blow it.

228
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,820
Excuse me.  Our dear police officer...

229
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:06,530
What is this?  You look exactly same as my deceased brother, who died not too long ago!

230
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,870
Oh my god, Mother...

231
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,560
Here. With this, please have a team dinner.

232
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,180
Are you bribing me now?

233
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,010
What kind of world are you living in now? Do you think this will work these days?

234
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,670
Please blow it, hurry up.

235
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,520
Passed!

236
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,110
What happened?

237
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,650
I didn't drink.

238
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,010
Why are you saying that now? I was completely terrified.

239
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,520
You didn't ask me, though.

240
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,260
Anyway, I guess the heavens are with us too.

241
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,230
Let's take care of the CCTVs first.

242
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,960
Damn it.

243
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,730
Go in, go!

244
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,500
 Video files damaged 

245
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,480
 Video files damaged 

246
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,870
 Video files damaged 

247
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,070
 46 minutes 12 seconds left until the ceremony 

248
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,070
 46 minutes 11...10 seconds left until the ceremony] 

249
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,720
Gosh...

250
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,150
What a relief.

251
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,080
All the bloodstains are gone,

252
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,910
and now it will be fine once the men's side is well taken care of.

253
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,880
It's too early to relax.

254
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,800
Look at that trickling water pressure.

255
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,260
Can't be sure when this big fountain will be filled up.

256
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,640
Let's get water from the restroom and add it.

257
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,280
- Yes. 
 - Me too?

258
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,000
Quickly, we don't have time, don't have time!

259
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,730
 Herapalace 

260
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,000
That's where Min Seol Ah was living.

261
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,150
And if she falls down from there...

262
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,280
If the body is found quickly, it won't be advantageous to us, so...

263
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,570
Let's put her up there.

264
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,500
- What? Up there?  
 - Yes.

265
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,090
But... that's...

266
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,730
Push it!

267
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,660
Come on, use some strength!

268
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,140
Attorney Lee, do it right, will you?

269
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,500
Damn it.

270
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,670
Here...

271
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,820
- Shoe! 
 - What?

272
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,720
Where is her shoe?

273
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,090
Damn it.

274
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,110
One of her shoes is gone!

275
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,470
What?

276
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,000
Attorney Lee, do you see her shoe down there?

277
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,740
 B07 

278
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,130
It's not here either.

279
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,140
It's not here either.

280
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm telling you, I can't find it!

281
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,130
It's not here at the fountain either.

282
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,160
We can't delay any longer.

283
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,840
Please wrap it up at each place you all are in charge of.

284
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,540
Please put this bag on the rooftop.

285
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,230
It would be better to have her suicide note found.

286
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,340
Then, is it over now?

287
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,210
We still have one more thing to do.

288
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,310
To complete her suicide note.

289
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,810
Wow, this is... well...

290
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,670
Damn.

291
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,670
What if there are some bugs in here?

292
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,350
Wow... Argh!

293
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,620
- Be quiet, you're too noisy! 
 - Because this place is so tiny...

294
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,700
Still, please!

295
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, this kind of place should be redeveloped by the government quickly.

296
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,650
Damn, that son of a bitch!

297
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,100
Here.

298
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,090
There is something...

299
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,800
What is it?

300
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,280
What...

301
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,380
It's a dog turd.

302
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,460
Argh, damn!

303
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,100
What is that?

304
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,910
Is.. Is that an eye?

305
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,640
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon 

306
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,220
 Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon 

307
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,640
We have exactly 25 minutes left now.

308
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,400
Since we couldn't find her cell phone, this is the best option.

309
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,460
With this, all the evidence

310
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,860
will disappear.

311
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,000
 Mom. Mom! 

312
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,510
Are you awake, Madame?

313
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,730
What happened?

314
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,870
You fainted in the elevator.

315
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,440
Don't you remember?

316
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,330
Nothing else happened?

317
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,990
Nothing and the event is running smoothly.

318
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,260
Madame.

319
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,100
 To Chairman Ju Dan Tae: Madame is heading down.  

320
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,590
Are you feeling better?

321
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,460
I heard you're not feeling well.

322
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,780
Didn't anything happen here?

323
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,490
What do you mean?

324
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,630
Why, is there anything that should've happened?

325
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,010
Let me know too, please?

326
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,700
I heard you fainted in the elevator.

327
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,260
Butler Yang told me so.

328
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,290
You still look pale.

329
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,100
You'd better finish this quickly and take a rest.

330
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,410
Still, what a relief, the lighting event is about to start soon.

331
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,930
 The First Anniversary Party - To The Splendid Glory of Herapalace 

332
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,460
To all of you who are attending this party to commemorate the first anniversary of Herapalace at this late hour,

333
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,390
I'd like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of all of our residents.

334
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,130
Especially to Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon, representing our district, thank you.

335
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,200
Now, the lighting event to make this fountain, the symbol of Herapalace, more perfect will start.

336
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,700
Please look at this statue of Hera, which was sculpted by a famous Italian artist.

337
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,290
Mr. Assemblyman?

338
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,080
Yes.

339
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,150
 I'm sure she fell down on the fountain... 

340
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,530
 Did I just dream it? 

341
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,470
Now, please raise your glasses.

342
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,140
To Hera, the Goddess of marriage and fidelity,

343
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,360
and the splendid glory of Herapalace, cheers!

344
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,330
Cheers!

345
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,270
Great.

346
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,600
This is a very cool ceremony, on what an extraordinary and grand scale it is.

347
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,390
I heard you even arranged the huge fireworks at the Han River.

348
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,910
Yes, thanks to your support as always, Assemblyman Jo.

349
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,690
Thank you.

350
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,030
She is your wife, isn't she?

351
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,640
You're very beautiful, as the rumors say.

352
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,490
Honey, please say hello to Assemblyman Jo.

353
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,140
 This man, this is Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon, isn't it? 

354
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,020
 Why did this man take photos with Min Seol Ah? 

355
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,020
My wife doesn't feel well today.

356
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,840
Please understand.

357
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,290
Honey! Here, blood?

358
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,260
I spilled the wine earlier

359
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,710
as I was stepping on my dress by accident.

360
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,520
What should I do?  I ruined your shirt.

361
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,130
It's fine.  Don't bother about it.

362
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,770
You did it while you were paying attention to your ruby ring, didn't you?

363
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,490
How much on earth does this stone cost?

364
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,800
You're all prettied up today, Teacher Cheon.

365
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,700
One, two, three!

366
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,460
Wow, the picture looks great.

367
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,880
 Tutor, if you see this text, please call me. 
 You didn't answer the phone.  Did something happen? 
 Are you okay? ... 

368
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,570
 Seol Ah, where are you? 

369
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,780
 Answer me please. 

370
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,170
Isn't that the place where the orphan girl lives?

371
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,890
Her dog was walking around all night...

372
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,830
- I think she and a dog, the two of them live together. 
 - Why did she set a fire?

373
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,300
Oh my! What's that?

374
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,600
Person!  Person over there!  Person!

375
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,800
Move aside!

376
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,600
Was the sneaker behind Ahjumma Hera also brought from Italy?

377
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,130
What... do you mean?

378
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,580
- I think the kids played a prank. 
 - I see.

379
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,950
 It's not that I was mistaken in what I saw. 

380
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,850
 I'm sure it was Seol Ah. 

381
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,910
Hey!  Who did this?

382
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,160
- How mischievous! 
 - They could have done it because they were curious.

383
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,350
How cute they are!

384
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:11,130
 All of you... what did you do to my Seol Ah? 

385
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,170
What are you doing? Remove it immediately.

386
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,410
Aigoo, these punks.

387
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,630
Fire at the Jewelry Village?

388
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,770
Well... That's a place where people live alone, right?

389
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,330
So what do you expect me to do?  Am I a firefighter?

390
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,930
 We just got some breaking news. 

391
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,160
 A fire broke out on Jewelry Village's 5th floor. 

392
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,180
 The fire was extinguished in over 30 minutes by the firefighters. 

393
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,860
 It was confirmed no one was home during the blaze. 

394
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,440
 But it caused a disturbance to over a hundred residents who had to evacuate their apartments. 

395
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,600
 While the police and the firefighters were investigating the exact cause of the fire... 

396
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,450
 The thick smoke is coming out of the windows. 

397
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,640
 While the firefighters were trying to extinguish the fire that occurred on the 5th floor, 

398
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,600
 a body was found on top of the apartment pavilion.  It gave us a shock. 

399
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,140
 The decease's identity was confirmed to be a teenage girl who lived in Jewelry Village 

400
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,870
 The police are investigating the CCTVs within the apartment (building) 

401
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,570
 to find out whether it's a homicide case or not. 

402
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,560
 She said she wouldn't die. 

403
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,940
 What a pity!  How could this happen? 

404
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,400
 How pitiful! In her prime days... 

405
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
 Her parents are the ones that should get struck by lightning. After giving birth to such a young baby ... 

406
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,370
 Why didn't they take responsibility for her? 

407
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,640
 Ah, really! 

408
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,800
 Is this... It's Seol Ah. 

409
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,090
We found a suicide note on the roof.

410
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,290
I think she committed suicide.

411
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,420
"Someone like me shouldn't have been born."

412
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,820
Such a young girl was so resentful.  That's why she set fire to her house.

413
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,460
And she threw herself from the roof?  Where is her shoe?

414
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,080
I haven't seen it yet.

415
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,660
- No way.  There is no way Seol Ah would commit suicide. 
 - What are you doing right now?

416
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
  Someone like me shouldn't have been born. 
 I wish all of them would just die.  

417
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,380
Ah really!  What are you doing right now?!

418
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,790
Why did you touch the evidence under the investigation without permission?

419
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,570
That's a crime of obstructing of justice!

420
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,860
I surely saw. The hand!

421
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,590
 There is no way Seol Ah committed suicide.   My Seol Ah...

422
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,000
Wait a second!  Wait a second!

423
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,610
Excuse me!  Please help me.

424
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,010
Please unfasten this.

425
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,530
I need to go.

426
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,050
Excuse me.  Can't you hear me?

427
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,490
Director Yun?

428
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,050
Why are you here?

429
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,780
If you lose your cool like that, what will you gain?

430
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,720
I think I warned you that if you acted rashly, all of you would die.

431
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,160
 If you want to find your daughter, follow my instructions. 

432
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,400
 If you act rashly, even Ju Hye In and your daughter, both of them will die. 

433
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,370
Was it you?

434
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,870
Who called me?

435
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,640
I'm asking!

436
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,720
Was it you who told me Hye In was not my daughter?

437
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,150
Why?

438
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,140
Why did you do that?

439
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,040
If Chairman found out this,

440
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,970
you would be in danger as well.

441
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,190
It doesn't matter.

442
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,460
When my daughter is dead, what's the use if I'm alive?

443
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,990
My daughter...

444
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,460
My daughter is dead.

445
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,580
You've done everything bad beside Ju Dan Tae.  But why now?

446
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,250
Are you starting to feel guilty now?

447
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,460
Do you think your sin will disappear even if you do so?

448
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,880
You're right.

449
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,550
I'm a person at the Chairman's side, who has to follow his orders.

450
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,270
Since he is holding my life line,

451
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,880
I'll follow his orders until I die.

452
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,510
Then why are you doing this to me?

453
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,130
What do you want from me?

454
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,750
Even if I were a Tosa dog and the worst trash, 
  ( Tosa dog - an aggressive fighting dog) 

455
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,110
I thought I would need to tell you just this once

456
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,120
what happened 17 years ago.

457
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,540
 Even though she was born within 32 weeks, 
   

458
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,730
 her heart and other organs are all normal. 

459
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,640
 I think you're really blessed. 

460
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,160
 You're telling me she is normal? 

461
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,470
 The thing called life is really tenacious. 

462
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,520
 That baby was also born within 32 weeks. 

463
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,750
 But her condition has gotten worse. 

464
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,360
 Her mother is an unwed mother so it looks like she has no room to take care of the baby. 

465
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,260
 Her medical expenses cost too much... 

466
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,060
 What were you going to do with the baby?  It's better for your baby's sake. 

467
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,820
 So stop crying.  Just think you made a good choice. 

468
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,280
 Good job. You did well. 

469
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,270
 Sim Su Ryeon's baby 

470
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,510
 Kim Jeong Bin's baby 

471
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:07,560
 They switched the just born babies in the newborn nursery. 

472
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,940
 However, I couldn't bear to kill the baby.
   

473
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,240
 I felt like she was struggling to survive by any means. 

474
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,010
 So I left her in front of the orphanage. 

475
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,820
 I didn't know that baby was Min Seol Ah. 

476
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,450
Stop telling me!  Stop!

477
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,580
I'll administer you a tranquilizer so get some good sleep.

478
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,120
Don't go yet.  Go after unfastening these first.

479
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Are you human?

480
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,500
Director Yun!

481
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,910
Director Yun!

482
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,630
 Don't get sick, Sugar 

483
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,820
Ju Dan Tae.

484
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,940
I'm going to surely kill you.

485
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,140
I'm going to kill you.

486
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,560
I'm going to kill you.

487
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,880
 Heraclub: I've made an arrangement  with the media to publish this as a case of a middle schooler,  

488
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,950
 who was pessimistic about her condition as written in her note, committed suicide after setting the fire. 

489
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,920
Doggy!  Mongrel!

490
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,930
Don't come close!

491
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,660
It's okay.  It's okay.

492
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,120
 Even if Seol Ah's phone's last location were indicated as Herapalace, 

493
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,030
 they can't find any evidence that we were directly connected to her. 

494
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,130
 There is nothing to worry about. 

495
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,960
 Because she was just a loser who committed suicide after struggling in desperation. 

496
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,790
Is it true that the girl committed suicide?

497
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,840
Then someone killed her?

498
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,210
I don't trust Ju Dan Tae.

499
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,130
How about you?  Do you believe him?

500
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,990
That bastard?

501
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,010
That's why you even manipulated her note.

502
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,780
I got goosebumps, looking at you earlier.

503
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,130
Did you really have to go that far? Like you were loyal to what he says?

504
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,340
I don't care whether she committed suicide or she was killed.

505
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,650
That was all for our Eun Byeol's sake.

506
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,550
I don't want to hear her name again.

507
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,090
Did you see this?  Look at this.

508
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,620
This is about Min Seol Ah, right?

509
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,340
"The arsonist of Jewelry Village was a middle schooler who was pessimistic about her condition."

510
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,460
"A note showing all her resentment toward the world was found."

511
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,470
"I wish all of them would just die."?

512
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,350
Ah really.  She was not ordinary.  Look at the scale.

513
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,950
- Goosebumps. 
 - Wow.

514
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,160
Then our incident will be naturally buried.

515
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,270
Of course, it'll happen.

516
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:10,400
Who would grieve for a sociopath's death?

517
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,530
Be quiet!  Stop talking about that dead girl!

518
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,600
She has nothing to do with us now. Let's plan our tri

519
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,580
Why have you been so sensitive since yesterday?

520
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,840
Did you kill Min Seol Ah?

521
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,790
What?

522
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,470
No, I didn't!  Why would I?

523
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:43,910
Then why are you overacting?  There is no way you killed her because she committed suicide.

524
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:47,300
I feel filthy.  Let's stop talking about the con artist.

525
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Soon, a nuclear bomb, that is much worse than Min Seol Ah, will come.

526
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,990
What do you mean?

527
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,000
The waiting list number 1, who got accepted to the school, thanks to Min Seol Ah.

528
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,820
She is a complete dumbhead and rude ass.

529
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,000
Why do you hate her so much? Are you jealous of her?

530
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,650
Are you out of your mind?  Why would I be jealous of such a girl?

531
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,030
When you see her, you'll notice right away.  She pretends she is something even though she is nothing.

532
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,770
I hate her more than Min Seol Ah.

533
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,570
That mediocre girl is the worse piece of luck, right?

534
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,300
Is that so?  I'm looking forward to meeting her.

535
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,120
Right, oppa?

536
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,430
Hello.

537
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,700
W-Where did you say?

538
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,230
Cheong Ah Arts School? Yes, so?

539
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,730
W-What did you just say?

540
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:05,090
 Student Bae Ro Na is accepted and added to the Department of Vocal Music at Cheong-A Arts School, I said. 

541
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,650
A-Accepted, added to?

542
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,260
W-Why... Why? How?

543
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,510
 One of the accepted students died yesterday.  

544
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,530
N-N-No way... D-Did I...?

545
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,140
Hi everyone!  Everyone!

546
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,060
A-Are you okay?   W-Where... Aren't you hurt?

547
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,560
Why are you acting like that, Ahjumma?

548
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,330
Why are you here again?

549
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,660
It's so annoying, really!

550
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,640
You're really something.

551
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,660
How come a person died as if she was waiting for death?

552
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,150
Anyway, Ro Na, that wench, is full of good luck.

553
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:46,360
It's a relief that you are all fine.

554
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,490
What, are you saying, is a relief?

555
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,950
Did you hear the news? That Min Seol Ah is dead.

556
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,870
Min Seol Ah?

557
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,970
The girl who was accepted as the top scorer?

558
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,880
Why that girl?

559
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,620
By any chance, did you kill her and you're playing innocent?

560
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,140
They said she committed suicide but I can't believe that at all.

561
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,030
Wasn't it really you, Ahjumma?

562
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:17,790
If you were not the...  Then was it Ro Na?

563
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,930
If you say such words to Ro Na,

564
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:23,660
I will not leave you alone!

565
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,870
You Ahjumma, you must be out of your mind!  Huh?

566
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,860
What is this?

567
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,180
Ahjumma!  It's bleeding on your hand.

568
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,180
Ahjumma, was there something that happened to you last night?

569
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,030
Stop it, Yu Je Ni!

570
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,120
Let's go.  Everybody is waiting for us.

571
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,740
How expensive this clothing is...  It's all ruined.

572
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,440
What is this?

573
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,370
P-Possibly... Possibly, did I...

574
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,650
No.  No way.  There was no way.

575
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,010
Why can't I remember anything?

576
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,970
Yeah, Ro Na.

577
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,370
Mom!  I was accepted to Cheong Ah Arts School!

578
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,760
Hooray!

579
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,580
I got accepted to Cheong Ah Arts School!

580
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,560
I was thinking again and again. That girl ...

581
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,890
There was no reason for her to commit suicide?

582
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,900
She was accepted as the top scorer so she would receive a scholarship.

583
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,000
And her future would be solid and bright. Why would she commit suicide?

584
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,790
Then you're saying one of us killed her?

585
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,020
Who would do that?  It doesn't make sense.

586
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,830
Nobody knows that.

587
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,520
Someone stepped out for a short time yesterday.

588
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,950
It looked like he hastily went somewhere. Dr. Ha!

589
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,460
Right now, are you suspecting me?

590
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,020
I went to the bathroom.

591
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,660
- Did it take that long to go to the bathroom? 
 - Pardon?

592
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:30,980
Ah right!  Didn't you step out yesterday, Je Ni's mom?

593
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,860
I was drunk so I went to vomit! I'm at a loss for words.

594
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,440
Ah right!  Attorney Lee, who did you talk to for a long time on the phone yesterday?

595
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,300
Right.  It looked like the call was very private.

596
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,760
What are you talking about?  I was talking with my mom—

597
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,110
What?  Shall I show you my phone?

598
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,790
I'm a person who calls his mom every hour!  Right?

599
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
Everybody!  What are you all doing?

600
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,680
- Show us! Show us! 
 - Why do you want to see?

601
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,900
- Show us!

602
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,560
We should stop.

603
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,800
- She said we should stop. 
 - If he says to show it, then show us.

604
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,190
- Why should I show it? 
 - Show us!

605
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,510
The police will come to Herapalace soon.

606
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,320
Min Seol Ah committed suicide!

607
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,300
We're making the truth!

608
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,940
When we looked at the Min Seol Ah's phone record, you talked with her on the phone frequently.

609
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,090
She was my daughter's math tutor.

610
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:46,780
She committed suicide at the Jewelry Village but why was her last phone location here at Herapalace?

611
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,730
 I don't know that.  Aren't you being a policeman to find that out? 
      

612
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,920
We found out she was a complete fake.

613
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,960
 We thought she was Teacher Anna who was a student at UCLA in the States. 
      

614
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,860
So you had a bitterness toward her because she swindled you like an adult?

615
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,280
Why should people like us show concern over that?

616
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,830
There are so many other things for us to be concerned about.

617
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,160
She was just... a fruit fly.

618
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,590
Yes, it bothered us.

619
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,960
But so what?  We just leave it alone.

620
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,050
I heard Min Seol Ah got accepted to Cheong Ah Arts School as the top scorer.  Is that true?

621
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:27,190
Yes.  I was surprised but I congratulated her.

622
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,230
Is that true?

623
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,980
There was a rumor that you tried to cancel her acceptance.

624
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,870
 It's an incorrect rumor. 
     

625
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,730
 If I'd wanted to cancel her admission, I would've done it earlier. 

626
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,020
 I sincerely wished her the best of luck with her talent. 

627
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:45,360
 As an adult, I just feel sorry I didn't embrace her more. 

628
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:50,990
Ju Dan Tae, there was a call recorded the day before her death. 
  Call Record of Ju Dan Tae 

629
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,380
By any chance, did you meet her?

630
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,260
 I called her to meet her but she didn't come. 
      

631
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,800
 It's a shame that she intentionally deceived us but I feel bad that she ended her life herself. 

632
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,740
Your wife, Sim Su Ryeon, also kept calling her.

633
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,740
My wife did?

634
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:17,470
Probably... There was a misunderstanding between kids. I think she tried to resolve it. That's why she called her.

635
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:20,840
She is a very soft-hearted person.

636
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,340
 Do you feel like you want to talk now? 

637
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,630
 Where is the phone? 

638
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,440
 If you want to go back home, it's better to speak out quickly. 

639
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,580
 Are you doing this to me because of some trifling adulterous video clip on my phone? 

640
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,350
 That's so lame. 

641
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,630
 Just because of that, you show me this bottom floor. 

642
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,450
 You really!  What makes you think you can act up like this? 

643
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,960
 I've already found out about you. 

644
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,120
 You were adopted,  had the adoption dissolved, and were even deported. 

645
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,300
 I heard the reason you were deported was stealing.   

646
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,660
 I didn't steal. 

647
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,250
 People like you framed me. 

648
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:54,060
 Who would believe the words of an orphan like you? 

649
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,650
 Speak quickly.  Where is the phone? 

650
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,720
 Even if you withstand it, what can you do? 

651
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,330
 Who knows? 

652
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:08,050
 I might know something much more than you thought, Ahjumma. 

653
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,040
 What do you think you know? 

654
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,180
 The corrupt admissions to Cheong Ah Arts School!  I know it all. 

655
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,270
 Stop acting up.  There is a limit for me to put up with watching your acting-up. 

656
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,250
 You feel guilty, don't you? 

657
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,680
 Did your daughter, Ha Eun Byeol get accepted fairly into Cheong Ah Arts School? 

658
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,470
 Didn't she take someone else's spot to be accepted? 

659
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,600
 Did you think I didn't know about it, by chance? 

660
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,390
 Shut up before I kill you! 

661
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,490
 Die!  Die! 

662
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,380
 Die! Die! 

663
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,000
 From Paradise Music Shop: See you at the penthouse, 9 PM. 

664
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,300
 Chief of Police Office 

665
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,700
I just finished interrogating the Herapalace residents.

666
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,890
How about the autopsy of the corpse?

667
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,490
Hey, are you in your right mind?

668
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,030
How many cases do we have right now?

669
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,850
Why do you want to waste your energy on the case in which  a suicide note was discovered?

670
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:34,100
Wrap up the case as suicide and treat the corpse as someone without family or friends.

671
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,800
Yes.  I got it, Police Chief.

672
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,780
 Min Seol Ah:  Suicide 

673
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,420
 Yu So Yeon:  Suicide 

674
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,970
 Min Seol Ah:  Suicide  
  Yu So Yeon:  Suicide 

675
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:35,920
 Cremation In Process 

676
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,610
Yes, Chairman.

677
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,590
The body is being cremated right now.

678
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,810
I got it.

679
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,190
The damage to the brain and the broken cervical vertebra from a fall

680
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:15,270
were the direct causes of her death.

681
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,360
There is one unusual thing.

682
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,560
This was found inside her body.

683
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,510
Why this?

684
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,490
I think she swallowed this just before she died.

685
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,100
Seol Ah!

686
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,630
Mom is so sorry.

687
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,290
I came for you too late.

688
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,990
I didn't recognize you.

689
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,210
I'm so sorry that I left you alone.

690
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:20,080
This is all my fault.

691
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,110
Everything is my fault.

692
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:25,260
I feel like a fool.

693
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,030
I feel like an idiot.

694
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:42,280
Seol Ah...  Who made you like this?

695
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:47,930
I'll definitely find the culprit

696
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:51,460
and I'll kill him, tearing him to  pieces!

697
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,990
My Seol Ah.

698
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,620
Mom!  Noona!

699
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,570
What happened?

700
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,770
It's not there!

701
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,160
What?

702
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,570
It is not here!  I'm saying it's not there.

703
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,130
What isn't here or there?

704
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,750
My antique skeleton pocket watch.

705
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,750
What!  Hey!

706
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,340
You seriously!  You Lee Gyu Jin, how...

707
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,390
What are you going to do?

708
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,840
- What are you going to do?  Huh? 
 - It hurts!  It hurts!

709
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,940
You Lee Gyu Jin, really!

710
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,470
Why did you ask me to meet at your house?

711
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,220
Don't worry.

712
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:54,620
The children went on a trip and I let the helpers go on vacation.

713
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,090
My wife won't be coming home tonight.

714
01:05:57,090 --> 01:06:00,740
So it's you and I, only the two of us are here.

715
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,950
Still, your home is...

716
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,140
uncomfortable.

717
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,810
We neatly finished resolving the headache problem, so we need to enjoy a drink after such a long time.

718
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:13,580
How about partying just between us?

719
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,020
We haven't found Min Seol Ah's phone yet.

720
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:21,100
There is our video clip in there. I keep feeling wary somehow.

721
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,720
What makes you wary?

722
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:28,340
The case was already closed as a suicide and they already finished cremating her body.

723
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,480
Is that true?

724
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,990
Already finished cremating her?

725
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,350
Of course.

726
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,960
Is there any place that my power can't reach?

727
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,050
However, I feel a bit of pity.

728
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,930
If she hadn't known anything, she wouldn't have died.

729
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:47,980
And then her life might have been more comfortable when she died.

730
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,450
She dared to threaten us by smartly taking a video?

731
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:55,280
She shortened her life span herself.

732
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,900
Forget everything from now on, let's drink a toast.

733
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,960
To our fortune!  Cheers!

734
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:21,610


735
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,700
 The Penthouse: War In Life  

736
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,700
 I will definitely not let it slide! 
     

737
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,990
 Even if I shake up Herapalace, that person is—  

738
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,440
 That means there was a witness. 

739
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,000
 I saw Dr. Ha's hand. 

740
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,230
 Perhaps, Dr. Ha did something to that girl? 

741
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,880
 Is there anything you are hiding from me? 

742
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,060
 This is a secret between you and me, only the two of us.  Do you understand? 

743
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,320
 We'll get punished for what we did to her. 

744
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,890
 I will never forgive the people who made you like that. 

745
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,260
 Is it that your mom pushed Min Seol Ah? 

746
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,140
 Why on earth are you doing this to me? 

747
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,570
 There is no way I killed her. 

748
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,430
 On the day Min Seol Ah died at Herapalace, 

749
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,710
 where and what did you do? 

750
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:59,200
 As I expected, you don't remember, right?
