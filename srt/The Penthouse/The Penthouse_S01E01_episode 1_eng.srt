10
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,930
She's art. She has a heavenly voice.

11
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,640
You do know her, right?  Soprano Cheon Seon Jin.

12
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,200
I only listen to trot.

13
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,180
Trot is trending nowadays.

14
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,320
Do you like the house, Assemblyman?

15
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,190
Well, it's nice.

16
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,670
The built-in devices provide seclusion from people.

17
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,820
You should have no worries about security, Assemblyman.

18
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,760
Come this way.

19
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,030
In the case of an emergency, you can use this door.

20
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,600
A great benefit is that it leads outside.

21
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,590
It looks useful.

22
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,530
I've wanted to ask you this before.

23
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,340
It's so hot, why are you wearing a scarf?

24
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,450
Aren't you hot?

25
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,450
I am fine. Fashion doesn't care about seasons.

26
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,090
If you're too inflexible, it's boring.

27
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,960
Who knows how I could help you?

28
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,210
What are you doing?

29
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,190
My scarf.

30
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,800
I said I'm fine.

31
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,370
You're so full of yourself.

32
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,980
I'll get going now.

33
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,040
- The broker's commission... 
 - Broker's commission?

34
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,150
Miss Oh, You're quite bold.

35
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,120
Did you think I wouldn't know you're consulting illegally without a license?

36
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,730
With just one phone call, I could end you.

37
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,620
If you understand, get going.

38
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,220
Assemblyman.

39
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,570
I've shown you dozens of  houses in the past 3 months.

40
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,010
I tried very hard.

41
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,560
You should give me the cost of labor.

42
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,520
Get lost. Don't bother me.

43
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,920
Assemblyman, but...

44
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,450
Yes, Honey? Where are you?

45
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,920
It would be nice if you came quickly.

46
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,520
It would be nice if you came and saw this house, too.

47
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,580
 Yes. 

48
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,540
That crazy man. They said he was a successful assemblyman,

49
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,510
but he's a complete bastard!

50
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,320
I should put him in a grinder and just grind him up.

51
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,070
What kind of woman would have an affair with a jerk like him?

52
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,110
That woman...

53
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,130
 Donated by Kang Ma Ri, mother of Yu Je Ni 

54
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,210
♫ Bright April comes, March winds are o'er.

55
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
♫ And thus sweet bird art here once more.

56
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,960
♫ I hear again they cheerful lay.

57
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,110
♫ Among the leaves and flowerets gay.

58
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,230
♫ Of happy youth and happy love!

59
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,770
♫ Of happy happy love.

60
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,500
Je Ni, put your strength into your diaphragm and push the sound forward.

61
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,100
Maschera resonance produces the sound. Use the maschera (mask) resonance.

62
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,360
- Is that so hard to do? 
 - If it were easy to do,

63
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,110
why would I be learning from you?

64
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,310
Oh my gosh.

65
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,950
Be honest. You went to a noraebang yesterday, right? 
  (Noraebang - song room, karaoke, KTV) 

66
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,030
Midterms just ended, can't I do that much?

67
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,840
How could you use your voice so recklessly before a competition?

68
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,020
I told you never to sing pop music.

69
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,990
Yu Je Ni, what are you doing?

70
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,560
That sneaky wench! If I catch her, I won't leave her alone!

71
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,690
"Put your strength into your diaphragm and push the sound forward.

72
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,040
Maschera resonance produces the sound."

73
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,130
I knew this would happen!

74
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,770
Bae Ro Na, that was you earlier, wasn't it?

75
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,570
Who said you could use my practice room?

76
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,720
- Why is the school's practice room just yours? 
 - Didn't you know?

77
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,680
This is the practice room my parents made for me to use and the piano they bought for me.

78
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,210
No matter who made what, it's the school's practice room.

79
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,190
It's not even your house. I don't think there's a reason I can't use it.

80
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,830
Of course, you can't!

81
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,620
This is my practice room at school for me, who's going to go to Cheong Ah Arts School,

82
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,320
to use so I don't waste time going back and forth from home.

83
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,110
Don't you understand?

84
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,080
Cheong Ah Arts School?

85
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm going to go there too.

86
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,240
Cheong Ah Arts School?

87
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,020
How could you get into Cheong Ah Arts School?

88
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,560
Do you have money?

89
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,730
Can your parents support you like my mom can for me?

90
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,580
And there's no way Cheong Ah Arts School would pick

91
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,830
two girls from a public middle school.

92
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,590
I'm telling you clearly for the last time.

93
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,530
That's my spot. Don't even dream of it!

94
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,030
My voice is enough.

95
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,060
In this competition,

96
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm going to win and get the letter of recommendation from our principal.

97
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,490
Without any help from my parents, like you.

98
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,060
Wait and see.

99
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,610
That girl, what is she saying?

100
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,730
Hey! Stop right there!

101
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,550
Hey, Bae Ro Na!

102
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,090
My daughter!

103
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,440
How did practice go? Are you hungry?

104
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,980
Why is your neck so bare?

105
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,260
You should be protecting your throat.

106
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,600
I told you to keep this around your neck.

107
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,030
Let's go.

108
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,490
I'm so annoyed, Mom!

109
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,460
What's wrong? Tell Mommy everything.

110
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,730
Princess, are you crying?

111
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,580
There's an ugly girl named Bae Ro Na at school.

112
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,210
But she

113
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,930
said she'd win the competition instead of me!

114
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,530
And she even snuck in a practice in my practice room.

115
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,400
Do I have to put up with this?

116
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,300
That crazy...  Why should my princess put up with that?

117
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,320
Daughter, don't put up with her. You have me.

118
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,030
I'm going to show that girl what I can do.

119
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,600
First, let's put her down by showing off your dress.

120
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,320
What do her parents do?

121
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,870
She doesn't have a dad. He died.

122
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,370
Died?

123
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,490
What about her mom?

124
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,240
What does her mom do?

125
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,650
Come this way, ma'am.

126
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,100
Isn't the garden gorgeous?

127
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,390
The entrance is too far away.

128
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,020
Isn't it decorated so nicely?

129
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,700
The upstairs is here.

130
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,960
♪ My love battery is all used up ♪

131
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,010
This house has so much sunlight, ma'am.

132
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,900
Of course.

133
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,740
Oh my!

134
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,930
Eat this, eat this!

135
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,020
Aren't there any good places?

136
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,130
All those places are mediocre.

137
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,560
Isn't that other real estate agent much better?

138
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,160
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

139
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,750
- If you give me one more day... 
 - Forget it!

140
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
Ma'am.

141
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,330
Thanks for the drinks.

142
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,690
Please call me, ma'am!

143
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,460
Math academy?

144
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,120
Yes, Teacher. Hello.

145
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,640
What? My Ro Na?

146
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,520
I'm home!

147
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,170
I got a call from the math academy.

148
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,760
They said it's been months since you showed up.

149
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,220
You bought these things with the money that I worked so hard to earn?

150
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,860
How long have you been lying to me?

151
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,520
- Mom, that's...
 - I told you!

152
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,720
I won't allow you to sing!

153
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,740
I'm going to sing!

154
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,530
I want to do classical singing.

155
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,910
Why can't I? Why don't you let me? Why?

156
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,760
Just study with your smart brain!

157
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,790
If you don't like cram school, I'll find you a tutor.

158
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,720
Why do you want to sing when you can be a lawyer or a judge?

159
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Don't you get it by looking at me, how to make a living?

160
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,930
You need licenses to make a living!

161
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,250
Never sing for living!

162
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,320
You've never heard me sing.

163
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,030
Singing isn't for just anyone!

164
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,210
I'm good at it!  I'm confident.

165
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,660
Why are you so against this?

166
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,030
Your daughter wants this more than death! She crazily wants to sing!

167
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,220
What's the reason you're stopping me from singing?

168
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,250
Stop!  Don't do that!

169
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,670
Don't!

170
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,850
- I don't care.  I memorized it all anyway. 
 - What?

171
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,040
Mozart's The Magic Flute's

172
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,190
"The Queen of the Night" aria.

173
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,310
♫ Then you will be my daughter nevermore ♫

174
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,630
♫ Disowned you'll be forever, ♫

175
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,810
♫Abandoned may you be forever,  ♫

176
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,550
 ♫  Hear, gods of revenge, hear a mother's oath!  ♫ 

177
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,820
If you say once more that you want to sing,

178
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,650
I'm going to die first, right in front of you.

179
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,130
You sing after I die.

180
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,550
Never until then.  Do you understand?

181
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,070
 No matter what you say, 

182
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,330
  I'm going to sing! 

183
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,270
 You're particularly pretty. 

184
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,530
 Of all the multipurpose apartment complexes, the most expensive one per square foot, 

185
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,030
 Samseong-dong's Herapalace 

186
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,720
 maintains its popularity. 

187
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,540
 It's called a castle for the richest top one percent. 

188
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,680
 After just one year since its opening, 

189
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,610
 its appraised value went up by nine percent. 

190
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,310
It's really nice. 
   Premium Lifestyle...Herapalace 

191
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,550
Before I die,

192
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,320
could I get to live in a place like that?

193
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,250
 Herapalace

♫ What a beautiful thing is a sunny day!  ♫

♫ The air is serene after a storm ♫

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,200
♫ The air is so fresh that it already feels like a celebration ♫

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,550
♫ What a beautiful thing is a sunny day! ♫

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,550
♫ But... ♫

199
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,500
Stop.

200
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,910
Lee Min Hyeok.  Do you really want to sing classical music?

201
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,440
Pardon?

202
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,320
Yes.

203
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,400
Aren't you just copying what everybody else is doing?

204
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,310
If this is all you can do,

205
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,540
you can't get into Cheongah Art High School, let alone Seoul National University.

206
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,080
Do you understand?

207
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,100
If you show up at a lesson without practicing once more, you're out.

208
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,240
My teaching philosophy is that a boy who doesn't have talent

209
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,880
and doesn't even try, can't make it as my student.

210
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,410
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes.

211
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,520
What are you doing?  Take him to the practice room.

212
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,110
He might have been going through a teenage phase recently

213
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,180
I'll give him a stern scolding, Teacher.

214
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,430
I don't think that my being close to the parents should mean I give lessons to the kid.

215
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,990
If Min Hyeok isn't good enough,

216
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,200
I'll expel him.

217
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,750
You know that I have a list of students accumulating

218
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,240
who are just waiting for a lesson from me.

219
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,830
Of course, I do. Everybody knows that

220
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,480
getting a chance of taking our Teacher Cheon's lesson is harder than picking a star in the sky.

221
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
Really.

222
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,640
I will make Min Hyeok practice.

223
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,760
Do you know my sunbae announcer, Jang Yun Gyeong?

224
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,160
Her in-laws are Mipung Industries.

225
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,210
By special request, I received permission to rent the Mipung Arts Hall.

226
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,330
What do you think about holding the Cheong Ah Foundation concert there this time?

227
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,540
Well, I'll ask my father about it.

228
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,800
Gosh, that's not very much to scale, is it not?

229
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,700
The Cheong Ah Foundation has its own standard.  That is already way beneath it. Right, Teacher Cheon?

230
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,530
I'm sure there is a reason for Je Ni's Mom speaking so confidently, right?

231
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,880
The Haeyeon Music Hall.  What do you think about there?

232
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,880
No way!  What kind of skills do you have?

233
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,800
Usually, it wouldn't be possible, but the owner's wife and I are close.

234
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,600
She made an effort for me.   If you just mention my name,

235
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,800
they will make the reservation immediately. Please make the call.

236
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,810
How can I repay this debt to you?

237
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,070
I heard you have an opening in your lesson schedule.

238
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,910
Teacher, that's for my Je Ni, right?

239
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,420
 Student Application 

240
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,480
I'll call you.

241
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,560
If Je Ni receives lessons from you, then Seoul University School of Music is a sure thing, right?

242
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,280
Then I will entrust everything concerning Je Ni to you,

243
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,140
whether it's about getting prepared for auditions or  her GPA.

244
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,370
To me, Teacher Cheon's "Cheon" means heaven.

245
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,410
Heaven Cheon.

246
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,320
What is that trophy?  I haven't seen it before?

247
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,560
Goodness.  This is the Grand Prize trophy of the Cheongah  Arts Festival, right?

248
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,660
We're finally seeing this famous legendary trophy.

249
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,970
Legendary?

250
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,420
Don't you know? A classmate who was jealous of Teacher's talent,

251
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,470
slit her own throat.  A long, drawn-out, and bizarre incident.

252
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,270
Everyone who sings classically knows the story.

253
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,730
Oh my god. Terrible. I mean, do you injure yourself because you're jealous?

254
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,260
Only some kind of nut.

255
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,390
Anyone at the top of their field is always bound to receive jealousy.

256
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,030
Like Mozart received Salieri's jealousy.

257
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,410
So what happened to that classmate?

258
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,010
Since she reached for something she shouldn't have coveted,

259
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,030
shouldn't she get punished by herself and leave music forever?

260
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,560
After that,

261
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,090
this award trophy disappeared forever as well.

262
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,750
If it is so legendary,

263
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,230
may I touch it just once?

264
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,450
This trophy was a free pass to the Seoul University School of Music.

265
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,110
Because it could only be won by placing first in the vocal section.

266
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,540
By the way, do you know the Hera Club will gather at my home this evening?

267
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,750
Yes.

268
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,200
You should come empty-handed, so you will be welcomed.

269
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,490
 Low Zone 21F - 60F 

270
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
 High Zone 61F-99F 

271
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,070
What?  "Je Ni's Mom, what kind of skills do you have?"

272
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,330
Does she look on Kang Ma Ri as water. 
 ( TN: A homonym of Kang is river.) 

273
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Go Sang Ah.  Is being the daughter-in-law of a law firm chaebol everything?

274
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,900
I can't even stand her name.

275
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,240
Where have you been roaming? Going out day in and day out.

276
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,230
How can you be busier than me?

277
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,910
Are you home already?  Wasn't there a trial?

278
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,830
Are you here now?

279
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,500
Mother-in-law.  When did you come without notice?

280
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,020
Why are you so surprised?  Do I need to call my son when I come to his house?

281
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Get me some fruit.  You bought the Shine Muscat, didn't you? 
  (Shine Muscat - a type of grape) 

282
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,050
Yes.  Please wait for a moment.

283
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,060
Oh, Older Sister-in-law, you're here too?

284
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,980
You look like you can't stand seeing me.

285
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,900
Of course not.  I'll get you some fruit.

286
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,270
Thanks.

287
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,470
Younger Sister-in-Law, you're here too.

288
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,820
You've only been a housewife for over 15 years.

289
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,030
How is it you haven't cooked a single taste preference of your in-laws?

290
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,940
Regardless of being a great announcer before you got married,

291
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,290
cooking is still a basic skill.

292
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,450
Why, isn't the seasoning right?

293
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,000
That's why I couldn't entrust the housekeeping to her.

294
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,420
There's nothing you're good at. Nothing.

295
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,090
I know.  Mother-in-law, please teach me how to cook better. I haven't improved at all.

296
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,550
When I talk (food) all day outside, do I still have to come to this home and teach my daughter-in-law?

297
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,110
My head is about to burst from my cooking classes, broadcasting, and book writing.

298
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,920
Look at these poor hands.

299
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Mom, Mom, what should I wear for the Hera Club gathering tonight? Is this okay?

300
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,870
Blue suits you well because of your fair skin.

301
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,790
Ah, blue!

302
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,420
What about the tie?

303
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,910
It's not a serious gathering, so no tie will be fine too.

304
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,430
But I'll pick one out for you. Let's go, Son.

305
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,200
I'm done eating.  Bring my fruit with you.

306
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,870
Yes.

307
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,500
  I want to live also shouting, Boom Boom. Truly. 

308
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,460
Wear something else.  How many times have I told you that's boring.

309
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,950
The host should be a little sophisticated.

310
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,520
I also have a good eye for clothing.

311
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Aren't you a little too much

312
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,060
for a dinner with people you see every day?

313
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,710
You're always fussing.

314
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,530
Are you finding fault with my style now?

315
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,990
Don't you care about how your wife wants you to look nice?

316
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,600
It's just that I don't like being pressured.

317
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,630
Are you still expecting to look pretty?

318
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,070
You practically showered with perfume.

319
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,310
 She said she loved you, didn't she? 

320
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,300
 - No way. 
 - Everyone heard her. 

321
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,090
Goodness. That's so nice.

322
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,800
Take a seat, Teacher.

323
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,100
This Peking duck dish tastes so good,

324
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,140
Teacher Cheon.

325
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,170
Please comfortably call me, Seo Jin, when it's just us.

326
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,170
We aren't at school.

327
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,320
When you're such a respected teacher,

328
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,800
how can we dare to address you by name?

329
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,080
If they actually called you by name,

330
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,130
you would be upset that they didn't respect you, wouldn't you?

331
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,060
How would I be?

332
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,270
Please treat me comfortably.

333
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,220
By the way, Dr. Ha, your face is practically shining so that you're glowing.

334
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,330
That can't be. I operate every day so I'm utterly exhausted.

335
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,050
He acts like a crybaby. I heard he only accepts VIP clients.

336
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,300
Even if you have a perfectly fine back,

337
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,900
once you go to his hospital,  you'll get your back broken.

338
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,030
Did you hear that rumor?

339
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,130
Honey, are you drunk?

340
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,600
- Did you hear that? 
 - Yeah.

341
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,840
It was just a joke.

342
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,470
Why does someone like you take that so seriously? Oh, really.

343
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,210
  That's a bit belittling... What are you staring at? 

344
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,010
  Thanks to his in-laws greasing palms for him. 

345
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,860
Your unique sense of humor is hard to find funny. Hmm?

346
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,700
 Loser.  But for his father's law firm, he would be an unemployed bum. 

347
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,300
But, is the Penthouse couple late again?

348
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,490
She must think she owns this place.

349
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,840
If they bought the land and developed it all the way through the apartment sales, then, yes, they are the owners.

350
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,060
Will Su Ryeon come today?

351
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,920
Would she come? She's so busy.

352
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,710
We're a bit late.

353
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,660
Su Ryeon!

354
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,120
Long time no see.

355
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,160
It's been a while.

356
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,940
It's nice to see you again, Su Ryeon.

357
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,560
Long time no see.

358
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,130
Thank you for inviting us.

359
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,920
We started without you. That's fine, right?

360
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,640
We're the ones who are sorry that we came late.

361
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,570
You've all been well, yes?

362
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,000
Let's meet more often! We all live in the same building,

363
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,390
but it's so hard to meet up.

364
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,880
We, as Hera's own club members, are so specially bonded, aren't we?

365
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,650
We met when the kids were in elementary school and started studying vocal music.

366
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,350
It's already been five years!

367
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,680
Exactly.  You should  come out to our art study gatherings

368
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,940
and work out together also to get closer.

369
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,440
That is...

370
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,840
She always wants to go out but I hold her back.

371
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,630
because I want to gaze at her by myself.

372
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,630
So sweet!

373
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,050
A romanticist.

374
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,910
What is this?

375
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,600
What about me?  I'm all alone so what am I going to do?

376
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,710
Is CEO Yu doing well in Dubai?

377
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,700
Of course. The construction industry is doing well.

378
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,790
He's so busy he hasn't been able to visit.

379
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,490
Wow, this looks so good. It must have been a lot of work preparing all this.

380
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,330
Would I have served just anything randomly?

381
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,840
Even though I was a little frazzled...

382
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Truthfully, she didn't do anything with her own hands.

383
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,430
Well, all the food was purchased.

384
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh, dear.

385
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,200
She works outside the home and that she is still so devoted to doing it, is amazing.

386
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,080
She is the best vocal teacher who takes care of our children.

387
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,390
So when I sold the Herapalace apartments, she was the first person I offered one to.

388
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,940
I'm sure it's enjoyable,  Ms. Seo Jin.

389
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,950
Thank you for acknowledging me.

390
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,990
We didn't want to come empty-handed.  It's pecan pie.

391
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,890
Let's eat it together later.

392
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:44,170
Today's concept was coming empty-handed...

393
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:53,080
Look at Teacher Cheon's expression.  She also prepared pecan pie for dessert.

394
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,300
Wow. This...

395
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,600
This looks like the one my mom made.  May I try it now?

396
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,520
Ah, sure.

397
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,760
Me too. Give me a piece.

398
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,300
Amazing. Wow.

399
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,500
In any case, she's talented.

400
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,550
We could even sell this right away.

401
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,610
I can't compare it to the taste of what we bought. Hey.

402
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,520
There's something that goes well with dessert.

403
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,220
Honey!

404
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,440
Get some Bordeaux wine from the wine cellar.

405
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,980
Let's drink something good with dessert.

406
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,400
Hurry up.

407
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,730
Excuse me.

408
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,950
What are you doing? Move.

409
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,370
Is it fun to embarrass your wife in front of people? Does it feel good?

410
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,200
Cut it short. What are you pretending to be? Aren't you tired?

411
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,860
Do you want a wife who is a 'below par' woman?

412
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,360
I'm doing this all for you.

413
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,420
Be honest.

414
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,370
You only think about yourself.

415
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,320
I am also just an accessory to you.

416
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,340
To be a truly supportive wife, you need to be like Su Ryeon.

417
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,350
See how well Chairman Ju's business is doing.

418
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,960
What are you doing?

419
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,390
What's so wonderful about complimenting someone else's woman, do you know?

420
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,810
You...

421
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,570
I couldn't find the bathroom...

422
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,580
Men are all like that.

423
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:27,925
 Us? 

424
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,145
 I'm going to go to the toilet. 

425
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,215
Listen up.

426
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:33,305
My Sang Ah...

427
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,525
Are you okay?

428
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:38,175
Gosh... Why is this here?

429
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,165
- Su Ryeon! 
 - Announcer Go Sang Ah!

430
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:44,375
She was the best announcer in Korea!  The best!

431
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,065
 - I know. 
 -  Everyone liked her. 

432
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,855
 Of course, 

433
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:49,365
she didn't say "jajangmyeon",  
 (Up to 2011, the spelling and pronunciation was controversial) 

434
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,455
she said "jjajangmyeon". 
 ( until the National Language Institute listed 'jjajangmyeon' in its dictionary.) 

435
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:55,735
 Wait. What is this?  Are you her fan? 

436
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:59,355
 Yes, I was a fan.  Of course, I was. 

437
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:21,005
I'll pour you a drink, Chairman Ju.

438
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:31,705
I'll pour one for you, too.

439
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,605
Teacher, are you all right?

440
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,405
Yes, I'm fine.

441
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:03,855
I'll go change.

442
00:36:03,855 --> 00:36:06,565
It's fine.

443
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,685
Could you help me?

444
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:09,405
Honey.

445
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:35,195
Honey.

446
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:17,335
Are you all right?

447
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:19,295
Where have you been, honey?

448
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,265
We need to go home now. Everyone's drunk.

449
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,725
All right.

450
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:39,465
 Hello! 

451
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,295
- Hello. 
 - You're early.

452
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,215
  Hwayeong Middle School. 

453
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:51,375
♫ Of happy youth and happy love!

454
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,345
♫ Of happy, happy love!

455
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:16,935
♫ Of happy youth and happy love

456
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:23,895
I'll use it for another ten minutes.  Then you can practice again.

457
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,065
I am Bae Ro Na.

458
00:39:42,065 --> 00:39:44,415
I sent a sample of my song.

459
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,765
I really want to take a lesson from you.

460
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:49,875
Please grant my request.

461
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:02,595
Hey!  How could you drive like that?

462
00:40:07,465 --> 00:40:08,705
 Tell me you're sorry! 

463
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:11,185
Tell me you did wrong!

464
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:12,575
Did you put some glue on your lips?

465
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:16,875
Even if you use your right to remain silent, it's no use, you know that?

466
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,495
I'm telling you! Say you're sorry!

467
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:23,275
What are you doing now?

468
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:27,605
Damn!  Are you her mother?

469
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:31,565
How brazen you are!  How on earth did you raise your kid?

470
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:37,045
How could she be so wicked as to put some drug in her friend's drink?

471
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:40,395
My daughter has now lost her voice!

472
00:40:40,395 --> 00:40:43,535
How will you take responsibility for the successful future of my kid if it's lost?

473
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:45,965
She is to become a great singer in the future!

474
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,325
Mom, I never did that, it's not true!

475
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,095
Look at her!  Will you keep denying it until the end?

476
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:54,395
We have proof from the CCTV footage.  Will you still deny it?

477
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:56,825
There were only two of you, Je Ni and you, in the practice room for the singing club!

478
00:40:56,825 --> 00:41:01,535
After Je Ni drank the drink from the tumbler, she vomited blood.  All of us here saw it!

479
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,125
You're still wet behind the ears but learned some wicked tricks first!

480
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,835
Seriously, it was not me!

481
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,465
This is surely Yu Je Ni's  own self-fabricated act!

482
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:13,735
Since she's not confident competing in the contest, she's putting on a show to frame me!

483
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:16,065
See?  This is...

484
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:18,675
Teacher, you told her too,

485
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:22,155
that she ruined her voice after she sang at the karaoke.

486
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:26,975
Come on, please tell them, Teacher!  You clearly told her so!

487
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:31,055
Are you crazy?  How dare you slander a sick kid?

488
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:36,355
You should go to jail for that! I'm going to report you to the Office of Education!

489
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:41,775
My daughter said it was not her.

490
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:44,165
You don't even have any solid proof!

491
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:47,185
Why don't you believe my daughter's words like you believe hers?

492
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,615
I told you, we have proof on the CCTV...

493
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:54,875
Sure, that CCTV!  Did it catch my daughter putting a drug in that tumbler?

494
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:58,535
It didn't, did it?

495
00:41:58,535 --> 00:42:02,805
Until it's proven clearly, please don't treat my daughter as some assailant, Mr. Principal.

496
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:06,095
What did you just say?  How stubborn...

497
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:11,865
If my daughter's voice is ruined, I won't ever leave your daughter alone!

498
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:16,195
Be prepared, I'm going to immediately convene the Committee Against School Violence and get her a compulsory transfer.

499
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:20,185
C-Compulsory transfer?

500
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:22,215
Hey, Yu Je Ni! Tell them now!

501
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:25,925
I know you're lying! You can speak up now!

502
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:27,635
- Tell them now! 
 - Let go of her!

503
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:31,495
Hey!  You, get out of my way!

504
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:34,275
 Today is your last day, I'm going to kill you. 

505
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:37,305
This little thing... how dare you

506
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,615
lay your hand on my princess!

507
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:43,905
 I heard she locked Cheon Seo Jin in and beat her up 

508
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:48,345
 while trying to take Seo Jin's trophy away. Apparently she cut her own neck.  

509
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:51,715
 How pitiful she is.  So she won't be able to sing any longer. 

510
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:55,975
 She has been in the top rank for the past three years, but suddenly she fell to rock bottom.  

511
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:57,685
 So, is her chance to get into the university gone too? 
   

512
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:00,075
   

513
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:13,415
 The disciplinary action has been processed. 

514
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:15,825
 Thank you, Dad. 

515
00:43:24,575 --> 00:43:27,055
 - Stand up! I know  you can stand up! 
  - What are you doing? 

516
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:28,395
 - Stand up!! 
 - Let go! 

517
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:29,835
 I know you're lying! 

518
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:30,885
 Let go of me! 

519
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,215
 Stand up! 

520
00:43:32,215 --> 00:43:34,475
 Don't! 

521
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:36,715
 Tell them you're faking it! 

522
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,705
 Mom! 

523
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:42,145
 - Are you hurt? 
 - Hey! 

524
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:44,205
 You were trying to hurt my Seo Jin again, weren't you? 

525
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,215
 What a crazy girl! 

526
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:49,945
 How dare you covet my daughter's place? 

527
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:53,505
 How could you act up like that in front of adults? 

528
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,145
 A girl like her needs expulsion, instead of a suspension! 

529
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:59,535
 - Principal, do your work right! 
 - Yes, sir. 

530
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:05,305
Order your coffin!  You're dead meat!

531
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:07,125
Please calm down, ma'am. Please calm down!

532
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,705
Stop!

533
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:34,845
I'm sorry.

534
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:37,345
Mom...

535
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:41,635
Trying to earn a few pennies more,

536
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:46,325
I was away from home all the time, so I couldn't take good care of my kid.

537
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:51,855
I'll make sure to teach and scold her, so please let this pass without the Committee Against School Violence (meeting).

538
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,955
I beg you.

539
00:44:54,955 --> 00:44:57,275
What are you doing?  Stand up right now!

540
00:44:57,275 --> 00:44:59,455
You should kneel down too!  Apologize to your friend!

541
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:03,885
Apologize for what?  I didn't do anything wrong!

542
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:06,765
I'll never lose to such a cowardly bitch like her!

543
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:08,895
T-T-That damnable bitch!

544
00:45:08,895 --> 00:45:10,335
Ro Na!  Ro Na!

545
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,845
Where are you running to?

546
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:15,235
You two, I'm going to see the end of you two!

547
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:20,985
Be prepared, as I will make sure you never get to sing again!

548
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,145
Understand me?

549
00:45:24,215 --> 00:45:25,215
 Wisely and Beautifully 

550
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:29,075
Ro Na, how could you leave like that?  We need to solve this issue.

551
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:32,495
Once the committee meets, we can never win against them.

552
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:34,745
No matter whether you're guilty or not, your life will be over!

553
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:37,015
Why should I beg for their forgiveness when I'm not guilty?

554
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:40,015
How could you make your daughter do such a thing?

555
00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:44,025
So, who told you to join the singing club?  I told you not to sing!

556
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:46,835
Promise them that you will never sing again!

557
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:50,875
Then, they will not make this issue go any further.

558
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:56,905
Mom, you're worse than my dead dad.

559
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:58,105
What...

560
00:45:58,105 --> 00:46:01,365
Dad at least liked my singing.

561
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:04,535
If it were Dad, he would've definitely taken my side.

562
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:07,195
I really hate you, Mom!

563
00:46:07,195 --> 00:46:09,655
Ro Na... Ro Na!

564
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:13,035
Ro Na!  Ro Na...

565
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,785
Ro Na...

566
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:24,375
Ro Na...

567
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:42,485
Here is your tea, ma'am.

568
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,365
This is yours, Je Ni.

569
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:47,925
Do you think I've treated you and the teachers on every occasion,

570
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:51,765
to see to this kind of thing?

571
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:55,215
Do you know how much I spent buying that piano for the singing club?

572
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:56,675
I know, sure...

573
00:46:56,675 --> 00:47:01,185
On my honour as the principal, I'll make sure to give her a strict punishment at the CASV (Committee Against School Violence).

574
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,325
Schedule a date for the CASV!

575
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:05,075
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,365
 Don't ever settle it! 

577
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:15,275
 Make her get the compulsory transfer for sure!  Make her disappear in front of my eyes! 

578
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,975
Just talk.

579
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:22,515
I know well that your voice is fine, so just say it out loud.

580
00:47:22,515 --> 00:47:24,495
Oh my, how did you know, Mom?

581
00:47:24,495 --> 00:47:27,625
If you're going to put on an act, you should do it properly.

582
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:31,835
Earlier, when that Bae Ro Na or whatever was arguing with the teacher, you said, "Crazy..."

583
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:34,075
I heard it all, girl.

584
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:36,615
Really? You think she heard it too?

585
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:40,945
If your mom hadn't shouted on purpose, you would've been caught right away.

586
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:44,635
What about the vomiting blood earlier?

587
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:47,905
It was red-colored paint, of course.

588
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:50,515
So what, will you forgive her because of that?

589
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:53,615
How could I forgive her when she's up against my daughter?

590
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:56,565
Don't worry, I will make sure she'll never sing again.

591
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:59,035
Don't you see he's scheduling a date for the CASV?

592
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:00,625
You mean it, right?

593
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,685
If I can't get in Cheong Ah Arts School this time, I'm going to die.

594
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:08,365
I told you, I will arrange all the tutors, from big shot to small,

595
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:10,795
and let you have all the lessons.

596
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:13,975
You know how well your dad is earning money in Dubai, right?

597
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:17,315
He told me that I should support everything our princess wants to do.

598
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:20,455
Dad is not even visiting me, but just always sending words only.

599
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:23,235
Anyway, I'll go to the same high school Min Hyeok goes to this time.

600
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:28,135
Don't bother yourself with that kind of punk, think about how to get along with the other kids.

601
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:32,175
Teacher Cheon will make the elite group with a select few and manage it with her full attention.

602
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,905
All of them are attending Cheong Ah Arts Middle School, except for me.

603
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:37,425
Eun Byeol, that girl, is subtly excluding me.

604
00:48:37,425 --> 00:48:41,945
You don't need Eun Byeol. Just focus on catching hold of Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong,

605
00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:46,085
since those twins are the line to true gold.

606
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:58,445
 Ju Seok Hun. 

607
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:15,295
- Teacher! 
 - Yes?

608
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:18,845
I made a mistake.  Please give me a new OMR card. 
  ( OMR - Optical Mark Reader) 

609
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:34,075
   

610
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:43,495
   

611
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:46,845
   

612
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:55,225
Hello, I'm here for an interview for the position in the Mathematics Department.

613
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,710
Anna Lee, correct?

614
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,640
Yes, you can just comfortably call me Anna.

615
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,710
You're majoring in mathematics at UCLA, but currently on a leave of absence?

616
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:22,520
There was a family issue, so I took a leave of absence after completing my first year.

617
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,410
This is the Certificate of Registration.

618
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,520
I have a degree from their graduate school.

619
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,620
The school is so beautiful, especially in autumn.  Right?

620
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,010
Well...

621
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,240
I guess all four seasons at my school are beautiful.

622
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,370
I especially like the front of the law school, because it's got all those fallen leaves.

623
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:56,180
 (in French) What was the name of that famous bakery shop in front of the school? 

624
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,450
 I really liked their Funnel cake.  

625
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,970
Full Sweets.

626
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,640
Ah... Full Sweets.

627
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,190
I bet you had the Caramel Apple flavor.

628
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,950
The line up there is always long, so it's hard to get any after 10 AM, you know.

629
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,080
This is the Apple necklace sold at that shop.   Do you remember?

630
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,240
I do remember.

631
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,030
I'm craving it now. It has been so long...

632
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:32,650
Now, shall I listen to the curriculum you've prepared...  Teacher Anna?

633
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:37,200
I'm Anna Lee, I'll be in charge of your mathematics lesson. Nice to meet you.

634
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,150
Why did you tell us to gather suddenly?  It's examination week now, so no tutoring sessions are scheduled.

635
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,210
Since you're here, I'd like to test your levels.

636
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,840
How funny.

637
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,710
Just because you're available now, you order us to come and go at whatever time or day as you please?

638
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,460
It will take only 10 minutes.  You can give me that much at least, no?

639
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,300
Sit down.

640
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,660
No, I can't give you even one minute.

641
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,160
All you need to do is just teach us as much as you're paid for.  Who do you think you are to test our levels?

642
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,890
We don't do such things!

643
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,920
So I hope you're not wasting your time... for no reason.

644
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,160
This clothing of yours is a knock-off, isn't it?

645
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,310
What's this, a blowfly?

646
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,950
If you came here to teach kids, please live truthfully, befitting your role as a teacher.

647
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,100
Oppa, aren't you leaving?

648
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:07,010
Since that clothing was a limited edition, there were only three pieces sold in Korea.

649
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:12,430
Anyway, what will you do, Teach?  I think you were rejected on your first day.

650
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,560
This class doesn't feel attractive to me at all.

651
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,570
Then, Teach, good luck.

652
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,870
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong are the top-ranked students at our school.

653
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,860
In this place, their words are the same as law.

654
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,670
Aren't you leaving with them?

655
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,980
I like you, Teach.

656
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,920
What?

657
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,950
Did you see Seok Gyeong's face?  When you said to sit down, she was momentarily taken aback.

658
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,810
I'll take your level test.  I'm Ha Eun Byeol.

659
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,910
 Are you going to the penthouse meeting tonight? 

660
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:55,910
 I don't know why Chairman Ju is trying to show off by inviting women? 

661
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,410
 He's annoying whatever he does. 

662
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,440
We have successfully wrapped up this building as well.

663
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,530
It was all thanks to you both.

664
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,050
May Hera Club flourish!

665
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,620
Bravo!

666
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,740
You sure like money, Lawyer Lee. Considering you're the only son of a rich family.

667
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,150
I can't compare to you, Dr. Ha.

668
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,700
Usually, it's those who grew up poor who are greedier for money.

669
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,890
What did you just say? You want to go outside?

670
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,960
What did I say?

671
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,790
Why are you two acting like this on such a good day?

672
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,540
It's nothing.

673
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,550
Anyway, when do we get a new deal, Chairman Ju?

674
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,130
We can start right away.

675
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,740
Is that...

676
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,300
Approximately 150 meters away from the building you just saw, a subway station will be constructed in three years.

677
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,750
If we knock that building down, build a mall,

678
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,050
and build the mall with an 800% floor area ratio,

679
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:05,110
I guarantee a 250% return on your investment.

680
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,730
Deal!

681
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,040
Oh my goodness!

682
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,600
The view from this penthouse really is amazing!

683
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,820
You can see the entire Han River!

684
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,460
The interior design also looks so artistic.

685
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,180
You're really different since he's from an arts university.

686
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,340
You must paint too?

687
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,540
Occasionally.

688
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,480
- Your house is like an art gallery! 
 - Exactly.

689
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,920
How could this be?

690
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,880
But, where are the kids?

691
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
They went to study in the community room.

692
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,140
Did Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong do well on their exams today?

693
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,900
I'll bet the twins will have the highest scores this time as well.

694
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,910
We'll only know once the results are out.

695
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,980
Teacher Cheon, you look like a whole other person!

696
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,470
Was your neckline always that beautiful?

697
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,130
I thought I'd change things up a bit.

698
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,260
- What do you think? 
- It suits you very well.

699
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,770
The dress is very pretty, too.

700
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:16,530
It's been so long since I was in this penthouse.  Only the men have been invited.

701
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:21,130
Please invite us, women, more often in the future.

702
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,100
Of course, please come by often.

703
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,870
Now, let's have a toast to the penthouse.

704
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,310
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

705
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,410
 What is this? 

706
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,270
- Isn't this caviar? 
 - Huh? Wow.  Oh my gosh!

707
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,140
Su Ryeon made this?

708
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,990
 We can eat this with a spoon. 

709
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,160
 Let's try it. 

710
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,120
 How can she make this kind of stuff at home? 

711
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,900
I think it's only a temporary shock.

712
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,110
I have Chief Yun on standby. Don't worry about us and hurry.

713
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,410
Thanks, honey. I'll call you.

714
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,300
Su Ryeon! Where are you going?

715
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,020
What?

716
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,540
Chairman Ju, you know how much I love you, right?

717
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,340
Let's go and have the rest of a drink.

718
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,020
Shall I carry you on my shoulders?

719
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,120
I'm fine.

720
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,660
It's an emergency! The patient's vitals are dropping.

721
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,010
Give her an Ambu bag!  Ambu bag!

722
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,940
Bring her up to normal.

723
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,820
Increase her oxygen.

724
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,450
Hye In, Mommy's here.

725
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,870
You have to make it.

726
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,310
   

727
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:32,440
   

728
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,930
Come on.  Get in!

729
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,660
Are you insane?

730
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,610
What do you expect me to do here?

731
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,900
Is there a reason we shouldn't be doing this?

732
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,150
Anyway, we can see them, but they can't see us.

733
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,020
I thought you would like this.

734
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,150
Ju Dan Te...

735
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,120
Is this who you really are?

736
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:34,540
I don't think... I can stop myself anymore.

737
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:58,950
Oh, dear!  I shouldn't have drunk that last glass.

738
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,090
I'm so drunk.

739
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,740
 Look at me. 

740
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,200
- Honey! 
 - My head!

741
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,670
- Hurry!  Hurry, come here! 
 - I'm bleeding!

742
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,260
 Bleeding!  Blood! 

743
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,210
What happened? Did you get hurt?

744
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,590
 It hurts! 

745
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,730
 Honey! 

746
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,470
 Honey, honey! 

747
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,110
 I'm bleeding! 

748
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,710
Ro Na!

749
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,810
Ro Na! Ro Na!

750
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,020
You know the Committee Against School Violence meeting is today, right?

751
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:04,610
Later, you have to tell Je Ni's parents that you'll give up on classical singing. Okay?

752
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,740
Or you'll be forced to transfer immediately.

753
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:10,490
I got it already. How many times are you going to tell me?

754
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,590
Later, you really have to answer properly!

755
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:17,960
I'll see you at school at three! I'll call you!

756
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,040
 Your call cannot be connected... 

757
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,190
Why isn't she picking up? This is driving me crazy.

758
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:34,850
Bae Ro Na, Bae Ro Na, Bae Ro Na...

759
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,330
Where's Ro Na? Is she still in the classroom?

760
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,580
Ro Na said she had to leave early for her training in classical singing lessons.

761
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,190
She left!

762
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:46,550
She doesn't have any lessons. Do you know where it is?

763
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,880
 Herapalace 

764
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,270
Hello, Teacher. I'm Bae Ro Na, the person who called you.

765
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,290
Bae Ro Na?

766
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,880
I'm your fan.

767
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,720
I watched every single one of your performances.

768
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,010
And I've listened to my favorite ones more than a hundred times.

769
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,580
I really want to receive lessons from you.

770
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,070
   

771
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,510
I really want to be your student.

772
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:27,040
Oh, dear. I'm already filled up with students so I can't take any more on.

773
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,970
I only called you here because you kept calling for lessons so many times.

774
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,750
I'm good at singing.

775
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,530
If I receive lessons from you, I can be even better.

776
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:37,870
I will be the best.

777
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:40,140
You can't succeed in classical singing just through passion.

778
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,500
You have to be naturally gifted with voice tone and your own voice color.

779
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:46,520
I really can't give up! I put my life on the line here.

780
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,610
Can you please reconsider just once? Please?

781
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:55,760
Why are you here alone? Where are your parents?

782
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,140
To be honest, my mom is against me doing classical music.

783
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,850
She's against it? Then I'm definitely not giving you lessons.

784
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,940
Parents' support is crucial for classical singing.

785
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,660
If you really want to sing, convince your parents first.

786
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,120
You should go now.

787
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,860
Go home already!

788
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,770
   

789
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:31,510
You said... your name was Bae Ro Na?

790
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,510
Who is your mother?

791
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,400
 Bae Ro Na! Where is she? 

792
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,860
Bae Ro Na, gosh!

793
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,750
Do you want to see me die?

794
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,770
How can you be here?

795
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,390
Why don't you listen to me?

796
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:48,030
If the Committee Against School Violence finds you guilty, your life will be over!

797
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,780
- Come here, let's go already! 
 - Oh Yun Hui?

798
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:07,140
Is it really you? Oh Yun Hui?

799
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,190
Let's go.

800
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:12,670
Mom, you know Teacher Cheon? How do you know her?

801
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,800
I don't know her! Let's go!

802
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:20,510
I thought there was something odd about her. I knew that voice was familiar.

803
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:25,680
To think, she was the great Oh Yun Hui's daughter.

804
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,600
I don't know you.

805
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,790
I mean, I forgot you. So let's not get intertwined again.

806
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,580
Let's go.

807
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,470
Do you know my mom, Teacher Cheon?

808
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,850
Of course I do. She's my old classmate from Cheong Ah Arts School.

809
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,930
Cheong Ah Arts school?

810
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,030
Mom, you went to Cheong Ah Arts? Why didn't you tell me?

811
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,050
Then why are you so against me singing?

812
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:49,240
Let's talk at home! Come on!

813
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,270
Well, it is an embarrassing past, so it's better your daughter doesn't know.

814
01:06:54,270 --> 01:07:00,150
Just how greedy humans can be... You were punished after trying to grab too much.

815
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,450
Looking at you now, you must still be receiving punishment.

816
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,750
Am I wrong?

817
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,080
Shut up! How can you say that?

818
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,860
As if you don't know who ruined my life.

819
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,500
Are you saying it was because of me?

820
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,790
You haven't changed at all.

821
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,730
Still blaming others.

822
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:29,080
You ran away because your ability was lacking, but now you're still blaming me?

823
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,080
Let's go home now!

824
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,580
Come with me!

825
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,690
I don't want to! Let go!

826
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:39,280
I'm going to sing.  I'll get a lesson from Teacher Cheon Seo Jin, no matter what!

827
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,980
Mom, who are you that you're so against me!

828
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,620
Right, take your daughter with you.

829
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:50,110
It's better not to start at all, rather than ending up like you.

830
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,410
 The highlight of the 25th Cheong Ah Arts Festival. 

831
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:06,220
 The Grand Prize which will be awarded to the best voice given by heaven. 

832
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,460
 The honorable Bella Voce Award goes to... 

833
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,070
 Cheong Ah Arts School's Senior,  

834
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:15,110
 Cheon Seo Jin 

835
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,650
 Thank you. 

836
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,770
 Hey, what's wrong with you, Oh Yun Hui? 

837
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,580
 Come!  Hurry up! 

838
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,610
 Really? 

839
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,550
 What?  The Grand Prize?  

840
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,450
 Your voice tone was unstable and even had off-key moments, so you don't deserve the Grand Prize! 

841
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,380
 Don't you have any conscience?  Give me that trophy right now. 

842
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,540
 Did you think it was a given that you'd win the first prize? 

843
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,540
 This is mine.  The Grand Prize of Cheong Ah Arts Festival.  

844
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,930
 I don't need anything else but this trophy, a free pass to the Seoul University School of Music.   

845
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:10,150
 Do you think people won't know that this is your father's work? 

846
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:13,600
 The corrupt Chairman of this school's Foundation gives the Grand Prize to his own daughter whose ability doesn't deserve it! 

847
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,340
 I'm going to tell people all about that! 

848
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,620
 Tell it, as if someone would listen to what you're saying. 

849
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,060
 The world listens only to the voices of people with power.  

850
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,180
 Who would care about a 'have-not' like you? 

851
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,230
 If you're that confident, then go ahead.  

852
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:28,900
 - Give me that! 
 - Let go! 

853
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,930
 That trophy is mine! 

854
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,420
 Give me that! 

855
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,690
 Give it to me! 

856
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,700
 Give it up! 

857
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,340
 No! 

858
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,310
 I'll never let you take this trophy away from me. 

859
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:27,230
 All the humiliation I had to suffer because of you!  This is the payback.  

860
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,050
 See?  The top of Cheong Ah Arts School is me! 

861
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:33,110
 Such a poor girl like you dares to study music? You should've known your place! 

862
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,090
 What a pitiful bitch. 

863
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,270
 What? 

864
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,270
 I said, you are pitiful. 

865
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,270
 Until when will you sing while clutching your daddy's leg? 

866
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:46,140
 How dare you say such things. 

867
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,280
 How dare you! 

868
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,430
 At any time in the past three years, have you ever beat me with your singing skill.  

869
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,280
 No wonder how much pissed off you must have been.  

870
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,310
 That's why you used your daddy's power to manipulate the judges, isn't it? 

871
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,440
 Fine! 

872
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,500
 I'll let you take first prize if you're that desperate.  

873
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:14,190
 Even if your wish is to win it for life, I'll give you a mere Grand Prize.  

874
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,930
 Seo Jin!  Are you alright? 

875
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,850
 It's Dad!  Seo Jin! 

876
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,890
 Open the door! 

877
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:25,010
 - Come on, hurry up! 
 - Open the door! 

878
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:31,070
 But you know what? You will never win against me, even if you're born again.  

879
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:35,790
 Fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.  

880
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:42,290
 Thieving! Thieving... bitch! 

881
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:44,530
 Oh Yun Hui... 

882
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:50,280
 If you say one more word, I'll kill you.  

883
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,030
 Why? Are you embarrassed? 

884
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:57,480
 Then, it's still not late to give up that trophy! 

885
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,820
 If you still have any last bit of your pride left! 

886
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,590
 Seo Jin! Seo Jin! 

887
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,380
 Hurry up! 

888
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,880
 Open it! 

889
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,140
 - Seo Jin! 
 - Seo Jin! 

890
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,270
 Seo Jin! 

891
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:02,860
 Oh my god, Seo Jin! 

892
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,220
 Seo Jin! 

893
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,860
 - Seo Jin! 
 - Hurry up! Move her! 

894
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,390
 Let's go, quickly! 

895
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,980
 Careful! 

896
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,820
 Seo Jin! Run! 

897
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,420
 Run! Hurry! 

898
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,320
 Oh my... 

899
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:37,910
I'm sorry, ma'am. She pushed through us stubbornly.

900
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,320
Ajumma, you should leave.

901
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,640
Please hurry up, as my next lesson is about to start.

902
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,110
Let go of her!

903
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,150
Please let go! Seriously!

904
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,990
I said, let go of her!

905
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:59,530
Oh Yun Hui, she is your daughter.

906
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,450
How creepy that her voice is so similar to her mother's.

907
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,780
   

908
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,590
   

909
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:12,810
As the mother of the victim,

910
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:20,060
I can never forgive this horrible terrorizing action made in our sacred school.

911
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:26,690
Does it even make sense that the school is nurturing criminals instead of talents?

912
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:33,480
I want the school to punish that student severely, who is still shamelessly denying her action!

913
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:38,850
Hey, a kid like you grows up to become a social evil which will gnaw at this country!

914
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,370
You're a little kid but so fearless to poison a drink!

915
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:45,530
You have no future, none!

916
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:51,590
My daughter is suffering nightmares every night.

917
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,840
No matter what, she must get a compulsory transfer!

918
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,120
I can never let my daughter study with her assailant in the same school!

919
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:09,830
Gosh, you... after you ruined another person,

920
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,040
let's see if you can pass the entrance exam to any arts school.

921
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,970
I'll definitely nip a kid like you in the bud!

922
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,330
Trash!

923
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:18,460
 What on earth did she learn from her mother? 

924
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,360
 If she's lacking in skill, then she should've had a good personality!  

925
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,890
 How could you do that? 

926
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,060
 That's right, everyone! 

927
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,810
 Come on, anyway, you can't come to this school! 

928
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:32,410
 Need to expel her! 

929
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,550
 You can't stay! 

930
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,970
 Say something if you can! 

931
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:48,240
 Tell me honestly! You were trying to hurt my Seo Jin again, weren't you?! 

932
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:54,740
 This little kid learned nothing but wicked things.  A girl like you needs expulsion, instead of a suspension! 

933
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,190
Shut Up!

934
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,620
What are you doing?

935
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:53,810
The real violence is being done by you all!

936
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,000
You all are using such irresponsible words

937
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,290
to trample on one child's life!

938
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:06,100
My Ro Na... will never transfer to another school.

939
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,340
No, she cannot!

940
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,060
She will get her graduation diploma,

941
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:16,550
no matter what!  You, trash-like people!

942
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,850
 What did you just say? 

943
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,130
 What the heck? 

944
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,700
 Hey! How dare you! 

945
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,120
Let's go, Ro Na.

946
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,650
What's this for?

947
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:43,090
Bae Ro Na... Sing.

948
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,520
I'm telling you to study classical singing.  Go to Cheong Ah Arts School.

949
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,780
I will make sure you go to Cheong Ah Arts School no matter what.

950
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:02,800
Cheon Seo Jin,

951
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,170
I'm not going to run away anymore.

952
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,970
Get out of my room immediately.

953
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,750
You will never win against me, even if you're born again.

954
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,780
Fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.

955
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,090
Thieving, thieving bitch.

956
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:43,780


957
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:53,570
   

958
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,940
 Who is the top of the freshmen at Cheong Ah Arts School? 

959
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,600
 I, your mom, did my best to make you the best.  

960
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,750
 By chance, will you let me teach Ro Na? 

961
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,880
 Realize the dream, which your mom couldn't realize. 

962
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,820
 This law is at the very top of everything, you know? 

963
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,600
 I'm worried that our innocent kids might be affected.  

964
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,050
 I want a simple relationship. 

965
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,410
 I think our rule was made just now.  

966
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:17,380
 I'm going to do everything I need to do for my daughter.
