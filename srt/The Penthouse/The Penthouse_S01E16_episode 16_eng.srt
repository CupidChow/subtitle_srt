1
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,890
Dad!  Father!

2
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,240
Father! Father!

3
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,980
Father!

4
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,300
Seo Jin.

5
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,980
Seo Jin!

6
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,550
How could you?

7
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,110
Seo Jin.

8
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,670
Seo Jin.

9
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,590
 Deleting CCTV Footage 
 Files can never be restored after being deleted. 

10
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,850
  SOME 
  DISCOVERED 
 GETTING LOST 

11
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,310
 Certificate of Appointment 
 Appointee:  Cheon Seo Yeong 

12
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,360
  Cheon Seo Yeong is appointed Chairperson of the Cheong Ah Arts Foundation 
 Signed: Cheon Myeong Su 

13
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,450
You should not have done that to me.

14
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,500
Father abandoned me first.

15
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,980
Are you all right?

16
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,300
I just got a call from Driver Kang that the Chairman fell.

17
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,100
You were with me today, and after that, you were in the lesson room.

18
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,240
What?

19
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,150
Keep your wits about you!  Will you fall apart?

20
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,710
I can't!

21
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,600
I will never do that.

22
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,210
Leave.  I'll take care of the rest.

23
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,450
I've never been here.

24
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,850
I never met my father.

25
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,990
 Seo Jin, are you okay? 

26
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,860
 It's Dad.  Seo Jin! Open the door! 

27
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,980
 - Get something to open it. 
 - Open up! 

28
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,710
Open the door.

29
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,610
 What's happened? Seo Jin! 

30
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,490
 - Put her on my back. Take her to hospital. 

31
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,830
 Go.  Hurry. 

32
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,420
  The CT scan shows no signs of any trauma, Chairman. 

33
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,670
 But her body was covered in blood. 

34
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,590
 I think she got her opponent's blood on her during the scuffle. 

35
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,440
 We've done a thorough examination, so you can relax, Chairman. 

36
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,510
 Nevertheless,  you will create an appropriate medical certificate, won't you? 

37
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,520
 I will, Chairman. 

38
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,630
 Will you stop acting and get up now? 

39
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
 Did you do that? It seemed Oh Yun Hui's throat was bleeding a lot. 

40
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,160
 I am sorry, Father. 

41
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,390
 But I couldn't bear it. 

42
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,130
 Oh Yun Hui even insulted you— 

43
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,370
  - Father. 
 - Do you know why I hit you? 

44
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,090
 It's not because you injured an insignificant girl like her. 

45
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,420
 It's because you are guilty of allowing an insignificant girl to beat you. 

46
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,840
  Why did you lose? You are the daughter of Cheong Ah Foundation's chairman. 

47
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,850
 But why could you only win the grand prize after you fell behind that pitiful fatherless girl 

48
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,830
 and I humbled myself to the judges to look favorably upon you, 

49
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,410
 Is that all my daughter can do? 

50
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,770
 I am sorry, Father. I was wrong. 

51
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,380
 I hope this doesn't happen again. 

52
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,570
 You must be the best. 

53
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,010
 Or else you don't deserve Cheong Ah Foundation. 

54
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,690
 Yes, sir. I will be the best. 

55
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,170
Father, you made me like this.

56
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,340
So don't feel wronged, Father.

57
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,280
You did it ...

58
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,480
for me and left.

59
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,800
Hello.

60
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,410
Yes, it's me, Seo Yeong.

61
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,170
It's me.

62
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,830
No, Dad.

63
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,230
Doctor, it can't be!

64
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,470
No, Doctor! It can't be.

65
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,090
No.

66
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,380
No, Father!

67
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,440
No, Doctor.

68
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
- Dad! 
 - You have to wake up!

69
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,770
No.

70
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,690
No, Honey!

71
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,830
- Dad! 
 - Honey!

72
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,760
Eun Byeol's mom.

73
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,730
Unni!

74
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,470
- Seo Jin. Seo Jin, Seo Jin. 
 - Unni!

75
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,010
- How did this happen? 
 - Dad, Dad.

76
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,400
I believe he had a heart attack and fell down the stairs.

77
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,730
Driver Kang discovered him and brought him to the hospital.

78
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,530
He was dead on arrival.

79
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,350
Your father ...

80
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,680
 You dare to spit in my face? 

81
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,970
 As if getting a divorce was not enough, you have an affair? 

82
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,900
 How dare you desire Cheong Ah Foundation when you've disgraced our family? 

83
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,050
 From now on you're removed from a director position at Cheong Ah Foundation. And quit Cheong Ah Arts School too. 

84
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,850
 I'll take back all your inheritance that I'm planning. 

85
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,480
No. No!

86
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,100
  Cheong Ah is now Seo Yeong's.   You're not my daughter anymore. 

87
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,830
No. No! No!

88
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,310
- Eun Byeol's mom, calm down. 
 - It's a lie!  It can't be true.

89
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,860
Why is my father dead?

90
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,700
 Seo Jin. 

91
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,830
No! No!

92
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,600
Seo Jin!

93
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,620
- Get a stretcher! 
 - Dad!

94
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,800
Hurry!

95
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,870
- Eun Byeol's Mom. 
 - Unni.

96
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,990
- Eun Byeol's Mom. 
 - Unni. Unni. Wake up.

97
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,020
I'm all right.

98
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,060
Mom, your face doesn't look good.

99
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,870
I'm afraid you will faint again.

100
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm fine.

101
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,760
Are you really okay?

102
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,190
You've suffered a lot.

103
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,950
You barely slept for three days.

104
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,410
I'll rest.

105
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,470
Ahjumeoni, please make some abalone porridge.

106
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,120
She hasn't been able to eat for a few days.

107
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,070
Yes, Doctor.

108
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,450
How sorry I felt for her.

109
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,070
Teacher Cheon, whom I thought wouldn't even bleed a drop if you poked her with a needle,

110
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,340
fainted in front of her father's funeral portrait.

111
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,680
I was heartbroken when I saw her fainting.  How many times did she pass out at the funeral?

112
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,340
I'll say.  I was surprised to see her sitting on the mat with an IV drip.

113
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,900
She was as dead as a corpse.

114
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,720
He lost his footing, of all times, when there wasn't any of his retinue.

115
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,540
If he had been discovered just a tiny bit sooner, he could have survived.

116
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,080
They say his heart was in a poor condition.

117
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,240
He was someone who enjoyed all of his wealth and fame while taking the best care of his health.

118
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,320
On that morning, who would have believed he would die on the street in the rain?

119
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,450
By the way, the position of chairman is now vacant,

120
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,200
who will be the next chairperson?

121
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,630
Ayy.  Naturally it is Seo Jin. It was announced before he died.

122
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,050
Now Teacher Cheon will be the Sun King of Cheong Ah.

123
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,930
She will have absolute power.

124
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,300
How can Dr. Ha's fate be so awful?

125
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,410
How did this happen? As soon as he is divorced,  his wife is elevated.

126
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,670
Is the divorce official?

127
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,890
Have they already split?

128
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,350
Don't spread the rumor. Because of Eun Byeol, they are keeping it hush-hush.

129
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,220
They are afraid she might be hurt.

130
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,330
What bullsh**! Would Eun Byeol be someone who gets hurt?

131
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,600
At her grandfather's funeral, didn't you see her sitting on the floor solving problems?

132
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,940
She's more vicious than her own mother.

133
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,780
Why is she studying so hard?

134
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,540
Once her mother becomes Chairwoman, if she just twists her mechanical pencil,

135
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,240
her mom will make her be ranked first in her class. She's a sweet kid.

136
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,320
What do you mean when you say it's because of you?

137
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,100
I told the Chairman about Cheon Seo Jin's affair.

138
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,340
That night, his accident occurred.

139
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,810
Don't you think the shock caused his heart attack? Or didn't it?

140
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,620
How did he react when you told him?

141
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,980
He criticized me a lot.  He said I was vulgar and rude.

142
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,980
That's strange.  According to rumors,

143
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,780
he valued his reputation and face more than anyone.

144
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,710
If he knew about her divorce and affair,

145
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,740
he would never let Cheon Seo Jin get away with that.

146
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,280
Unni, are you suspicious of Cheon Seo Jin right now?

147
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,180
After the chairman died, someone who gets the most benefits is Cheon Seo Jin.

148
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,620
She can bury her embarrassing personal matter and take over the chairperson position as well.

149
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,640
Cheong Ah Arts School's CCTV was out of order two days ago.

150
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,060
It's so tricky for saying that it was coincidental.

151
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,460
I'll look into it more.

152
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,810
  :  Would you look for the security guard  

153
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,240
 who worked on the day of Cheong Ah Arts' Chairman's death? 

154
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,800
 This matter is related to Cheon Seo Jin. 

155
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,490
 I'll look for it as soon as I go to work.  

156
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,290
Aigoo, hello.  How are you?

157
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,440
Have this drink and relax a little while working.

158
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,720
- Aigoo, thank you, Teacher. 
 - Sure, sure.

159
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,210
By the way, I haven't seen Mr. Choi for a few days.

160
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,290
He was on duty on the day of the chairman's passing away.

161
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
Did he get shocked?

162
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
- He quit. 
 - Pardon?  Why did he?

163
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,660
He said he would take some maintenance manager's position somewhere with a high paying salary.

164
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,860
Is that so?  Where is the place?

165
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,350
I don't know.

166
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,840
It's like he won the lottery.  He even changed his phone number.

167
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,070
Really?

168
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,100
Anyway, good for him.

169
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,410
Aigoo. It's already so late. I need to go now.

170
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,270
- I will enjoy the food. 
 - Yes, yes. Work hard.

171
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,850
Yes.

172
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,870
"He even changed his phone number."

173
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,940
Are you certain it's been settled?

174
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,130
Lawyer Park's mouth is firmly shut.

175
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,800
Did you meet with the security guard who was on duty that night?

176
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,940
To make sure that something silly doesn't come out of his mouth.

177
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,210
He's already been transferred to another job at a different location.

178
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,030
I'll take care of it without any repercussions.

179
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,060
Thank you for your help.

180
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
I will definitely reward you, Secretary Do.

181
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,960
What is it? Why are you here?

182
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,550
I was concerned about you.

183
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,480
Are you okay?

184
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm fine so you can leave.

185
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,570
Don't go into my room anymore without a good reason.

186
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,170
Sure.

187
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,340
You ate all the porridge.

188
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,080
I guess you were hungry.

189
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,430
I had no choice if I want to regain my energy

190
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,030
You.

191
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,900
What happened to this?

192
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,120
Did you get hurt somewhere?

193
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I fell down by accident.  It's not a big deal.

194
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,000
That night, where were you?

195
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,070
When your father died?

196
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,920
I was practicing in the lesson room. With Secretary Do.

197
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,490
Is there something you're curious about?

198
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,900
No.  Nothing. Relax.

199
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,770
 Did you meet with the security guard who was on duty that night? 

200
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,700
 To make sure that something silly doesn't come out of his mouth. 

201
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,260
 No way.  It can't be. 

202
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,880
 That ... really shouldn't have happened. 

203
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,360
I need to talk to you.

204
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,500
The funeral is over so pack up and leave as you promised.

205
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,950
What are you talking about? I've told you about Eun Byeol's condition.

206
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,230
She has to continue to receive counselling.

207
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,760
Are you insinuating yourself here by using Eun Byeol as an excuse?

208
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,800
Have you forgotten that until I become chairperson, our divorce remains a secret. 
   Divorce Settlement Agreement 

209
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,740
I don't think there's any reason now to hide it anymore.

210
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,490
Eun Byeol is sick.

211
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,200
Because of your high expectations for her,  inside our daughter there is disease and it is festering.

212
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,700
Our Eun Byeol is not as weak as you are.

213
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,200
I can take care of her mental health.

214
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,260
When you got seven billion won in alimony,

215
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,220
shouldn't you leave cleanly as a final courtesy to me?

216
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,460
Mom  and Dad, are you divorced?

217
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,180
Eun Byeol.   No.That's not so, Eun Byeol.

218
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,430
I was going to tell you after the test but now you've already heard it so I have no choice.

219
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,040
Dad and I are divorced.

220
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,010
You should also be aware that Dad is going to live separately.

221
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,590
I don't like that.  It never can happen.

222
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,370
Am I going to live without a father like Bae Ro Na?

223
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,520
The kids are going to be whispering about me.

224
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,740
Even if it's phony, let's live together.

225
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,560
Mom, don't divorce!

226
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,680
Mom, can't you let Dad slide just once?

227
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,270
Nowadays, Dad has been so nice to both you and me.

228
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,480
It's already all over.

229
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,790
We just don't live in one house and you can see him whenever you want.

230
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,720
Even so, I don't want that.

231
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,870
Dad, don't leave. Live together with me.

232
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,440
Don't go anywhere.

233
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,010
Don't worry Eun Byeol. I'm not going anywhere.

234
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm going to be with you.

235
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,610
You are now the daughter of the Cheong Ah Foundation Chairperson.

236
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,600
You are Cheon Seo Jin's daughter.

237
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,310
You can't be compared to such a person like Bae Ro Na.

238
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,530
Dad was just an accessory, that didn't make any difference to you, whether there was Dad or not.

239
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,800
All you need is Mom. You have a mother who can do everything for you!

240
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,040
I need Dad, too.

241
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,630
I don't want to lose Dad to such an insignificant wench.

242
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,250
What?

243
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,190
Do you think I don't know?

244
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,390
Aren't you ditching me for Ro Na?

245
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,430
Dirty.

246
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,470
That's not so, Eun Byeol.

247
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,570
Don't be childish, Ha Eun Byeol.

248
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,950
There isn't anything you can reverse because you say that.

249
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,800
Go to your room and study.

250
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,940
You've already wasted several minutes talking about useless things.

251
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,000
You also cannot do this to me.

252
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,740
I can never let Dad leave.

253
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,890
If he leaves, I will leave too.

254
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,540
Eun Byeol. Hey. Hey.

255
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,730
Ha Eun Byeol.

256
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,210
You.  Do you really have to do this far?

257
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,320
Didn't you already give your word?

258
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,140
Pack your bags and leave quietly.

259
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,280
Haven't you quit smoking yet?

260
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,390
Everytime I try to break the habit, something happens.

261
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,110
You've managed to go through the tough matter (funeral), haven't you?

262
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,680
How is Seo Jin?

263
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,420
She is bulletproof.  Very much so.

264
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,090
By any chance, did Seo Jin tell you?

265
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,590
The day that the chairman died

266
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,260
he and I met.

267
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,800
Father-in-law?  Why with you?

268
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,370
The Chairman was informed about everything before he passed away.

269
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,000
About his daughter's divorce  and  ... well ...

270
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,240
even her affair with Ju Dan Tae.

271
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,260
Thank for coming to the mortuary.

272
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,420
 I'm so sorry about the chairman. 

273
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,040
He was still in his prime.

274
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,150
- Have you had any rest? 
 - There's no time to rest.

275
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,160
There's so much foundation work... I'm going out of my mind.

276
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,240
I think the inauguration ceremony will be done after the board meeting.

277
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,130
I have to start working immediately because of the transition.

278
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,870
Will the board approve as a matter of course?

279
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,660
They should.

280
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,870
My mother and younger sister won't object.

281
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,680
Now I have everything I wanted.

282
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,000
 Except you. 

283
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,660
The longing to be in your embrace right now

284
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,400
is driving me crazy.

285
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll look forward to seeing you at the villa tomorrow evening.

286
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,250
Work as you take care of yourself.

287
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,850
 Tapping conversation. 

288
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,060
It is like you are on your way to a party.

289
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,750
I can't believe you're dressed that way right after the funeral is over.

290
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,560
Anyone seeing you would think you were looking forward to your father's demise.

291
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,410
Watch your mouth.

292
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,280
While you're living with and raising a child,

293
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,900
I just hope you don't commit any more major crimes.

294
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,550
I wasn't going to say this but

295
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,990
the person who killed my father

296
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,380
is you.

297
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,940
I am restraining myself because I don't want to cause an uproar.

298
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,920
If you want to avoid being sued, lie down quietly.

299
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,300
Are you blaming me?

300
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,670
Who's the one who had an affair?

301
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,910
Who made your father fall?

302
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,200
Finish processing your daughter's dropping out before you interfere in someone else's family business.

303
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,360
You look pathetic drooling with lingering attachment.

304
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,840
Anyway, isn't your daughter more hopeless?

305
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Since she's already dropped out,  disappearing from Hera Palace  will also help you understand your place.

306
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,420
Don't bet on that!

307
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,670
Don't we have to wait to see

308
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,320
who will disappear from here?

309
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,580
Alright, good luck.

310
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,020
 Thank you Cheon Seo Jin, the next Chairperson, for your hard work! 

311
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,920
You've withstood a ton of difficulties, Department Head.

312
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,380
Teacher Cheon, we're also here.

313
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,620
Oh my goodness.  Look at how gaunt your beautiful face has become.

314
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,310
You've experienced so many shocks and difficulties.

315
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,580
This nameplate is made of pure gold

316
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,570
and is Gyu Jin's appreciation for Teacher Cheon.

317
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,100
What's with Teacher Cheon? She's the chairperson now.

318
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,200
Huge congratulations on becoming the next chairperson.

319
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm not the chairperson yet.  I need to be approved by the board of directors.

320
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,250
It's a done deal anyway.

321
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,600
Oh my, your real charisma is no joke.

322
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm sorry, but the kids' midterms begin today.

323
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,250
Parents are strictly prohibited from entering the school.

324
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,100
It appears our teachers made a mistake.

325
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,200
Please leave immediately for the sake of transparency in the administration of the school.

326
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,980
Alright.

327
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,210
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
Thank you.

330
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,980
For me, who is grief-stricken over the sudden loss of such a large pillar in my life

331
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,100
such warm consolation gives me immeasurable strength.

332
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,600
Education is the basis of our Cheong Ah Foundation.

333
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,900
I'll do my utmost so that Cheong Ah Art School can become a bigger tree fostering talent.

334
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,650
That filthy adulteress. Look at her being so brazen  and confident.

335
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,260
What kind of game is she playing donning the mask of a human?

336
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,950
Isn't her expression too much like something which saved the country?

337
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,800
Who is going to say no?

338
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,130
How dare she kick out us when she as an educator had an affair with a parent?

339
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,030
If we reported her to the Education Board,

340
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,360
it'll just be a matter of time before she gets fired from being the Chairwoman.

341
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,060
You! Isn't a nameplate made of gold too much?

342
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,260
Do you know how much gold costs?

343
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,450
It was bought with the steering committee's funds. Ju Dan Tae approved it.

344
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,060
I'm in a foul mood. Even so, how could she tell us to leave right to our face?

345
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,270
What was she saying?  "Transparency in school administration?"  Jeez.

346
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,270
Why do you think there is a rumor that if you are a teacher at Cheong Ah for three years

347
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,180
and you can't afford to buy a house, you're a fool?

348
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,650
But still, we have to be careful what we say

349
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,700
in front of Cheon Seo Jin. We need to read the situation.

350
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,910
These days I've been trying so hard to keep my mouth shut

351
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,160
that it's making me rot inside.

352
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,870
I'm going crazy because I want to diss her openly.

353
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,770
Even so, what can we do?  Our children are our weakness as she holds them as the hostages.

354
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,980
But, what's going to happen to Su Ryeon?

355
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,840
Since Teacher Cheon got divorced, does she have to leave the Penthouse?

356
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,430
Cheon Seo Jin occupying the Penthouse? Oh I'm getting goosebumps just imagining it.

357
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,350
Cheon Seo Jin and Ju Dan Tae.

358
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,440
The worst combination. How annoying.

359
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,530
  First Semester 2020 Midterms 
    Subject Code 01 

360
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,850
If you're caught cheating, your answer sheet will be taken away no matter what.

361
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,950
And it'll be treated as "0" score.

362
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,550
I have 20-20 vision.

363
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,210
Don't even think of trying anything strange.

364
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,220
  Cheong Ah Foundation Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin    

365
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,810
What did you just say?

366
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,700
Why are you so surprised?

367
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,330
Isn't Teacher Ma the best person to be the next Arts Director?

368
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,680
Thank you.

369
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,250
I'll pledge my loyalty to you until the day I die.

370
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,800
I'll really do my best.

371
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,880
Then you need to show it with actions instead of words.

372
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,170
Pardon?

373
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,020
Do you know Seoul National University strongly considers

374
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,530
the applicant's activities outside her major?

375
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,130
So in light of that, I want to give you complete control

376
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,690
of the development of Eun Byeol's resume.

377
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,900
I completely understand what you're saying.

378
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,200
You don't have to worry,  Department— no, Chairperson.

379
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,660
To live up to your expectations, I am going to pour my heart and soul into this as much as you believe in me.

380
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,560
From now on, if there is any award at school whether it's for our school's books, debates, or essays,

381
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,700
anything you can write down on the resume without any quibbling over niceties,

382
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,970
let's give all to Student Ha Eun Byeol.

383
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,220
Aggressively support any activity clubs that Ha Eun Byeol belongs to.

384
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,070
You meant us to give Eun Byeol any school awards, right?

385
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,680
Shh.

386
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,600
What's going on?

387
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,410
Am I an outcast?

388
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,790
You didn't know it?

389
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,740
This is why you should've behaved in the first place.

390
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,250
Wow, don't you think you're being a bit much?

391
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,610
Hello?

392
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,220
Yes. Who is this?

393
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,370
It's Ju Dan Tae, Chairman of the School Steering Committee.

394
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,590
You're Seok Gyeong's homeroom teacher, right?

395
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,040
Yes. Hello! I'm Teacher Ma Du Gi.

396
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,020
It's Chairman Ju.

397
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,280
Yes, yes please speak.

398
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,210
Of course I should go.

399
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,590
It's an honor to be called privately like this, Chairman.

400
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,560
I left my two children in your care and I've been too uninvolved all this time.

401
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,920
I should have invited you to play golf.

402
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,030
Let's grab a date to play a round.

403
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm still a mere beginner.

404
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,990
I'll start practicing very hard starting from today.

405
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,240
I'll get to the point since you're probably busy.

406
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,770
These days it seems like Seok Gyeong is very stressed because of exams.

407
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,490
As a father, I can't be of much help

408
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,870
so it hurts my heart.

409
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,450
Of course you feel that way. It must have been hard for you.

410
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,490
So, what can I do to help?

411
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,640
The tests.

412
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,120
I'm sorry?

413
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,280
 What is it? 

414
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,820
 Please help me. 

415
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,720
 I can't do it alone. 

416
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,320
 I don't care if you kick me out abroad. 

417
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,570
 But I refuse to lose to Eun Byeol. 

418
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,820
For me, I can't bear to see my child lose against anyone.

419
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,350
Even if it's Ha Eun Byeol.

420
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,110
So basically, you want me to steal the test answers.

421
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,100
Is that right?

422
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,310
But doing that has a lot of risks.

423
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,150
What is this?

424
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,910
Open it.

425
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,590
I never abandon someone once they become my person.

426
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,850
If you take care of Seok Gyeong's exams for the next three years,

427
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,300
I'll make sure to take care of you after retirement, Teacher Ma.

428
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,460
Until I die?

429
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,640
I hope things go smoothly tomorrow for Seok Gyeong's exams.

430
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,080
Have a safe drive, Chairman!

431
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,570
I love you!

432
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,850
What a rotten bastard.

433
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
 J King Holdings 

434
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,010
A joint investment?

435
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,250
Yes. Logan Lee is proposing that he makes a

436
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,650
joint investment deal with our company.

437
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,160
Rather than a shopping center, he believes that the Myeongdong land

438
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,710
would be more suitable for the hotel and casino business aimed toward foreigners.

439
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,560
He's made that decision.

440
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
Casino business?

441
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,500
In Singapore's case, the hotel casino in the city caused a significant increase in the number of tourists.

442
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,390
Who doesn't know that? But

443
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,750
will a casino business be easily permitted, especially in the middle of Seoul?

444
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,090
Is it because Logan Lee doesn't know much about Korea?

445
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,530
This is my business.

446
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,850
If I didn't have the confidence to do it in the first place,

447
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,820
I wouldn't have done it.

448
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,600
Now. This is the business outline for hotels and casinos

449
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,890
that I'm pushing in New York and Seoul.

450
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,880
Estimated budget:  one billion ...

451
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,750
Dollars.

452
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,210
And since I'm staying in America for most of the time,

453
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,390
and for better business operations in Korea

454
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,370
I am offering you co-investor.

455
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,890
That's over 1 trillion won.

456
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,850
Listen, you have to understand. This is a massive business idea.

457
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:49,320
On the verge of contracting with some of the biggest and I mean big... big corporations. Okay?

458
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,370
I only came in today because Ms. Oh asked me to come.

459
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,030
It was a favor.

460
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,400
You don't want to do it, you don't have to.

461
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,190
Let's go.

462
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,130
- Please give me some time to review it. 
 - No.

463
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,460
No! Business is about information

464
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,130
which is something that you... don't have.

465
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,180
Logan, wait please!

466
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,280
Are you going to give up like this? This was a very hard meeting to grab

467
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,350
especially since Five Star Group is also coming on very strong.

468
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,130
Five Star Group?

469
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,730
 The Five Star Group, Promoting Asia's largest hotel casino with U.S. funding. 

470
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,290
 Logan Lee, an intriguing investor, entering Korea in earnest through casino business 

471
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,220
Is it really going through?

472
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,100
Articles have been released non stop since this afternoon and Five Star Group's stocks have skyrocketed.

473
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,510
Call Logan Lee immediately and grab a dinner meeting.

474
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,550
I need him sitting and facing me at that table no matter what. Understand?

475
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,100
I'll trust that you can do it.

476
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,730
He probably hasn't left yet.

477
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,800
I have 150 billion committed to Myeong-dong.

478
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,230
I'm going to pull it all out at once.  If I invest in the casino business,

479
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:14,200
I could collect at least $50 million per year.

480
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,850
 JAKOMO 

481
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,580
  It's Sim Su Ryeon.  Please check your mail. 

482
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,850
As expected, this is it!

483
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,890
I mean, what have you eaten that your skin is glowing like this?

484
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,900
-You guys are here? 
 - Oh!

485
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,940
We're here because Min Hyeok's mom needs a sofa.

486
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,820
The material for this one is nice and it has a high satisfaction rating.

487
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,680
Let me try it.

488
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,100
- Where are you going to put it? 
 - Umm ...

489
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,090
- In my husband's study. 
 - The study.

490
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,860
 Teacher Gu Ho Dong 

491
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:08,750
- Excuse me. 
 - Of course! Don't mind us and go.

492
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,630
He'll take the bait no matter what because of his money that is tied up in Myeong-dong.

493
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,240
If you are to have a joint investment, you should make a new corporation.

494
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,230
Yes.  I've already planned that.

495
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:27,000
He's someone who has a lot of suspicions. You need to make sure your story matches up with Five Star Group.

496
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,300
I've known Chairman Park for a very long time so he'll help me out.

497
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,520
More than that, do you happen to know exactly how much Ju Dan Tae's real estate and other assets are worth?

498
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,240
No. He keeps his assets strictly confidential.

499
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,600
There's a secret space in his study that only he uses.

500
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,590
He probably keeps its documents in there somewhere.

501
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,160
You can't go in without his fingerprints.

502
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,990
Fingerprints? Don't worry, there should be a way.

503
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,750
Wait.

504
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,220
I think Ju Dan Tae took the bait.

505
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,220
Please talk with me for a second.

506
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,530
 Cheon Seo Jin! 

507
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,340
Father.

508
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,420
 You're a murderer. You have no right to have this trophy! 

509
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,540
No! It's mine!

510
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,040
Stop bothering me!

511
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,690
You're dead.  You're already dead.

512
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,950
Cheon Ah Foundation is mine!

513
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,200
Chairwoman!

514
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,360
Have you not gotten off of work yet?

515
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,960
- What brings you here? 
 - Eun Byeol's mental state is no joke.

516
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,540
I was worried because of the late Chairman's funeral and exam season

517
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,460
but she's gotten the perfect scores on all three of today's subjects.

518
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,570
Seok Gyeong is a total mess.

519
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,600
Is that so? She's been working hard so that's a relief.

520
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,500
But...

521
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,890
I understand.

522
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,580
It must've been very hard for you. I'll clean it up.

523
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,650
Then I'll leave it to you.

524
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,780
I have an appointment so.

525
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,470
Don't worry and go home.

526
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,000
 2020 1st Semester Tests and the answer for 1st Year Class 

527
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,910
Damn. I can't see.

528
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,170
You said you were looking for a man's jacket.  What do you think about this?  The color is luxurious.

529
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,370
It's nice. Give me this too.

530
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,370
Pack all that up.

531
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,810
 I'm going to have to postpone our dinner meeting. Something important came up.  

532
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,980
Where are you? We were supposed to see each other today.

533
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,320
Next time. I can't leave this meeting.

534
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:41,030
I don't need next time! Now. I need you now.

535
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,350
You know my situation right now. Come to the villa. I'll be waiting.

536
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,960
Sorry.

537
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,910
Is that your wife? You guys seem to adore each other.

538
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,730
Ah... yes.

539
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,500
Then with this, you've agreed to a joint investment.

540
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,250
It's useless to change the subject. "No turning back."

541
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,940
Again I am convinced by Ms. Oh.

542
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,500
It's an honor that I'm able to be of this much help.

543
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,670
In celebration of our agreement, shall we do a one shot?

544
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,910
Why don't we give it a try?

545
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,640
Cheers.

546
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,790
That's nice.

547
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,090
Although we have signed the Memorandum of Understanding,

548
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:40,270
what part of Oh Yun Hui moved you so much?

549
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,130
I would say... her bravery.

550
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,240
There are many smart people out there but brave? Not so much.

551
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,560
Her bravery.

552
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,960
Ah, excuse me.

553
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,670
Unfortunately... something urgent came up.

554
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,340
Is it okay to leave you two alone?

555
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,740
Yes, of course. There'll be plenty of time in the future.

556
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,320
Yes, please. Excuse me.

557
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,290
Moment, please.

558
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,830
It's a present.

559
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,230
Oh, thank you. You're appreciated.

560
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,900
- Talk to you soon? 
 - Okay.

561
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,780
 Success 
 Completely Recognized 

562
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,570
Everything's ready. I'll be on my way.

563
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,370
Here.

564
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,820
Because I am a meritocrat, I make sure the compensation  is commensurate with the results.

565
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,330
So I'm thinking of promoting you to become the Team Leader of the Investment team of J King Holdings.

566
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,390
- Really? 
 - I look forward to working with you.

567
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,720
Whatever our past fate was, what's true is that you're someone I need right now.

568
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,360
I'll do my best.

569
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,540
I hope you're not already drunk. This is the start for me.

570
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,730
My alcohol tolerance is stronger than you think.

571
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,150
Of course, I'm not drunk.

572
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,940
Please excuse me.

573
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,470
Are you okay?

574
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,390
Yes, I'm okay. Oh no, I'm sorry.

575
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,450
There's an emergency kit in the car.

576
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,950
- Secretary Jo, where are you? 
 - Are you okay?

577
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,980
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

578
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,700
I'm so sorry.

579
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,510
Chairman, are you okay?

580
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:21,920
 No, Mom you can't die. 

581
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,520
Stop.

582
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,950
Chairman! Are you okay?

583
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,900
Get away!  Where are you touching?

584
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,830
Chairman!

585
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,960
I said to stop.

586
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,230
I said to stop. I said to stop.

587
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,460
The kids are at the study room and I sent Housekeeper Yang early.

588
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,690
This way.

589
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,240
This is...

590
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,970
This is the land owned by my furniture company. 
      

591
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,560
I guess Ju Dan Tae wants to develop a village on that land.

592
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,300
Is that why he wanted Hye In dead?

593
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,980
What are you talking about?

594
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:12,620
When my father died, he left the site of the furniture company to Hye In.

595
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,740
There's a safe.

596
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,510
How do we open this?

597
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,630
I think I know a way.

598
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,440
 Err -03 

599
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,850
 FAIL 

600
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,540
Where are we going right now?

601
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,680
There's a villa nearby.

602
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,190
 Err 03 

603
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,480
 Err  -03 

604
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,200
It's been over two hours already.

605
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,120
If there are 6 digits, even if we figure out all possible combinations, we may not be able to open it today.

606
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,980
We don't know when we'll get another chance.

607
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,120
Don't you think we should go to the hospital first?

608
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,090
There's nothing here.

609
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,560
He'll wake up soon.

610
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,510
I'm going to buy some things to treat him so wait here.

611
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,050
There's clothes in the closet. You can change to those.

612
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,410
Are you here, Secretary Jo?

613
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,460
- What do you think you're doing? 
 - That's what I should be asking! Why are you here?

614
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,930
Wearing my clothes!

615
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:56,760
I'm here because of a circumstance so don't get me wrong.

616
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,000
What circumstance?

617
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,670
It seems  you're mistaken and think you've become something because you go to the same company as him.

618
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,190
But Ju Dan Tae is my man.

619
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,390
Who do you dare to covet?

620
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,620
Take off my clothes right now!

621
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,850
You're so shameless.

622
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,930
The old saying is a concubine can't stand another concubine.

623
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,760
How do you come off posing as his legal wife?

624
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,920
Don't judge me with your filthy standards.

625
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh Yun Hui.

626
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,860
Are you not confident?

627
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:35,920
The great Cheon Seo Jin is going crazy over one guy.

628
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,600
I'm becoming really curious all of a sudden.

629
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,420
What kind of guy is Chairman Ju Dan Tae?

630
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,330
Shut up.

631
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,090
Know your place.

632
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,880
And what's your place?

633
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,940
You're just an adulteress!  Don't act up.

634
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,870
The Chairman needs to be in a stable condition so please stop making a fuss and leave.

635
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,810
I'm saying this as the Team Leader of J King Holdings Investment team.

636
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:23,220
Are you crazy? How are you the team leader?

637
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,830
What are you doing? Take her out. The Chairman will wake up at this rate.

638
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,800
Please leave for now.

639
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,170
Let go! I said let go!

640
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,560
Oh Yun Hui! Tell Chairman Ju to come out!

641
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,420
Crazy bitch.

642
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,510
Are you awake?

643
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,960
Are you okay now?

644
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,420
I've been seen too much by someone who has no interest in my personal life.

645
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,560
My wife doesn't even know about it.

646
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,530
I'll be on the way out since it seems like you're awake now.

647
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,100
Why didn't you say anything to Cheon Seo Jin?

648
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,150
About what happened today.

649
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:20,960
I saw pain in your face, Chairman.

650
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,880
I'm not so low as to spread with my mouth the news about other people's wounds

651
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,540
I didn't see anything today.

652
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:37,650
So don't worry and please concern yourself with the one outside right now.

653
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,390
I want to talk to Chairman Ju!

654
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,080
Let go! Let go!

655
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,400
Oh Yun Hui. Where are you running off to?

656
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,780
Explain yourself before you go!  You!

657
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,330
Oh Yun Hui!

658
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,250
Let go! Let go!

659
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,400
Don't get overworked. It isn't a big deal.

660
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,200
It isn't a big deal?

661
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,420
This villa is a place for just the two of us.

662
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,490
So how is she here?

663
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:21,440
Oh Yun Hui that brat left here wearing my clothes.

664
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,480
What were you doing on your bed?

665
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,470
It's not like that. It's work related.

666
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,730
I told you to fire her!

667
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,430
You said you would kick her out right away but why are you attracted to her?

668
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,730
I'll take care of my work related problems!

669
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,340
Something just happened so it was inevitable.

670
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,610
Don't be mad. Let's talk inside.

671
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,900
Oh Yun Hui!

672
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,290
She gets on my nerves.

673
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,650
How many times do I have to tell you?

674
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:02,500
I came here because I wanted to be comforted by you.

675
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:07,610
Did you have to ruin my mood like this?

676
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,520
What happened today ...

677
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,040
you have to explain it properly to me.

678
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,980
Escort Ms. Oh Yun Hui and take her home.

679
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,880
I'll go separately.

680
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,350
 Ju Dan Tae Village 

681
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,220
Wait a second.

682
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,510
 230519 
 Open 

683
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,570
How did you know?

684
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,960
 May 19, 2023 is written on this aerial perspective, 

685
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,490
The list of real estate alone is huge.

686
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,460
All this cash adds up to billions.

687
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,600
What is this?

688
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,070
This is a picture from when Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong were babies.

689
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,710
Who is this lady? She has a unique tattoo on her back.

690
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,280
Is she their birth mother?

691
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:30,320
I heard that she died of sepsis immediately after giving birth.

692
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,500
Why ... are you here?

693
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,000
That is...

694
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,620
I thought I told you that I wouldn't like you to come in without permission.

695
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,510
What is this?

696
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:01,050
This ring!  This was the wedding ring of Hye In's dad and me.

697
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,400
Why is this here?

698
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:10,830
You just found this?

699
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,810
I was excited every day by thinking when you would find out this.

700
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,800
Don't tell me...

701
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,730
You happened to kill him... didn't you?

702
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,100
How could you do that?

703
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:37,460
You killed the innocent person and kept his finger like booty?

704
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,960
Are you human?

705
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,880
Once I looked at the wedding ring that he wore on his finger,

706
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,340
I just flipped out.

707
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,140
Such a trivial bastard dared to take my woman away from me.

708
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,960
When I thought you had his baby,

709
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,270
it wouldn't be enough even if I tore his heart to shreds and ate it.

710
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,850
You... You're crazy!

711
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:04,090
Then do you think I wouldn't get crazy when my woman betrayed me?

712
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,560
Because of such a lousy bastard, you dared to betray Ju Dan Tae!

713
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,550
We didn't love in the first place.

714
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,200
I didn't help but got engaged with you because of our parents.

715
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,000
And I never opened my heart to you even once.

716
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,750
You killed a person.

717
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,180
But how brazenly could you act like this?

718
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,870
You're the devil.

719
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,870
Devil?

720
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:43,030
I'm the one who has taken care of  the child that a woman who betrayed me gave birth to for 16 years.

721
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:48,030
You were the one who praised me by saying even if there had been her real dad, he couldn't have done like me.

722
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,740
With what right, did you talk to me about divorcing?

723
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,000
Because I just had an affair with Cheon Seo Jin once?

724
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,850
Sorry for saying this but you were the one who betrayed me first!

725
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,700
Let's consider this would get even with the finger matter.

726
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,720
We can forget everything and start a new life again.

727
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,250
Love?  We can start it from now on.

728
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:23,030
We betrayed each other once, isn't it fair now?

729
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:28,030
Then I understand you're thinking the same way.

730
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,050
I'm going to wash first.

731
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,280
May I see your ID card?

732
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,720
I'm a college student.  Just ring up please.

733
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,170
In our store, we can sell certain items after checking ID.

734
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,390
By chance... are you Abby?

735
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,520
You're really Bae Ro Na!  Look at your make-up and hair style...

736
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,170
Did you run away from your house?

737
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,900
We're studying until our brain gets earthquake.

738
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,010
Wow!  You even drink alcohol?

739
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,520
Never mind.

740
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,420
What's wrong with her?  After quitting school, she must get crazy.

741
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,260
Hold on.

742
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,660
What time is it, you're just home?

743
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,030
What time is it?

744
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,200
What's wrong with your hair?

745
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,110
Bae Ro Na!

746
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,240
What have I lived so hard for?

747
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,460
What's the use for becoming a team leader?

748
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,450
What's the use of living in a fancy house?

749
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,850
When I ruined my daughter's life.

750
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,570
 Can we meet for a short while? 

751
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,860
 Please come to the 47th floor at Hera Palace. 

752
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,310
 Hera Palace 

753
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:11,170
Min Seol Ah... 47th floor...

754
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,120
Min Seol Ah... 47th floor...

755
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:30,190
Ju Dan Tae... It was Ju Dan Tae.

756
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:32,110
 Die! 

757
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,070
 Die! 

758
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,060
 Hera Palace, 47th floor 

759
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,120
 Ahjumma? 

760
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,930
 Was it Ahjumma? 

761
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,970
 Did you save me, Ahjumma? 

762
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,840
 Thank you. 

763
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,740
 Spare me, Ahjumma! 

764
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,840
 If you were gone, my Ro Na would be able to get admitted. 

765
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,060
 If you were gone... 

766
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,290
It was not a dream.

767
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:04,300
Min Seol Ah... fell at Hera Palace.

768
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,730
I... I did kill her.

769
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,750
Yun Hui.

770
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,530
Unni.

771
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,660
You're here early.

772
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,430
Why did you ask me to meet up here?

773
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,170
I have something to tell you, Yun Hui.

774
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:46,010
Actually, I've used you all this time.

775
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,400
Me? W-What do you mean by that?

776
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,820
I was the one who sent you to Min Seol Ah's house in Bosong Village.

777
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,040
I was also the one who brought you here, to Hera Palace.

778
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,330
I used you, Yun Hui.

779
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:08,980
Because I really needed you get my revenge.

780
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:20,440
I... am Min Seol Ah's mom.

781
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:36,480

 The Penthouse: War In Life 

783
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,230
 I saw it clearly at this 47th floor banister. 

784
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,180
 I'll decide whether we meet or part. 

785
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,410
 Bae Ro Na came back. 

786
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,340
 I'm going out with Bae Ro Na. 

787
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,820
 I didn't even start it yet. 

788
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,590
 Take good care of me, Chairwoman Cheo Seo Jin.  

789
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,870
 I'm going to finish up everything. 

790
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,770
 Don't believe anyone except yourself. 

791
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:05,210
 I have to be strong because I'm a mother.
