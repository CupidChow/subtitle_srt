00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,000
 Episode 18 

2
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:56,900


3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,770
Where is Ju Hye In? Where did you hide her?

4
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,450
Someplace where you'll never be able to find her.

5
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,400
Someplace where you won't be able to kill her again.

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,920
Tell me. Where did you take that wench?

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
You dare treat me like an idiot!

8
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,600
You're not even human.

9
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,890
Trash. Murderer!

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,190
None of that is important.

11
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,920
Since we've gotten to know about each other much more,

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,670
we can be a more harmonious couple now.

13
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,780
Crazy bastard.

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,700
All this time you've acted too gracefully,

15
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,550
elegantly, and high end.

16
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,390
A woman like you needs to be punished.

17
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,830
A punishment for deceiving her husband and thinking about other things.

18
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,750
After you receive your punishment,

19
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,200
everything will go back to how it was.

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,530
Where are you going?

21
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,840
We're not done talking.

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,120
Madam please leave this house immediately.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,790
I can't leave without my children.

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,830
Madam.

25
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,610
Do you want to die by the Chairman's hands? Please go!

26
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,940
I need to take my kids!

27
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,130
Sim Su Ryeon!

28
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,470
Where did you go, Sim Su Ryeon?

29
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,850
Sim Su Ryeon!

30
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,270
Housekeeper Yang, I will come back for my children.

31
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,050
So please take care of them while I'm gone.

32
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,420
I'll kill you.

33
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,760
Secretary Jo. Catch Sim So Ryeon immediately!  Immediately!

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,550
Ju Seok Hun? This little—

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,780
Let go of my arm!

36
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,120
Leave mom alone.

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
If you go after her, I'll tell everyone.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,530
That Min Seol Ah died at Hera Palace.

39
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,490
This bastard.

40
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,490
If you want to hit me, hit me. Here.

41
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,660
Hit me all you want. Hit me!

42
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,140
I'm no longer scared

43
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,390
of someone like you.

44
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,330
Hye In left safely.

45
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,900
Once she arrives in America, I'll get a call.

46
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,930
Thank you.

47
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm just paying back what I couldn't do for Seol Ah.

48
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,550
Secretary Hong is going to take care of her until she gets to the hospital

49
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,740
so don't worry too much.

50
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,150
Are you okay? You didn't get to say goodbye to her.

51
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,060
If I had seen her,

52
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,180
I would've felt like I wouldn't be able to let her go.

53
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,000
Both Seol Ah and Hye In,

54
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,280
both Seok Hoon and Seok Gyeong,

55
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,680
if they had met a better mother,

56
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,680
there wouldn't have been an incident like this.

57
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,020
All because I

58
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,780
wasn't a good mother,

59
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,480
all because of me, my children are suffering.

60
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,610
It's driving me crazy.

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,470
Once everything is finished here, I'll take you to Hye In.

62
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,190
Let's go to America together.

63
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,880
Get away from Ju Dan Tae and start a new life. I'll help you.

64
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,330
Do you think

65
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,710
I have the right to start a new life?

66
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm not a victim.

67
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,890
I am also

68
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,700
the mother of the children who bullied Seol Ah to her death.

69
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,210
My dead child

70
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,470
was killed by my other children.

71
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,100
I can't forgive myself for that.

72
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,780
No.

73
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,380
I will make you happy.

74
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,910
I am going to keep my last promise to Seol Ah.

75
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,010
I'm going to do that.

76
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,020
 Husband 

77
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
 The person you are calling is not able to be connected— 

78
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
 Ju Dan Tae Village 

79
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,600
Sim Su Ryeon, I'm going to kill you! How dare you touch my safe!

80
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,210
Chairman! Chairman!

81
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,370
Did you find her?

82
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,370
Ju Hye In just left for America.

83
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,280
What? Are you telling me that to brag or something?

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,340
What about Sim Su Ryeon? Where did she go?

85
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,120
Not yet ... I'm doing everything I can to find her.

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,700
You worthless bastard!

87
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,780
If you have time to tell me that, then go find her yourself!

88
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,580
 Calling... Oh Yun Hui 

89
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm sorry for calling you this late at night. It's me, Ju Dan Tae.

90
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's meet right now.

91
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,530
 Unni Su Ryeon 

92
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,600
 There's no need to feel guilty. 

93
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,730
 It's the same as Unni Su Ryeon using me to avenge her daughter. 

94
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,490
 All I need to do now is protect my daughter. 

95
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,380
Wow.

96
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,570
Something ... you look different.

97
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,350
Is that so?

98
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,270
Why did you call me?

99
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,350
We share a special secret so can't we have a drink together?

100
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,630
Even so isn't our relationship such that we shouldn't meet late at night?

101
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,810
Did you forget that I'm close with Su Ryeon?

102
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,320
If that had bothered you, you wouldn't even have come out.

103
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,660
Isn't that so?

104
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,790
 Unni Su Ryeon 

105
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,270
Answer it. If you don't want to create any secrets from my wife.

106
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,460
Hello?

107
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,330
 Yun Hui, why haven't you been answering? I've called multiple times. 

108
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,140
Sorry, Unni. Something came up.

109
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,550
I left the penthouse.

110
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,550
What does that mean?

111
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,490
Ju Dan Tae is involved with my daughter's death.

112
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,340
 Come with me to the police station tomorrow and make a statement about Seol Ah's death. 

113
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,530
 The only person I can trust right now is you. 

114
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,430
I'm going to catch that murderer.

115
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,000
 Please help me, Yun Hui. 

116
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,030
 Yun Hui, are you listening to me? 

117
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,890
 Yun Hui. 

118
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,760
Do you know

119
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,360
where my wife is right now?

120
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,450
If I tell you,

121
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,370
what can you do for me?

122
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,660
Everything Oh Yun Hui wants.

123
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,710
  Unni Su Ryeon  

124
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,240
What did I do?

125
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,590
  I'll be at the lounge. 

126
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,030
Let's have breakfast together.

127
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,440
I'll have a coffee first.

128
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,350
If you are curious about something, ask.

129
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,020
There's probably a reason you waited for me,

130
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,010
That's right.

131
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,760
Being straightforward is more like you.

132
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,890
I thought about it,

133
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,530
and I'm wondering why your attitude toward me changed.

134
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,540
I feel like it's an extraordinary reason.

135
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,970
If you think about it,

136
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,830
I'm your best friend's husband,

137
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,150
and having an affair with the woman you hate the most.

138
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,190
Didn't your relationship with Su Ryeon end a long time ago?

139
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,380
And your relationship with Cheon Seo Jin seems over as well.

140
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,100
Why do you think that?

141
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,480
I felt it at the villa.

142
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,140
The way you treated Cheon Seo Jin.

143
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,490
It looked like you wanted her to leave your side.

144
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,300
It was the face of a man who was sick of her.

145
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,760
- That's how I felt. 
 - So?

146
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,510
That means the spot next to you is vacant.

147
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,760
And you wavered towards me.

148
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,360
Do we need more reasons?

149
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,080
A woman who becomes more interesting the more I see you,

150
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,980
especially the fact that you betrayed my wife, I like that very much.

151
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,460
I didn't betray her.

152
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,750
She betrayed me first.

153
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,520
Pretending to help me, pretending to care for me,

154
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,490
she was acting.

155
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,600
All of that was a lie, and I know that now.

156
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,900
Ju Dan Tae, she was using me to bring you down.

157
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,200
So? What are you going to do now?

158
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,290
Are you going to get your revenge on Sim Su Ryeon?

159
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,120
Whatever it is.

160
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,050
Whatever it takes to protect myself.

161
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,460
I like it. You.

162
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,160
You're honest and bold.

163
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,330
And you're beautiful.

164
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,810
Use me.

165
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,070
The thing that you want,

166
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,530
I may be able to tell you.

167
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,580
I want to know where Sim Su Ryeon is.

168
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,820
And who's working with her.

169
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,590
And what she's planning.

170
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,950
  It's me, Chairwoman. 

171
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,650
What happened? Did you find the person who sent the video?

172
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,200
I couldn't find the sender.

173
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,460
You told me you took care of everything that day.

174
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,800
Why would something like this happen?

175
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,940
There must've been someone who was there that day.

176
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,900
Someone saw me!

177
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,820
All the security footage from that day was deleted,

178
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,900
so we can't confirm who was at the school that day.

179
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,220
Stop telling me you can't do anything,

180
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,800
and find out at all costs. Do whatever it takes.

181
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,600
Find out who shot the video,

182
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,960
and who dares to threaten me like this.

183
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,830
I will find out.

184
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,710
Just wait till I catch you, I'll kill you.

185
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,780
Where have you been this early in the morning?

186
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,800
Wearing that?

187
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,570
By chance, did you stay out all night?

188
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,690
And you, you look like you didn't get any sleep.

189
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,890
What? Do you have something to worry about?

190
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,300
By any chance, were you not able to get in contact with your lover?

191
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,480
That's not your concern.

192
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,030
This is my last warning.

193
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,630
Don't stick next to Chairman Ju like gum, and leave him.

194
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,880
Do you not have any pride?

195
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,330
Not having any pride and sticking next to him like gum,

196
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,530
isn't that you, not me?

197
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,160
Seeing him up close, it looks like he's having a hard time.

198
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,690
- So I'm just advising you. 
 - What?

199
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,010
Don't trust men too much.

200
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,090
The most useless and easy thing in the world is a man's heart.

201
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,710
Watch your mouth.

202
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,650
As long as I'm Cheong Ah's chairwoman,

203
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,970
your daughter won't even be able to graduate or go to college.

204
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,210
You think so? I guess we'll find out in the end.

205
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,460
Although I'm not sure if you'll be able to keep that position.

206
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,100
 No way.  Did Oh Yun Hui send that video? 

207
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,680
Why aren't you answering your phone?

208
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,580
You called?

209
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,250
Where are you coming from?

210
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,670
I just got back from a business trip.

211
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,860
I have to wash up and go to work.

212
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,790
I'll call you later.

213
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,930
She's become a pain.

214
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,890
Ju Dan Tae.

215
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,970
You're becoming ruder and ruder.

216
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,140
- Where are the kids? 
 - They went to school.

217
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,280
You still haven't found Sim Su Ryeon?

218
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,200
Her phone is off and she hasn't gone to work.

219
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,890
You idiot.

220
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,270
So you've been helping Sim Su Ryeon behind my back all of this time?

221
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,710
You betray me after helping you for more than ten years?

222
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,620
I feel sad, Housekeeper Yang.

223
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,620
I have nothing to say, Chairman.

224
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,620
My kids have really liked you, Housekeeper Yang.

225
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,730
How long has it been?

226
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,350
Since you betrayed me and took Sim Su Ryeon's side.

227
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,590
I never betrayed you. I wouldn't dare betray you—

228
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:15,010
Don't make excuses. You wore her clothes and pretended to be her.

229
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,280
Did she tell you to do that? To throw me off her trail?

230
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,870
I did wrong, Chairman. Please forgive me once.

231
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,260
I will pay you back for letting me live.

232
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,070
I will work for you until the day I die.

233
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,010
- Drag her out. 
 - Chairman.

234
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,840
Chairman, no! No!

235
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,120
Please forgive me!

236
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,050
I can't leave this house! I'd rather die in your hands. Chairman!

237
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,950
To be honest, Gu Ho Dong found my weakness.

238
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,760
So I had no choice.

239
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
Stop.

240
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,860
Gu Ho Dong?

241
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,150
Weakness?

242
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,910
You guys worked hard taking your midterms,

243
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,770
Don't go running around because your exams are over.

244
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,610
Starting today,

245
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,790
Prepare for you final exams starting today.

246
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,160
 My dad and your mom are having an affair. That disgusting affair you keep talking about. 

247
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,530
 So let's live quietly. 

248
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,250
 Before you and I embarrass ourselves more. 

249
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,530
No! No, no!

250
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,400
Eun Byeol what's wrong?

251
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,480
Did the stress from the exams get to you? Did you fail today's test too?

252
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,090
Why are you pressuring her?

253
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,610
Eun Byeol, are you ok? Is something wrong?

254
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,160
I'm going to go to the nurse's office because my head hurts.

255
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,290
What are you doing here?

256
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,330
Why are you looking through my phone?

257
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,530
Mom. Is it—

258
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,260
Is it—

259
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,560
Nevermind, it's nothing.

260
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,350
What's wrong with you? What happened?

261
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,030
Get your filthy hands off of me!

262
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,780
What? Filthy?

263
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,940
How dare you speak to your mother like that!

264
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,940
I'm so disappointed in you, Mom.

265
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,130
Eun Byeol. Ha Eun Byeol!

266
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,370
What does she know that she's acting like that?

267
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,580
- You're here? 
 - Y-Yeah.

268
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,180
I'm sorry for  repeatedly avoiding your calls.

269
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,080
After hearing what you said,

270
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,750
I had so many thoughts.

271
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,960
I just needed some time to figure things out.

272
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,970
Whether our friendship was genuine or not.

273
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,170
- I'll believe you. 
 - Thank you for understanding.

274
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,910
You once said,

275
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,460
that a mother can do anything for her child.

276
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,590
That sometimes they even become a villain.

277
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,940
  I want to know who's helping her 

278
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,660
 and what she's planning. 

279
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,840
You didn't hear anything from my husband?

280
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,500
He's probably  going crazy trying to look for me right  now.

281
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,050
Not yet.

282
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,500
Don't worry. I won't tell him I met you.

283
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,760
Of course I believe you.

284
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,060
But I'm just worried you would be

285
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,890
in an awkward position because of me.

286
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,970
Is it time for you to be worried about me right now?

287
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,810
Why did you suddenly leave your house? What about your kids?

288
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm really going to end it with him.

289
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,380
It's time now.

290
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,620
To reveal Min Seol Ah's

291
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,070
murderer?

292
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,470
I need to punish the people who killed my Seol Ah.

293
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,650
Ju Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin,

294
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,960
and everyone at Hera Club.

295
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm going to return to them exactly what Seol Ah went through.

296
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,110
And what if you get hurt in the process?

297
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,180
You know the power that the people at Hera Palace hold

298
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,700
especially Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin. They're not easy opponents.

299
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,070
Do you think they'll just stand by and watch?

300
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,890
They killed my daughter.

301
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,680
You want me to leave them alone, knowing that?

302
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,480
What about you? If Ro Na went through all that,

303
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,600
would you be able to stand still?

304
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,700
Min Seol Ah's death was very heartbreaking but

305
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm just worried you'll get hurt.

306
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,040
And on top of that, you said there was no solid evidence.

307
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,220
Just by saying you saw Cheon Seo Jin's ruby red ring,

308
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,460
do you think the police will believe you?

309
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,650
 Please say you'll stop here. 

310
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,650
 Please don't do anything. Then I'll stop too.  

311
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,450
 Please, Unni. 

312
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,540
You shouldn't live like nothing happened after committing a crime.

313
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,160
I put my life on the line.

314
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:17,280
I believe the truth always comes out eventually.

315
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,940
If you just tell the police exactly what you happened that day,

316
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,450
everything will come out slowly.

317
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,370
I already told you.

318
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,850
I already told you.  There's nothing for me to say.

319
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:33,580
That day I was really drunk,

320
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,780
and I fell asleep as soon as I got home.

321
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
Did you really

322
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,020
really not see anything?

323
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,600
You have nothing to say to me?

324
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,250
I should've seen something at least for your sake but

325
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,890
I really didn't see anything.

326
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,000
So I won't be of much help even if I go to the police.

327
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,740
Is that so?

328
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,150
So where are you staying right now?

329
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,610
What are you going to do alone with no one by your side?

330
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,640
Don't worry. I'm somewhere safe.

331
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,340
Where is that?

332
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,840
I'll tell you once I settle down.

333
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,300
Excuse me for a minute.

334
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,720
Hi, Ro Na, I'm kind of busy right now.

335
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,150
The exam? You did that well?

336
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,610
Yes I'm telling you.

337
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,140
The two I took today were 100%, and I only missed one in social history.

338
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,520
I think Ha Eun Byeol flunked again.

339
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,300
See? No one can beat my daughter when it comes to your ability.

340
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,600
Ro Na, what do you want to eat? I'll make you something really delicious—

341
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,680
Okay, I'll see you at home.

342
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,490
I love you my daughter.

343
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,550
I see you made up with Ro Na.

344
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,580
That's good.

345
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,980
Thanks to you.

346
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,490
You look really happy.

347
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,780
I'm sorry. With your situation and everything.

348
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,890
It's okay.

349
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,290
Seeing you smile gives me strength.

350
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,440
You know how much I like you.

351
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,480
 Yun Hui, you're such a great person. 

352
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,190
 Su Ryeon, let's be friends forever.  

353
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,710
 Let's never fight or betray each other. 

354
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,260
 No matter how badly you mess up, 

355
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,410
 I'll never hate you. 

356
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,250
 What will you do once you find out the truth?   

357
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,340
 She'll probably throw me in jail right? 

358
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,260
 Or she might even kill Ro Na. 

359
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,410
 No. Come to your sense, Oh Yun Hui. 

360
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,830
 Su Ryeon believes that Cheon Seo Jin is the culprit. 

361
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,550
 You can't get caught. Think about Ro Na. 

362
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,590
  J King Holdings 

363
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,220
You met her? Where is she?

364
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,530
I don't think she chose a place to stay yet.

365
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,470
Why didn't you tell me you would met her? You should've told me before you left.

366
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,080
We agreed to meet again.

367
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,470
Did you ask about who's helping her? Anything stands out?

368
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,060
She seemed the same as always.

369
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,130
She's as elegant as always and

370
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,570
nothing seemed off.

371
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,040
She didn't even pack anything from home.

372
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,480
I'm certain that someone is helping her.

373
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,430
There's no way she's working alone.

374
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,620
There is someone I'm suspicious of.

375
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,940
But once I'm more certain of it, I'll let you know.

376
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,270
Now it finally feels like I've met a partner that I match with.

377
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,480
Good work. If there's any favor you need to ask of me, let me know anytime.

378
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,660
Can I ask that favor now?

379
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,100
Of course. Whatever it is.

380
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,090
Even if it involves Ro Na?

381
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,570
Why did you crawl back here when no one welcomes you?

382
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,250
Do you think this is the delinquent center?

383
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,140
How can you say something like that, not even knowing if I'm recording or not?

384
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,120
 VERITAS LUX MEA 
 (T/N: "Truth is my light." Motto of Seoul National University) 

385
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,350
Now you're even threatening?

386
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,190
I ask of you.

387
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,330
Seeing you bothers me so much.

388
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,580
Can't you just leave? For the sake of the peace in our school.

389
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,140
Did Teacher Cheon tell you to do that?

390
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,350
To bother me and kick me out of school?

391
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,350
Or do you act on your own in favor of those in power?

392
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,930
You're so aggressive. Really aggressive.

393
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,110
This is why I hate you. You don't know your place and you're fearless.

394
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,530
And you don't seem like the type to receive love from your students.

395
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,900
Do you know what love is?

396
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,560
You'll never be able to graduate from this school!

397
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,970
I'll put my name on the line to ensure that. You got it?

398
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,470
You got it?

399
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,520
So disgraceful.

400
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,600
 Chairman Ju Dan Tae  

401
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,770
Hello? I will be loyal to you until the day I die. This is Ma Du Gi.

402
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,640
Yes, Chairman?

403
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,250
What's the occasion, coming all the way to my house?

404
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,130
I'm sorry for coming here without contacting you when you're resting.

405
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,190
I was very rude to you all this time.

406
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,740
Which rudeness... do you mean by that?

407
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:11,120
Do you mean when you backstabbed us and ran off during Ro Na's Cheong Ah Admissions?

408
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,010
Or when you shamelessly appeared as a teacher at Cheong Ah Art School?

409
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,510
Or when you were ostracizing and punishing only my daughter by giving her penalty points?

410
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,930
I don't know which one you're talking about so I'm a bit confused.

411
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,370
Come to think of it, I was really a bad person.

412
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,410
I give my sincerest apology.

413
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:42,810
I don't know why you're suddenly doing this but it's uncomfortable receiving your apology.

414
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,830
All this time, I didn't pay enough attention to you.

415
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,190
Especially if I had known you were Chairman Ju's best employee,

416
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,410
I would never have made such a mistake.

417
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,980
I already knew you were a person easily swayed by authority,

418
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,260
but this is too expected.

419
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,180
I'm just a naive person. Please look at me favorably.

420
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,590
Since it's come to this, I'll be honest with you. Ro Na will become the subject of special care from now.

421
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,050
No, she is already in, as per Chairman Ju's special orders.

422
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,820
A subject of special care?

423
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,750
She'll be cared for at the same level as Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong.

424
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,210
I see your eyes sparkling. From now on,

425
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,520
please do not hesitate to contact me about anything regarding Ro Na's academics.

426
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,800
Just like how you are peacefully lying here and relaxing to the core,

427
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,970
I will take care of everything.

428
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,430
As proof of Ro Na's special care system,

429
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,650
I'll introduce you to the internal detail oriented academies.

430
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,180
There is an academy like that?

431
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,640
An academy that holds the most of Cheong Ah Arts School's exam information.

432
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,980
It's even a secret among the parents.

433
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,760
All the kids at Hera Palace have already been attending.

434
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,740
I will escort you there myself.

435
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,220
A fog keeps obstructing my sight.

436
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,070
There is too much negative energy.

437
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,750
It's filled with someone's sorrow.

438
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,710
Sorrow? Whose sorrow are you talking about?

439
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,200
I wouldn't know that. You two should know.

440
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,080
No way, Min Seol Ah—

441
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,590
Why is her name coming out of your mouth? Flip the last card.

442
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,020
 Death 

443
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,110
There will be a bloodbath.

444
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,890
Someone might even die soon.

445
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,470
 Death 

446
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,610
That just brought down my mood. I just wanted to ask if Je Ni was going to be accepted into Seoul University.

447
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,260
What was she talking about? Saying nonsense like sorrow and death.

448
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,920
I came all the way down here and paid good money because I heard she could tell the future well.

449
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,440
A subject of special care. A subject of special care.

450
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,830
 My Ro Na is special now too. 

451
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,370
 If I could do more things for my Ro Na.. 

452
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,270
 I also have a favor to ask. Could you stop by my house? 

453
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,340
 The penthouse? 

454
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,090
  Tell my wife you'll pack some of her things and bring it to her.  

455
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,830
 She'll need lots of things because she left in a rush. 

456
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,950
 There should be no one home at 7pm. 

457
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,560
 Hera Palace 

458
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,400
It's so beautiful.

459
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm sorry. I'll get changed immediately.

460
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,800
I told you. I can let you have whatever you want.

461
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,710
Even if that means the penthouse.

462
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,900
Then get rid of your wife Sim Su Ryeon first.

463
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,940
To some place where no one will find her so she can't return.

464
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,270
Can you do that?

465
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,990
That's what I want.

466
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,750
I heard from Hye In that she arrived at the hospital in America.

467
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,180
Luckily, the tests showed that there was nothing wrong. Don't worry about Hye In.

468
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,970
She's at the best hospital receiving the best care.

469
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,920
Thank you.

470
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,450
How is the contract with Ju Dan Tae going?

471
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,630
Tomorrow, everything regarding the contract will be finalized.

472
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,640
Now is the start. The date is set to three days from now.

473
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,680
Three days from now...

474
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,440
Do you think they'll admit the crimes they've committed?

475
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,480
We have to make them. They'll take the bait.

476
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,260
 2020 Soprano Grace Jo's Special Private Concert  Recital for the Children 2020.04.25 7pm 

477
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,150
They'll know once they go through the same thing.

478
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,670
What crime they committed.

479
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:31,850
♪ You visited in my dreams and talked to me ♪

480
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,130
What's the matter?

481
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,790
He said he would tell us once you got here so I don't know either.

482
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,830
I'm sure you're very shocked since I called you this late at night.

483
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,010
But this is a very big issue.

484
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,590
Take a look.

485
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,770
Adulteress alimony lawsuit?

486
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,930
10 billion won for alimony?

487
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,050
Is this woman Sim Su Ryeon insane?

488
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,560
Divorce lawsuit?

489
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,430
Being in this position is really difficult for me. Why did Su Ryeon ask this of me?

490
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
This was why you two should've—

491
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,870
I know. Love is like that.

492
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,500
If the conditions are right, you can  file for divorce through agreement.  The conditions are—

493
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,680
Give up the penthouse, the child custody, parental rights.

494
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,890
Prohibited from seeing the children,

495
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,950
giving up 90% of my property,  what kind of crap is this?

496
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:33,640
This is just telling you to eat loads of crap.

497
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,250
Is this fun for you? You look like you're having a blast.

498
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,070
What have you been doing that you couldn't control your wife and had to make her come after me?

499
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,290
Shouldn't you have been able to stop something like this?

500
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,990
I have so many things to worry about. Why are you involving me in such dirty things?

501
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,280
Don't say another word.

502
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,030
I'm not in the mood to deal with your hot headed temper.

503
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,790
 Caller ID restricted 
 Voice Message 

504
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,950
 Did you like my video present, Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin? 

505
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,680
Who on earth is this bastard?

506
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,650
Don't hide like a coward and show yourself!

507
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:33,510
 Requiem in D Minor K. 626 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 

508
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,160
  The caller is not available. Please leave a message— 

509
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,710
Why isn't she answering?

510
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,020
 Unni Su Ryeon 

511
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,240
 Unni Su Ryeon, I packed some clothes and makeup from the penthouse. 

512
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,510
 If you tell me where you are, I'll bring them. 

513
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,370
Yes, Logan.

514
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,620
You're going forward with the contract?

515
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,660
Today?

516
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,700
  Co-investment contract 

517
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,920
 Logan Lee 

518
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,370
I didn't know you would decide so quickly.

519
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,220
No, there was plenty of time to think about it.

520
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,270
Besides, I was mainly convinced by the fact that you, Mr Ju,

521
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,510
you yourself showed interest in establishing an investment company.

522
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,950
Even with your Myeong-dong land as collateral. That was all the commitment I needed to see.

523
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,690
The only problem is, who will be the chairman.

524
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,660
Of course, if we considered the investment amount, it should be you.

525
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:22,560
But to convince investors on our side, it would be easier if it were me.

526
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,920
Ah yes, yes. Ms. Oh did mention something about that to me.

527
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,680
Not a problem.

528
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,200
A thing like that shouldn't get in the way of our contract now, should it?

529
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,440
I have faith in you, Mr. Ju.

530
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,580
Then I'll set a meeting with investors during the investment explanation next week.

531
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,710
All right. I'm already looking forward to it.

532
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:45,590
Oh, and in celebration of our successful contract,

533
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,870
I prepared a special little gift for you.

534
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,890
 J King Holdings. 

535
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,540
Here you go.

536
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,890
What's this?

537
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,500
Let's just say I have some acquaintance with Soprano Grace Jo.

538
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,420
Soprano Grace Jo?

539
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,030
She's having a concert here in our country.

540
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,530
- That's right. Your daughter, she's studying opera, right? 
 - Yeah.

541
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,750
So when Grace found out about it, she wanted to hold a concert for her.

542
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:17,490
So then I thought it'd be a good idea to invite your daughter and all of her friends as well.

543
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:19,360
The kids will really like this.

544
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,440
So it's all going to be happening this weekend.

545
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,760
Oh, and another thing. The adults will be invited to a separate dinner party.

546
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,640
We'll send you a limousine.

547
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,740
A dinner party?

548
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,460
I don't know how to thank you for such an amazing gift.

549
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,790
Mr. Ju. Now that we're officially partners,

550
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,590
there's no need for such formalities.

551
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,340
Your daughter, she's also studying opera, right?

552
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,230
Yes.

553
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,310
This one's for her.

554
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,330
Thank you, Logan.

555
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,160
Sure thing.

556
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,490
Kids, kids! Let's take a picture together.

557
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,720
Oh, my Je Ni, you're shining.

558
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,550
Grace might want to take her to Italy after she sees her.

559
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,000
One, two, three, cheese!

560
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,130
Do they like it that much? Aigoo.

561
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,230
They're going to faint of happiness.

562
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,480
Grace is not an easy person to meet.

563
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,610
And she only invited our kids. A private concert.

564
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,860
That invitation is worth millions.

565
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:38,660
Logan is a generous person. He's holding a party for us too.

566
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,740
That's why I like American silver spoons.

567
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,890
Honey, honey! You brought the gift, right?

568
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,990
Don't worry. I brought it right here.

569
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,190
What? You guys prepared a gift by yourselves?

570
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,920
You're trying to get all the attention yourselves. We should've bought it together.

571
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,940
What is it? What is it?

572
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,160
Tell me what it is!

573
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,430
But where's Seo Jin and Chairman Ju?

574
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:06,360
Are they coming out together?

575
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,430
Don't talk if you don't know anything.

576
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,620
That's not how things are going on right now.

577
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,180
It's a bit strange.

578
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,130
Both Teacher Cheon and Chairman Ju.

579
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,040
What are you talking about?

580
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,990
I saw and heard something.

581
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,760
  Why did you ignore my calls all day? 

582
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,300
 You still haven't explained why you were at the villa with Oh Yun Hui. 

583
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,900
 I was just resting there. 

584
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,360
 Oh Yun Hui happened to be there with me after the company dinner. 

585
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,440
 Oh Yun Hui was wearing my clothes that you had gifted me— 

586
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,970
Cut. Cut!

587
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,210
Why is Oh Yun Hui appearing right now?

588
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,490
That's what I'm saying. Why is Oh Yun Hui appearing?

589
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,690
Don't cut me off and listen till the end.

590
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,180
He said she changed because she ruined her clothes.

591
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,920
 Do I have to explain every little thing? 

592
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,510
 I heard you signed the contract with Logan Lee. So kick Oh Yun Hui out immediately. 

593
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,740
 Logan Lee wants her, as much as I do. 

594
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,180
 What?  

595
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,950
 Be careful. There are lots of eyes watching. 

596
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,440
 Don't change the subject. 

597
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,110
 I don't know what you're thinking but remember this. 

598
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:23,180
 The promise we made when we started over, that I would decide our relationship. 

599
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,710
 Meeting together and breaking up, 

600
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,860
"is all"

601
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,590
"decided by me."

602
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,330
- Right? 
 - Wow!

603
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,320
They're over, right? They broke up, right?

604
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,350
Oh Yun Hui. I thought she was a calm cat.

605
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,360
But if she connects everyone here and there...

606
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,330
And me—

607
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,620
Seo Jin must've had a hard time.

608
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,510
No way. Oh Yun Hui and Su Ryeon are best friends.

609
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,930
How could she meet Su Ryeon's husband?

610
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,540
Yea, Oh Yun Hui hates Chairman Ju.

611
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,560
Right, Doctor Ha? You know they have a bad relationship.

612
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,530
If they have a bad relationship, how could they work together?

613
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,950
I could tell they fell for each other.

614
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:20,540
She must've been so lonely living alone.

615
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,870
Stop that!

616
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,630
Stop it already.

617
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,790
You scared me.

618
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,600
Why are you like that?

619
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,900
For me,

620
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,640
ex-husbands can hear this much information.

621
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,550
Like foreign vibes, the cool ones.

622
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,830
Why don't you ask her personally.

623
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,760
Chairwoman, you're here.

624
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,350
Seo Jin. No.

625
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,070
Our Chairwoman, your beauty today is like that of an actresses.

626
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,760
And your color selection is amazing.

627
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,930
That's right. I haven't seen that before, is it new?

628
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,050
You look so beautiful, Chairwoman.

629
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,390
Take me shopping with you.

630
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,350
So I can learn how to have a good taste like you.

631
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,610
I'm Logan Lee's secretary.

632
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,450
The car is here.

633
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:31,390
Are we leaving right now?

634
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,500
I'll escort you to the party.

635
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,930
The kids can enjoy the concert in the community room.

636
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,340
- Eun Byeol, I'll see you later. 
 - Have fun.

637
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,800
Hey don't do anything bad.

638
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,400
But isn't Logan Lee close with  Oh Yun Hui? Why didn't he invite her?

639
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,440
What are you doing here?

640
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,620
We wanted to thank you. This is my daughter.

641
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,910
- I'm Bae Ro Na. 
 - Hi.

642
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,500
I really like Grace Jo.

643
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,040
Thank you for inviting my daughter to the special concert.

644
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,760
No, it's my pleasure.

645
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,160
Besides, you played a big part in establishing the contract.

646
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,160
Think of it as a compliment.

647
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,260
But the concert is held in the crystal room in this hotel, right?

648
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:25,010
The Hera Palace kids thought it would be at the community earlier.

649
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,380
I think there must have been some kind of a mix up. I'll be sure to let them know.

650
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,020
Now if you'd excuse me, I was in the middle of doing something.

651
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,130
You guys have a great day now.

652
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,200
Thank you.

653
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,890
Bye.

654
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,580
Let's go.

655
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,440
Where have I seen that bag?

656
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,610
Mom, I'm so excited and I can't wait. My heart feels like it's going to explode.

657
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,840
Am I really going to meet Grace Jo?

658
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,650
How many times are you going to ask? Are you really that happy?

659
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,700
Mom, you're so cool.

660
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:05,350
You work with such an amazing person. You're so cool.

661
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,140
Let's go.

662
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,380
You're were surprised, weren't you?

663
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,470
I'm ok. I'm going to go first.

664
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,560
I'll see you later.

665
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,420
Su Ryeon.

666
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,600
Be careful.

667
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,720
You too.

668
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,520
Here, all together.

669
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,500
Cheers!

670
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,560
How long has it been since we gathered like this?

671
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,400
It's the first time since Eun Byeol's family divorced, right?

672
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,890
Doctor Ha, you have an American mind.

673
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,790
You stay friends even after divorcing.

674
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,140
It's so nice to see.

675
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,630
There was need for you to come too.

676
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,730
You're the unwelcomed guest.

677
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,230
I got properly invited as an investor.

678
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,200
Investor?

679
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,750
The Myeong-dong land I invested in became a part of a co-investment company with Logan Lee.

680
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,030
You didn't know that?

681
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,660
Chairman Ju must have a lot of secrets from you.

682
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,330
The honeymoon phase is usually not like that.

683
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,660
The kids were so happy, I'm so thankful to Logan.

684
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,970
But how come Su Ryeon didn't come? I haven't seen her in awhile.

685
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:46,420
She went on vacation. For her hard work while the kids took midterms.

686
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,180
What's with this mood on such a nice day?

687
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,010
This won't do. Everyone, come on.

688
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,240
One shot!

689
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,370
Cheers!

690
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,610
Cheers!

691
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,150
Cheers!

692
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,600
- This is beautiful. 
 - Right.

693
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,830
 Grace Jo Solo Concert 

694
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:15,400
I'm going to get Grace's autograph on this dress.

695
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,090
If I have a daughter some day, I will pass it on as a family heirloom.

696
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,820
Do you mean we're meeting the prima donna of the New York Opera?

697
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,770
She is going to perform and even do an audition for us.

698
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,600
Can't I write down this kind of meeting on the personal statement?

699
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,550
'I received a personal audition from Grace Jo.'

700
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,620
By the way, why did Grace Jo invite us?

701
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:40,280
Father's business partner is an American theater owner so he must be close with musicians there.

702
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,730
Anyway, he must be very rich in America.

703
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,150
This is an important event so everyone be careful not to mess up.

704
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,550
Why am I

705
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,560
so tired?

706
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,710
Why isn't she here yet?

707
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,190
I know right, it's been a while.

708
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,990
It's my mom.

709
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:42,270
Mom, did you arrive yet? How's the party? It's awesome, right?

710
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,290
Hello? Mom, why aren't you saying anything?

711
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,810
 Je Ni, save me! 

712
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,980
What's wrong? What happened?

713
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,420
What?  What's going on?

714
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,460
I don't know. She just called me crying asking me to save her.

715
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,820
What's wrong with my phone? I don't have signal anymore.

716
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,000
I'll call Father.

717
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,030
It doesn't work for me either.

718
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,200
It's dead.

719
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,820
At Hera Palace? There's no way.

720
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,270
This won't do. I want to go out and try calling.

721
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,170
Me too.

722
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,130
What is this? What's wrong with this?

723
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,430
The door doesn't open!

724
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,140
What are you talking about? Move.

725
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,890
What the heck?

726
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,210
What are you doing? Why would the door be locked?

727
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,180
Open up!

728
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,320
 Everyone, go back down and take your seats 

729
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,610
What the—  Who is that?

730
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,200
- Who is it? 
 -Whose voice is that?

731
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,730
Who's playing this kind of joke!

732
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,610
 Everyone, calm down. 

733
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,190
 The show is about to begin. 

734
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,240
Cut it out and just open the door!

735
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,810
Chairman Ju!

736
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,820
Doctor Ha!

737
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,570
Attorney Lee, Attorney Lee!

738
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,770
- Ugh my head. 
 - Teacher Cheon!

739
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,780
Get up!

740
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,280
Ow, my head.

741
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,750
Sang Ah, wake up.

742
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,300
Wake up!

743
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,730
Where are we?

744
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,510
Oh, hey.

745
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,970
Ah damnit.

746
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,340
What is this?

747
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,600
What is this?

748
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,480
- What is that over there? 
 - What?  What is it?

749
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,840
It's on fire.

750
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,730
What?

751
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,620
What the—

752
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,330
What is that?

753
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,990
Mom?

754
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,000
Mom!

755
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,820
Mom!

756
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:26,360
Mom!

757
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,290
Mom!

758
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:30,800
What is that? Mom!

759
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,200
Why is my mom there?

760
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,190
 Mom! 

761
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,200
 Hera Palace 

762
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,910
 Let us out! 

763
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:53,480
I have your parents. They need to be punished.

764
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,720
What bullshit are you spewing!

765
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,960
Are you saying you kidnapped our parents? Do you even know who my dad is that you're doing this?

766
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,600
Come out right now.

767
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,790
Is anyone out there!

768
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,370
We're in here!

769
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,130
Pick up!

770
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,030
She's not answering. Mom.

771
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,180
Mom!

772
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,770
No!

773
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,020
 It's no use. 

774
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,510
 No one is going to come and help you. 

775
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,450
This voice.

776
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,790
That's... the place.

777
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,890
What do you mean?

778
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,690
Min Seol Ah?

779
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,710
There's no way.

780
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,740
Why would Mom and Dad be there?

781
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,090
Mom!

782
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,850
- Mom! 
 - Dad!

783
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,810
Mom! I was wrong!

784
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,770
No!

785
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,680
What is this?

786
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,020
- It's gasoline! 
 - Shit!

787
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,200
What! What's wrong?

788
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,300
It's a bomb!

789
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,680
We have to survive no matter what!

790
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,240
- No, no! Don't touch it! 
 - Don't move!

791
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,020
Look at here! The door is locked!

792
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,870
What?  The door?

793
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,960
Save me! Save me!

794
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,380
Save us!

795
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,660
There's no signal!

796
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,620
Mine too.   There's no signal.

797
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,380
Over there! There's a person over there!

798
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,090
- Where? 
 - Over there!

799
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:54,440
Over here!

800
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,260
Don't just stand there but open the door!

801
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,790
- Please take us out of here! 
 - Come over here and help us out of here!

802
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,770
Our dresses are all ruined!

803
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,390
What's going on?

804
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,720
Mom!

805
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,690
What is this?

806
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:17,550
Your parents are going through exactly what you guys did in the past.

807
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,640
Is there something wrong?

808
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,560
Your parents will die instead of you.

809
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,500
No. No. No, Mom.

810
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,330
No!

811
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,630
No! Mom!

812
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,780
I was wrong!

813
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,770
No!

814
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,600
 What an idiot.  I think the fire spread on. 

815
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,230
 Fire? 

816
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,470
 I damaged the door earlier. 

817
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,180
 Save me! Open the door! 

818
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,860
 Open the door! 

819
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,000
 - Let's go. 
 - Then what about her?  

820
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,700
 - I don't know. 
 -Don't go! 

821
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,420
 - She'll figure it out herself. 
 - Let's hurry go.  What if the car blows up? 

822
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,540
 Don't leave! 

823
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,100
 Mom! 

824
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,740
  Why did I call out for mom back then? 

825
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:09,220
 If I had a mom, wouldn't I have gone through something like that? 

826
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,230
What on earth do you think you're doing?

827
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,870
There are people in here! Won't you stop this instant?

828
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:20,830
Hey, are you insane? Why did you start a fire?

829
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,690
 Why? Are you scared of dying? 

830
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,070
What the—

831
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,220
 Was it okay when your kids did it? 

832
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:32,600
 Your kids started a car fire and ran away. 

833
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,550
- What are you talking about? 
 - Tell me in a way we can understand!

834
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,800
- Min Seol Ah! 
 - What?

835
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,600
What are you saying? What do you mean Min Seol Ah?

836
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:48,140
That day, there was a fire in the van.

837
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,340
What do you mean a fire?

838
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,560
The kids lit the candles on the cake

839
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:58,250
and said Min Seol Ah almost burned to death.

840
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:31,770


841
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,080
 The Penthouse Preview 

842
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,810
 Kidnapping, trapping, blackmailing! 

843
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,180
 Min Seol Ah is my daughter! 

844
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,870
 Take a lot of crap so screw yourselves. 

845
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,130
 - Do you like me? 
 - It was hard, wasn't it? 

846
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,280
 Don't be mistaken and think it's going to end like this. 

847
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,870
 The sin that I mistook the real culprit who pushed Seol Ah for my friend. 

848
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,660
 You can just kill her! 

849
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:59,230
 In the most painful way at last.
