 Timing and Subtitles provided to you by The Penthouse Tangles Team @ Viki.com  

2
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,580
Clean up where it was touched by her 10 or 100 times as many as needed.

3
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,230
I feel it's dirty and disgusting.

4
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes, Chairman.

5
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,110
Honey, are you that kind of person?

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,950
What do you mean?

7
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,790
I know she did wrong.

8
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,210
But she's still young.  Don't you think you went too far?

9
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,960
Are you saying now  I was wrong?

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,430
We should've set a good example for the sake of the children's upbringing.

11
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,460
Isn't that a parent's role?

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,050
You didn't act like an adult today.

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,310
 You conned the GED (testers) and you live in Jewelry Village. 

14
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,430
 Do you think a top school like Cheong Ah Arts would accept a con artist like you? 

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,180
 And this is my warning to you, live your life properly. 

16
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,120
 I heard you stole Seok Gyeong's keyring. 

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,970
 A total thief and con artist, aren't you? 

18
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,970
 Someone like you cannot attend the same school as us. 

19
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,360
 So your top score acceptance at Cheong Ah Arts will be, of course, canceled. 

20
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,850
I've just lived diligently.

21
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,570
I've just tried like crazy to do my best.

22
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,700
Sugar,

23
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,680
I only have you.

24
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
 Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong's Mother:  Excuse me for sending a text so late at night. Did you get home safely? 

25
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,340
 Anyway, congratulations on  becoming the top scorer for admission to Cheong Ah Arts. 

26
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,600
 You look like you must have a very beautiful voice. 

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,480
 My Daughter, Music Fairy Yu Je Ni,  Congratulations on Admission To Cheong Ah Arts - From Dad, Dubai 

28
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you. 
    

29
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,480
The right side tilted a little bit,

30
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,560
so lift the left side 10 cm up. Yes.

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Level it horizontally. Okay!

32
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,610
When I'm the one accepted, why are Mom and Dad's names there? 
    

33
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,990
It's so embarrassing.

34
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,210
Just let me use this opportunity to put my name on the banner thanks to you.

35
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,920
It looks just great.

36
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,880
Really, don't you think Dad would come to visit us on such a day?

37
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,520
He only sent a text, without even calling me.  It's so disappointing.

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,510
It's because Dubai is so far away.  Please understand him a little bit.

39
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,060
But in return, he sent us a lot of congratulatory money.

40
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,550
Oh, let's take a picture together so we can send it to Dad.

41
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,020
One.

42
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,490
Cheese!

43
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,230
- Je Ni! 
 - Oh my!

44
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,090
Congrats!  Congratulations!  Here.

45
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,640
And this, too.

46
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,700
Thank you.

47
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,320
Je Ni's mother, howâ€”

48
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm treating all the students to a buffet, instead of the school providing lunch today.

49
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,220
And I've separately made reservation for a teachers' dinner with the best grade of Korean beef this evening.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,730
Oh my!  You're really generous, Je Ni's mother.

51
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,160
Je Ni's mother, take even this.  This.

52
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,900
Oh my!

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll gladly take and enjoy it.

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,090
You know my mind!

55
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,250
Then bye.

56
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,300
 Congratulations on Je Ni's Acceptance to Cheong Ah Arts! 

57
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,280
Bae Ro Na, I heard you're  Number 1 on the waiting list.

58
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,590
- You, really? 
 - Number 1 on the waiting list?

59
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,260
Oh my!  How pitiful!

60
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,080
You were jumping around, acting so confidently...  Now, your nose falls off and you look dispirited.

61
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,960
That's why you should know your place.

62
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,060
How did you dare to consider sending her to Cheong Ah Arts although she didn't have any ability?

63
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,250
The person who doesn't have any ability is your daughter, not my Ro Na!

64
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,670
Something definitely is wrong.

65
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,050
How was Je Ni accepted but Ro Na wasn't accepted?

66
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,380
Even though you see this, huh?

67
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,620
Even though you see it, you still have the delusion of being persecuted?

68
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,830
This is the truth and that is the justice.

69
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,490
Understand?

70
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,960
Oh, right!  I heard there is an orphan among the admittees.  You should meet her.

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,070
Who knows?  If you give her an ample amount of money, she may give up her spot.

72
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,890
- Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations!

73
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,100
You should eat some.

74
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,140
My mom treats everyone for my admission.

75
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't feel I should talk to you.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,830
Please get out of my sight.

77
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,100
You wish one of the admittees would just die, don't you?

78
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,140
Then you, Number 1 on the waiting list, could get in.

79
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,530
Wow,  you look like you could kill someone.

80
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,260
But what will you do?  The accepted candidates were already pre-decided.

81
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,120
You scut  (tail-end) !

82
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,360
What do you mean by that?

83
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Don't you know?

84
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,190
Within the Vocal Music quota of 23 admittees, they will pre-qualify a family member who is out of tune

85
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,930
and accept a few whizz-kids to complete the variety.

86
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,150
Then they would never have to accept a kid like you.

87
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,920
Don't you think a  kid who has to even worry about buying a dress matches the level of Cheong Ah Arts?

88
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,000
- Hey, Yu Je Ni! 
 - And...

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm telling you this because you're pitiful.

90
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,840
There has never been a chance for a person on the waiting list to get accepted since Cheong Ah Arts  opened.

91
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,860
Therefore, don't dream that your vain dream will come true, just give up on it already.

92
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,420
There'll be an orientation for admittees tomorrow.

93
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,230
And there'll be a congratulatory party at Herapalace a few days later.

94
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,330
Are you jealous yet? Tease ya!

95
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,750
Yes, Eun Byeol.

96
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, Cheong Ah Arts' orientation notice?

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,160
Of course, I've received it.

98
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,490
What time are you going to leave for the orientation?

99
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,200
- Around 8 AM?  Am I going to leave around that time? 
 - Eun Byeol?

100
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,900
 I see. Shall we go together? 

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,110
 I think Ha Eun Byeol messed up. 

102
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,760
 Why would you worry about her? Her grandfather is Chairman of the School Board. 

103
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,290
She made a mistake that time for sure.

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,890
Please let me see Teacher Cheon Seo Jin.

105
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,790
Oh please! I have something I must talk to her about.

106
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,610
How many times have I told you?

107
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,870
You can't get in without an appointment. Don't make a fuss and leave.

108
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,820
 Soprano Ha Eun Byeol 

109
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,120
Hey!

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,050
What on earth are you doing?

111
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,300
 Congrats on admission to Cheong Ah Arts 

112
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,450
Hey!

113
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,380
Hey, Bae Ro Na! What are you doing?

114
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,980
- Do you know her? 
 - That's her.  Number 1 on the waiting list.

115
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,200
Ah... By the way, what's up with being violent here? 
    

116
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,310
You are Ha Eun Byeol, aren't you?

117
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,890
Why are you doing this?

118
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,280
I saw you.

119
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,520
You were crying when you left the test place.  You made a (big) mistake, didn't you?

120
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,980
What are you talking about?  Which mistake did I make?

121
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,740
Even though you made a mistake and ruined your test, you were still accepted with your mom's power, weren't you?

122
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,530
I heard your grandfather is the chairman of Cheong Ah Arts.

123
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,650
There is something going on, right? There is, right?

124
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,030
Let go of me!  It's not! Let go of me!  It's not!

125
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,800
Aren't you stopping?

126
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,960
What is this all about?

127
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,090
If I behaved like this you'd meet me.

128
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,520
- What? 
 - Please tell me

129
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,420
the reason I was rejected.

130
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,690
I didn't make a mistake like Ha Eun Byeol. I didn't do anything wrong on the lyrics or the tones.

131
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,880
Then why was I rejected when I was like that?

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,340
Please open the test scores to the public.

133
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,850
Before seeing the scores, I will never understand the situation.

134
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,160
You look exactly like your mother.

135
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,360
Always acting like a victim.

136
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
- What did you say? 
 - Just accept it as is.

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,350
You were rejected because you lack ability.

138
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,330
Then how about her, the one who made a mistake?

139
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,270
It wasn't a big mistake.

140
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,760
And we're looking for potential when accepting someone at the entrance exam.

141
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,490
You don't have a talent for the music,

142
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,900
therefore, stop acting violently and leave here immediately.

143
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,280
No.

144
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,130
I'm sure there was a corrupt admission.

145
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,000
I can never accept this situation.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,590
Corrupt admission?

147
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,240
Can you take responsibility for what you just said?

148
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,410
The admittees had already been decided from the beginning, weren't they?

149
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,300
That's why Ha Eun Byeol was accepted although she made a mistake!

150
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
If you don't leave here immediately, you'll be dragged out.

151
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,410
The person who bought off my tutor was you, right,  Ahjumma?

152
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,770
Ahjumma?

153
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,130
Why should I call you "Teacher" when you didn't teach me?

154
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,960
I won't move even one step from here until I see the scores.

155
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,660
Hey, what are you doing?  Get up!  Get up!

156
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,180
Eun Byeol!

157
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,070
Eun Byeol!  Are you okay?

158
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,330
- My arm! 
 - What's wrong?

159
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,390
- Ro Na! Ro Na!  Are you okay?  Aren't you hurt? 
 - Mom!

160
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,210
- What happened to your hand? 
 - The person who got hurt is my Eun Byeol.

161
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,080
She is so ignorant of how strong she is.

162
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,620
What did you say?

163
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,350
What did you do to my daughter?

164
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,310
Hey, Ahjumma! Ah really.

165
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,000
From now on, you should talk only to me.

166
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,820
Then take care of this matter, Attorney Lee.

167
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,230
I don't intend to make any settlement with them, so take care of it according to the law.

168
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,290
Hey, hey.  Where are you going?

169
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,820
Why did you just let them go?  You just heard only one side and then you're letting them go! What will you do?

170
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,970
What do you mean, "What will you do"?

171
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,730
All that's needed is for you two just to get punished.

172
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,090
Here, I'm submitting the CCTV clips.

173
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,140
And just in case, I prepared this for you to look at by yourself.

174
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,710
In spite of my appearance, I'm a kind lawyer.  Here.

175
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,250
Ah, really.

176
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,180
I was trying to catch her but she was dragging me down, Mom.

177
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,150
That's fine.  Ro Na, it's fine.

178
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,480
Wow, assault, damage to property,

179
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,290
making false rumors, and defamation of character... so many offenses.

180
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,800
Ah right.  She has a history of the Committee Against School Violence (CASV) having to meet because of her.

181
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,300
- Just how did you raise your kid? 
 - Excuse me!

182
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,510
Ah, look here!  Go to the next one.

183
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,810
Mother and daughter are really making a great spectacle.

184
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,990
This...

185
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,360
Oh!  Oh Yun Hui, you're getting sued as well.

186
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,550
For you and your daughter's molestation of Cheon Seo Jin and her daughter, viciously and constantly.

187
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,870
I'm going to request the proper punishment for that too.

188
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,280
And this is for your reference. There will be no settlement.

189
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,730
But if you really want it, for the settlement of both cases together, one hundred million Won!

190
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,040
Does that even make sense?

191
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,150
Up to here, my role now ends.

192
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,500
If you can't prepare the settlement money,

193
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,190
I'll proceed the complaint right away. So do whatever you want.

194
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,110
Why did you offend Cheon Seo Jin, when you don't have power or support?

195
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,900
Is this that she is stupid or naive?

196
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,150
Have a nice day.

197
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,700
Do whatever!

198
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,500
Are you okay?

199
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,970
Oh Yun Hui...

200
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,580
Ah really.

201
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,760
You're late.  Ms. Seo Jin left a while ago.

202
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,510
Ah, is that so?  Then I need to go back to the hospital.

203
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,450
The perpetrator was Seo Jin's high school classmate.  Did you know that?

204
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,860
It's fun, right?  Right, it's fun.

205
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,420
I, Gyu Jin, have a good hunch.

206
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,070
 You're scared, aren't you?   I'm a specialist in love affairs.

207
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,410
Wow, it's so interesting.

208
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,370
 Even though you made a mistake and ruined your test, you were still accepted with your mom's power, weren't you? 

209
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,350
 I heard your grandfather is the chairman of Cheong Ah Arts. 

210
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,640
 There is something going on, right? 

211
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,060
 Won't you get a hold of yourself?  Practice!  Only practicing will do! 

212
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,980
     

213
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,580
It was a mistake.

214
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,290
It's not my real ability.

215
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,140
If I just close her mouth, everything will be alright.

216
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,560
Only I.

217
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,320
 There will be no settlement.  But if you really want it,  

218
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
 for the settlement of both cases together, one hundred million Won! 

219
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,010
Oh, is that so?

220
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,720
I don't care even if it takes a long time.  So tell them I won't settle with them at all.

221
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
Yes.

222
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,400
You've been working hard today, Attorney Lee.

223
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,850
There must be something to make you happy.

224
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,830
What is there to be happy about?  It's not like Eun Byeol became the top scorer for admission.

225
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,240
The necklace is pretty.

226
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,110
I've not seen it.

227
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,980
My dad bought it for me.

228
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,500
Are you already sick of the necklace that I bought for you?  You wanted it so badly.

229
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,720
I don't need to wear it every day because you bought it for me.

230
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,500
 Server's News:  Cheong Ah Arts Min Seol Ah's Controversy 
 Is it okay to live like this? 

231
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,230
 Cheong Ah Arts' Top Scorer's Bare Face!!! 
 Middle Schoolers' Reality These Days... 

232
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,300
 - Why did the school make her the top scorer? 
 - If it was at this level, did she get accepted by using bribes? 

233
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,910
 Making me get goosebumps. Is she just a criminal?  I think she should be sent to the youth detention center. 

234
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,380
Of course, we have to clean up this kind of kid.

235
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,020
Don't worry.

236
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,390
I can't allow the school I'll inherit

237
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,430
to get dirty in this way.

238
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,590
Min Seol Ah.

239
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
How dare you deceive me then make what is mine dirty?

240
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,460
If you cancel Min Seol Ah's admission,

241
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,940
then Bae Ro Na, number one on the waiting list, will be automatically admitted.

242
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,930
I can't have it happen like that.

243
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,800
If I get an admission waiver from her first and take care of it on the entrance ceremony day,

244
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,170
I can get rid of both Min Seol Ah and Bae Ro Na.

245
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,430
Both of them can never get into Cheong Ah Arts.

246
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,440
 Orientation for Incoming 2020 Freshmen. 

247
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,140
 Chairman's Office 
 Principal's Office 

248
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,090
 Thinking about it, the waiting list's number one has no real meaning, 

249
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,380
 because the students will never give up their hard-earned acceptance on their own. 

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,900
Excuse me, Seo Jin!

251
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,250
It's all my fault.

252
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,220
It's very natural that you hate me.

253
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,020
But to my daughter... is there...

254
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,800
anything to do for my daughter?

255
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,670
What?

256
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,430
Seo Jin!

257
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,880
She didn't do anything wrong. Please.

258
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,120
I'm begging a favor of you like this.

259
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,390
Don't you think it's too cruel for her to get punished because of us?

260
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,070
Please accept my Ro Na.

261
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,060
You can make it happen.

262
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,790
Right now... you mean I will make her get accepted, using a corrupt admission method, with my power?

263
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,930
Even the great Oh Yun Hui can't help herself in front of her daughter.

264
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,140
You despise our use of money or power.  From the mouth of someone such as you...

265
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,420
- I never expected such words. 
 - What should I do?

266
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,140
I'll do anything you ask.

267
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,260
If you say you don't want to see me, I won't show myself in front of you.

268
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,640
I won't come to school until she graduates.

269
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,070
Seo Jin, if you ask me to clean your house, I'll do it.  Seo Jin, please!

270
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,740
Where is the confident spirit that you'll send your daughter to Cheong Ah Arts no matter what?

271
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't do this to me.

272
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,200
Why don't you even...

273
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,940
kill one of the admittees and

274
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,290
get your daughter into school?

275
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,240
You're that vicious a person.

276
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,760
You'd better prepare the settlement money if you don't want to obstruct your daughter's path.

277
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,680
 I'm notifying all 2020 admittees to Cheong Ah Arts. 

278
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,500
 that the incoming freshmen orientation will be conducted in the respective departments. 

279
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,780
Wow, she works at a bar.

280
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,570
- Her sponsor made her get accepted into Cheong Ah Arts. 
 - How brazen she is.

281
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,470
If I were her, I would give up entering because it's embarrassing.

282
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,930
Hey, if she knew it, do you think she would work at a bar?

283
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,270
Did you see me working at a bar? Or having a sponsor?

284
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,740
Look at her eyes. They're really spiteful.

285
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,810
Let's go.  I'm afraid we'll get splashed with filthy wastewater.

286
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,140
Wow, this protagonist is different.  I thought you wouldn't dare be here.

287
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,580
You're really high-spirited.

288
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,390
Don't bother me.

289
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,550
I don't intend to keep up with or play your childish game.

290
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,380
Let's pretend not to know each other in the future.

291
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,770
Where do you get all that confidence so you act up like this?

292
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,410
Do you think you can get through here just with your pride?

293
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,480
You're the shame of Cheong Ah Arts so disappear from our school.

294
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,600
Don't mess with me.

295
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,560
What?  Are you scared?

296
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,120
Won't you let her go!

297
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,340
Everyone, take a seat.

298
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,960
Who is Min Seol Ah here?

299
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,350
 Chairman's Office 
 Principal's Office 

300
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,510
Come on in.

301
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,950
We have a lot to talk about, don't we?

302
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,860
You must know my father is the chairman of Cheong Ah Arts.

303
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,100
If you sign a waiver refusing admission on your own,

304
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,860
I won't have any other issues with you. 
  Abandonment of Admission Application Form 

305
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,240
You're the so-called top scorer at Cheong Ah Arts.

306
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,600
We should make you look good.

307
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,950
Sign there and leave.

308
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm going to attend this school.

309
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,070
- What? 
 - I don't know why I have to give up school.

310
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,060
You're really not an ordinary kid.

311
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,240
Is the innocent face saying you  after you deceived people?

312
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,190
It's a crime of fraud when you were paid tutoring fees with a forged ID and documents.

313
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,380
I was admitted to this school fairly by my own competence.

314
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,360
I think this is a different issue from tutoring.

315
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,270
A different issue?

316
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,450
Such a young kid has no fear.

317
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,570
Do you want to ruin your life with forged documents?

318
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,580
At least, I did my best for what I got paid.

319
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,890
You also were grateful to me that Eun Byeol's grades went up.

320
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,100
If you still think the tutor fees are an issue, I'll pay them back by doing part-time jobs, no matter what.

321
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,080
So I won't give up school.

322
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,800
You're always such an insolent and absurd brat.

323
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,340
Because of a kid like you, orphans get criticized.

324
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,820
Don't say unnecessary things, just sign here immediately and leave!

325
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,440
Please let me sing.

326
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,130
I want to sing.

327
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,680
Do you think I'd accept you even if you act like this?

328
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,000
I get goosebumps and terrified that my pure Eun Byeol might have been tainted by you.

329
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,870
I feel filthy, just thinking she breathed in the same place as you.

330
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,110
Of all people, we were involved with one who didn't get any home discipline.  Ah really!

331
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,120
I'm the same human as Eun Byeol.

332
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,560
Did I transmit any kind of disease to her?

333
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,470
It's not only your daughter who is precious.

334
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,800
How dare you compare yourself to her?

335
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,030
Is an orphan like you, without even the fundamentals,

336
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,870
the same as my precious daughter?

337
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,790
Eun Byeol would know, right?

338
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,390
What kind of person her mother is?

339
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,760
What are you trying to say?

340
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,120
35th floor, garden.

341
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,810
Penthouse Ahjussi.

342
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,350
What?

343
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,940
Eun Byeol is very conscious of Seok Gyeong.

344
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,130
If she finds out the relationship between Penthouse Ahjussi and you,

345
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,370
what will happen to her?

346
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,060
What did you just say?

347
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Now, do you get it? What I am saying?

348
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,610
I'm going to attend this school.

349
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,990
If you let me attend, I won't tell anyone about it.

350
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,190
What crap!

351
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,750
What did you see to act like this?

352
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,370
Do I really need to say it with my own mouth?

353
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,840
You misunderstood.

354
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,220
I'm not so sure.

355
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,760
After seeing this video clip, other people might also think that way.

356
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,190
But I don't know either.

357
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,600
Then I'll see you at the beginning of the semester.

358
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,480
Video clip?

359
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,420
I'll invite you next time for sure.

360
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Will her admission be canceled if the situation is like this?

361
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,390
She was already summoned to the chairman's office.

362
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,350
 But I heard she was the top scorer for admission. 

363
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,940
 She must sing very well. 

364
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,010
The top scorer's admission can be canceled?

365
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,720
- Hi everyone, excuse me but may I see that? 
 - Yes.

366
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,920
Thank you.

367
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,980
- She is the top scorer? 
 - Yes.

368
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,990
But she may be kicked out.

369
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,930
She is an orphan. She got caught when she was working at a bar.

370
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,070
- Hey, is she Min Seol Ah? 
 - Huh?

371
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,980
- Yeah. 
 - She has presence.

372
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,680
Thank you.

373
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,030
Why did you visit Hye In all of a sudden?

374
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,950
The children's entrance exams are over.

375
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,850
So I wanted to concentrate more on Hye In.

376
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,570
Hye In's condition has gotten much worse lately.

377
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,260
All right, do so.  I'll stop by as soon as I finish my work.

378
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,810
All right. Take care of her.

379
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,560
 Diamond's color is elegant and dazzling. 

380
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,870
 It looks just like her. 

381
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,270
 I like it. 

382
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,860
-  I'll wrap it. 
 - Yes. 

383
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,600
 Ms. Su Ryeon? 

384
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,210
 What's the matter?  You're calling me first? 

385
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,860
 It makes me happy. 

386
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,580
 Oh,  are you coming this vacation? 

387
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,130
 - My parents started talking about our marr... 
 - Let's 

388
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,670
 break off our engagement. 

389
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,030
 What did you just say? 

390
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,930
 I can't deceive myself by denying my feelings anymore.  

391
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,840
 I've already told my Dad about it. 

392
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,240
 I'm going to be married in the States soon. 

393
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,460
 I'm sorry, Dan Tae. 

394
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,670
 I won't be reachable from now on. 

395
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,950
 Hello?  Hello? 

396
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,810
 By whose decision? 

397
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,690
 By whose decision, do we break off our engagement? 

398
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,450
 By whose decision? 

399
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,620
 According to whose decision, do we break off our engagement? 

400
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,380
Is that bastard still so precious?

401
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,180
So much that she hasn't let go of him yet?

402
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,340
Yes?

403
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,220
 We are in big trouble. 

404
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,820
That girl knows?  Are you sure?

405
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,500
She knows about this place.  She must've seen us.

406
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,210
If she opens her mouth, we'll be over.

407
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,480
You don't need to worry because there is no CCTV on the 35th floor.

408
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,880
But she has proof.

409
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,600
I think she video-taped something with her phone.

410
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,400
No matter what, we have to find it and get rid of it.

411
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,430
She is an interesting child.

412
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,900
I'll take care of it.

413
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,890
Are you crazy?  Is this a time to be doing this?

414
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm so nervous I am going crazy.

415
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,460
Because of that little wench, are you wavering?

416
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,390
Cheon Seo Jin is.

417
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,910
That girl, Min Seol Ah, is not an ordinary girl.

418
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,030
It's not a time to be relaxed.

419
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,260
I'm Ju Dan Tae.

420
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,860
Do you think I'm going to easily fall apart because of such a child?

421
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,760
What are you going to do?

422
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,820
Do you have a way to handle it?

423
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,010
That kind of child is so obvious.  Pretending to be smart.

424
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,580
She is going to use the card she has, no matter what.

425
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,710
She doesn't know the card will become

426
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,520
a knife that will stab her.

427
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,270
 If only you disappear, 

428
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,450
 if only you give up, 

429
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,930
 I must be out of my mind.  How can I think of stealing from such a poor girl? 

430
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,540
 There must be some other way. 

431
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,460
Hurry up, tons of dishes are backed up.

432
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,850
I'm sorry, I'll finish them quickly.

433
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,120
Damn, this is why I shouldn't hire young kids.

434
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,050
I hired you since you begged for this job so much and your wages are low.

435
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,930
Ro Na's mom! I heard you're thinking of moving.

436
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,250
Did your landlord ask you to move out?

437
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,730
 No, I'm thinking of moving to a smaller place. 

438
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,570
Where are you thinking of moving to?

439
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,480
I haven't decided yet.

440
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,460
Since it's just the two of us, me and my kid, any place will be fine, I guess.

441
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,580
It's not easy to raise a child.

442
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,290
Take your time.

443
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,960
Let them unplug it. This is a meaningless treatment for the prolongation of her life without any possibility of hope anyway.

444
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,460
Let's stop it now.

445
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,670
She has lived quite long,

446
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,970
enjoying the earnest care from her fake mom and fake dad.

447
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,660
Don't you agree?

448
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,720
Madame will be shocked.

449
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,800
From now on,

450
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,740
she should get a proper taste of hell.

451
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,550
Prepare it discretely.

452
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,200
I'm not sure if it's okay to do it.

453
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,800
If the plaintiff knows, damn...

454
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,990
As you know, this plaintiff is no ordinary person.

455
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,950
For that part, I'll take responsibility.

456
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,870
I sent you the settlement payment, so please relay it to her, Attorney Lee.

457
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,640
Well, fine since there is no loss on my end.

458
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,520
Here.

459
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,260
By the way, is she your first love?

460
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,260
I can see she's your first love.

461
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,360
I thought you were the ambitious type,

462
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,980
but our hottie, hottie Dr. Ha has a naive side too.

463
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,580
Although she is your first love,

464
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,210
how can you use a huge amount like 100 million Won as if it's 10 Won?

465
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,120
Or... Wait!

466
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Are you two still in a relationship?  Since when?

467
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,280
Even if you're busy, you can still do what you want to do.

468
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,040
- It's nothing like that. 
 - Wow.

469
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:06,490
If Seo Jin finds out, she will kill both of us, right?

470
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,540
In Herapalace,

471
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,100
a murder might occur, like a bloodbath...

472
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:20,260
When Seo Jin unreasonably demanded 100 million Won, there was a sure reason, now I can see it.

473
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,310
No wonder, I could smell adultery.

474
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,510
As an attorney specializing in divorce cases,

475
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,130
my intuition is totally famous in this fieldâ€”

476
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,550
Damn it, I told you to stop!

477
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,320
Sheesh, that was scary!

478
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,460
Hey! I'm thinking of telling my mom on you!

479
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,950
What did you call us to gather here for?

480
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,530
This is the petition signed by us, the upcoming freshmen's parents.

481
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,870
It's about our demand to cancel Min Seol Ah's acceptance.

482
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,660
You can sign it and give it back to me.

483
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,620
Since I couldn't just sit and watch,

484
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,750
I'm going to step forward and lead this case.

485
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,660
Of course, we can't let our children attend school with such a kid like her.

486
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,980
We've already signed it.

487
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,750
Su Ryeon, you will sign it too, won't you?

488
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,110
Do we have to go this far?

489
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,940
All these adults versus a child?

490
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,320
I can't agree to it.

491
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,390
T-T-That woman again is pretending to be the lone noble-minded one.

492
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,170
She's always making a big deal out of things.

493
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,180
Why did you initiate this kind of thing without my permission?

494
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,070
Just as you please, Je Ni's Mom?

495
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,580
What...?

496
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,010
We stepped forward for your sake, thinking you might be in a bit of an awkward position here.

497
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,610
What is this reaction now?

498
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,540
By any chance... Does Min Seol Ah also know about this petition?

499
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,880
O-Of course, I guess?

500
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,490
This news is also known by all the kids.

501
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,370
Why are you doing things you were not asked to do?

502
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,900
What good is it to provoke her?  I was going to take care of this myself!

503
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,540
 Will I be the only unqualified one? 
   

504
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,660
 Spare me! Spare me, please! 

505
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,320
 Here, here, look this way! 

506
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,250
 I'm telling you, I'll make a good video of you.  

507
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,670
 - Nose, nose!  
 - Oh my god!

508
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,050
 Please, save me! 

509
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,940
What on earth is this?

510
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,160
What's this?

511
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,300
 Don't be afraid.  Starting now we're just throwing a celebration party. 

512
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,910
 A grand party to congratulate our Teacher Anna for her top-scoring admission. 

513
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,900
 You said we were pitiful? 

514
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,560
 We should stomp on her.  Your parents left you because of the way you are! 

515
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,920
 Smile! You look like a stone now! 

516
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,950
 You think you can win against me? 

517
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,710
Tell us everything as it was, honestly.

518
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,570
What's the point of asking them?

519
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,230
We can clearly see that the leader was Seok Hun.

520
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,900
Seok Gyeong initiated the plan and Seok Hun executed it,  correct?

521
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,530
It also seems my Je Ni was just following them reluctantly.

522
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,000
Our Min Hyeok too.  His voice was barely heard, right?

523
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,620
I know, right?

524
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,500
They said Min Hyeok was filming it.

525
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,170
And Je Ni's words were the harshest ones.

526
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,700
The fact here is that all of them took a turn in forcing her to drink, isn't it?

527
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,200
The key point, in this case, is the group lynching.

528
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,440
All of our kids did wrong.

529
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,030
It's a wrongdoing, so horrible and shameful.

530
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,430
As their parents, we all also share the biggest responsibility.

531
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,380
The wrongdoing was done by our kids,

532
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,060
but we were all thinking of kicking this student, Min Seol Ah, out.

533
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,700
- Aren't we then all terrible? 
 - So what?

534
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,750
We all should properly apologize and ask her forgiveness.

535
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,310
And we don't have any right to stop her acceptance into Cheong Ah Arts School either, of course.

536
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,690
So, do you mean we should be swayed by that wicked kid?

537
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,970
If this gets out to the public, do you think it will be okay for Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong?

538
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:48,120
Not just the hard-earned acceptance to Cheong Ah Arts School, but later for Seoul National University, this will be a problem.

539
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,720
Don't you think you're not taking this case seriously enough?

540
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,680
So what? Are you suggesting that we ignore it without giving any apology?

541
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,360
We'd better invite Min Seol Ah over and talk with her.

542
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,730
As we have the party celebrating the first anniversary for Herapalace tomorrow,

543
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,510
we can't let any problems ruin the party.

544
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,870
Until then, all of you should be careful with any words and actions.

545
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,890
Who turned it off...

546
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,580
 You've been deceived by Ju Dan Tae.  

547
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,000
 Ju Hye In is not your daughter. 

548
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,710
 Bio-Geno - The Best DNA Test Institute in Korea 

549
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,800
 DNA Test Results 

550
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,550
According to this DNA test, it is confirmed that you are not her biological mother.

551
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,530
Hye In is...

552
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,490
Hye In is not my daughter?

553
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,610
How could this happen...?

554
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,490
Then... Where on earth is my daughter...

555
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,970
 This is Seok Hun, Seok Gyeong's Father.  Can we meet at 10 PM tonight at Herapalace? 

556
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
  - Please come to the 50th floor.  

557
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,960
You people are really scary.

558
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,650
Are you that afraid?  Of me spilling the beans?

559
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,800
If you're that afraid, you should've lived your life properly.

560
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,390
Let's go about this the easy way.

561
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,130
The original files of your video clip and voice recording,

562
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,350
you just need to hand them over to us.

563
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,300
Where is your cell phone?

564
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,400
How could I trust you and just bring it here?

565
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,180
I'm not such an idiot.

566
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,870
I'll definitely reveal what kind of people you are.

567
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,760
You're quite smart, aren't you?

568
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,720
However, how long would you be able to last?

569
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,470
I hope you won't suffer too much, though.

570
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,220
 You've been deceived by Ju Dan Tae.  Ju Hye In is not your daughter. 

571
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:05,480
 â™ª Wise men say â™ª 

572
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,380
 â™ª Only fools rush in â™ª 

573
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:25,800
 â™ª But I can't help falling in love with you â™ª 

574
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,640
 NICU - Sim Su Ryeon's baby 

575
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,130
 It seems there was some brain damage due to the premature birth. 

576
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,160
 She only keeps sleeping, poor baby. 

577
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,270
 It's all because of me. 

578
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,620
 Because of me, my baby is... 

579
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,050
 Please don't blame yourself. 

580
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,280
 I'll take care of your baby going forward. 

581
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,410
 I even thought about her name.  Hye In, isn't it pretty? 

582
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,280
 No. 

583
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,650
 You and I were already over. 

584
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,220
 I've never forgotten about you, not even once. 

585
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,120
 After being dumped by you, I got married out of spite and had twin children, 

586
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,400
 but their mother died of sepsis after the childbirth. 

587
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,150
 Can't you become a mother to my poor twin children? 

588
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,560
 Nonsense. 

589
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,690
 Please go home. 

590
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,490
 Both you and Hye In,  

591
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,890
 I'll protect you both going forward. 

592
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,560
 Just like my own twin children.  

593
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,220
How could he...

594
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,080
How could he do such a thing...

595
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,540
Hello?

596
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,840
 Are you now ready to listen to me? 

597
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,080
Who are you?

598
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,900
 I asked you if you now believe that Ju Dan Tae has been deceiving you. 

599
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,230
I don't even know who you are, so how can I believe what you say?

600
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,770
Who are you?

601
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,080
 Don't you want to find your real daughter? 

602
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,010
My daughter...

603
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,520
Is she alive?

604
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,890
Where is my daughter?

605
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,750
 You should find your daughter yourself. 

606
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,540
 If you want to find her, follow my instructions. 

607
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,640
 If you make a rash move, both Ju Hye In and your daughter will die. 

608
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,020
 Just like that man in the States did. 

609
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,310
Did he really...

610
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,670
Did my husband kill him?

611
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,620
 Believe whatever you want to believe. 

612
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,640
 The important thing is that Ju Hye In's heart will soon stop too. 

613
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,790
 If that happens, Ju Dan Tae's truth will be buried perfectly. 

614
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,970
Who would kill my daughter according to whose will?  Hye In is my daughter!

615
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,260
If you touch my Hye In, I won't stay still!

616
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,100
Hello?

617
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,260
Hello?

618
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,920
 Go to Hope Orphanage, located in Yeongdeungpo.  

619
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,060
 Find a child found in December, 2004, wrapped in a navy jacket. 

620
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,530
Hello?

621
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:34,930
Pardon me?  Cheon Seo Jin dropped the lawsuit?

622
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:35,970
How could it be, all of a sudden...?

623
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:39,750
 Mrs. Cheon Seo Jin   is generously forgiving you, just so you know.

624
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,160
She said she doesn't want any gratitude in return from you,

625
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,600
so you'd better not appear in front of her for any reason. Bye!

626
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:55,060
She's not a type to do such things, though...

627
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,050
Ro Na, what are you doing?

628
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,800
It's a weekend, so shall we go out...?

629
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,030
- What are you doing? Stop it! 
 - Let go!

630
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,540
What's wrong?

631
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,050
Ro Na, your neck will get hurt, stop!

632
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,570
Stop it!

633
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:19,100
- Ro Na, stop, stop! 
 - Let go!

634
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,800
I will no longer sing.

635
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,520
What?

636
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,090
Ro Na, don't, please, don't do that.

637
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,300
Your neck will get hurt!

638
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,440
You were right, Mom.

639
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,330
Talent?  Such things don't matter.

640
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:37,340
Money and background are the talents.  A girl like me shouldn't have sung.

641
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,720
So now I don't need any voice.

642
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,030
Ro Na, don't!

643
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,290
It's okay to get hurt on my neck now.

644
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,800
Please, don't!

645
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,260
Ro Na, just hit me, hit your mom.

646
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,740
Alright, hit me instead, Ro Na!

647
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,660
Don't do it.  Please, don't do it!

648
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,900
Please, please don't!

649
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,060
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

650
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,360
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

651
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,900
Min Seol Ah is in the maintenance room?

652
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,990
Then, you should take her cell phone first and destroy it.  Did you find it?

653
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:45,120
Soon she will talk. I'll take care of that matter,

654
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,360
so you don't have to visit her separately.

655
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,020
Even if you provoke such a lowly girl, it will only make her more brazen.

656
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,080
Even so, locking a young girl in a room is a bit...

657
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,340
But we can't let our children get hurt either!

658
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,830
This is a matter affecting our children's lives!

659
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,640
Why isn't Su Ryeon here?

660
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,510
She's not feeling well, so I came alone.

661
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,100
When we see Su Ryeon, she subtly seems not to care about her kids.

662
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,890
Some people might say she's their stepmother.

663
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,960
Let's disperse for now.

664
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,730
Because of today's event, I'm quite busy.

665
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,850
This is Herapalace's party on a large scale after such a long time,

666
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,860
but because of our babies causing trouble, damn! My mood is ruined.

667
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,760
No need to ruin your mood, it's just one rotten apple in the barrel.

668
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,610
To celebrate our children's acceptance to Cheong Ah Arts School, we should enjoy an even grander and fabulous party.

669
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,030
Bingo!

670
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,380
For this, I will be in charge.

671
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,060
 Hope Orphanage 

672
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,650
- Move this stuff ... 
 - Yes.

673
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,900
Who are you looking for?

674
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,660
Isn't this the place called Hope Orphanage?

675
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,700
They moved out.  We started our construction a few days ago.

676
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,850
Do you perhaps know where they moved to?

677
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:02,960
I don't know.

678
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,340
If you have any contact detail for its director?

679
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,970
As soon as we wired the full payment, he changed his phone number.

680
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:12,120
It seemed that the director was closing this orphanage.

681
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,870
Closing the orphanage?

682
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,990
I don't know how he could live together with children in this kind of place.

683
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:21,060
It's full of mildew and its heating system is not working either.

684
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,330
This is like a dumping ground, gosh.

685
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,490
   

686
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,620
I'll pay you handsomely.  The faster, the better.

687
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,280
You said the place already filed that it's closing the business, so where could I possibly find its director?

688
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,520
If you find him sometime today, I'll pay you double.

689
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,480
If you find him before sunset, it will be triple.

690
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,880
Help! Help!

691
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,260
Is it very bad?  Shall I stay by your side?

692
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,190
No need.

693
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:49,630
You're in charge of the event, so you'd better hurry up.

694
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,800
Then, I'll go down first, so take your time getting ready.

695
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,830
Alright.

696
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,220
I'm sorry to make you worry for no reason.

697
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,330
Don't say that, when you're the only one I have.

698
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,060
Come down when you're ready.

699
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,270
Hello? Did you find him?

700
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,990
Where is it?

701
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,530
Damn, sh*t.

702
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:39,670
If it's in 2004, the record is probably gone.

703
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:44,460
When I closed the orphanage, I shredded all the personal information files of our kids.

704
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,040
Did you dump your child at our orphanage?

705
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,840
Why did you close your orphanage?

706
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,630
What about the children who were at that orphanage?

707
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,440
Do I have to explain that reason to you?

708
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,750
All my life, I have fed the orphans other people abandoned

709
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:02,900
and contributed to this country's social welfare!  So I deserve to take a rest now.

710
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,200
You dumped your child then, what's with this f***ing bulls**t now?

711
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,100
After selling a countryside orphanage, you now own this size of a golf practice club in Gangnam? Where did you get the money?

712
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,780
Can you reveal your money source clearly?

713
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,990
If I dig more, something will come up. Shall I start checking one by one?

714
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,260
I'll come here every day

715
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,600
until you show me the information files of those kids, I'll never give up.

716
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,520
If you're confident to bet everything you own and fight against me, go ahead.

717
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:50,040
Here it is.  Fine, I'll give you everything.

718
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,810
Find it yourself, whatever.

719
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,310
Damn, what bad luck today.

720
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,940
Instead, you can't take any photos or leak the information.

721
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,760
Never!  Got that?

722
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,360
- I understand. 
 - Okay.

723
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,700
   

724
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,720
 Where are you, my baby? 

725
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,670
 Mom is here. 

726
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,100
 Wow, they prepared a lot. 

727
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,150
   

728
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,900
Come on, hurry up!

729
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,240
Great job.

730
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,990
Let's go.

731
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:30,030
 Herapalace 

732
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,910
It's all because of you.

733
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,250
Everything is... Cheon Seo Jin...

734
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,040
All because of you!

735
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:29,080
The reason why I'm living in this state now and what happened to Ro Na...

736
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,660
Everything is because of you.

737
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:35,530
I won't leave you alone.

738
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,150
Hello...

739
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,460
Where did you say?

740
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,890
Cheon Ah Arts School? Yes, so?

741
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,180
W-What did you just say?

742
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:52,190
 Student Bae Ro Na is accepted and added to the Department of Vocal Music at Cheong Ah Arts School, I said. 

743
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,130
A-Accepted and an addition to?

744
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,710
W-Why...  H-How?

745
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:03,120
 One of the accepted students died yesterday.  

746
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:16,890
N-N-No way...   D-Did I...?

747
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:27,660

 The Penthouse - Preview 

749
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:41,850
 If she reveals our relationship... 

750
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,880
 They would think of it as just a desperate claim made by a crazy kid.  

751
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,460
 Then, are you saying someone killed her? 

752
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,370
 Did you kill her? 

753
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,430
 We killed her? 

754
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,680
 To protect our children, this is an unavoidable choice we must make.  

755
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,580
 Honey,  here is blood! 

756
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,180
 Ajumma! Your hand is bleeding! 

757
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,290
 With this, all evidence disappears.  

758
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,090
 You people... What did you do to Seol Ah? 

759
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,260
 What did you do!? 

760
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,640
 I'll kill him, tearing him to pieces!
