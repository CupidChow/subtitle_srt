1
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,700
It's because of me.

2
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,570
It's all because of me.

3
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,090
I should've taken care of it better.

4
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,550
I was too late.

5
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,300
Hey why is that  your fault?

6
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,520
How can you stop a psychopath?

7
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,100
Calm down and go home.

8
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,980
How can I drink something like this?

9
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,850
Ahjussi, where's my mom?

10
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,860
Please let me see my mom.

11
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,120
Is she okay?

12
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,590
Why did you arrest an innocent person?

13
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,730
Why is my mom in a place like this?

14
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,800
She admitted everything.

15
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,260
What?

16
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,970
That's not true.

17
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,000
That can't be.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,520
No, no

19
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,440
  The Penthouse's beautiful Hera, Su Ryeon! Rest in peace... 

20
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,040
 The state of shock continues for the murder which occurred at a high end apartment building. 

21
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,790
Su Ryeon rest in peace.

22
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,250
I will never forget you!

23
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,410
  Business Monthly 

24
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,110
Please be in a better place now.

25
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,340
Aigoo.

26
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,990
The apartment price is going to hit bottom.

27
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,240
It drops further everyday.

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,760
How could such a disaster happen?

29
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,540
What's up with you?

30
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,250
What if someone hears you?

31
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,410
There are so many cameras from the broadcasting station.

32
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,490
That's what I'm saying.  Someone died, it's a murder case.

33
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,790
That's why I'm more worried.

34
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
A resident murdering another resident is an unprecedented situation.

35
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,980
The real estate values are plummeting daily.

36
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,970
I'm so worried and scared about how much more it will fall.

37
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,160
Is real estate value important right now?

38
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,570
I'm so scared that I can't even go to pee at night.

39
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,450
How could Oh Yun Hui kill Su Ryeon?

40
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,110
Only Su Ryeon took care of Oh Yun Hui and worried about her the most in here.

41
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,910
She lost her mind after falling for a man.

42
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,620
Su Ryeon is the saddest one here.

43
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,540
That's a total betrayal.

44
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,250
Did you see the news? Oh Yun Hui decorated her house to look like the penthouse.

45
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,100
She even had feelings for someone's husband.

46
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,610
After looking at the picture that she photoshopped her face into Su Ryeon's family portrait,

47
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,540
I was scared so much.

48
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,650
That's why she crawled into Chairman Ju's company.

49
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,690
I'm getting the chills.

50
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,600
Regardless,

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,450
we've got nothing to lose.

52
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,550
Since it became like this, Min Seol Ah's murder reinvestigation will come to a close.

53
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,870
- Really? 
 - Really?

54
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,170
Sim Su Ryeon is dead so how can the investigation be continued?

55
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,080
Both the victim and the victim's mother are dead.

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,960
We should be thankful to Oh Yun Hui.

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,310
Now that I think about it, all the people that were bothering us

58
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,940
have all been cleared in one shot.

59
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,900
Sim Su Ryeon, Oh Yun Hui, and even Ro Na.

60
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,620
Don't be so obvious.

61
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,070
We spent some time together.

62
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,230
Come to think of it, we aren't completely unlucky.

63
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,150
Isn't that right, Attorney Lee?

64
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,150
If we were unlucky,

65
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,770
we wouldn't be living in Hera Palace, would we?

66
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,750
The heavens

67
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,490
are on the side of the wealthy people like us.

68
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,910
The world runs on the taxes we pay.

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Aigoo Su Ryeon.

70
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,470
You went through a lot getting through the funeral.

71
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,750
Stay here for the time being until the house is organized.

72
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,970
Housekeeper Yang will bring the things you need.

73
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,380
Get some rest.

74
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,890
What will happen now?

75
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,100
- About what? 
 - Are we going back to live in the penthouse?

76
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm going to to organize  everything like nothing ever happened.

77
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,970
You have nothing to worry about.

78
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
- Nothing has changed. 
 - Mom died there.

79
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
How has nothing changed?

80
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,210
Are you really alright?

81
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,000
If it's hard on you, take a break from school and study abroad for a year.

82
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,420
Think about it.

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,330
It's always like this.

84
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,010
There's no one who really worries about us.

85
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,250
Mom said she would protect us and now she's dead.

86
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,670
They are all liars.

87
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,450
It's annoying. I hate it so much.

88
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,560
Let's not go back there.

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,260
  30 Years with Patients - Cheong Ah Medical Center 

90
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,250
What are you saying right now?

91
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,320
The medical accident (malpractice) you had a couple months ago,

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,070
- is becoming an issue again. 
 - We already took care of that.

93
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,400
The patient expressed his wish to sue us because the aftereffects of the malpractice have become worse.

94
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,980
And I heard because of the child that died at Hera Palace,

95
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,690
you were even investigated by the police?

96
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,420
Why didn't you say anything about it?

97
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,070
The online community bulletin board is flooded with messages asking to reveal the facts.

98
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,970
What do you want?

99
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,940
You didn't understand?

100
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,340
It means you should step down from the Hospital Director position.

101
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,800
A director should have at least that much responsibility toward his hospital.

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,420
Is it your doing?

103
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,440
Making a problem out of an old accident?

104
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,280
You'll probably have your license suspended for one or two years.

105
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,590
I contacted Johns Hopkins University in America,

106
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,180
so why don't you study over there in the meantime?

107
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Isn't medical negligence caused by lack of skill?

108
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,880
I've already picked someone to fill the position.

109
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,980
Please take care of it  so we can fill the position quickly.

110
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,620
Yes, Chairwoman.

111
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,500
Chasing me out of the hospital,

112
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,970
and taking everything from me,

113
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,740
is this the final picture you wanted?

114
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,290
I'm only trying to return everything to their original places.

115
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,820
The hospital, the foundation,

116
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,100
and Eun Byeol.

117
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,890
That position does not suit you.

118
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,420
So why were you needlessly greedy?

119
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,310
Now there's nothing

120
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,720
you can have.

121
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,700
How do you feel?

122
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,780
I bought some cake from your favorite dessert shop,

123
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,750
would you try some?

124
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,980
Are you really not going to talk to me?

125
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,920
Alright. If you're frustrated you will speak first.

126
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,520
Eat it when you're hungry. I specially ordered chocolate.

127
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,190
Wow.

128
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,650
- Who killed Sim Su Ryeon? 
 - What is wrong with your face?

129
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,540
Man, I told my guys to make sure they escorted you well.

130
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,240
This isn't as good as the hotel, is it?

131
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,290
Who killed Sim Su Ryeon?

132
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,340
When even a great billionaire starves for a few days, it's the same as others for him to become shabby looking.

133
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,420
What's the point of having several buildings in New York when you don't even have a burger to eat right now? Agree?

134
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,810
Answer me, Logan. No, no, no, no.

135
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,810
I mean, Gu Ho Dong, isn't it?

136
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,700
Bastard.

137
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,200
You dared to con me?

138
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,590
Were you trying to get all my Myeong-dong land for free?

139
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,120
Because of you, I had to go to the prosecution office embarrassingly,

140
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,000
my privacy was exposed, and I even almost went to jail.

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,980
Why is that my fault? It's your fault for living your life that way.

142
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,470
I don't intend to kill you.

143
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,870
Nor making you handicapped.

144
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,040
There's only one reason I'm saving you. I just got off the phone with your dad, James Lee.

145
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,220
I just got off the phone with your dad, James Lee.

146
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,260
What did you do, you lunatic?

147
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,760
I negotiated with your father over Min Seol Ah's case.

148
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,700
Min Seol Ah that brat is helping me like this again.

149
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,580
Shut up!

150
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,260
Turns out, your father really went through some tear jerking efforts for his sick son.

151
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,990
Adopting Min Seol Ah from the orphanage, making her go through bone-mallow harvesting,

152
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,470
then dismissing the adoption without giving anything wasn't enough,

153
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,330
so he even framed her as a thief and had her kicked out to Korea.

154
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,080
Top of that,

155
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,540
the details of transactions with the broker, Assemblyman Jo Sang Heon,

156
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,810
came into my hands, how could this be?

157
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,270
This huge secret...

158
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,610
What would your father do if this got out to the public?

159
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,350
Hey, you were at least prepared to send your father to prison, right?

160
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,070
- Just kill me instead.
- No, no, no, no.

161
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,360
I don't even think about killing you.

162
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,830
It seems like you weren't aware but your body is really worth a lot.

163
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,490
For the price of returning you back, your father paid a huge sum of money.

164
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,270
Of course, he even returned the Myeong-dong land intact.

165
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,750
Forget about Korea. And Min Seol Ah and Sim Su Ryeon as well.

166
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,260
Then, adios amigo.

167
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,180
Hey, you bastard! Who killed Sim Su Ryeon?!

168
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,910
It's you, right? You did it!

169
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,110
I swear on my life I'm going to kill you one day, Ju Dan Tae!

170
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,620
Ju Dan Tae, you bastard.

171
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,970
Stop there! Hey!

172
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,010
♫  The vengeance of hell boils in my heart  ♫

173
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:43,880
♫  Death and despair flame about me   ♫

174
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,210
It's been a while since just the two of us were together.

175
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,880
- And whose fault was that? 
 - I'm sorry.

176
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,960
But still, isn't it important that  we returned to each other, despite everything which happened?

177
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:09,290
Now I am certain, you are the best partner for me.

178
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,130
Shall we toast?

179
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,500
I love you.

180
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:26,400
♫  Then you will be my daughter nevermore.   ♫

181
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,400
 Oh Yun Hui! 

182
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,380
 Explain yourself. Why are you with this man?  

183
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,910
 Tell me! What are you doing with him? 

184
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,810
 - Let go. 
 - What are you doing right now? 

185
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,610
 What's your relationship with him? 

186
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,700
  Did you sleep together? Did you? Did you sleep with him?! 

187
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,630
 - Tell me yourself. Tell me! 
 - Get your hands off my woman! 

188
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,080
 What? 

189
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,590
 - How could you do this to me? How could you! 
 - Stop it! 

190
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,650
 I'm really sick and tired of this. 

191
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,980
 If you have time to do this, go protect your foundation. Stop being so possessive! 

192
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,610
 Ju Dan Tae, you bastard! Stop right there! 

193
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,270
 Rest now. 

194
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,140
 Keep your eyes on that woman, Oh Yun Hui.  

195
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,720
 What a nerve you must have to come here! 

196
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,020
 Is the great Cheon Seo Jin really doubting me? 

197
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,650
 - Do I look like someone who would swoon over a girl like that? 

198
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,860
  What do you mean? 

199
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,000
 It was a plan to use Oh Yun Hui. There's no one better than her to use as bait. 

200
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,770
 Tell me what your plan is properly.  

201
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,140
 We have to return to Sim Su Ryeon exactly what she put us through. That way everything will end well.  

202
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,520
 My company, your foundation, and the Min Seol Ah case. 

203
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,990
 Are you saying we should get rid of Sim Su Ryeon? 

204
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,170
 Then what about Oh Yun Hui? 

205
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,970
 That girl is just something we're going to use and throw out.  

206
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,410
 If we play our cards right, she'll do what we want.  

207
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,280
 Isn't she a perfect way to approach Sim Su Ryeon? 

208
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,360
 That's why you need her? Oh Yun Hui? 

209
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,000
 As expected, Ju Dan Tae is still alive.  

210
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,830
 What can I do to help? 

211
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,510
 I need money this instant. 

212
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,000
 Because of Logan Lee, all the accounts were frozen so I can't do anything. 

213
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,440
 - It's been a while, Assemblyman. 
 - Chairman Ju, you know what the situation is like.  

214
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,340
 Meeting like this is dangerous. 

215
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,950
 It's difficult even for me to cover up this case. 

216
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,610
 You can't lose your assemblyman's badge you earned in a hard way by overdoing yourself because of me. 

217
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,400
 Then I'll take it that you understand and will be on my way. 

218
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,100
 This was... my small kindness that I sent you regularly all the while. 

219
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,250
 The amount was pretty huge. 
   

220
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,520
 Can I send it to the prosecutor general? 

221
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,770
 Chairman Ju, what are you doing? 

222
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,040
 I am Cheon Seo Jin, the chairwoman of Cheong Ah Foundation. 

223
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,160
 You should use this opportunity to expand your connections and climb the ranks. 

224
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,800
 I'll also help you with my full support. 

225
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,980
 Make a decision. I won't die alone.  

226
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,900
 You'll only live if I live.  

227
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,080
 Regarding the investigations for the J King Holdings and Cheong Ah Foundations corruption, 

228
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,050
 make a story and wrap it up nicely.  

229
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,120
  Seoul Gangam Police Station 

230
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,340
  You have until today to turn yourself in. 

231
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,570
  Go to the police station right now. 

232
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,580
  If you refuse to do so until the end, I'll ruin Ro Na. 

233
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,870
  Just like Seol Ah. 

234
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,930
  Seoul Gangnam Police Station 

235
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,330
 Secretary Jo, what are you doing here? 

236
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,340
  Chairman is asking you to come to the penthouse quickly. He says it's important. 

237
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,330
  Housekeeper Yang, you're finally starting to earn your keep. 

238
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,040
  You made me realize something very big. 

239
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,060
  If we put this here... It's beautiful. 

240
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,450
  All we have to do it call Sim Su Ryeon. 

241
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,500
  What are you doing? Call her. 

242
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,850
  If you say the kids are in danger, she'll run to come right away. 

243
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,060
  Yes, Chairman. 

244
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,530
  Yes, Housekeeper Yang. Is something wrong? 

245
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,410
  Madam, Chairman took the kids into his study room again. What should I do? 

246
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,820
 Frühlingsstimmen Op. 410 by Johann Strauss 

247
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,060
  She just arrived. She'll be upstairs soon. 

248
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,810
  Seok Hun! Seok Gyeong! 

249
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,890
  How could you? 

250
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,760
  Who's the one who made me come to this? 

251
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,280
  Oh no. 

252
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,500
  The end of your revenge is death. 

253
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,520
  At least you can go meet 

254
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,360
  your daughter whom you miss so much. Aren't you happy? 

255
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,090
  Chairman, I'm here. 

256
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,320
  Chairman. 

257
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,210
  Goodbye. 

258
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,100
  Chairman, are you in here? 

259
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,250
  Su Ryeon? 

260
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,890
  Unni. 

261
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,680
  Unni are you ok? 

262
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:32,160
  What did you say? I can't hear you well. 

263
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,920
  Unni. Unni? Unni. 

264
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,610
  Unni wake up. Unni don't die. You can't die! 

265
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,010
  No, no! Don't die, don't die. 

266
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,970
  Did you do this? 

267
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,020
  To my wife? How could you do such a thing? 

268
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,280
  What are you doing? Take her away! 

269
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,130
Were you moved by Oh Yun Hui?

270
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,280
I swear, never.

271
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,520
Those without anything, will fall for you with just a little bit of attention.

272
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,920
Me, Ju Dan Tae, fall for an insignificant woman like that?

273
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,780
Thanks to her misunderstanding, we were able to protect what's ours.

274
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,320
But why did Oh Yun Hui admit to killing her so easily?

275
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,140
She probably gave up because the evidence was too convincing.

276
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,080
But something is definitely there. Between Oh Yun Hui and Sim Su Ryeon.

277
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,220
Oh Yun Hui seems to have done something gravely wrong.

278
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,090
Something she can't undo.

279
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,230
Doing something wrong? What would it be?

280
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,830
I'm not sure.

281
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,710
Either way, it's not bad for us.

282
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,260
By tomorrow, Oh Yun Hui will be transferred to the prosecution.

283
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,170
She'll be provided with a public lawyer.

284
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,460
Then there will be no issue with finding her guilty.

285
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,530
Then everything is finally over.

286
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,620
A man like you,

287
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,710
is very scary. That makes you more attractive.

288
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,890
You acknowledging that makes me excited already.

289
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,510
But you didn't get blood on your own hands, right?

290
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,700
The murder was done very cruelly.

291
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,130
You think I would? How could I do such terrifying things?

292
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,310
You know I can't even kill an ant.

293
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,910
I took care of it with no issues, so don't worry.

294
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,530
I'm still curious about something.

295
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,580
- Who killed Min Seol Ah? 
 - Why does it matter who did it?

296
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,640
The important thing is that someone we couldn't let around us was taken care of.

297
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,730
Min Seol Ah, and Min Seol Ah's mom.

298
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,020
Bye-bye.

299
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,140
Bye-bye.

300
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,050
Ahjussi.

301
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,000
You still haven't left? I told you there's no point in staying here.

302
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,210
Please let me meet my mom.

303
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,830
There's something wrong. There's no way my mom would do that.

304
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,790
I know my mom the best.

305
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,920
She loved the penthouse Ahjumma so much. It doesn't make any sense.

306
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,410
I'll meet with her and talk to her.

307
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,320
Please let me meet my mom.

308
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,370
Your mom doesn't want to.

309
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,750
We've asked her multiple times and she's said no. What do you want us to do?

310
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,030
She said to go to your paternal grandmother's house. She said she talked to her already.

311
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,080
I won't go.

312
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,860
I'm not moving a step from this place until I meet my mom.

313
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,840
I'm a public defender.

314
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,690
We found overwhelming evidence that you were stalking Ju Dan Tae.

315
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,980
You went in to the penthouse multiple times,

316
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,100
and stole Sim Su Ryeon's belongings, wore Sim Su Ryeon's clothes, and acted like Sim Su Ryeon.

317
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,380
It's all recorded on the CCTV.

318
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,710
You'll be transferred to prison tomorrow as soon as the warrant is approved.

319
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,990
I never appointed a lawyer.

320
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,450
Well it is a pointless game,

321
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,740
but you should show yourself repenting for the sake of your daughter.

322
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,500
That way your sentence can get reduced.

323
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,180
Your daughter is not going home and staying at the police station for a few days.

324
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,740
Are you really not going to see her?

325
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,340
No, I'm not going to meet her.

326
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,660
Just tell her to leave.

327
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,070
I acknowledge all the charges.

328
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,540
Yes.

329
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,670
Please finish up everything quickly, Lawyer.

330
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,450
She's coming out! Do you admit to killing her? 
  Gangnam Police Station 

331
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,680
Why did you kill her? Were you in a warped romance?

332
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,940
Why did you kill her so cruelly? What was the reason for stabbing her multiple times?

333
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,440
Was your murder motive the hatred towards the upper class?

334
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,740
How long have you been jealous of the victim?

335
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,450
Was it respect or hatred?

336
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,740
Do you have anything to say?

337
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,760
Mom! It's not true. You didn't do it.

338
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,340
Tell them you didn't do it. Please! Hurry!

339
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,770
Hurry up and tell them. Mom, Mom.

340
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,440
Mom look at me. Mom please look at me once.

341
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,420
Mom look at me just once.

342
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,590
Mom, Mom. Mom. Mom!

343
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,710
Mom!

344
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,600
  Take responsibility for the housing prices! 

345
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,320
 Psychopath! Hell! Get lost!   

346
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,360
 Go back to the Bosong Village! Murderer! 

347
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,910
 Devil! The devil Oh Yun Hui! Filthy mother and daughter! 

348
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,160
 Hera Palace's shame! 

349
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,380
  A murderer lives in this house! 

350
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,100
  The housing prices are dropping, get out. 

351
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,290
 When will you give me that? 

352
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,160
 It's not anything expensive. 

353
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,390
 It's pretty. 

354
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,600
Hey!

355
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,660
Where have you been? It's been so chaotic while you were gone.

356
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,090
It was so loud I couldn't live.

357
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,800
I thought you ran off somewhere.

358
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,970
So what? Do you want to mock me for being a murderer's daughter too?

359
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,540
Do it. Curse me out.

360
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,650
I'll listen to it all so do it all you want.

361
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,810
Did you eat?

362
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,640
What?

363
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,280
At least eat this. If you're going to cry, you need strength to cry.

364
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,770
Act like you're not home and stay quiet like a dead mouse.

365
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,500
You never know when people will gather here again.

366
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,570
Mom, what do I do?

367
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,490
What do I do now?

368
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,850
 6 months later 

369
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,360
It seems like I'll be released as innocent thanks to you.

370
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,350
How will I ever repay you for your grace?

371
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,690
I told you I would help big time at least once.

372
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,470
This is nothing to me.

373
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,790
I pledge my loyalty to you until I die.

374
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:44,140
And all those stories on the news are fake.

375
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,490
That dead woman did it all for the divorce alimony.

376
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,390
It was all a show.

377
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,640
What was her illness?  Delusional disorder.

378
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,310
She was spewing nonsense saying some dead girl was her daughter.

379
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,410
I can't believe there are such illnesses like that in the world.

380
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,990
- Really? 
 - Yes.

381
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:13,330
 Chairman Ju of J King Holdings who was being investigated for embezzlement, bleach of fiduciary duty, and investment fraud was found innocent. 

382
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,920
 The victim of the penthouse murder case Mrs. Sim 

383
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,180
 was found to have fabritcated documents 

384
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,960
 in order to have an advantage in her divorce lawsuit. 

385
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,840
 Mrs. Sim fabricated company investment documents. 

386
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,750
  And gave them to the police. 

387
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,730
Mom, can I stop now?

388
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,590
I feel like my legs are going to fall off.

389
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,150
Mother-in-law, please don't be mad anymore.

390
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,920
We were cleared as innocent.

391
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,950
Do you know how much money we have spent to prove you innocent?

392
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,120
We used ten lawyers, ten.

393
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,090
As if tarnishing your father's name wasn't enough.

394
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,800
We won't let this happen again, so stop being mad.

395
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,410
Mi Ja, you've done enough.

396
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,070
Son, don't live getting involved in such dirty incidents anymore, okay?

397
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,690
It seems like your father is planning on sending you into politics.

398
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,670
Politics? Me?

399
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,630
Don't you think that at least someone in our family should be in politics?

400
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:27,600
So live carefully and make sure that you're not caught up in that kind of speculation again, okay?

401
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,570
You too!

402
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,760
Yes, Mother-in-law.

403
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,140
An assemblyman?

404
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,270
Sounds good to me!

405
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,640
You've been through a lot going through all those prosecution investigations, Chairwoman.

406
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,860
This is just the result of your efforts to reveal the truth.

407
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,650
The alumni association protested against the investigation as well.

408
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:03,110
And the opera industry constantly released interviews expressing their support for you.

409
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,670
Isn't that obvious?

410
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,960
The donations and assistance Chairman secretly gave

411
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,500
was shown to the society through this incident.

412
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,520
That's what I, Ma Du Gi believe.

413
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,560
I'm glad to know that I haven't been living a wrong life.

414
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,260
Cheong Ah's corruption will never be mentioned again.

415
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,830
I ask that you work hard for Cheong Ah with a new mindset.

416
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,380
Of course we will.

417
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,990
But what about Eun Byeol?

418
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,800
She's returned from her trip safely.

419
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,430
She's going to comeback to school next week.

420
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,480
Since you've been discharged, start going to school next week.

421
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,150
The doctor said there was nothing wrong with your body so there shouldn't be any obstacles when studying.

422
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,290
I'll plan tutors to help you catch up to the lessons you missed. You'll be busy for the time being.

423
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,740
Ha Eun Byeol, how long are you going to keep your mouth closed?

424
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,480
I can't wait for you any longer.

425
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,820
What on earth do you want?

426
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,510
Are you going to give up on school and opera? Do you not care if you don't go to college? Is that true?

427
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,300
Hi, Honey.

428
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,310
What?  A party?

429
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,380
Everything regarding the company has been taken care of.

430
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,260
I made them conclude that the embezzlement was done by Logan and Oh Yun Hui.

431
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,850
I was thinking of having a small party with the Hera Club members to celebrate.

432
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,270
Everyone had a hard time this past while.

433
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,960
Okay, sounds good.

434
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,200
Let's talk later.

435
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,600
Go in and get some rest.

436
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,210
Mom.

437
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,720
Eun Byeol, did you just call for me?

438
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,180
Yes, that's right! As expected, my Eun Byeol.

439
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,370
I knew you would overcome this.

440
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,300
Say something else. Is there anything you want to eat?

441
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,080
I'll make it for you.

442
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,980
Why aren't you asking me? Why I took those drugs.

443
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,570
About that. Forget about it.

444
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,770
We can just start over. Nothing ever happened to you.

445
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,320
If you think that way, do you think that what happened will just disappear?

446
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,000
If you're stuck in the past, you won't be able to do anything.

447
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,260
That's such a stupid thing to do.

448
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,270
Is that why it's as if nothing happened for you?

449
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,720
Grandpa's accident.

450
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,060
What?

451
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,490
 You! You're no longer my daughter! 

452
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,140
 No! Cheong Ah Foundation is mine! 

453
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,770
 - I can't give it to you! 
 - Let it go! 

454
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,160
 Let me go! No! 

455
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,360
 Let me go! 

456
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,260
 Father! 

457
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,570
 If I had just called the ambulance back then, he wouldn't have passed away. 

458
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,810
 If I think about it now, I feel so bad for Grandpa. 

459
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,210
 I was just trying to protect my mom. 

460
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,440
Why are you suddenly talking about Grandpa?

461
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,420
I took the drugs because I really missed Grandpa.

462
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,380
What do you mean?

463
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,970
What do you mean? Say it in a way I can understand!

464
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,440
See? You haven't forgotten about it either!

465
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,560
You miss Grandpa too, right?

466
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,470
I'm hungry. I want to eat pasta.

467
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,600
With lots of garlic. You'll make it for me, right?

468
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,770
You've been through a lot this whole time.

469
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,240
Why don't you move your house with this?

470
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,160
I didn't do it to receive money.

471
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,300
Keep it safe. Housekeeper Yang, you're now an important person to me.

472
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:18,550
 Each check: 100 million won 

473
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,210
 My daughter, when will you fix your habit of flipping your books backwards? 

474
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,860
 What would you do without me? 

475
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,730
 You can just always organize it for me, what's the worry? 

476
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,480
  You were twisting your hair while studying again, weren't you? 

477
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,860
  I don't know, I keep twisting it while solving problems without realizing it. 

478
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,740
 Should I just cut if off? 

479
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,980
  Why would you cut it? I enjoy tying your hair so much. 

480
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,080
  My daughter, how is even your hair so beautiful? 

481
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,510
 I got it from you. 

482
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,730
  I'm late. 

483
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,100
 I'm late. Quickly tie my hair for me. 

484
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,170
 Drink your juice, I'll tie it quickly. 

485
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,060
 - It tastes good. 
  - Really? 

486
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,760
 Drink it all before you go. I put in a lot of good things.  

487
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,640
What are all these useful for? I hate it.

488
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,800
Seok Gyeong, what's wrong? Calm down, Seok Gyeong.

489
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,880
- Let go. 
 - Seok Gyeong.

490
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,720
Let go! I said let go!

491
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,940
Calm down. What's wrong?

492
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,430
I hate her. I hate her so much I'm going crazy.

493
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,920
Seok Gyeong. Seok Gyeong, calm down.

494
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,400
I'll never forgive her for leaving me behind.

495
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,000
It's okay. It's okay. Calm down.

496
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,160
Calm down.

497
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,330
I hate her. I hate her.

498
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,850
It's okay. It's okay.

499
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:19,230
Mom!

500
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,380
Mom!

501
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,420
It's okay.

502
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,460
Mom!

503
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,830
It's ok.

504
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,250
 See? You haven't forgotten about it either! 

505
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,130
 You miss Grandpa too, right? 

506
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:21,970
Eun Byeol can't happen to know anything, right?

507
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,540
It can not be.

508
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,230
There's no way.

509
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,300
I heard Doctor Ha was wrapping up things with Cheong Ah Medical Center and heading to America. Is that true?

510
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,520
He insists on studying more and I see no reason to stop him.

511
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,820
I heard a rumor he was kicked out, being pushed by Seo Jin.

512
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,750
- Honey, are you drunk? 
 - Can you hear me?

513
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,210
I heard Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong are going to study abroad.

514
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,080
The kids wanted to so I'm going to send them for a year.

515
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,060
That's a lie.

516
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,100
Isn't it so you guys can set up to live together without minding the kids?

517
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,570
Must be nice, Chairman Ju and Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.

518
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:03,640
Since you guys don't have your spouses now,  you don't need to hesitate any more.

519
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,180
Oh, I almost forgot! Today is the day of announcing the verdict for Oh Yun Hui.

520
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,610
Is that so? I forgot.

521
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:17,380
Did you really forget? You didn't purposely choose to have this party today?

522
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,940
To congratulate you for the victory in the war of Hera Palace.

523
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,530
What do you mean congratulate? If someone heard that, they would misunderstand.

524
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,610
I was just joking. It's a joke.

525
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,400
By the way, what is going to be the trial result?

526
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,340
Because of the seriousness of the crime, she'll get sentenced severely, right?

527
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,140
Isn't it already all over?

528
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,360
At the point she admitted murdering her, I think it's just a perfunctory trial.

529
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,250
No one knows that.

530
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,550
We can only know once the trial ends.

531
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,520
I'm Reporter Kim Jeong Min from SBC.

532
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,260
I would like to speak with Ms. Oh Yun Hui.

533
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,920
We don't have time since we have to go to the trial.

534
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,220
As you can see, I don't think she has the will to either.

535
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,040
Unni Su Ryeon asked this of me.

536
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,340
Then you have exactly five minutes.

537
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,460
It wasn't easy coming to meet you.

538
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,940
How could you kill someone like that?

539
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,390
Just say what you need to.

540
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,390
What did Unni Su Ryeon ask of you?

541
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,690
  What is this? 

542
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:00,100
  It's a petition. Give this someone by the name of Oh Yun Hui. 

543
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,300
  Oh Yun Hui? Who is that?  

544
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,630
 She's a close friend of mine. 

545
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,220
 She's going to turn herself in tomorrow at the police station. 

546
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,630
 When she does, she'll receive her punishment according to the law, 

547
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,040
 but I feel like she'll need this. 

548
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,420
 Then you can just deliver this yourself. 

549
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,110
 It's because my heart might change.  

550
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,790
 Petition 

551
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,640
 Petition. The Oh Yun Hui that I know, 

552
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,450
 is someone with a warm heart who is righteous.  

553
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:44,680
 I petition you to help her so that she can return home to her waiting daughter safely, 

554
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:51,160
 and so that she can make the mother and daughter's happy memories  

555
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,380
 that Seol Ah couldn't have. 

556
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,500
 I'm sincerely requesting the highest possible leniency. 

557
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,850
 From Min Seol Ah's mother, Sim Su Ryeon. 

558
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,020
Whatever your sin from the past may be,

559
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,740
why did you kill an unni who cared for you this much?

560
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,470
I had no choice but to come here because of my promise with Su Ryeon,

561
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,530
but looking at you is horrifying.

562
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,440
How could do something like that just because you wanted her spot?

563
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,630
I heard she treated you so well!

564
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:29,430
Did you really think that Ju Dan Tae and the penthouse would be yours if you killed her?

565
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,550
Mom.

566
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,400
The Accused Oh Yun Hui had yearned for the dead Sim's life

567
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,040
and has confessed that she hated Ms. Sim to the point of wanting to kill her.

568
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,620
On top of that, the defendant's image was captured on the CCTV

569
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,500
sneaking into the penthouse and even trying on Ms. Sim's clothes.

570
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,980
Attorney, do you have a counter statement?

571
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,510
Defendant has already admitted all of the above facts during her statement processing.

572
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:43,440
However, she had suffered  from the hardships of life for a long time.

573
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,830
And she is a single mother taking care of her daughter.

574
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,770
Please take that into consideration.

575
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,390
I pronounce the verdict.

576
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:20,070
Defendant Oh Yun Hui used to be envious and jealous of the victim who trusted and helped her.

577
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,660
So she murdered her cruelly by stabbing her multiple times.

578
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,990
The crime's viciousness, her intentional murder,

579
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,100
and the shock given to the victim's family being considered,

580
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,120
she can't avoid  receiving a severe punishment.

581
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:39,100
The court judged the anti-humanitarian perpetrator should be permanently separated from the society.

582
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,090
The defendant is therefore sentenced to life imprisonment.

583
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,150
 - Secretary Jo. 
 - Chairman is asking you to come to the penthouse quickly. 

584
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,030
 Chairman Ju. 

585
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,490
 Chairman Ju, are you here— 

586
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,500
 Unni Su Ryeon? 

587
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,630
 Unni. 

588
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,640
 Unni, come to your senses. 

589
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,870
 Unni! 

590
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:09,980
 I'll call the ambulance right away, just wait.  

591
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,100
 What, Unni? 

592
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,600
 Go, go.  

593
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,440
 What did you say? I can't hear you. I can't hear you well. 

594
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,460
 Run away. Run away. 

595
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,330
 Unni! 

596
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,340
I...

597
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,110
didn't kill Unni.

598
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,820
Mom.

599
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,930
What did you say just now, Ms. Oh Yun Hui?

600
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,760
I, Oh Yun Hui,

601
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,170
did not kill Sim Su Ryeon, Your Honor.

602
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,380
I definitely didn't kill Unni Su Ryeon. I swear on my  daughter's name.

603
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,900
I am not the culprit. Please investigate all over again.

604
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,940
This is all fabricated!

605
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,720
I'm not the culprit! I didn't kill Sim Su Ryeon!

606
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,630
Please reinvestigate! I'm not the culprit!

607
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,230
Mom!

608
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:27,210
Ro Na. Ro Na! I didn't kill her!

609
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,090
I'm not the culprit!

610
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:35,340
It's not me! I didn't kill her! This trial is invalid!

611
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,180
I'm telling this trial is invalid! I have something to tell the judge.

612
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,510
Let me go back to the judge!

613
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:46,310
I didn't kill her! It wasn't me!

614
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,640
- No. No. 
 - Go!

615
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,190
Requesting for backup, requesting for backup.

616
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,020
 2607 Oh Yun Hui is fleeing after a rollover accident. 

617
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,980
 Requesting for backup. 

618
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,630
Logan. How are you here?

619
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,300
What happened?

620
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:08,030
 Breaking News. Today, when the defendant sentenced with a life sentence in court was on her way to prison, 

621
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,850
 the prisoner transport vehicle overturned in a car accident and it allowed the defendant to escape. 

622
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:16,220
 The escaped offender Oh is the culprit of the Hera Palace resident's murder case. 

623
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,080
Ro Na! 
  She was put on trial after 6 months. 

624
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,460
 She denied all aspects of the crime suddenly. 

625
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,460
 And she went on a rampage at court. 

626
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,120
 Right now, the police are searching the area 

627
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,200
 and checking CCTVs- 

628
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,880
Where are you trying to go?

629
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,710
Logan. My Ro Na. I need to meet my Ro Na.

630
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,340
I need to tell Ro Na that her mom is alive.

631
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,410
The police are already all over that place.

632
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,450
If you want to get caught, then go.

633
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,900
No. My Ro Na.

634
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,540
What about my Ro Na?

635
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,810
You killed two people, yet you're worrying now about your daughter?

636
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:07,120
As expected, you really are a terrifying woman.

637
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,520
Two people? W-What do you mean?

638
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,250
Just because the only witness is gone,

639
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,250
it seems like you've been mistaken into thinking that this would go away forever,

640
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,580
but what should we do?

641
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,480
Su Ryeon told me everything before she died.

642
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,440
That you killed my little sister.

643
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,290
Little sister?

644
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,360
She was your sister?

645
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,700
That's right. My little sister.

646
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,790
My little sister, Min Seol Ah.

647
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,010
Now we finally get to meet.

648
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:49,930
I came all the way to Korea to find the person who killed my sister.

649
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:52,000
That was you,

650
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:55,150
you, Oh Yun Hui.

651
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,820
Why did you do it, huh?

652
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,750
Why did you kill her? Why?

653
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,490
Why did you kill that pitiful kid?

654
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:13,090
Su Ryeon believed you and waited for you.

655
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,320
She believed your words saying you would turn yourself in.

656
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,080
She believed and waited for you

657
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,050
even though she knew you were Seol Ah's killer.

658
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:24,490
But you stabbed someone like her in the back?

659
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,580
If Su Ryeon hadn't stopped me that time,

660
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,950
I would've run immediately to kill you.

661
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,190
Then Su Ryeon wouldn't have died so unfairly like that.

662
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:37,170
No. I didn't kill Unni Su Ryeon!

663
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,040
Stop lying!

664
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:44,980
You joined hands with Ju Dan Tae and were going to put a hit on her.

665
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,940
But do you know?

666
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:52,750
Even though Su Ryeon knew that, she still wanted to protect you until the end.

667
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,350
But to someone like that, you do such a thing?

668
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,790
You're not even human.

669
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,080
So you need to die.

670
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,230
You're a despicable woman who doesn't deserve to live!

671
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,240
 What did you say? I can't hear you. 

672
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,620
 Run away. 

673
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,030
 Run away. 

674
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,750
You're right.

675
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,320
It's the same thing as killing her.

676
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,290
I wanted her to disappear.

677
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,070
Okay. Kill me.

678
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,990
It's not enough even if I die.

679
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:45,130
But once I get revenge for Unni Su Ryeon's death, kill me then.

680
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:49,920
After I repay Chairman Ju and Cheon Seo Jin for killing Unni Su Ryeon,

681
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,970
then I will die in your hands. I promise.

682
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,740
So please just let me go for now.

683
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,100
Please help me. Please. Please.

684
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,800
Are you telling me now to believe what you say again?

685
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,240
No. You should just die here today.

686
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,570
The police will never find you.

687
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:17,710
Then you'll forever be remembered as a horrifying murderer and prison escapee.

688
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:23,710
Remain in people's memories as the heartless mom who even  abandoned her daughter.

689
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:27,390
What do I have to do to get you to believe me?

690
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:31,970
I didn't kill her. I swear I didn't kill Unni Su Ryeon!

691
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,280
Ju Dan Tae is framing me!

692
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,070
Stop trying to pull something!

693
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:41,760
You just need to go through the same thing! Just like how Su Ryeon was killed,

694
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,530
just like how Seol Ah was killed... the same way.

695
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:49,640
Miserably and horribly!

696
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:06,700
Fine. I won't ask you to believe me anymore.

697
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,850
I'm the one who killed Min Seol Ah

698
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,410
and I'll make sure I receive that punishment.

699
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:21,330
So kill me. Kill me right now.

700
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:24,420
But don't forget.

701
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:31,990
Even if I die, the culprit responsible for  Unni Su Ryeon's death  is still out there.

702
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:27,520
 Ro Na. Mom is sorry.   

703
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,250
 My little sister 

704
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:02,700
 Unni, let's take a picture to celebrate our accomplishment. 

705
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,540
 Okay. 

706
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,800
 All right. 

707
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,380
 That's not romantic. 

708
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,680
 A polaroid! 

709
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,700
 You're so old! 

710
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,440
 I'm a bit of a classic. 

711
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,860
 This is my first picture with you so I want it to be meaningful. 

712
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,140
 This will be the only picture in the world. 

713
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,720
 What a talk of romance!  That's why a rich Unni is not good. 

714
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,420
 You don't have a sense of reality. 

715
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:46,990
 My pretty Unni, I love you. 

716
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,260
 I hope it came out well. 

717
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,800
