1
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,440
Oh no. The expensive cup is broken.

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,990
It is very expensive, isn't it?

3
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,050
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

4
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,060
It's alright.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Your daughter's eyes resemble yours very much.

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,710
Seok Gyeong and my eyes resemble each other right?

7
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,910
I hear that often.

8
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,530
But... What did you want to talk about? 
   Episode 10 

9
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,940
The thing is... Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong

10
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,010
were involved in a bad situation.

11
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,340
A bad situation? Did something happen at school?

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,730
There was.

13
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,030
You may live in a lavish house like this,

14
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,040
but you raised your kids very poorly.

15
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,430
They say kids reflect their parents.

16
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,520
So you must not be a very good mom.

17
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,610
These kids are only seventeen,

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,640
but they engaged in gang violence and threatened a friend.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,190
This is terrible behavior.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,100
I apologize. As their parent I am ashamed.

21
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,220
From what I heard,

22
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,360
There was a similar incident before they started school.

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,990
With someone named Min Seol Ah.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,420
They bullied a female student,

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,890
And it was put on social media, I heard it was a mess.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,700
What about the student victim?  Was he badly hurt?

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,730
Well, I'm sure his heart is hurting more than his body.

28
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,130
And he's probably scared to attend school with them.

29
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,000
So I am thinking about punishing them harshly for this.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,100
To teach these rascals to never do this again.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,350
You should discuss that with me.

32
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,130
Hello, Seok Hun's father.

33
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,130
I am Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong's assistant homeroom teacher, Gu Ho Dong.

34
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,820
You're the new person moving in right?

35
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,070
- So nice to meet you. 
 - Welcome, nice to meet you.

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,150
Hello. I'm moving o the 45th floor.

37
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,430
- Oh Yun Hui? 
 -  Please take good care of me from now on, Cheon Seo Jin.

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,090
This woman. Have you gone crazy?

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,830
I can't listen to you if you keep talking nonsense.

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,350
Security! Stop the movers right now!

41
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,380
You must not know,

42
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,000
our Hera Palace is not somewhere anyone can move into.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,910
You need a resident's recommendation.

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,310
A recommendation... This?

45
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,500
 Recommender: Ju Dan Tae  

46
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,010
Recommender Ju Dan Tae?

47
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,420
Do you understand the situation a little now?

48
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,770
Does Chairman Ju have Alzheimer's?

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,390
How could he let a woman like this live in Hera Palace?

50
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,890
Is he telling me

51
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,390
to live with this vulgar woman across the hall 24/7?

52
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,790
Call Chairman Ju.

53
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,000
I won't believe anything until I confirm it.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,270
Until then,

55
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,800
don't take a step from here.

56
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,290
Take a look.

57
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Is this some bribe?

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,970
That changes on how you accept it, Teacher Gu.

59
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,370
Whether it's a bribe, or a token of friendship.

60
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,590
So you're saying take this,

61
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,640
and cover up the kids' assault case?

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,470
What if I say I won't do that?

63
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,870
Yes.

64
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,450
You will do it.

65
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,560
If you wanted justice, you would've gone straight to the Ministry of Education.

66
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,960
Not this penthouse.

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,120
Am I wrong? Teacher Gu Ho Dong.

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,070
Wow.

69
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,660
Bravo.

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,270
You have a truly amazing perspective.

71
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,440
There are no long words needed between two players right?

72
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
I figured you would understand my words, Teacher Gu.

73
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,690
I will delete that video myself.

74
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,380
Of course.

75
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,700
You are very precise when it comes to things like this.

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,890
Here.

77
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,050
People who're brave enough to take my money and act clueless,

78
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,610
- aren't common. 
 - Of course, of course.

79
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,430
- I completely understand. 
- I am an investor.

80
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,670
It's my job to only invest in things that are worth it.

81
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,900
Whether you are someone who will hold my hand,

82
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,660
or hold me back, is something we'll find out.

83
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,240
Or someone who stabs you in the back.

84
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,460
It's just a joke.

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,890
Hello.

86
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,070
 Hurry and come over here. It's a mess. 

87
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,640
Ok.

88
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,260
Is this true? You bought an apartment here at Hera Palace?

89
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,560
This recommendation, is it valid?

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,110
Then are you saying I forged that recommendation?

91
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,510
If you forged documents, I'm going to call the police.

92
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,760
Excuse me, I'm a human just like you all.

93
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,620
And I bought this place legally with my own money.

94
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,860
Why are you making a fuss separating levels, so vulgar!

95
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,700
A fuss? Vulgar?

96
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,740
Would you believe this?

97
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,140
There's no reason for Chairman Ju to recommend youâ€”

98
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,410
It's true. I wrote it.

99
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
It's true?

100
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,910
  But I don't know what I should ask for as a condition of the deal. 

101
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,560
  There's something I have thought of. 

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,600
 A condition that both you and I need. 

103
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,470
 What is that? 

104
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,640
 Tell him you want to move into Hera Palace. 

105
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,030
 Move into Hera Palace? 

106
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,070
 What are you talking about all of a sudden? 

107
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,480
 Hera Palace? 

108
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,380
 Did I hear you wrong? 

109
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,860
 You can decline the offer. 

110
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,560
 Let me know if you change your mind. 

111
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,900
 Our Hera Palace, is not somewhere anyone can move into, Ms. Oh Yun Hui. 

112
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
 I heard that too, so I am aware. 

113
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,800
 I heard you need a resident's recommendation and approval. 

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,060
 But, if it's Chairman Ju's recommendation, 

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,050
 absolutely anyone can move in. 

116
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,320
 The moment the ownership of an unit of  Hera Palace is transferred to me, 

117
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 I'll give you the Myeong-dong building. 

118
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,870
I wrote the recommendation because there was no issue with the residents' policies.

119
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,490
Do I have to explain it all?

120
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,590
The kids are also in a good relationship  at school, so let's all get along.

121
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,900
In a good relationship? What are you talking about?

122
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,700
Chairman Ju. Are you trying to ruin our Hera?

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,560
Lawyer Lee, did you know about this?

124
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,080
- Honey? 
- No!

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,860
This was a solo decision by Chairman Ju.

126
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,900
No. I feel wronged. This is too much.

127
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,440
You should've given me a hint about it.

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,070
Then it should be okay for me to continue to move in, right?

129
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,190
There are still a lot of furniture and appliances that still need to come in.

130
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,170
Please take good care of me from now on, neighbors.

131
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,670
Can you move?

132
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,490
How could you not discuss this with me and allow Oh Yun Hui in?

133
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,760
You know how much I hate her, yet you stab me in the back? How dare you!

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,550
Calm down.

135
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,210
Does it look like I can calm down?

136
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,260
You should've stopped her at all costs!

137
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,390
Do you think I did this because I wanted to?

138
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,620
I had no other choice because we're involved in business.

139
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,540
If you want to argue, go to your husband.

140
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,680
Ha Yun Cheol is the main reason Oh Yoon Hui moved here.

141
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,700
- What? 
 - It seems your husband

142
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,290
has great affection for Oh Yun Hui.

143
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,290
Their relationship is not ordinary, is it?

144
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,990
Explain to me what happened.

145
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,450
Explain so I can understand.

146
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,620
What's with you? Are you going to Seok Gyeong's  house again?

147
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,340
Why do Seok Gyeong and Seok Hun keep hanging out with her? It's so degrading.

148
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,980
This elevator is for residents only.

149
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,000
The maid's elevator is in the back, so can you get lost?

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,220
- I'm going to my house. 
 - What are you talking about? Your house?

151
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,700
  The door has opened. 

152
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Can you move?

153
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,090
Mom, Mom, Mom.

154
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,420
Mom, Mom!

155
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,840
Bae Ro Na moved in across the hall. Is this a prank?

156
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,630
This is a dream, am I being haunted by a ghost?

157
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,600
You're so loud. Stay still. I'm thinking for once.

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,560
Is it true that wench is living there?

159
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,330
Good idea!

160
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,380
Mom, it's so pretty!

161
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,180
Mom, Mom.  Is this really our home?

162
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,530
Are we really living in Hera Palace starting today?

163
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,610
This furniture, are you sure it's all ours?

164
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,600
Yes, it's our home. Do you want to see your room?

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Yes, where is it?

166
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Here, let's cover your eyes.

167
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,050
- What is this?   - I'll show you. 

168
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,500
Ta Da!

169
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,830
Mom, is this all mine?

170
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,990
The bed and the desk are so pretty.

171
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,150
Mom, it's not a dream, is it?  Pinch my cheek.

172
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,480
It's not a dream.

173
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,240
I can't believe it.

174
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,700
But, what is this?

175
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,800
It's a present from Seo Gyeong's mom. Hurry and see what it is.

176
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,600
- A piano? 
 - Do you like it?

177
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,160
I thought about what would be a good moving in present. I think a piano is great.

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,750
Be sure to become an outstanding vocalist.

179
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,130
Thank you, Ahjumma.

180
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,620
I really really love it.

181
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,350
My lifetime wish was to own a piano.

182
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,900
I really will do my best. I love it.

183
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,940
Take a look at it.

184
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,820
 Seol Ah, I also like it when you are smiling. 

185
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,020
 My dear daughter. 

186
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,550
I made a few dishes because I thought things would be so hectic while you were moving in.

187
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,550
Why would you have done that when I could have ordered jjajangmyeon?

188
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,130
 (TN:  Jjajangmyeon, noodles with black bean sauce, is traditionally eaten when people move into a new home 

189
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,200
Wow. You're even a great cook.

190
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,500
Unni, truly, you are my life's winning lottery ticket, savior, and lucky charmâ€”

191
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,010
Stop flattering me. It makes me not think straight

192
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,000
It's delicious.

193
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,450
Neat and well organized.

194
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,920
Unni, I truly thank you.

195
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,810
Moving here and everything is thanks to you.

196
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,170
I'll be in your debt forever.

197
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,600
You don't owe me anything.  You've struggled all of this time.

198
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,740
Right now you're on the 45th floor,  but in the future when you earn a lot more of money,

199
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,870
you will continue to move up to the 60th, the 70th floor and  the 85th floor where Cheon Seo Jin lives.

200
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,330
At that rate, aren't you coveting my home in the penthouse?

201
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,340
Unni, what nonsense?

202
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,140
How could your penthouse be the subject of my ambition?

203
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,930
Ridiculous.

204
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,280
What do you think?

205
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,190
Right.  Why didn't I think of that?

206
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,110
There is a reason we are the Hera Palace Steering Committee.

207
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,870
If we collect all the votes, it's only a matter of time before she will be kicked out.

208
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,750
Even if we don't count the penthouse votes, Dr Ha's two votes, your two votes and my vote,

209
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,990
that is a majority already. We can kick her out immediately.

210
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,810
That's right.

211
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,470
Why aren't you saying anything? You're unconditionally in favor, right, honey?

212
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,400
Does Doctor Ha agree?  Did you ask him for his opinion?

213
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,580
We don't have to ask that family.

214
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,460
Cheon Seo Jin and Oh Yun Hui are enemies.

215
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,440
How could they live in the same building?  They will be drawing swords.

216
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,580
I think the swords are going to fly upstairs first.

217
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,770
You knew, didn't you? That Oh Yun Hui would be moving into Hera Palace.

218
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,220
I see you knew.

219
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,540
Did you encourage her?

220
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,220
What did I do?  The recommendation was from Chairman Ju.

221
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,240
Lie.

222
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,600
Are you that happy because your first love will be next to you?

223
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,820
I'm stating in no uncertain terms that I can not live bumping into and facing her morning and evening.

224
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,950
So what if you can't live?  The chairman already finished it by approving and she moved in.

225
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,540
Of course she will be ejected.

226
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm in hell now.

227
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,110
I think I'm going crazy being reminded of past nightmares.

228
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,280
It's already 20 years. That's no reason to kick her out.

229
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,300
That's funny. Am I the only one uncomfortable with the current situation?

230
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,890
When you see Oh Yun Hui living well, do you feel better because your debts are being paid?

231
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,820
Was your heart ache that much?

232
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,280
Was your love for her so desperate that you've felt guilty for having abandoned her whole life?

233
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,800
Stop it. You're crossing the line now.

234
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,430
Did you think I didn't know.

235
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,110
When you married me, you had Oh Yun Hui in your heart.

236
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,000
 You studied yesterday and all night for the exam.  I brought a change of clothes. 

237
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,500
 I got paid. Pay the rent. 

238
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,890
 I don't want it. Why are you doing this all the time? 

239
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,130
 You don't have to feel guilty because giving it to you makes me feel good.  

240
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,300
 Really.  It's a small amount. 

241
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,300
 I will be a doctor soon. I'll support you forever. 

242
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,170
 I'll remove this scar too. 

243
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,590
  This is nice. 

244
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
 This is tasty. 

245
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,010
 Dad, it's me.  I want to recommend a medical student 

246
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,310
for the Cheong A Foundation scholarship.

247
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,470
 What is it?  Did you receive the Cheong Ah Foundation Scholarship? 

248
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,340
 Did the Foundation throw a party and did the Chairman entertain you? 

249
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,240
 But why didn't you tell me? 

250
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,930
 I had to go when they gave me a scholarship.  It doesn't mean anything. 

251
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,660
 Is that an excuse? 

252
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,900
 Who told you to accept dirty money to become a doctor? Why do you disappoint me? 

253
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,690
 How is it dirty? 

254
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,300
 After staying up for several nights, I'm tired. 

255
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,670
 Hey, Ha Yun Cheol. Return the scholarship money immediately. 

256
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,990
 Throw it in Cheon Seo Jin's face. 

257
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,230
 What am I supposed to do? 

258
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,560
 Even If my family died and were reborn, I wouldn't be able to afford anything. 

259
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,240
 My cousins and second cousins are impoverished so I can't borrow money from them. 

260
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,130
 Why are you so touchy for the money I accepted just with closing my eyes and bowing my head? 

261
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,100
 You have an inferiority complex. 

262
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
 What? 

263
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,860
 How can you say that? 

264
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,390
 Do you want to go to school on money from the girl who made my life like this? 

265
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,030
 I hate your being involved with Cheon Seo Jin. 

266
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,320
 That Cheon Seo Jin! Cheon Seo Jin! 

267
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,620
 Stop. Please!  I'm tired too. 

268
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,430
 Ha Yeon Cheol! 

269
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,010
    
 Ha Yun Cheol.

270
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,500
 - Stop drinking. 
 - Let me be. 

271
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,000
 Damn.  What else could I do? 

272
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,700
 Why would you want to take on another burden when even your study is not easy? 

273
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,460
 I will give you 

274
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,320
 wings to fly. 

275
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,950
Wait and see. Who will live here in the end.

276
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,140
No matter what, I am kicking that bitch out.

277
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,130
Oh Yun Hui. Oh Yun Hui. Oh Yun Hui!

278
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,860
Haven't you had enough?

279
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,730
Are you on a guilt trip?

280
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,940
Behave yourself right.

281
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,290
If you don't want to see either Oh Yun Hui or me to die.

282
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,030
How many time have your already done that?

283
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,940
Are you not tired?

284
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,260
I am not tired... at all.

285
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,670
What's being tired when I'm cleaning my own house?

286
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,830
Mom.

287
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,640
You did keep your promise to let me live in Hera Palace.

288
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,600
I can't believe a day like this would happen.

289
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,300
There was never a time when I wasn't worried about money.

290
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,870
But now, I don't have any debt and I don't have to worry about paying rent.

291
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,930
This is unbelievable isn't it?

292
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,910
I'm going to go to Seoul National University School of Music,

293
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,060
And i'm going to study abroad in Italy.

294
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,970
I'm going to sing as the prima donna in the best opera theater.

295
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,030
Yes. My daughter, do whatever you want from now on.

296
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,960
Okay.

297
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,920
Ro Na it's the first day in our new house,

298
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,590
Do you want to sleep with me?

299
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,830
- Yes. 
- Let's do that and go.

300
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,090
Did you have a nightmare?

301
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,680
Did you wake up because of me?

302
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,790
No, I was moving around because I couldn't sleep.

303
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,380
Hera Palace... I spent so much effort creating it.

304
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,710
And now there's a scratch on it.

305
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,740
Only the nobles of Korea would gather and share the best education

306
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,970
and share the best community. But my plan,

307
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,160
has been stained. Because of that Oh Yun Hui.

308
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,260
Ro Na's mom?

309
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,850
Don't get too close with her. I won't allow that.

310
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,710
Hello.

311
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,340
Can you help me?

312
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,710
I don't really know how to use the machines.

313
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,470
Me?

314
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,510
It's similar

315
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,580
to dips.

316
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,950
It exercises your

317
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,890
pectoral muscles like this.

318
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,260
Oh my,

319
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,930
Lawyer Lee you know everything.

320
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,840
Maybe it's because you're a lawyer,

321
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,210
you explain information very well so that I can understand easily..

322
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,730
You seem really smart.

323
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,460
Smart?

324
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,800
Then can I ask you anytime I have something I don't know?

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,230
Like an Oppa?

326
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,480
An Oppa?

327
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,940
Oppa...oppa.

328
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,630
We...

329
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,240
have a special relationship, don't we?

330
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,140
Rather than complete strangers,

331
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,440
it's nice and friendly.

332
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,840
Well... my Dongsaeng, you're very nice.

333
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,150
I was worried because I've never used such high level fitness.

334
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,230
Then please take care of me from now on, Oppa.

335
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,660
Oh my,

336
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,860
You look charismatic and sexy when you take your glasses off.

337
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,470
You hear that often, don't you?

338
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,250
Am I sexy?

339
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,630
People tell me that I'm more cute.

340
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,800
That's what people say.

341
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,790
You're already attending fitness?

342
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,630
Since you won't be here for long, enjoy it while you can.

343
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,960
It'll be a good experience.

344
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,400
Do you feel better when you say things like that?

345
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm really thankful to you.

346
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,470
I was curious about where you lived. And I wanted it.

347
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,810
I think I got here thanks to you,

348
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,790
so I'm thankful for that.

349
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,750
I'm planning on wanting more.

350
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,820
Your house on the 85th floor.

351
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,470
The things you own.

352
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,610
And the things you stole from me. All of it.

353
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,750
You'll have to protect it well, Cheon Seo Jin.

354
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,010
Isn't your welcome greeting a little too harsh?

355
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,070
Is this how Hera Palace treats their neighbors?

356
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,100
Stop playing around. I'm restraining my urge to kill you so hard.

357
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,950
Don't restrain.

358
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm ready to accept that at any time.

359
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,320
Find out where this person is.

360
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,260
As fast as you can.

361
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,460
- Any other information? 
 - There's none.

362
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,120
I only know that she ran a fabric store in Dongdaemun ten years ago.

363
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,280
I will ask around and find her for sure.

364
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,150
I'll kick you out no matter what, Oh Yun Hui.

365
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,560
No matter what.

366
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,590
Our practical skills lesson is done for today.

367
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,260
And this week is the audition for the Cheong Ah Arts School Student Ambassador.

368
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,250
We're picking one male and one female.

369
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:05,640
If you're picked as the student ambassador,  you will preside all school events, and it will be recorded on your school record.

370
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,610
I'm taking applicants, who wants to try out?

371
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,180
Yes, Min Hyeok, Eun Byeol ...

372
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,180
Bae Ro Na, you too?

373
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,890
Yes. I want to try out for the Cheong Ah Arts School student ambassador.

374
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,640
Alright. Your courage is amazing.

375
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,510
Then applicants, prepare efficiently.

376
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,750
I have something to tell you.

377
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,320
Say it.

378
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,250
If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving.

379
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,020
I like you.

380
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,740
I've liked you for a long time.

381
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,330
I know you'll find it burdensome.

382
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,990
That's why I couldn't tell you.

383
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,750
But I can't watch you taking care of someone else.

384
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Hey Ha Eun Byeol, what's wrong with you?

385
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,850
I don't understand what you're saying.

386
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,970
How... do you feel about me?

387
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,660
No. Don't answer right now.

388
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,910
Answer me after we become the student ambassadors.

389
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,970
I'll try really hard.

390
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,820
I won't let another student take it from me. Especially Bae Ro Na.

391
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,180
Since we bought that land from Oh Yun Hui,

392
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,940
now we can start our plan.

393
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,500
Of course. Since we have the right rectangular shaped  land in the center of Myeongdong,

394
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,790
we can sell it at the best price.

395
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,110
But who is going to buy the land?

396
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,660
If it's a plan to build a shopping town of this scale in Myeongdong, they must be very rich.

397
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,020
I've heard he is the most successful Korean-American.

398
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,030
His name is Logan Lee.

399
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,450
Logan Lee?

400
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,740
He came to Korea for this contract, so I'm planning to meet him soon.

401
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,840
Can I  also meet him with you?

402
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,920
I went to meet him a few times already, but couldn't meet him.

403
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,280
He has a 100 storey building in the center of Manhattan, New York, so he is not an easy person to meet.

404
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,410
100 storeys... Are you talking about Madison Tower?

405
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,420
How did he become so rich?

406
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,680
His father's building company was hugely successful, and is a famous theater owner now.

407
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,670
He is the role model of my life.

408
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,120
The observation deck of the building alone brings enough money for three generations to live off of.

409
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,970
Then he must not know the Korean real estate market well.

410
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:46,250
Okay.  Then we should catch him and raise the price tenfold.

411
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,830
Agreed?

412
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,810
Why do you think he's so rich?

413
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,520
He's rich because he's suspicious and doesn't trust anyone.

414
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,480
As long as we work him right, we can earn lots of money.

415
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,870
That way, enduring that embarrassment from Oh Yun Hui

416
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,160
and obtaining the auctioned land were worth it.

417
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,410
By the way, Oh Yun Hui,

418
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,010
Is she going to keep living in Hera Palace, Doctor Ha?

419
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,060
Don't you know?

420
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,770
Are you going let her keep living here?

421
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:25,440
That cannot happen. What kind of place is our Hera?

422
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,610
I'll take care of it, so my princess, don't worry and focus on class.

423
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,490
If you want to go to Seoul National University School of Music, you have to be top 5, no matter what.

424
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,380
You know right? Ok, bye.

425
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,460
Hello. I'm apartment 4502, I moved in yesterday.  Have some of this while you work.

426
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,970
Rice cakes?

427
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,090
Thank you.

428
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,630
I'm sorry, I don't eat rice cakes.

429
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,850
If Mrs. Cheon Seo Jin finds out, you'll be struck by lightning. Do you want to get fired over some rice cakes?

430
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,770
You're right. Don't tell her.

431
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,950
Cheon Seo Jin's influence is great.

432
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,690
I see that even now there are people giving rice cake when they move in.

433
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,220
At Hera Palace, we don't. If you gave out the dried yellow corvina sets, it might be accepted...

434
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,230
Is that so? I still don't know that.

435
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,920
Your sense of style is, how shall I say it, pedestrian?

436
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,000
In Hera Palace, the appearance of your outfit should be unique.

437
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,010
It's not even a helper's. ( Making a joke of her use of HePa for Hera Palace). 

438
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,350
I like to wear comfortable clothes because I'm moving.

439
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,790
Would you like some rice cake?

440
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,920
There is no one to eat it at home.

441
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,540
My husband and child are picky.

442
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,520
My mother-in-law Wang Mi Ja is a cuisine researcher on television.  Did you know?

443
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,900
I didn't know.  I don't watch TV.

444
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,200
You must be on your way out.  Have a nice day.

445
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,610
She doesn't know? How can she not know Culinary Researcher Wang Mi Ja?

446
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,340
She's had regular appearances on "Best Chef" but she doesn't know her?  Does that make sense?

447
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,080
Contact Teacher Cheon immediately and convene  steering committee meeting.

448
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,420
She should be kicked out like a dog so she would know which bowl is for her food.

449
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,480
Living on the same level must really irk you, Je Ni's Mom.

450
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,670
It's the same level.

451
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,320
What do you mean "it's the same level"?

452
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,210
When my husband returns from Dubai, I will also move up to the 60th floor.

453
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,250
I will move up immediately.

454
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,940
Oh, yes. I was just on my way out.

455
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,620
Soak yourself in warm water and be patient for a little while.

456
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,540
I will loosen you up and make everything limber.

457
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,470
Yes!

458
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,300
I'm going.

459
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,170
This is driving me crazy.  Her cheating is ticking me off, too.

460
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,310
Sordid. Truly.

461
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,400
   

462
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,850
Chairwoman Byeon, I really like your new cell phone.

463
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,390
It's going to be a big hit.  The stock is going way up.

464
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:19,290
I heard the pharmaceutical company will be listed on KOSDAQ. ( Korean stock exchange  )

465
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:25,150
Is it true, Chairwoman Song? Your oldest son will be running the pharmaceutical company, right?

466
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,600
I've already heard the rumor that a dementia drug has been developed.

467
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,880
The stock goes public, it will cause a sensation.

468
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,740
Please distribute some unregistered stock to us Three Mamas.

469
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,310
Don't even dream it.  Only one person deserves our stock.

470
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,840
Who is that?

471
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,400
What do you mean "who is it?" She's Lady Jincheon, who came from Jincheon.

472
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,970
Madame Song.  Your 13 minute soaking is over. Please hurry here.

473
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,150
Okay.

474
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,080
Are you cold?

475
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,520
Do you want a seaweed pack, Ma'am?

476
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,320
Why are you asking? Take care of everything yourself.

477
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Yes.

478
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,820
But where did you soak?

479
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,020
Was it a foreign product which made your skin so rough?

480
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,350
Oh my.  Is it obvious?

481
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,410
I went to a few countries in Europe and the spas were terrible.

482
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,700
Dear, can't you end it here and come to Gangnam?

483
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,680
I'll give you a sauna spot at my hotel.

484
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,210
I appreciate what you're saying but

485
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:49,650
I came here from the bottom with just this scrubbing towel.

486
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,300
This is my second hometown and the heart of Lady Jincheon, me.

487
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,330
That's why I like you.

488
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,410
The passion and pride of a scrubber.

489
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,920
By the way, I had fun with stock's uprising last time,

490
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,180
you told me to hang onto.

491
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,500
No one can match your information.

492
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,180
These three madames are my benefactors. Benefactors.

493
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,980
What are you saying? We three owe you a debt of gratitude.

494
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,970
Do you want surgery for that scar?

495
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,700
Why would I do that?  It's a badge of honor for me.

496
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,650
This scar.

497
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,820
   

498
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,100
 - Madam!  Madam!  
 - Huh, huh. 

499
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,900
 Out of the way. Out of the way! 

500
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Out of the way! 

501
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,560
 We're almost there. Hang on, Madam! 

502
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:18,010
Because I didn't miss the golden time, I'm alive today.

503
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,270
You were faster than the ambulance.

504
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,710
How could you run to the hospital in your underwear?

505
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,710
That wasn't a big deal.  You'r embarrassing me, Ma'am.

506
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,240
When you think about it, she's saved a lot of lives.

507
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,820
When I had a heart attack, she was the first to give me CPR.

508
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,250
You even discovered my breast cancer.  She was as good as a skilled doctor.

509
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:46,510
You were the first to figure out what the doctors at the university hospital didn't discover it.

510
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,170
Lady Jincheon was our lives saver.

511
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,430
We must help you something big at least once.

512
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,550
We pay back our enemies, but we also repay your kindness.

513
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,820
Whatever.

514
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,260
This is embarrassing.  Stop talking about that.

515
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,090
Shall I give you a glass of the refreshing sikhye ( Rice water drink ) that I made?

516
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,980
- Okay. 
 - Nice.

517
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,420
 Fairmont Ambassador Seoul 

518
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,500
Hello. ( In English )

519
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,910
Hello, this is Dan Tae Ju from J King Holdings. Am I speaking with Logan Lee?

520
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,660
Yes, this is he.  How can I help you?

521
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,600
I heard you're planning to open a shopping center in Myeongdong.

522
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,700
I am the person that owns the property there.

523
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,240
Ah yes, I heard that from my secretary. I'm anxious to look into it.

524
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,700
I can assure you that you won't find a better piece of property as well.

525
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,100
Are you available at the moment? I am actually here at the hotel lobby.

526
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,260
No.  I'm a bit tired tonight. Why don't I have somebody call you back?

527
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,930
Good bye.

528
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,590
Hello.

529
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,850
Why is he so arrogant?  It's not hard to meet face to face.

530
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,820
What did he say?  Did you get an appointment?

531
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,650
What?  You're rejected again?  Falling flat on your face.

532
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,810
how many times have you been rejected?  You even came to the hotel.

533
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,670
Does he really want to buy?

534
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,920
Because he wantsâ€” to buy, he came to Korea.

535
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,520
In my research, I think they are looking for something in which they can invest at least 500 hundred billion won.

536
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,580
F-five hundred billion won?

537
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,690
The moment you rush a real estate deal, all is lost.

538
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,610
If we appear to be not in any hurry, they will get anxious and will start negotiating.

539
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,130
If we wait, we'll make money,

540
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,590
- HI. 
 - Guys ... did something happen?

541
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:40,520
When you hear a classmate moved next door, is it strange to visit?

542
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,680
It's galbijjim ( braised short rib ).  My mom made it and told me to bring it.  Are you surprised?

543
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,470
No.  Come in.

544
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,470
I made it in a rush so I don't know if it will taste good.

545
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,650
If I had known in advance, I would have prepared something nice.

546
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,600
Next time I'll make something delicious.

547
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,240
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we would like to have a good time just among ourselves.

548
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,080
Oh, yes, yes. I'm clueless.

549
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,470
You can stay late, so have a good time.

550
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,940
Thank you for coming.

551
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,930
I hope we're not a bother. Thank you for the food.

552
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,590
All right. I'll go out.

553
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,300
Do you usually eat something like this?

554
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,330
Is your mom so out of it?

555
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,770
Stir-fried rice cake with red pepper powder, greasy buckwheat with fried powder,

556
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,280
the menu choices show no consideration.

557
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,340
If my mother saw this, she would faint.

558
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,010
It looks like all are junk food.

559
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,480
Kids, what's the matter? What you're saying is too much. We came to get close.

560
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,940
Ro Na.  Don't get upset. You know kids speak thoughtlessly.

561
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,840
Yeah.  I'm okay.

562
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,800
Heol.  Daebak, Seok Hun.

563
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,930
Hey.  Seok Hun, do you eat food at someone else's house?

564
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,620
Then, I will too.

565
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,060
Hey, it's not bad.

566
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,860
- Is it tasty? 
 - I'm eating it.

567
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,820
This one?

568
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:41,660
I'm going to the bathroom.

569
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,020
- Eat more. 
 - Juice, juice.

570
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,670
 Ro Na's Diary 

571
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,960
 Good! - Ju Seok Hun 

572
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,220
  I wonder if Seok Hun drank the chocolate milk I gave him. 

573
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,370
  I think I have a crush on Seok Hun. 

574
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,480
What are you doing?

575
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,700
No, nothing.

576
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,240
- Aren't you leaving? 
 - You go first. I want to look around the room.

577
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,960
She decorated it nicely. Ro Na has nice taste.

578
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,840
Right?

579
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,590
I don't know.

580
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,790
 HÃ¤ndel - BÃ¤renreiter Urtext 
(George Frederick HÃ¤ndel (1685-1759) Complete Organ Works) 

581
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,970
So sly, she already took pictures?

582
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,380
- Seok Gyeong? 
 - What?

583
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,310
What are you doing?

584
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,020
Looking around the room.

585
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,730
She decorated it nice and pretty.

586
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,670
Bae Ro Na and her mom.

587
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,590
Are you going to let them live in our Hera?

588
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,350
We should definitely hold a steering committee meeting,

589
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,060
and kick her out.

590
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,730
We already decided that.

591
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,660
As long as she moved in by recommendation,

592
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,190
we can't kick her out for no reason.

593
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,950
Then what should we do?

594
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,990
I'll have a latte.

595
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,930
Whether it's impairing dignity, or inappropriate behavior,

596
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,620
we'll vote her out as soon as we can make a reason.

597
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,300
I'll set everything up,

598
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,470
so Je Ni's and Min Hyeok's mother,

599
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,270
just need to create the mood.

600
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,290
You can do it right?

601
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,260
That's easy.

602
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,420
Have you guys not seen my hair pin?

603
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,930
You know, the hair pin my dad sent me from Dubai!

604
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,780
Doesn't that have diamonds on it?

605
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,260
Where did you put such an expensive thing?

606
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,120
I don't know. I'm so annoyed!

607
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,030
At our divine school, Cheong Ah Arts, stealing should never happen,

608
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,070
but it has occurred.

609
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,200
The item robbed is a diamond embedded hair pin.

610
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,220
It's such an expensive item,

611
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,900
so I have no choice but to look through your belongings.

612
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,270
Bae Ro Na, open your pencil bag.

613
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,660
 Minot cigarette 

614
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,440
What is this? Do you smoke?

615
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,100
No. This isn't mine.

616
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,730
It's not yours? Is this not your bag?

617
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,910
This is my bag...

618
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,280
But it wasn't me, this is unfair!

619
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,610
Stop lying to me.

620
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,860
Did you steal Je Ni's hair pin as well?

621
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,100
 Girl's My Orite 

622
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,790
Bae Ro Na, are you going to keep denying it after this?

623
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,320
Who said to bring an adult magazine to school!

624
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,800
It's really not me!

625
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,030
Someone put this in my bag on purpose.

626
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,380
Hey. Hey Yu Je Ni, it's you, isn't it? You did this?

627
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,080
Did you make this up again?

628
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,410
Say something, did you do it?

629
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,220
What are you talking about? I'm going crazy too because I lost my hair pin!

630
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,110
My dad gave it to me for my birthday, my dad did!

631
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,960
You, I from the start I didn't like your rash attitude and words.

632
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,200
Follow me to the teachers' office.

633
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,070
Please believe me.

634
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,590
That stuff is not mine. I can swear.

635
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,820
Something's wrong. I'm serious!

636
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,910
What do you mean something's wrong? Follow me!

637
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,940
Please believe me.

638
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,560
I've never seen that stuff before.

639
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,310
- It's not me, Teacher! 
 - Follow me.

640
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,650
Please listen to me. Please?

641
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,600
Bae Ro Na got what she deserved, didn't she?

642
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,360
There was nothing for me to worry about.

643
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,160
If I knew she was that type of girl, I wouldn't have even approached her.

644
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,160
You did it, didn't you? Putting cigarettes in Bae Ro Na's bag.

645
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,380
What are you talking about? It's not me.

646
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,330
You went into Ro Na's room yesterday.

647
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,960
I went in,

648
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,310
but it's not me. I'm telling the truth, you don't believe me?

649
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,050
Are you going even to lie to me?

650
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,490
I'm disappointed in you.

651
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,420
Oppa. Ju Seok Hun!

652
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,000
 She decorated it nice and pretty. 

653
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,350
I don't think this situation should end with just demerits.

654
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,070
It's enough for a suspension.

655
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,590
If she gets suspended, then naturally she won't be able to apply for the school ambassador.

656
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,690
Either way, Bae Ro Na never had a chance.

657
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:05,930
It will become a fight between Seok Gyeong and Eun Byeol.

658
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,780
How could a vocal musician smoke?

659
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,370
Take care of Bae Ro Na according to school rules.

660
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,960
Yes.

661
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,790
The person who is living in apartment 4502 here at Hera Palace,

662
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,310
I am reporting Oh Yun Hui.

663
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,650
Oh Yun Hui, as soon as her husband died,

664
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,130
she abandoned her old and sick mother-in-law.

665
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,870
She lives in the best apartment in Korea,

666
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,400
but her old mother-in-law can't even pay rent,

667
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,760
and she is barely surviving worrying about her next meal.

668
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,100
Does this make sense?

669
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,510
How could she be so ungrateful?

670
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,210
Just because her husband died,

671
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,470
she cut off contact with  her in-laws,

672
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,960
and she took all the money my son made.

673
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,470
She is a shameless wench who ran away.

674
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,200
How sad...

675
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,670
That woman must be Oh Yun Hui.

676
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,140
What are you doing right now?

677
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,040
Come out!

678
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,230
What's going on?

679
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,950
It's fun watching, so stay quiet.

680
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,800
Hurry and come out!

681
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,090
My wealthy daughter-in-law, now you show up?

682
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,430
Is everything fine as long as you live well?

683
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:30,460
I'm still Ro Na's grandmother, how could you act like a stranger?

684
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,990
You ruined my son,

685
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,050
and now you won't let me see my granddaughter.

686
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,510
I won't be able to die because I feel so wronged.

687
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,800
I feel so upset and mad!

688
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,690
If you have a mouth, say something.

689
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,310
Did you really abandon your mother-in-law?

690
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,990
That's really terrible, isn't it?

691
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,700
I can't live with someone of your level, being afraid of getting undignified.

692
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,330
I've only heard of this kind of an immoral thing on the news.

693
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,620
Isn't that true, everyone?

694
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,720
- Yes. 
 - You're right.

695
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,380
Talk with me.

696
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,490
Ow, oh my...

697
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,230
Goodness.

698
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,320
My son is the one I feel bad for.

699
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,400
If he saw me like this,

700
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,500
how upset would he be?

701
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,550
This is why you have to be careful of whom you bring into the family.

702
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:19,050
Stop it now!

703
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,520
Mother-in-law, why did your son die?

704
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,980
He was having an affair with another women,

705
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,470
got drunk and fell off the railing to death!

706
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,740
Do I have to take responsibility for that too?

707
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,310
How dare you talk back to me?

708
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,970
Mother-in-law,  have you ever

709
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,220
hugged our Ro Na?

710
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:49,070
You never bought Ro Na a toy, not even once.

711
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,670
Just money, money!

712
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,350
After we got married,

713
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,720
I never failed to give you living expenses.

714
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,710
And when he opened a store for the woman he had an affair with

715
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,430
by putting me in debt and died,

716
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,800
I took on all that debt.

717
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,870
At the funeral, you broke the condolence money safe,

718
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,320
took all the money, and ran away!

719
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,350
You were afraid I would share the burden with you,

720
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,350
so you asked me to cut ties with you!

721
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,290
You said to live like strangers,

722
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,160
but now you curse me out? After all this time?

723
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,830
Why?

724
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,310
For the first time in my life,

725
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,680
I'm living in a nice apartment and living like a decent person.

726
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,120
Does that really...

727
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,010
Does that really upset you so much?

728
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,430
Is that why you're making such a big deal?

729
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:52,590
Your dead son, your dead son that had an affair,

730
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,440
you're using him now to make a scene?

731
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,430
Her life is really so dynamic.

732
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,410
I'm out of breath just watching.

733
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,130
Leave now.

734
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,930
You can't do this here.

735
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,700
Let go, let go of me!

736
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,740
Let go of her.

737
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,240
She's my child's grandmother. I'll take care of it.

738
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,090
I'm sorry for causing a scene.

739
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm embarrassed that you all know my family issues now.

740
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

741
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,560
Let's go out now.

742
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,330
If you want to gain anything from me,

743
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,950
get up now!

744
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,310
Shit! Really!

745
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,190
Lead the way.

746
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,400
She has some charisma,

747
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,070
really.

748
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,070
Why are you crying?

749
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,720
You moron.

750
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,020
You really don't know why I'm crying, do you?

751
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,690
Aren't you coming over here?

752
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,120
To your husband... Come over here!

753
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,540
She has some pitiful side too, don't you agree, Ms. Cheon?

754
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,600
Well, kicking her out should be done, of course, but thinking of her mother-in-law,

755
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,130
that makes my head hurt.  Gosh, maybe it's because she's unlucky.

756
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,720
My princess, when did you come?

757
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,910
You're hungry, aren't you?  Let's go eat something.

758
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,520
Let's go.

759
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,890
You lost.

760
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,850
What did you say?

761
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,830
I said, you lost.

762
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:17,070
Admit it.  You can't kick Oh Yun Hui out from here.

763
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,770
So what? Huh?

764
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,480
Are you saying you can't let me in your house at the end?

765
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,450
Right, I don't want to.

766
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,410
I hate you complaining in front of Ro Na,

767
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,540
as well as you walking and poking around my house as if it's yours.

768
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,120
You are really good at speaking out now.  How could you hold it until now?

769
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,970
How did you find out about us and come here?

770
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,430
Well, it's not a big secret, so easily can be found.  Why bother asking?

771
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,000
It has been 5 years since we cut our ties.

772
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,880
Who was it to tell you I'm living here?

773
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,280
I told you, there was no one like that.

774
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,090
If you tell me the truth,

775
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:19,060
I can get you a place with yearly deposit.

776
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:26,400
For the past years we haven't met, I see you've become more generous in spending.

777
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,510
Stop drinking.

778
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,200
Are you alright?

779
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,630
No, I'm not alright.

780
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:56,720
My life is so shitty, isn't it?

781
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,100
After everything is revealed to the neighbors,

782
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,190
I feel somewhat relieved at least.

783
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,470
It's not your fault.  You've lived your life earnestly.

784
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,090
You raised Ro Na well in such a situation.

785
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,100
That's something great.

786
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:20,080
In some way, you seem more upset than I do.

787
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,190
Just...

788
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:29,300
I wonder, if I didn't dump you then, we might have become different.

789
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,570
Marrying Seo Jin,

790
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,690
do you regret it?

791
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,810
Well, people always regret, you know.

792
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:52,570
Living life means bearing the consequence for not choosing, they say.

793
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,780
It's not your fault.

794
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,630
Don't feel apologetic to me.

795
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:22,100
At that time, we were too young.

796
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,900
And...

797
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,000
It hasn't always been miserable for me either.

798
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,930
I got my Ro Na too.

799
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,850
Thanks for saying that.

800
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,220
Let's go now.

801
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,050
I shouldn't have called you here.

802
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,890
Are you okay?

803
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,490
 Bar Fate 

804
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,840
Sorry, it's my mistake.

805
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,000
Go follow her quickly.

806
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,130
Seo Jin saw us just now.

807
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,700
What?

808
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,490
How could she be here?

809
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:27,880
I called her,

810
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:34,420
as it was your wife who ordered my mother-in-law to cause a scene.

811
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,590
I apologize to you.

812
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,690
Yun Cheol!

813
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,680
I can't take this any more.

814
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,310
I'm going to take Oh Yun Hui back down to the bottom again.

815
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,070
I'm going to kick her out of here.

816
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,290
 Today my husband went to the vacation home again.  

817
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:44,460
 With a lot of clothes he bought for Cheon Seo Jin. 

818
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,660
Ju... Ju Dan Tae?

819
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:40,680


820
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,870
 The Penthouse - Preview 

821
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,630
 Am I not going to have any right for you forever, Yun Hui? 

822
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,070
 Pay back to Cheon Seo Jin, as much as she made you suffer. 

823
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,840
 You dirty and vulgar wench! 

824
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,580
 Were you with Oh Yun Hui all night long? 

825
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:02,190
 Such an enthusiastic attitude, I really like it. 

826
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:05,090
 Ms. Sim Su Ryeon, this isn't right if you're this happy. 

827
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,330
 Go ahead and shoot.  Shoot! 

828
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:10,210
 You sons of a b**ch!
