 Episode 19 

2
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,410
What is this?

3
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,560
- It's gasoline! 
 - Shit!

4
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,030
What on earth do you think you're doing?

5
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,370
There are people in here! Won't you stop this instant?

6
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,180
Hey, are you insane? Why did you start a fire?

7
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,850
 Why? Are you scared of dying? 
   

8
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,050
 Was it okay when your kids did it? 

9
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,600
 Your kids started a car fire and ran away. 

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,900
- What are you talking about? 
 - Tell me in a way we can understand!

11
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,380
Min Seol Ah!

12
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,940
What are you saying? What do you mean Min Seol Ah?

13
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,460
That day, there was a fire in the van.

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,450
What do you mean a fire?

15
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,360
The kids lit the candles on the cake

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
and said Min Seol Ah almost burned to death.

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,670
It's a lie!  It never happened!

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,500
Don't make stuff up.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,210
It's true! Je Ni told me everything that day.

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,520
Me! I really didn't know anything!

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,610
I really didn't know!

22
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,700
The kids must've run away because they were scared.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,250
It was just a joke!

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,630
 A joke? 

25
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,020
 Min Seol Ah almost died that day. 

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,080
 Because your kids confined her in a burning car, 

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,740
and ran away to save themselves!

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Even after all that, your kids, didn't feel sorry at all.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,900
  How could you do that? 

30
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,660
 Ju Seok Gyeong: What the heck? Are you alive? 

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,910
 Nice! As expected, we're lucky! 

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,890
 Ha Eun Byeol: Why? Did something happen? 

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,650
 I was sleeping soundly and just woke up. 

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,300
 Min Seol Ah: Do you guys know what you just did? 

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,670
  I almost died because of you guys! 

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,340
  Because of the fire you guys started! 

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,620
 Yu Je Ni: A fire? Teacher, do you smoke? 

38
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,170
 You should think about your health and quit. 

39
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,530
 I thought you liked alcohol, but were you a smoker too? 

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,630
Why is this happening?

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,940
So? Are you trying to make us like that too?!

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,620
Who are you? You're Min Seol Ah's brother, aren't you?

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,970
If you don't quit now, I'll rip you to pieces!

44
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,150
 Really? 

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,780
Then why don't you try?

46
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,120
Because I don't intend to let you guys live.

47
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,630
- What? 
 - Please, open the door!

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,920
Je Ni, your mom's going to die!

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,640
Please open the door!

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Stop now! Hey!

51
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,030
Save them!

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,390
Please save them!!

53
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,100
Mom!

54
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,000
Mom!

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,640
Mom...

56
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,490
 Write down everything you did to Min Seol Ah. 

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,350
Move out of the way.

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,790
What did you do to our kids?

59
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,590
If you touch the kids, I'll kill you!

60
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,450
 Of course the kids should take a time to reflect on themselves. 

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,070
 As much as the crimes they committed. 

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,170
 Then should we make a deal? 

63
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,630
 Confess everything you did to Min Seol Ah. 

64
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,410
What happened the night Min Seol Ah died.

65
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,190
Don't leave out anything.

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,040
What do you want us to say?

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,970
If you want to live, confess right now!

68
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,960
Everyone keep your mouth shut. Don't say a thing!

69
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,600
Hey you crazy bastard,

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,470
are you saying we should burn to death together?!

71
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,990
Please spare me.

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,780
I'm really innocent!

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,390
Regarding Min Seol Ah,

74
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,890
I learned the fact later

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,580
that she was locked in the mechanical room!

76
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,310
Ju Dan Tae,  Cheon Seo Jin!

77
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,800
You guys locked her in there right? Tell us now!

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,210
Is that my fault?

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,280
Everything was for the sake of the kids.

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,460
Don't make me laugh.

81
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,140
The kids are an excuse, you guys were trying to find the video of your affair!

82
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,600
- I told you to shut up! 
 - Hey!

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,380
Our kids' lives and ours are on the line!

84
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,520
- But how dare you want to act like our boss?! 
 - You bastard!

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,180
No, stop it.

86
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,630
- Let go! 
 - Oh, you idiots.

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,120
- I went easy on so far! 
 - Let go, you bastard!

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,330
Stay still you idiots.

89
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,090
Look at that!  Only 5 minutes left!

90
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,240
 There's 5 minutes left. 

91
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,770
I'll release the person who confesses most truthfully.

92
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,590
And their child as well.

93
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,700
 Are you saying you don't care if you die? 

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,390
 Then I'll do as you want. 

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,760
No! No!

96
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,450
I'll go first. That day,

97
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,140
all I did was clean the blood in the fountain.

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,480
It's the same for me as well.

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,080
All I did was clean the blood because Je Ni's mom told me to!

100
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,420
Stop it! This is all a trap.

101
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,330
She's putting on a show to find evidence.

102
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,500
Hey. Stop talking.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,750
Die by yourself!

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,510
I can't die.

105
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,290
That thing, Ju Dan Tae,

106
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,390
told us to move the corpse. I really!

107
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,540
Only did what Ju Dan Tae told me to do.

108
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,290
Don't joke around, Lee Gyu Jin, you bastard!

109
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,430
The golf bag. Your family brought the golf bag to move the corpse!

110
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,400
That golf bag was transported in your car!

111
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,920
- And your ex-wife, this one. 
 - This one?

112
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,560
- You're the one who forged the suicide note! 
 - You?

113
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,550
Your couple,

114
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,790
two of you were the ones who made it look like a suicide!

115
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,110
And Ju Dan Tae, you piece of shit.

116
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,730
The one who made it look like she fell from the roof at Bosong Village was you!

117
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,570
You bastard!

118
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,050
- Stop it! 
 - You bastard!

119
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,300
Stop it!

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,770
  REC 

121
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,760
- Please stop it! 
 - Let go of me!

122
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,240
You two. If your affair

123
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,290
hadn't been caught by that girl, none of this would've happened.

124
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,860
Our kids are all going to die because of you two.

125
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,940
If my Je Ni gets hurt because of you,

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,270
I'll shred you to pieces myself.

127
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,780
Let go of me!

128
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,160
Hey! Say it, that you killed Min Seol Ah!

129
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,190
We're all about to die because of you!

130
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,230
Why would I kill her?

131
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,970
Then did Teacher Cheon kill her?

132
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,300
I never did that.

133
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,790
Then who killed her?

134
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,490
Our kids are all going to die at this rate.

135
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,770
Look here.

136
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,850
Please! Let my daughter Je Ni live.

137
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:57,160
The prettiest one there wearing a white dress is my daughter.

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,170
If you let my daughter live,

139
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,610
I'll give you all the money I have.

140
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,250
My house, my buildings,

141
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,340
I'll give you everything.

142
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,770
So please let my Je Ni live.

143
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,310
Min Hyeok, Min Hyeok no!

144
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,390
Min Hyeok!!

145
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,230
To be honest, my mother is very sick.

146
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,680
She only has two months left to live.

147
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
Please let me live just two months.

148
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,930
Please let me die with my mother.

149
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,240
What a load of crap!

150
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,110
How dare you say that! Let go!

151
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,900
- I'll kill you. 
 - Let go, you bastard!

152
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,280
What happened?

153
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,500
It blew up.

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,170
It blew up.

155
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,900
Gosh...

156
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,580
Over there.

157
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,640
S-Someone is over there.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,400
Who is it?

159
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,020
Su Ryeon?

160
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,760
Sim Su Ryeon!

161
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,050
If you find your children so precious,

162
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,580
how could you do that to Min Seol Ah?

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,100
What does that have to do with you?

164
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,730
By chance, are you the one who planned all this?

165
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,420
Sim Su Ryeon! That woman must've gone crazy.

166
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,450
- What the heck? 
 - What's going on?

167
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,950
Min Seol Ah is my daughter!

168
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,340
What?

169
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,530
My poor daughter who was swapped without my knowledge and abandoned.

170
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,900
She never got to hold my hand,

171
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,140
and never got to call me mom before she wrongfully died.

172
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,690
You guys...

173
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,050
the Min Seol Ah you guys ignored and beat up,

174
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,730
is my daughter.

175
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,430
I knew it!!

176
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,010
Hey! What did you do to my Eun Byeol?

177
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,400
Stop this nonsense right now!

178
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,390
Su Ryeon.

179
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,720
Let's calm down first.

180
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,540
Let's take a deep breath.

181
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,380
I mean... you're not really going to kill everyone here.

182
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,980
I'll represent everyone here,

183
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,240
and apologize to you.

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
- I did wrong. 
 - Su Ryeon.

185
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
- Hurry up. 
 - I did wrong as well.

186
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,350
- We did wrong. 
 - Yes we did.

187
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,750
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

188
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,030
- I'm apologizing. 
 - I'm sorry!

189
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,930
- I did wrong. 
 - I'm sorry.

190
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,610
I don't need those insincere apologies!

191
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,750
- Hey you crazy bitch! 
 - Shut up!

192
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,290
You're paying for the wrongs you did.

193
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,090
Look carefully.

194
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,600
Look at what kind of monsters your kids have become because of you.

195
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,170
That crazy bitch.

196
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,820
She's gone. Where did she go?

197
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,580
- Where did she go? 
 - Sim Su Ryeon!

198
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,370
Hey open the door! Open the door before you leave!

199
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,690
- Open the door! 
 - Help us! Help us!

200
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,760
- Open the door! 
 - Sim Su Ryeon!

201
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,150
Hey!

202
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,290
Open the door.

203
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,490
We're going to die!

204
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,020
What happened?

205
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,840
Damn.

206
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,570
 Door Open 

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,820
Let's go.

208
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,650
Let's go together! Let's go together!

209
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,600
Let's go!

210
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,120
   

211
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,530
What is this? It smells!

212
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,510
- What is this? 
 - This is dirty water!

213
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,120
Go back!

214
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,990
Dang it!

215
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,620
How are we supposed to get across?

216
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,370
Wait for me!

217
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,600
  Listen to me carefully. 

218
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,910
  Min Seol Ah never came to Hera Palace at this time. 

219
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,460
  I'm saying that Min Seol Ah didn't die here. 

220
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,300
  This should be good enough, right? 

221
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,280
  This is Min Seol Ah's bag. 

222
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,850
  I wrote a suicide letter in her notebook. Please set it up together with this. 

223
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,190
 In five minutes we have to finish cleaning. 

224
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,800
 With this all evidence disappears. 

225
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,060
  Even after she died, we had a party 

226
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,620
  as if nothing happened. 

227
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,510
  It was the greatest party in the world. 

228
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,730
  I've never seen a party like that in my lifetime. 

229
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,180
 The fountain lights were so beautiful. 

230
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,940
Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

231
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,430
- My son! 
 - Eun Byeol!

232
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,340
Mom!

233
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,800
Je Ni!

234
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Dad! Mom!

235
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,840
- Eun Byeol! 
 - Mom!

236
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,320
- Mom. 
 - Eun Byeol.

237
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,490
Mom.

238
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,640
Stop!

239
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,660
- What? Gu Ho Dong! 
 - Gu Ho Dong?

240
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,780
What are you doing right now?

241
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,460
Put a stop to this now!

242
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,330
I'll give you all the money you want, so stop this immediately.

243
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,020
Money?

244
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,230
How much are you going to give me?

245
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,360
Is it enough money to save my sister?

246
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,420
You're really Min Seol Ah's brother?

247
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,710
Brother?

248
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,830
You were suspicious from the beginning.

249
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,810
You were Min Seol Ah's brother?

250
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,130
You locked my daughter in and threatened her to get revenge for a dead girl?

251
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,610
Are you really a teacher?

252
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,680
This is nothing compared to what you did to my poor Seol Ah.

253
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,130
Your kids are alive.

254
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't forget. You brought all of this onto yourselves.

255
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,500
I will take the letters of reflection that your kids wrote to the police.

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,410
- Hey, you bastard! 
 - Don't!

257
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,180
- Don't do it! Hold back. Gu Ho Dong! 
 - Don't move.

258
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,360
Gu Ho Dong!

259
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,700
Hey!

260
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,030
I catch you and kill you myself.

261
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,870
Bastard.

262
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,740
Yes, I understand, Chairman.

263
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,490
- Who called? 
 - It's nothing.

264
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,690
Ahjumma!

265
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,600
You're coming back? I was waiting for you.

266
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,290
Why haven't you been answering your phone? I packed all your stuff.

267
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,110
That's why I came back for it.

268
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,000
And I get to see Ro Na.

269
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,910
   
 Su Ryeon is at my house right now. 

270
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,610
Ro Na is working really hard.

271
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,210
What? Oh.

272
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,760
She met Grace Jo today.

273
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,710
She's full of motivation.

274
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,940
The coffee is all done.

275
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,910
What are you talking about?

276
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,660
It's all over?

277
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,790
The Hera Palace kids confessed to bullying Seol Ah.

278
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,310
And the parents confessed to moving Seol Ah's corpse

279
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,080
and manipulating a crime scene.

280
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,730
Then did Ju Dan Tae admit everything?

281
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,390
Of course. His crime is the most serious.

282
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,770
Stealing a corpse, getting rid of evidence, and arson.

283
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,500
He even defamed my daughter.

284
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,850
What about Cheon Seo Jin?

285
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,810
Did she admit to killing Min Seol Ah?

286
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,060
No.

287
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,960
She said it wasn't her until the end?

288
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,310
Even when you said you saw her?

289
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,420
You said you saw the ruby ring on her hand.

290
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:29,010
You saw Cheon Seo Jin pushing Min Seol Ah.

291
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,100
It wasn't Cheon Seo Jin.

292
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,030
What?

293
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,570
The real culprit who pushed my daughter Seol Ah.

294
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,870
is not Cheon Seo Jin.

295
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,360
It's not?

296
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,000
Then who's the real culprit?

297
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,560
It's you. The person who killed my daughter.

298
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,820
My Seol Ah.

299
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,760
Why did you kill her?

300
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,810
Are you ok? Did you not get burned?

301
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,100
What are you talking about? I asked what you were talking about?

302
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,600
Do you remember the day I called you to the 47th floor?

303
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,150
The day I confessed Seol Ah was my daughter.

304
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,460
  I clearly saw the person who pushed Seol Ah. 

305
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,940
  Who was that? 

306
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,600
  She had a ruby ring on her hand. 

307
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
  A red ruby ring. 

308
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,010
  Did something happen? 

309
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,680
  I'm fine.  

310
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
  I'll call you later. 

311
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,230
  It was strange. Ever since you disappeared without a word. 

312
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,270
  But late that night, 

313
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,460
  I got a call from Ro Na. 

314
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,200
  Ro Na, why are you calling so late? 

315
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,670
  The police station? 

316
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,220
  She's at the police station, 

317
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,140
  but her mom wasn't picking up the phone. 

318
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,330
  I went into your house to wake you up, thinking you were asleep. 

319
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,370
  Yun Hui. 

320
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,890
  This is Seol Ah's necklace. 

321
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,010
  No matter how much I thought about it, 

322
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,150
  I couldn't think of a reason why you had her necklace. 

323
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,180
  Why are you so surprised? 
 So I went to ask you about it. 

324
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,100
  To confirm it for myself. But... 

325
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
  Revenge? 

326
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,930
  You're just trying to get what you want without getting blood on your hands! 

327
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,660
  I was fine on my own, but why did you send me to Bosong Village 

328
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,510
  and get me involved with Min Seol Ah? 

329
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,600
  Yun Hui, I need your testimony. 

330
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,960
 Come with me to the police station tomorrow and make a statement about what you know happened. 

331
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,100
  The police? Me? 

332
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,080
  My daughter who died so wrongfully 

333
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,560
  is in here right now. 

334
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,820
  Stop talking about Min Seol Ah. 

335
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,650
  I'm going to go 

336
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,450
  It wasn't the Yun Hui I used to know. 

337
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,290
  You were extremely nervous, 

338
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,880
  and seemed like you were hiding a big secret. 

339
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,820
  So I followed you. 

340
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,490
  No matter how hard I tried to understand you, I couldn't. 

341
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,550
  I couldn't understand why you tried to get rid of Seol Ah's necklace at that time 

342
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,310
It was as if,

343
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,830
you were trying to deny everything that happened that day.

344
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,590
What nonsense are you saying? Are you insane?

345
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,190
Have you gone crazy because of your dead daughter?

346
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,370
I understand you feel wronged and angry,

347
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,760
but stop imagining things.

348
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,360
Then why did you burn Seol Ah's necklace?

349
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,070
Why did you have her necklace?

350
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,740
I got it as a gift from Min Seol Ah.

351
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,170
To thank me for helping her. But after you told me she was your daughter,

352
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,370
I didn't want to be needlessly misunderstood

353
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,200
so I just threw it away. That's it.

354
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,660
No. You were drunk that day and lost your memory.

355
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,960
Then you remembered everything once you heard my confession.

356
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,330
That's why you burned all your clothes and the necklace to get rid of evidence, am I wrong?

357
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,140
Unnie! Why are you doing this to me?

358
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,040
I told you I didn't do it. I told you I didn't!

359
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,830
Lower your voice. Do you not care if Ro Na hears you?

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,140
Mom. What's wrong?

361
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,600
Are you fighting with her?

362
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,680
No it's not like that. Go buy some juice.

363
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,560
-There should be some in the fridge. 
 - If I tell you to buy it, just buy it!

364
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,630
Do you have evidence?

365
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,960
Evidence, not your suspicions.

366
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,710
Do you have hard evidence that I killed your daughter?

367
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,630
If you don't have any, then get out of my house this instant before I drag you out.

368
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,470
From now on,

369
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,920
we're through.

370
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,090
After Seol Ah died,

371
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,660
an autopsy was done.

372
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,480
On that small child's body, there were so many different DNAs from multiple people.

373
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,440
Of course that included Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

374
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,010
But there was one unidentified DNA that couldn't be confirmed.

375
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:42,450
A DNA that was left in Seol Ah's fingernails as she resisted.

376
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,670
Because of that, the police investigation kept getting delayed.

377
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,690
  The main culprit's DNA doesn't match with any of the Hera Palace residents. 

378
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,490
 Does that mean we can't find the culprit? 

379
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,440
 The fact that there was DNA found in the corpse's fingernails 

380
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,670
 it means there should be a visible scar left on the culprit. 

381
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,770
 I was curious. 

382
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,860
Who was the last person to see my Seol Ah?

383
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,410
I did it just in case.

384
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,660
Oh Yun Hui.

385
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,950
It was you.

386
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,110
 DNA Results 

387
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,110
  STR analysis test results show sample 1 and 2 are the same. 

388
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,220
Do you remember?

389
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,660
After Seol Ah died, there was an emergency meeting at Cheong Ah Arts School.

390
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,470
 What happened after you drank? 

391
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,990
 - I don't remember.
 - She just said she doesn't remember.  

392
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,750
 What is that scar on your hand? 

393
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,590
 As expected, you don't remember. 

394
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,040
Everything started to come together.

395
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,540
The scar on your hand that day is evidence.

396
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,100
What I saw wasn't Cheon Seo Jin's ruby ring

397
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,560
but the apple necklace that you grabbed onto from Min Seol Ah.

398
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,970
The person who killed Min Seol Ah was you, Oh Yun Hui!

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,870
No! No.

400
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,210
Was it because of Ro Na?

401
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,320
If it weren't for Seol Ah, your daughter, the 1st place wait listed student, would've gotten into Cheong Ah Arts School.

402
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,210
Is that why you killed Seol Ah? Is it?

403
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,090
Don't write a novel. All this is just your imagination.

404
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,950
Anyone can fabricate something like this.

405
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,850
Why? Is it not working out trying to make Cheon Seo Ji the culprit?

406
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,760
Is that why you're trying to blame it all on me?

407
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,470
Oh Yun Hui! How much worse can you get?

408
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:31,070
I could've gone straight to the police but I came here to give you a chance to ask for forgiveness.

409
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,530
I didn't kill her. I said I didn't kill her!

410
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,900
I understand your guilt, but that's not going to bring her back to life.

411
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,170
It's your fault you couldn't protect her!

412
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,110
Yes you're right! It's my fault.

413
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,100
A sin for mistaking a murderer for my friend.

414
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,970
If Ro Na found out the truth, what would she say?

415
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,260
If she found out her mom killed a person for her,

416
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,150
would she be able to understand and forgive her mother?

417
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,700
Don't you dare say anything to Ro Na about Min Seol Ah.

418
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,480
Don't make my kid who just got herself together waiver with your nonsense.

419
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,160
As expected, you don't fear anything when it comes to Ro Na.

420
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,430
Honey. We should go home.

421
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,000
Is this your answer?

422
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,500
Drag her away. Politely.

423
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,120
I'll go on my own.

424
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,510
I'll call you later.

425
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,060
You did well. You did the right thing, Oh Yun Hui.

426
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,800
I had to do it for Ro Na.

427
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,470
You did well.

428
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,570
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

429
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,290
It's so cold.

430
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,870
Seok Gyeong! What's wrong?

431
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,530
Ju Seok Gyeong! It's okay. Be still.

432
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,630
It's okay, Seok Gyeong.

433
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,430
Go away!

434
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,150
Dad! I'm scared.

435
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,220
Min Seol Ah keeps chasing after me.

436
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,220
It's okay. I'm right here. Don't be scared.

437
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,120
I'm right here so you don't need to be scared.

438
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,700
Did Mom kill Min Seol Ah?

439
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,460
Because of me.

440
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,240
Mom killed her to cover my wrongdoings.

441
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,280
It's okay, Eun Byeol. It's okay.

442
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,580
It's okay.

443
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,030
You're Min Seol Ah's biological mother?

444
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,050
You did a really careless thing, Sim Su Ryeon.

445
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,200
What are you relying on that you're acting out like this?

446
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,080
Were you always such a reckless person who would risk their own life for a dead child?

447
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,460
Say whatever you want.

448
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,280
If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have died like that.

449
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,130
Why did you do it? As if killing Seol Ah's dad wasn't enough,

450
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:23,160
that newborn— Why did you switch the newborn baby?

451
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,450
Then did you really expect me to raise that guy's child?

452
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,710
Aren't you being too naive?

453
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Why would I raise his kid when it's not even enough for me to rip him apart?

454
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,500
Don't think it's going to end like this.

455
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,700
I will definitely make you get punished for what you've done.

456
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,650
You bastard.

457
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,450
Who is it? The person who's giving you all this confidence.

458
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,710
Stealing Hye In and sending her to New York,

459
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,190
and putting on this show today can't be done by someone like Gu Ho Dong, a small fish.

460
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,550
There's another person helping you.

461
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,950
Tell me. Who is it?

462
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,500
Fine. It wouldn't be so bad

463
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,910
to see your dead daughter now.

464
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,930
It's Logan Lee, Chairman.

465
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,500
It's me. I was going to contact you.

466
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,300
Right now?

467
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,660
Okay.

468
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
Keep an eye on her.

469
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,900
Make sure the kids don't bump into her.

470
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,890
What is it? What happened?

471
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,680
Turn on the lights. Quickly!

472
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,480
Turn on the lights. Turn them on!

473
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,060
She's gone.

474
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,740
Find her. Right now!

475
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,660
Stop!

476
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,080
Excuse me for being late.

477
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,540
It's okay.

478
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,730
I'll have the same please.

479
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,690
So Mr. Ju, I heard you missed the event with Grace Jo.

480
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,440
You know I put in a lot of work into it, right?

481
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,190
You put me in a bad position.

482
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,730
So you wanna tell me what happened?

483
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,830
There was an accident.

484
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,790
It seems like you haven't heard anything at all.

485
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,230
There was a fun incident that happened in the limousine you sent.

486
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,620
Ah, yes, yes. I heard about it from my secretary.

487
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,810
There must have been some kind of confusion with the limousines.

488
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,900
Anyway, do you happen to know a man by the name of Ho Dong Gu?

489
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,840
Ho Dong Gu? Gu Ho Dong?

490
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,790
Yes. This man called me

491
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,160
and he asked me if I knew the real Dan Tae Ju.

492
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,270
He claims that you and others at the Hera Palace are involved in some kind of a

493
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,930
murder case.

494
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,470
Is this true?

495
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,380
He's not a trustworthy guy. You don't have to pay attention to him.

496
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,300
It's against my policy to go around digging up other people's private business matters.

497
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,820
But it did catch me off guard.

498
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,280
Considering the fact that you tried to sell your living daughter's property

499
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,640
and now a murder case.

500
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,430
I don't know if I can keep trusting you as a business partner.

501
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,460
The Investment presentation is tomorrow.

502
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,980
There are many investors interested in this casino business. You cannot be swayed now.

503
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,960
They are all false rumors and not true.

504
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,940
What if I don't believe you?

505
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,190
I will prepare diligently and earn your trust.

506
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,980
There won't be any disappointment.

507
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,360
Investment presentation.

508
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,800
I'll be looking forward to it.

509
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,550
Okay.

510
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,700
Did anything happen? Wasn't Ju Dan Tae suspicious?

511
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,480
He's someone with a lot of suspicions so I'm sure something is bothering him.

512
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,810
But since he's listed as the CEO and the investment presentation is coming up,

513
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,320
it looks like he wants to cover it up.

514
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,040
It was hard, wasn't it?

515
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,860
Why did you go to Oh Yun Hui's house?

516
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,210
What I saw that day was true.

517
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,450
 Don't you know that I'm close with Unni Su Ryeon? 

518
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:35,020
 If that bothered you, you wouldn't have come out in the first place. 

519
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,830
 Isn't that so? 

520
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,360
 Hello? 

521
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,210
 Yun Hui, why haven't you been answering? Ju Dan Tae is involved with my daughter's death.  

522
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,580
 I need you to go to the police station with me tomorrow and make a statement regarding Seol Ah's death. 

523
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,420
 The only person I can trust right now is you. 

524
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,850
 I am going to catch the murderer. Please help me, Yun Hui. 

525
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:18,190
 Oh Yun Hui joined hands with Ju Dan Tae. She betrayed me.  

526
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,380
What did I say?

527
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,520
I told you not to trust Oh Yun Hui!

528
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh Yun Hui killed her.

529
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,050
Our Seol Ah.

530
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,560
What did you just say?

531
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,940
The person who killed Seol Ah

532
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,750
was Oh Yun Hui.

533
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
Please calm down!

534
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,860
It's not time yet. Give me some time. I'll figure it out.

535
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,020
What more time do you need?

536
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,930
What are you expecting from her?

537
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,220
Oh Yun Hui already abandoned you.

538
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,830
She stuck to Ju Dan Tae and will do anything to kill you.

539
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,590
I know that! However, now isn't the time.

540
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,370
Why isn't it? All we need to do is kill her!

541
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,690
The same way she killed our Seol Ah.

542
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,030
I want to do that too!

543
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,350
But is that the end? What about after?

544
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,240
Do you think becoming murderers like them is the best for Seol Ah?

545
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,830
What about Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong? I'm their mother.

546
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,090
I can't end my life this irresponsibly.

547
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,440
I feel way more wronged, angry, and furious than you to the point where I feel like I'm going insane.

548
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,600
But I'm holding it in with all my strength.

549
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,550
Because this can't be solved emotionally. I'm going to pay them back my way.

550
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,600
In the end and in the most painful way.

551
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,720
So please do as we planned.  One by one.

552
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,830
That's the best thing we can do.

553
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,020
Chairman Ju. Why are you so late?

554
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,010
This is an emergency situation.

555
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,350
I thought my neck was going to fall out from waiting.

556
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,240
What's the matter calling us this early in the morning?

557
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,060
What do you mean what's the matter?

558
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,170
We almost died, including our kids!

559
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,930
Are you going  to just sit idly by doing nothing?

560
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,300
Sim Su Ryeon. Did you find her?

561
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,180
No.

562
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,650
You didn't find her?

563
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,730
Good job.  What a great job. Very good.  Good.

564
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,590
What?

565
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,220
It turned out that the identity of the eyes threatening us is Sim Su Ryeon.

566
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,020
How can a mother do something like that, not thinking about the trauma she could give the children?

567
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,680
It's not like we can report her to the police!

568
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,890
What did we do, right?

569
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,750
What are you scared of, when even our children know everything?

570
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,290
Sue her! Kidnapping, entrapment, blackmailing!

571
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,400
I can't just let this go.

572
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,020
Now that we think about it, everything Teacher Cheon said was right.

573
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,600
Su Ryeon really is Min Seol Ah's mother.

574
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,750
Up to now,  she was deceiving us and planning all this.

575
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,360
All this time, we didn't make any mistakes, did we?

576
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,230
Sim Su Ryeon was probably collecting evidence one by one.

577
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,140
Won't we all be handcuffed together?

578
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:47,090
Didn't you notice anything at all even though you were under the same roof with that woman this whole time?

579
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:51,180
You were showing off this whole time but you really have no sense. Are you stupid?

580
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,330
He probably didn't see it since he was so in love with his wife.

581
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,020
I'll admit my mistake.

582
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,960
However, what's important is what would happen from now on.

583
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,820
If we don't want to be blindsided by Sim Su Ryeon again, we have to be alert.

584
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,960
You really don't listen.

585
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,570
With the confessions out of our own mouths, what's the point of being alert?

586
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,700
What was our situation when we confessed?

587
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,750
Coerced!   False confessions which were coerced!

588
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,730
Bingo.

589
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:33,500
If we claim that we falsely confessed because we felt ours lives were threatened, then the police can't do anything.

590
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,540
From now on, we have to match our story.

591
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:41,760
Sim Su Ryeon dragged all of you into this in order to  get a divorce.

592
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,510
She's trying to get a large amount of alimony.

593
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,740
There's something else.  Sim Su Ryeon  is obsessed with the delusion that the dead Min Seol Ah is her daughter.

594
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,640
That's right.

595
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,630
There's no evidence that Min Seol Ah is Sim Su Ryeon's daughter.

596
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,410
What about Gu Ho Dong? What do we do about him?

597
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,260
I'll take care of that.

598
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,200
I'm going to chase him to the ends of the earth if I have to.

599
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,740
How have we built our Hera Palace into a kingdom?  We won't ever let it collapse.

600
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,520
Never.

601
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:51,940
I apologize.

602
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,910
Catch Sim Su Ryeon no matter what. I don't care if it's a corpse.

603
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,220
Eun Byeol. Did you sleep well?

604
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,100
Don't go to school today. I'll tell them.

605
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,740
I messed up my midterm exam so I can't be absent.

606
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,850
Who cares if you're absent, look at me.

607
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,110
Are you really okay?

608
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,510
Eun Byeol's mental state isn't that weak.

609
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,240
What are you doing not going to school? Warm up your voice before the other students get to school.

610
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,890
You're right. I should do what I've been doing.

611
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,710
Since I did nothing wrong.

612
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,230
It's just that you and Dad didn't raise me right.

613
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,120
Eun Byeol.

614
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,430
Are you pressing forward with what you're doing now?

615
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,720
Do you really have to go through with the Chairperson inauguration despite everything?

616
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,000
After what we went through yesterday?

617
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,140
I didn't do anything wrong so why must I act like a sinner?

618
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,360
I won't just watch and have Sim Su Ryeon get what she wants.

619
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,670
If we divorced, stop interfering and overstepping boundaries!

620
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,400
Are you not worried after looking at Eun Byeol's mental state?

621
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,910
Don't you see she's getting worse and worse?

622
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,910
She had nightmares all night, said nonsense, and isn't in her right mind right now! Eun Byeol!

623
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,240
Right now to Eun Byeol

624
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,740
there is no greater comfort than her mom becoming the Chairperson.

625
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,320
That's my way of helping her.

626
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,360
If you do nothing but baby Eun Byeol, do you think anything will change?

627
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,300
Will she flounder in nightmares of Min Seol Ah for the rest of her life?

628
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,300
You're incompetent and irresponsible. A worthless father like you!

629
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,140
You're really a scary woman.

630
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,540
Do you even know what Eun Byeol is thinking?

631
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,170
She's scared because she thinks you killed Min Seol Ah.

632
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,960
I didn't do it.

633
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,090
Isn't that good enough?

634
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:24,100
Stop making a fuss and just attend the inauguration as the Director of Cheong Ah Medical Center.

635
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,610
I found this on Gu Ho Dong's desk this morning. 
   Letter of Resignation 

636
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,310
 Resignation 

637
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,720
 My resignation. Go f***  yourself. 

638
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,810
Isn't this guy a psycho?

639
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,640
How dare he tell you to go f*** yourself—

640
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,920
Chairwoman, he was getting in the way anyway so isn't it for the better?

641
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,690
Isn't it a great gift that he did this before your inauguration?

642
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:08,200
On top of that, preparations for the inauguration ceremony this afternoon are progressing smoothly step by step.

643
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,920
Today as a surprise event, I agreed to sing the congratulatory song.

644
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,460
The song I'll sing is your favorite—

645
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,500
Okay. You can leave now.

646
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,250
Yes. Then I'll see you at the ceremony later.

647
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:37,060
  Go f*** yourself. 

648
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:46,210
Gu Ho Dong. Something doesn't seem right.

649
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,330
I knew it. Logan Lee was the person Unni Su Ryeon joined hands with.

650
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,390
Can we meet right now?

651
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,520
It's important.

652
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,070
So tell me why did you want to see me?

653
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,010
Is Unni Su Ryeon doing well?

654
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:47,200
I wondered where she was hiding but I feel reassured knowing she's with you.

655
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,820
I know that Unni Su Ryeon is staying with you at the hotel.

657
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:58,700
I already confirmed it so you don't need to lie.

658
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,570
As you already know, I'm an employee of J King Holdings.

659
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,290
The Chairman is currently looking for his wife.

660
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:17,080
As his employee, I should let him know what he wants to know.

661
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,670
Where Sim Su Ryeon is and with whom.

662
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,360
Then you should've contacted Mr. Ju.

663
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,870
Why in the world did you come to me?

664
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,970
I was curious.

665
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,710
Why are you helping Unni Su Ryeon?

666
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,270
Don't say.  Do you like her?

667
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,540
Your partner's wife?

668
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,900
Now Ms. Oh.

669
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,780
Why is it necessary for me to explain my personal feelings

670
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,090
to someone like you?

671
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,990
This business is probably just as important to you.

672
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:01,090
I'm just worried the business might be affected by personal feelings.

673
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,040
Is it because of Mr. Ju?

674
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,150
Because apparently to me,  you're the one who seems like you have personal feelings towards him.

675
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,100
What did you say?

676
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,240
Now did you really think that I was gonna go and invest my money

677
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,440
without doing any background research on my business partner?

678
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,090
Listen.

679
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,820
I don't care if you're his employee or his little Juliet.

680
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:48,490
Because it seems obvious that Mr. Ju's private life seems rather disturbing anyway.

681
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:53,870
So why don't we keep all this nonsense confidential for the benefit of both of us?

682
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:03,110
Because you do realize that we have a very very important  investment conference coming up, right?

683
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:10,490
As long as you're helping Unni Su Ryeon, we can't excuse you.

684
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,990
I am going to report your relationship with Unni Su Ryeon to the Chairman.

685
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,340
Listen. When this is over

686
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,340
I'm planning to take Su Ryeon with me to America anyway.

687
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,930
Did Unni say she's going to do that?

688
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,390
I'm convincing her at the moment.

689
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,640
Obviously she can't live with Mr. Ju anymore.

690
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,620
But isn't that what you wanted in the first place?

691
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,950
For me to get rid of her?

692
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,440
Unni Su Ryeon is going to go to America with Logan Lee?

693
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,090
Yes.

694
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,420
Did you find out what you needed to confirm? The helper for Sim Su Ryeon?

695
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,480
No, I need more time.

696
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,600
I'm asking you to hurry up a little.

697
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,040
Oh Yun Hui found out about our relationship? How?

698
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,000
It seemed like she saw you walk into the hotel.

699
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,410
I sealed her mouth for now but I don't know when she'll open it.

700
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:34,020
She needs to hold it in until the investment conference.

701
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:40,070
If Ju Dan Tae finds out before then, everything will go down the drain.

702
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,000
We have to leave it to the heavens.

703
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,680
Finally, it's judgment day.

704
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,900
Everything will work out.

705
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,390
It has to.

706
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,440
For Seol Ah. It must.

707
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,110
As a result of the vote of the board of directors of Cheong Ah Foundation,

708
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,160
I announce the appointment of Cheon Seo Jin as chairperson of the foundation.

709
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,260
 Seventh Inauguration of the Chairperson of Cheong Ah Foundation 

710
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,090
 Chong Ah Foundation For The Arts 

711
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,630
 Certificate of Appointment 

712
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,860
Congratulations.

713
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:33,690
Next, Chairperson Cheon Seo Jin will give her inauguration speech.

714
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,100
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.

715
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,750
First of all, thank you to all the very important guests who used their precious time to attend

716
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,800
and make this occasion brilliant.

717
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,590
I bow to express my profound thanks

718
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,100
to the board for trusting me and giving me their absolute support

719
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,010
by appointing me.

720
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,250
I will do as my father wished,

721
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,280
I pledge to everyone to lead Cheong Ah

722
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,000
to become stronger and more righteous.

723
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,010
 7th Cheong Ah Foundation Chairperson's Inauguration 

724
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,270
   

725
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,900
 Ha Yun Cheol 

726
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,600
I got a message.

727
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,050
What is this?

728
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:58,260
What?

729
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,960
   Private school corruption, illegal admission,  manipulation of entrance scores by director of CSSA. 

730
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,210
Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.  I'm Oh Song Hui from Jeongui Daily,

731
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:16,680
Did you know there was tip from a whistleblower about the admission corruption at CSSA?

732
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,410
Is it true that you manipulated your daughter's scores to get her into the school?

733
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,200
Is it true your daughter sang out of tune in the entrance exam,

734
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,160
gave up the exam midway, and  ran out?

735
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,050
They say that you received bribes from parents to raise their children's scores, is that true?

736
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,050
Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin?

737
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,620
Is it true?

738
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,480
We ask that you say something.

739
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,810
What's going on?

740
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,500
What is this?

741
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,060
 Ugly face of Cheong Ah Foundation's private school corruption, illegal admission revealed. 

742
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,130
 It is shocking that much of the content concerns soprano Cheon Seo Jin, new chairperson. 

743
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,890
  It is a fact that Miss Ha performed poorly on the entrance examination ... 

744
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,920
What do you think you're doing? Won't you stop this instant?

745
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,140
I am Oh Jun Hyeok, a prosecutor in the Seoul Central District Office.

746
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,800
I'm usually a fan but we meet like this.

747
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,730
I have a seizure and search warrant and an arrest warrant. Shall we just go?

748
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,440
Let go! Do you know who I am that you're putting you're hands on me?

749
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,910
Let go. Let go! Won't you let go this instant?

750
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:01,680
Chairwoman we 're in trouble! They took everything in the teachers' office too.

751
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,580
Chairwoman, what's going on?

752
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,110
An insider's tip?  What kind of crazy bastard?

753
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,980
Is it—

754
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,100
It's nothing.

755
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,470
There seems to be a misunderstanding but it'll be resolved soon.

756
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:23,580
Department Head Ma, until I return, take care of your position so that students and parents won't be alarmed.

757
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,480
Let go. Let go!

758
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,300
Chairwoman.

759
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,150
Do you think I'll crumble this easily?

760
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:40,580
I'm the Chairwoman of Cheong Ah Foundation,

761
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,300
Cheon Seo Jin.

762
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,120
 J King Holdings Casino Presentation 

763
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,100
Thank you.

764
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,220
Yes, hello.

765
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,480
Thank you for coming.

766
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,850
As much as our land in Myeong-dong is the collateral,

767
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:11,000
we two should be big shots in this business.

768
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,730
So let's not just entrust everything to Chairman Ju but involve ourselves directly.

769
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,450
We should do that.

770
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:21,660
Have you seen anything go well by trusting Chairman Ju's words?

771
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,860
That's what I'm saying.

772
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,740
Anyway, you didn't go to the Chairman inauguration?

773
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,810
The Hera Palace women spent all morning getting dressed to kill.

774
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,670
Even though you're divorced, you're still a Director of Cheong Ah Foundation. You should have  exercised your voting rights.

775
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,800
That way later on, you'll reap the profit.

776
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,310
If this investment goes well,

777
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,930
should I give a good amount of alimony and just coolly get a divorce?

778
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,010
Can you stop spewing nonsense?

779
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,950
I can't focus with all this chaos.

780
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,840
What is there to focus on? This isn't even the start.

781
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,210
Something doesn't feel right.

782
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,560
Why can't I see Logan Lee?

783
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,280
You're right. The American wallet is really late.

784
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,950
Why is Logan Lee so late?

785
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,970
Give him another call.

786
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,370
He's usually a very prompt person.

787
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,840
 Co-investment Contract 

788
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,400
 J King Holdings 

789
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,460
Secretary Hong. Start now.

790
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,650
- What happened? 
 - I can't reach him.

791
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,270
His phone has been off since earlier.

792
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:25,490
His phone is off on an important day like this?

793
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,060
It seems like the investors are starting to get anxious,

794
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:33,080
so why don't we just start the event? We can start with the business brief.

795
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:38,420
  Integrated Resort Casino Seoul 
 Investor Presentation on the Casino Complex Resort 

796
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:46,040
Hello. I apologize for the long wait.

797
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,080
I am Ju Dan Tae, the Chairman of J King Holdings.

798
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:59,110
Today my co-investor Logan Lee seems to be caught up in a long call with the American headquarters

799
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,220
so I will start off the investment conference.

800
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:08,130
The soon to be biggest casino in Asia will be built in  the heart of our country, in Myeongdong.

801
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,870
The casino complex to be built this time

802
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:15,540
with a super-sized swimming pool  and a luxury shopping center for the 4th industrial revolution

803
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,360
I'm confident it'll be the best tourist attraction in Korea.

804
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,280
Everyone, take a look at the screen.

805
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,860
In Myeongdong ...

806
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,850
Yes Eun Byeol, what is it?

807
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:29,900
What? I can't hear you.

808
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,190
Wait.

809
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,300
What's wrong, Eun Byeol. It's okay don't cry and talk to me.

810
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,780
Yes.

811
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,330
Talk slower, Eun Byeol.

812
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,910
I got it. I'll be on my way.

813
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:10,320
It is expected to generate 3.5 trillion won in annual sales.

814
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,970
Are you Chairman Ju Dan Tae?

815
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:31,120
Yes, but what is it?

816
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,450
This is a private event that you can't enter without an invitation.

817
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,620
You are being arrested without a warrant for embezzlement of public funds,

818
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,420
investment fraud, and violation of the Capital Market Act.

819
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,060
Arrest him.

820
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,930
What are you doing?

821
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,000
Why would I commit embezzlement? I have never once broken the law.

822
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,930
Let's talk at the station. Take him.

823
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:51,190
Where are you taking me?

824
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,860
Who ordered this?

825
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,330
Are you joking right now?

826
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,780
What do you mean embezzlement of public funds? When have I ever been short of cash?

827
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:25,110
You are charged with receiving investors' money by  using Logan Lee's name and giving them false information.

828
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:29,540
Why would I use and sell Logan Lee's name? He's my casino business partner!

829
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,740
Call Logan Lee right now. We can just call him and confirm!

830
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,020
Are you looking for me?

831
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,460
Logan! Logan!

832
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,070
Great timing. There seems to be a misunderstanding.

833
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:45,100
Please resolve this ridiculous situation.

834
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:51,500
You still don't get it now, huh, Mr. Ju.

835
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,840
The person who sued you is me, Mr. Ju Dan Tae.

836
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,230
What? What did you just say?

837
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:06,540
I sued you.

838
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:24,690


839
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,560
 The Penthouse Preview 

840
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,700
I told you that you were in for a surprise.

841
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,100
 Isn't it only fair if you go through the same thing? 

842
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,400
 Trash! 

843
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,790
 What's wrong, Eun Byeol! 

844
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:47,450
 You need to go through the sadness of losing a child too.  

845
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,030
 I won't leave you alone either, Unni. 

846
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,380
 Are you asking me to kill Sim Su Ryeon? 

847
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,990
 I'll wait for you until you come.  

848
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,880
 The truth will come out.  

849
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,270
 Try me. Let's go to the end.
