1
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,690


2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,080
   

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,230
 This man is the one my husband is most concerned about. 

4
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,020
 There is a rumour that he is planning to build a shopping center on land in Myeongdong, which my husband bought. 

5
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,960
His name is Logan Lee.

6
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,300
Other than the information that he's a Korean-American and an enormously rich man, nothing is known about him.

7
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,380
Then, no one knows how his face looks either?

8
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,240
Right.  Even my husband hasn't met him in person yet.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,580
Although he keeps trying to set up a meeting with him, it seems it gets cancelled every time.

10
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,730
As long as you can contact this man, my husband can't avoid hiring you.

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,870
Is this the information about that man?

12
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,110
I took photos of those documents secretly in my husband's study.

13
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,690
Approach Attorney Lee and make it look as if you got the information from him.

14
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,480
In that way, you will receive less suspicion.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,370
Can you do it?

16
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,880
I'm the one who passed the bar exam at the young age.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,430
Who do they take me for, huh?

18
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,540
Telling me to come and go...

19
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,840
Are you okay?

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
Ms. Oh Yun Hui...

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Oh, what's this, are you here to welcome me?

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,290
You must have had a lot of drinks, Attorney Lee.

23
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,160
Shush!  Why do you call me, Attorney Lee?

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,590
Is my name "nothing" as an identity?

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,020
Next time, call me Gyu Jin.

26
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,750
No, no!

27
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,640
Oppa.  Oppa Gyu Jin.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,330
Come on, call me that now, hurry.

29
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,150
Ah.. Oppa...?

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,950
By the way, there must have been something to upset you a lot.

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,320
You were cussing on your way here from over there.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,400
Something to upset me...

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,370
Yes, there was.

34
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,130
This is something to piss me off so much.

35
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,930
I was, you know, singing "Samba's Lady" in front of my mom,

36
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,980
like this, and borrowed 30 billion won  (about $30M),  you know?

37
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,080
And just all of it, bam!

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,240
I invested all with Chairman Ju, but all of a sudden,  what was that,

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,450
Logan Lee or whatever showed up,

40
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,880
and kept playing a prank, damn...

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,090
No, Gyu Jin, be quiet.

42
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,900
By the way, Ms. Oh Yun Hee, you make my heart flutter.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,310
Pardon...?

44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,190
Good night.

45
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,440
What a moron, seriously, he's a joke in every way.

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,580
What?

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,380
30 billion won...?

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,250
- A real estate agent. 
 - A real estate agent.

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,650
Then, you can say, "I've been a real estate agent for over 10 years."

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,420
I am a real estate agent of... for over 10 years.

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,220
- Myeongdong is. 
 - Myeongdong is.

52
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,530
Korea's number one shopping district.

53
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,380
Myeogdong is Korea's number one shopping district.

54
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,460
Hello, Mr. Logan Lee. I'm Yun Hui Oh.

55
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,830
 The only person in contact with Logan Lee is his secretary.  

56
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,560
 You should meet that secretary and persuade him.  

57
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,470
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,980
Wait, wait.

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,750
You're Mr. Logan Lee's secretary, aren't you?

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,640
Hello, my name is Oh Yun Hui.

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,960
Can I meet him for a moment, please?

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,100
If you don't have any appointment in advance, you can't meet him.

63
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,510
Oh, excuse me, but this is for something really urgent.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,070
This is really an important matter to me.

65
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,400
Just 10 minutes or 5, no, can't I have just one minute, please?

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
Please escort her out.

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,600
Just a moment would be enough for me.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,680
You think I would give up?

69
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,050
I put my life on it too!

70
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,720
♫  The vengeance of hell boils in my heart  ♫

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,220
♫  Death and despair flame about me   ♫

72
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,120
♫  If Sarastro does not through you feel  ♫

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,670
♫  The pain of death  ♫

74
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,100
♫  Then you will be my daughter nevermore  ♫

75
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,250
I was intimidated for no reason.

76
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,250
Unni, it's me.

77
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,740
I couldn't meet him yet.

78
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,950
Sorry for all your hard work.

79
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,530
It's not a hard work. You know what,

80
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm totally full of tenacity now.

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,250
Logan Lee?

82
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll meet him no matter what.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, call me if there is any good news.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,120
What good news?

85
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,720
When did you come home?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,540
Who were you talking to so warmly?

87
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,260
Ro Na's mom?

88
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,190
I talked to her as we had something to discuss about the kids' school.

89
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,550
Didn't I tell you that I don't like her?

90
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,660
I think I told you to keep your distance from her.

91
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,900
It's also possible that she approached you on purpose.

92
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,160
Why would she when I'm a nobody?

93
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,810
I don't know anything about the school either.

94
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,060
- Didn't you tell me there was some important appointment?  
 - Damn it!

95
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,900
It got cancelled again.  That son of a b**ch, how arrogant he was.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,960
Even though he's loaded with money, so what?

97
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,140
It doesn't matter, it will be solved soon.

98
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,480
Sorry, but Mom needs to meet someone no matter what.

99
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,230
Don't wait for me but go to bed.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,830
Hello, I'm here again.

101
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,260
Please let me meet Mr. Logan Lee, I'm begging you.

102
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,010
It's because I really have to meet him, please?

103
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,410
Please follow me, Ms. Oh Yun Hui.

104
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,850
Pardon me?

105
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,370
Hello, thank you so much for your time.

106
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,990
I'm Yun Hui Oh.

107
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,730
Won't you state your business?

108
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm here to set up a meeting between you and Mr. Ju,

109
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,230
the president of J King Holdings.

110
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,990
Did he send you here?

111
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,140
If that's the case, I really don't have anything to say to you.

112
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,590
Please escort her out.

113
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,060
- Please, this way. 
 - No, wait.

114
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,040
No, no, no! I can't go like this! Oh dear.

115
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,090
I-I must bring you to Mr. Ju.

116
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,790
Please help me. My-my life depends on this.

117
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,190
You are the only one person who can help me.  Oh.

118
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,550
Y-You know Myeongdong?

119
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,110
Myeongdong is, uh, number one shopping town in Korea.

120
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,620
Here is the... the estimate investment profile...?

121
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,630
Gosh, I memorized all, but...

122
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,540
Oh, okay.  Myeongdong is Korea's leading commercial district

123
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,030
with high symbolism.

124
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,200
You can just speak in Korean.

125
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,910
His Korean listening is okay.

126
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,410
Really?  Thank you!

127
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,950
Then, in that case anyway,

128
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,520
I'll tell you honestly.

129
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,950
I got conned by Chairman Ju Dan Tae and lost a huge amount of money.

130
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,180
To take that money back,

131
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,610
I really have to get hired by J King Holdings.

132
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,550
This won't cause any harm to you at all.

133
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,860
All you have to do is meet him just once.

134
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,420
If you help me this time, I'll repay your kind favour no matter what.

135
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,220
Please, please help me, please.

136
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,470
Then why don't we set up a meeting for tomorrow?

137
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,100
Tomorrow?

138
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,760
 J King Holdings 

139
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,600
At last, we finally meet, Mr. Ju.

140
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,940
I may be the Logan Lee you were looking for.

141
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,270
Logan Lee?

142
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,530
Wow,

143
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,150
quite a view you've got here, Mr. Ju.

144
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,660
What do you think?

145
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,960
Are you now interested in interviewing me?

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,370
I almost got fooled by you perfectly,

147
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,190
Oh Yun Hui.

148
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,740
How can I believe this man is Logan Lee?

149
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,390
I myself have never seen Logan Lee's face yet,

150
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,250
yet you brought such a person like him to me?

151
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,830
You would really regret what you just said.

152
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:53,800
He wants to know that you are really Logan Lee.

153
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,550
Prove.. yourself?

154
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,450
Prove myself?

155
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,730
Please.

156
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,790
As you wish.

157
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,810
 Incoming: Logan Lee 

158
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,460
Please.

159
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,510
You have a very respectable employee, Mr. Ju.

160
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,260
Now, can we get down to some business?

161
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,750
For your reference, his Korean listening is quite good.

162
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,720
So, you can talk to him comfortably.

163
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,760
How beautiful.

164
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,250
The image of a woman being loved.

165
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,530
Do I seem that way? A gift of flowers is always nice to receive.

166
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,610
Have a seat. I'm curious to know what you want to speak to me about.

167
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,480
Go ahead and open that first. Looks like there's a gift, too.

168
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
Shall I?

169
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,630
 Indeed, it was you. 

170
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,220
 The criminal who killed my daughter. 

171
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,940
What's wrong, Seo Jin?

172
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,250
It's nothing.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,870
Is this the ring you wore on that day?

174
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,170
What did you say?

175
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,220
On the first anniversary of Hera Palace.

176
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,680
This went very well with you so I particularly remember this.

177
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,200
 You did it while you were paying attention to your ruby ring, didn't you? 

178
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,880
 How much on earth does this stone cost? 

179
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,530
 You're all prettied up today, Teacher Cheon. 

180
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,760
By the way, you receive the same ring as a gift again?

181
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,610
Give it to me.

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,580
Are you okay, Seo Jin?

183
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,390
You're bleeding a lot.

184
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,670
The ring is very sharp.

185
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,890
What would you do if your face were scratched?

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,090
You can't have a scar on your beautiful face.

187
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,970
Seo Jin, why are you trembling?

188
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,080
You must be happy to find the ring that you lost.

189
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,310
What are you talking right now?

190
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,300
I've never had this kind of ring.

191
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,970
You must mistake something—

192
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,010
Seo Jin, why are you so sensitive today?

193
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,750
Is there any story behind that ring?

194
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,430
Tell me what you want to talk quickly.

195
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,940
Why did you want to meet me?

196
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm going to have a party with Hera Club families this weekend.

197
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,170
My Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong were selected as PR models.

198
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,920
I think I didn't thank you properly for that.

199
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,690
You wanted to see me just to talk about a mere congratulatory party for PR models?

200
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,040
You're an expert on the subject of partying.

201
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,190
If you're the lady of Penthouse, aren't you supposed to be able to do at least that by yourself?

202
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,000
I have something urgent to do,  so I should leave now.

203
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,650
Right. Run.

204
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,970
To Ju Dan Tae.

205
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,010
I knew we would speak the same language as well.

206
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,230
Okay so, I would have to talk for the details with Ms. Oh here, right?

207
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,200
 Yangjae Flower Market 

208
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,800
Do as you please.

209
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,530
Ah, are you free on the weekend? We'll have a party at Hera Palace.  I want to invite you.

210
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, that'll be an honor.

211
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,380
I'd love to see the Hera Palace myself.

212
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,780
I heard from Ms. Oh here that there is a marvelous fountain there.

213
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,100
I'll prepare it to make the best party.

214
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,230
I will be looking forward to it.

215
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,780
The car is ready.

216
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,340
Well, let's talk about it now.

217
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,260
The reason Ms. Oh Yun Hui particularly wants to get a job at my company.

218
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,600
I need money.

219
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,750
I was looking through the job advertisements.

220
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,240
I saw an advertisement that J King Holdings was looking for an experienced employee.

221
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,430
So I searched somehow.

222
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,540
For what J King Holdings' chairman wants right now.

223
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,660
Lucky for me, Attorney Lee Gyu Jin easily opened his mouth

224
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,010
about a person named Logan Lee.

225
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,890
You're saying you heard about him from Attorney Lee?

226
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,100
Is it your specialty that you always get clingy to anyone?

227
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,310
I persuaded Logan Lee using that specialty.

228
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,120
That Logan Lee came here today was completely due to my ability.

229
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,520
Not your ability, Chairman.

230
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,410
If you want to sell Myeongdong land in the future, you need me to be here.

231
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,190
Don't forget that.

232
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,890
Contrary to your looks, you must be talented.

233
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,730
Fine.  Then you must succeed in getting a contract signed.

234
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,590
But,  up to there is it.

235
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,460
Once the contract case is finished, I don't think there'll be any reason to see you any more.

236
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,610
Perhaps at the time,

237
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,960
you may try to hold me, Chairman.

238
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,750
Is that so?

239
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,540
Crazy b**ch.

240
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,030
Yes, Unni.  Cheon Seo Jin is here.

241
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,400
Is that so?  How about what I asked?

242
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,890
Don't worry.

243
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,280
I hid it well.

244
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,860
What's the matter?  I told you not to come to my office!

245
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,680
That's why!  Why didn't you pick up the phone?

246
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,830
I was in the middle of an important meeting!

247
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,230
This!  Did you send this to me?  What did you think and send it to me?

248
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,010
What are you talking?  Why did I send this to you?

249
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,080
Was it not you?

250
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,260
Flowers and this ring...

251
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,710
were delivered under your name.

252
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,480
What?

253
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,160
That ring...

254
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,780
I threw it into the trash can at my house on the day after Min Seol Ah's death.

255
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,010
It has already been past a few months since it happened.

256
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,260
Someone sent me the ring using your name.

257
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,690
Someone definitely knows what we did. They're clearly threatening us.

258
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,210
Lower your voice.  There are a lot of ears to hear us.

259
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,060
There is nothing to get afraid of.

260
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,400
Min Seol Ah committed suicide.

261
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
She didn't commit suicide...

262
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,150
You know it well.

263
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,020
The threatening letters with an eye drawn...

264
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,630
The person is aiming at us.

265
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,120
Director Min already died in prison.  I told you I had taken care of him.

266
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,030
It's not Director Min.

267
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,170
The threat letters, flower bouquet, and this ruby ring

268
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,420
Sim Su Ryeon, your wife is the person who sent them.

269
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,930
What?

270
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,560
Why on earth do you suspect her?

271
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,890
Why would she do such things?

272
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,730
 To unveil what we did to Min Seol Ah. 

273
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,940
 Don't you get it yet? 

274
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,100
 Your wife is trying to dry our blood to death. To get revenge against us. 

275
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,830
I'm sure there is a connection between your wife and Min Seol Ah.

276
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,120
Perhaps, Min Seol Ah is

277
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,710
your wife's hidden daughter.

278
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,260
What nonsense are you talking?

279
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,660
It's not a nonsense talk!

280
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,120
Her daughter already died!

281
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,740
What?

282
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,820
The child who was placed in the charnel house.

283
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,250
She was the daughter my wife gave birth to before our marriage.

284
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,160
In the charnel house?

285
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,830
 How could you hide away a sick daughter in the hospital like that? 

286
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,060
 I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier. 

287
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,670
 Is this child a product of adultery, by any chance? 

288
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,500
Then that child...

289
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,030
was not your own daughter?

290
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,590
Right.

291
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,180
Before we married, we had different partners from each other.

292
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,250
And each other's own children.

293
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,400
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong are not the children whom she gave birth to.

294
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,230
We started a new family when they were new born babies.

295
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,330
They had grown knowing that she was their real mom.

296
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,470
I haven't imagined it at all.

297
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,950
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong are not Sim Su Ryeon's own children...

298
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,980
Then how about Sim Su Ryeon's ex-husband?

299
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,150
He died.

300
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,130
Before their baby was born.

301
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,060
Rather,

302
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,010
I'm suspicious of your husband.

303
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,440
What do you mean?

304
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,840
This ring... You said you threw this into the trash at your house.

305
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,150
Then who would have this?

306
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,290
If your husband knew our relationship, would he want to threaten us using Min Seol Ah?

307
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,440
No way.

308
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,490
Probably, it's not.

309
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,160
Although he is stupid, he is not as bad as doing this kind of stuff.

310
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,580
Do you still trust Ha Yun Cheol?

311
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,410
 Then let's check out. 

312
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,500
 Who the person was who sent out a courier delivery. 

313
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,180
 Close relationship between Political and Business Circles. 

314
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,260
 Possible Suspects 
 Real Estate Investment Club 

315
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,420
 Little Hera Club 

316
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,100
 Anna Lee 
 Oh Yun Hui 

317
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,650
Oh Yun Hui also was in Hera Palace at the night of the fountain lightening event.

318
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,660
Hera Palace?

319
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,590
Are you sure?

320
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,870
Yes. I heard she went to Cheon Seo Jin's lesson room and ran riot.

321
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,300
It was recorded on CCTV and Cheon Seo Jin's husband, Ha Yun Cheol was a witness.

322
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,680
Oh Yun Hui... Her daughter got accepted into Cheong Ah Arts, instead of Seol Ah.

323
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,030
Mother and daughter moved into the apartment in Bosong Village, where Seol Ah used to live.

324
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,320
 POSSIBLE SUSPECTS 

325
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,880
 Oh Yun Hui 

326
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,570
With this, everything is complete.

327
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,650
The people were there in Hera Palace on the day and at the time.

328
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,950
The suspects who killed Seol Ah.

329
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,300
Eun Byeol, what are you doing? I'm afraid you may fall while doing so.

330
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Dad, I have to memorize everything for the mid term exams by today.

331
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,600
Oh my! My daughter.

332
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,980
- Hello. 
 - Hi, Ro Na.

333
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,580
It's good to move in Hera Palace, isn't it?

334
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,570
- There are a lot of friends here too. 
 - Yes.

335
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,070
Okay.

336
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,140
Are you feeling better?

337
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,130
Who said you could worry about me?

338
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,750
Who said you could touch my stuff with your dirty hands?

339
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,040
Are you trying to look good in front of my dad?

340
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,780
Eun Byeol, why are you being so mean to your friend?

341
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,360
Friend? She's not my friend.

342
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,660
I don't have such a loser as a friend.

343
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,710
And! Can't there be separate elevators for lower levels and upper levels?

344
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,630
How much longer do I have to put with her?

345
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,240
So annoying!

346
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,450
Eun Byeol!

347
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,960
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

348
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,190
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

349
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,060
 Did you find out? 

350
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,900
 Some male ordered the flower delivery. 

351
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,210
 But, the cellphone number was Professor Ha's. 

352
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,350
I even covered up for his medical malpractice.

353
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,280
And you play such childish jokes?

354
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,040
Acting like a loser until the end.

355
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,530
Eun Byeol, why are you acting like this?

356
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,150
Hold on! Let's talk.

357
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,570
I don't want to talk to you!

358
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,780
What's wrong?

359
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,100
Don't you know why she's being so sensitive?

360
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,650
You should have let her rest. Why do you give her so much pressure on exams?

361
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,540
It looks like you're the one giving her stress.

362
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,830
It's my fault again?

363
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,540
Eun Byeol is my daughter. I know her the best.

364
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,800
So stop bothering the kid, who's busying studying for her tests.

365
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,700
I don't even expect you to act like my husband.

366
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,830
You can act like the other dads, at the very least.

367
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,770
My reference books. My workbook.

368
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,310
Eun Byeol.

369
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,330
Where are my reference books?

370
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,700
Did you throw them away?

371
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,070
- Do you expect me to lose against Ro Na? 
 - What?

372
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,400
Why were you being so nice to Ro Na?

373
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,600
Don't you know how much I hate her?

374
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,500
Why were you being so nice to her, when I ddm't even like that I had to share the same space as hers!

375
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,910
She's your classmate!

376
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,710
Why? Are you pitying Bae Ro Na?

377
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,590
Are you worried about her because she's the daughter of your first love?

378
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,930
Do you feel bad because she grew up without a father?

379
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,930
What nonsense are you talking about?

380
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,110
Mom told me everything! Aren't you seeing Bae Ro Na's mom?

381
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,840
Eun Byeol!

382
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,050
Did you really want to go to your first love, leaving me and mom behind?

383
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,230
Is that why you were being good to Ro Na?

384
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,800
Eun Byeol stop acting like this, don't listen to your mom.

385
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,450
The person I love the most in this world is you, Eun Byeol.

386
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,410
Liar! You were smiling at Ro Na before!

387
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,340
You're not on my side.

388
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,980
That's a misunderstanding. Listen to me!

389
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,770
I only have Mom!

390
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,620
Mom has gone to such great lengths for me, including Min Seol Ah—

391
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,830
I don't want to see you!  Get out of here!

392
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,940
If not!

393
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,820
I'm going to die like Min Seol Ah.

394
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,580
What?

395
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,400
What happened to you?

396
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,170
Since when did you turn like this?

397
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,400
So annoying!

398
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,500
You're a coward. And as the head of the house, you're worthless.

399
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,390
Get out! I don't want to see you anymore!

400
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,770
Hey!

401
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,150
Why did you tell her about Oh Yun Hui?

402
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,930
Did you have to hurt her as well?

403
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,230
What's wrong? It's not like I made it up.

404
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,170
Shouldn't Eun Byeol know the truth, if she has to go up against Bae Ro Na?

405
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,970
You really did this... to make her feel competitive?

406
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,400
You're really giving me goosebumps.

407
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,150
Who's the one to talk?

408
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,870
You acted like you would take care of things neatly but who was doing all nasty things behind my back?

409
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,300
You must have fun that you found my weakness.

410
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,900
If you want to get called "Dad" from Eun Byeol later,

411
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,600
you quietly stay lying flat and sign the paper.

412
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,000
Why are you acting so honorably?

413
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,360
Should I tell the world about what you've done?

414
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,580
If you have the courage to, then go ahead!

415
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,200
But you're going to look like the stupider one.

416
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,290
Will you be okay?

417
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,050
Can we please play fairly until we get divorced?

418
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:47,140
For someone whom you've lived with for 17 years, it's impolite to stab me in the back this way.

419
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,380
Don't provoke me anymore.

420
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,980
I can't stand you anymore.

421
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,490
  The threat letters, flower bouquet, and this ruby ring    

422
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,940
  Sim Su Ryeon, your wife is the person who sent them.    

423
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,810
 Your wife is trying to dry our blood to death.  

424
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,560
 To get revenge against us. 

425
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,320
Will this be enough?

426
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,000
Are there more people you want to invite?

427
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,190
There's one more.

428
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,450
Logan Lee. He's an important guest, so we'll have to give our special attention.

429
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,360
Is he the person that you said you had to meet?

430
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,070
You were able to get in contact with him? That's a relief.

431
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,760
I'm also very curious about what kind of person he is.

432
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,710
And there's one more. Invite 4502 as well.

433
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,390
Yun Hui too?

434
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,480
Can we?

435
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,900
I don't like it, but she's got connections with Logan Lee.

436
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,190
I don't have any choice except to invite her.

437
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,620
I guess she would become a good connection for you.

438
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,830
Don't give a sharp edge to her but treat her kindly.

439
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,760
Strangely, she makes me offended.

440
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,190
I can't figure out what she is thinking at all.

441
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,710
Then, I'll deliver the invitations.

442
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,070
It's been a while since the members of Hera Club gathered, so I'm excited.

443
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,620
Let's go get you fitted for some dresses tomorrow.

444
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,540
The punk Logan Lee has no ordinary eye.

445
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,380
Really? I was worried that I didn't have anything fit for the occasion.

446
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,220
   

447
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,490
Yes, Housekeeper Yang?

448
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,070
They said Chairman Ju would host a party this weekend.

449
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,750
They also talked about going dress shopping tomorrow.

450
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:19,030
Oh really? Thank you for your work.

451
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,070
Why is she acting like she has all the time in the world?

452
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,980
What on earth does she believe?

453
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,600
How is it?

454
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,800
It looks good on you.

455
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,900
My wife looks good in anything.

456
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,890
You really do look very beautiful in anything.

457
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,700
I don't know what to recommend, because it all looks good.

458
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,540
You pick for me.

459
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,060
I like anything that you like.

460
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,400
Why don't you try this one as well? We have to prepare only the best.

461
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,840
You have to look the most stunning at the party tomorrow.

462
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,400
Can you ring up everything she's tried on so far?  Try it on.

463
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,080
That scarf too, please.

464
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
Yes, Madam.

465
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,920
What's wrong?

466
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,020
It's nothing!

467
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:00,290
You look very beautiful, Min Seol Ah's mother.

468
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,380
What are you doing here? How did you know I would be here?

469
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,660
There's nothing I don't know about you, Sim Su Ryeon.

470
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:12,230
You were so relaxed but why are you so nervous now?

471
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,590
You ignored my warning but are having fun getting ready for a party with your husband.

472
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,760
Don't mind someone else's business and leave immediately!

473
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,620
 Madam, may I come in? 

474
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,000
 I'm going to help you. 

475
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,600
It's okay, I can do it myself.

476
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,200
I changed my mind.

477
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,890
Let's reveal the fact that you're Min Seol Ah's mom

478
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,220
immediately at the tomorrow's party.

479
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,160
What?

480
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,460
I think it'll be more fun if there are more in the audience.

481
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,750
Isn't it a good day that we make people surprised?

482
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,650
I'll tell people everything at the right time.  So don't butt in.

483
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:59,150
I warned you that I wouldn't stay still if you were in my way.

484
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,620
Tomorrow is D-day.

485
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,760
There is no negotiation.

486
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,880
And I heard everybody who knew Min Seol Ah would gather together just in time.

487
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Don't you think it's the best opportunity of all?

488
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,390
Can you hold on a little longer? There's something I must take care of.

489
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,310
Ahjumma!

490
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,240
Ahjumma.

491
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,220
I don't have so nice a personality as to consider your situation.

492
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,330
I've already gotten punished.

493
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,460
I'm not happy.

494
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,330
Did you already change it?

495
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,610
What are you doing?  Hurry and leave, please.

496
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,500
Honey?

497
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,340
What's the matter?  Are you okay?

498
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm fine.

499
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,120
I was a little bit dizzy.

500
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,580
I think I overworked a bit while preparing the party.

501
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,260
I'm sorry.

502
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,060
I'll change it quickly and go out.

503
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,310
Okay, I got it.

504
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,970
Don't forget.

505
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,480
It's tomorrow.

506
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,630
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

507
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,230
Why did you summon us again?  I thought something would've happened so my heart almost fell.

508
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,790
No matter what, I think the person who is imitating Min Seol Ah is Bae Ro Na.

509
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,640
Bae Ro Na?

510
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,400
Besides the sneaker which was missing at school,

511
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
who would be connected to Min Seol Ah, except her?

512
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,980
Oh, that's very right.  Bae Ro Na used to live at the Min Seol Ah's house.

513
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,790
It's strange that after Min Seol Ah died, Ro Na got into the school in place of her.

514
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,580
And also strange that she moved into Min Seol Ah's house in Bosong Village.  Everything is strange.

515
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,410
Don't you think it's strange that she followed us even to Hera Palace?

516
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,620
Then she did all on purpose?  Is she possessed by Min Seol Ah ghost or something?

517
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,390
Stop it now! Please!

518
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,680
Everything is all guesses.

519
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,870
There is no solid evidence that Ro Na did it.

520
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,420
We can find the evidence, can't we?

521
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,960
What?  Do you have a good idea?

522
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,090
Just leave it to me.

523
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,400
Hey, Bae Ro Na, what are you doing?  Oh, studying English.

524
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,090
- Look at this, you got everything wrong. 
 - Give it to me. 
 - I don't want to.

525
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,460
- I told you to give it back to me. 
 - I don't want to.

526
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,940
It worked!

527
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,160
What is this?  There is no group chat.

528
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,440
She already got rid of it.

529
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,380
That's enough.  Why are you looking at someone else's phone?

530
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,100
Hold on!

531
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,200
This puppy...

532
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,720
No way!  Is it the same puppy?

533
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,170
Sugar?

534
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,370
Is it really true Bae Ro Na did it?

535
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,160
Threatening us, pretending Min Seol Ah?

536
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,270
Do you still think it's not her?

537
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,180
Oppa, look at this with your own eyes.

538
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,130
Min Seol Ah and Bae Ro Na were holding the same puppy.

539
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,050
Is this coincident?

540
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,590
Look at this.  What did I say?  I told you that I was sure Bae Ro Na did it.

541
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,220
Wow, what a surprise!

542
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,770
If things go this way, we'll need a serious talk.

543
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,340
Geez, that wench completely played the fool with us.

544
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,400
Bae Ro Na.  I treated her like a human but... She is really an interesting girl.

545
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,940
I sent your secretary the information about Myeongdong land this afternoon.

546
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,340
By chance, did you look at it?

547
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,580
Oh, no. Not yet.  That's not my priority at the moment.

548
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,340
Listen. I met Mr Ju because you desperately asked me for a favor.

549
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,840
That didn't mean I was going to sign the contract right away.

550
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,370
A contract is made between two people.

551
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,350
So wouldn't it be nice to know what kind of people I'm dealing with?

552
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,000
Of course, it would.

553
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,370
With that being said,

554
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,440
What kind of a person are you, Ms.Oh?

555
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,060
Me?

556
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,360
What do you mean, what kind of person?

557
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,290
I heard you were admitted into the Hera Palace in a very dramatic way.

558
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:28,660
You bought some old beat-down apartment and made some big money out of it?

559
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,530
Ah, you heard it from Chairman Ju.

560
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,770
There was some situation.

561
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,190
Situation?

562
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,890
I wonder what that situation was.

563
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,110
That apartment came on the market with a much cheaper price than the market price.

564
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,130
Because some girl died there.

565
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,310
They said she committed suicide.

566
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,060
Suicide?

567
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,650
And you still decided to go with a purchase because...

568
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,810
Ah, of course, I didn't know it in the beginning.

569
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:10,150
But strangely, I didn't feel that house was a haunted house.

570
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:17,760
I had met the girl. She was really a nice girl.

571
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,560
Did you guys know each other well?

572
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,390
A little bit.

573
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,000
If she had had parents, she wouldn't have died like that.

574
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,700
 Possible Suspects 

575
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:50,270
You.  Were you really sincere with my Seol Ah?

576
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,120
 Oh Yun Hui: Lived for a while in Yongsan, moved to Bosong Village 3 Dong, Unit 501 after Seol Ah's death. - Entered Hera Palace 

577
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,280
 Invitation to Hera Club Private Party to Logan Lee  

578
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,460
Just wait and see.  It'll be an unforgettable party.

579
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,640
 - Why are you here? 
 - Ahjumma? 

580
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,210
 What's wrong with your face?  Something happened to you? 

581
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,730
 Hera Palace people are trying to kill me. 

582
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,300
 I'm frightened, Ahjumma.  Please help me.  Please save me, Ahjumma. 

583
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,360
Right.  She surely said Hera Palace's people.

584
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,770
I'm sure.

585
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,110
 When I'm wearing this scarf, 

586
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:29,470
 it will mean that I plan to have you. 

587
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,940
Why was Min Seol Ah at Hera Palace that day?

588
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,160
By chance, if she didn't commit suicide but someone killed her...

589
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,890
It makes no sense.

590
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,820
- Mom! 
 - Yes, Ro Na.

591
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,320
It looks like Penthouse's ahjumma sent something to you.

592
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
All of these?

593
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,920
Oh my.

594
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,000
Wow! Is this for you to wear?

595
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,450
How pretty it is!  A kind of dress that I've ever seen in the movie.

596
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:40,080
 Walk in confidently, without feeling small. Today party's heroine is Yun Hui.  
   

597
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,430
Ahjumma's taste is no joke.  Try it on quickly, Mom.

598
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,020
It's really pretty.

599
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,860
Come on, what are you doing?  Hurry and try it on.

600
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,970
It's too pretty to wear. Because it's so valuable, how can I try this on?

601
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,770
The color and design are really great.

602
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,550
There are so many...

603
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,080
Mom, try this on.

604
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,240
- Am I pretty? 
 - Your whole body shines.

605
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,840
You look like the goddess Hera, who has both wealth and honor.

606
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,680
What?

607
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,330
It does look really nice.

608
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,510
  Seok Hun: I have something to say. 

609
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,450
 Can you come see me at the community room at 6? 

610
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,790
Ro Na.

611
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,030
  Bae Ro Na: Ok. I'll see you later. 

612
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,850
 Seok Gyeong: Mission clear 

613
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,950
A day like today can't end with just one drink.

614
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,200
Wow, Chairman Ju and his wife put a lot of effort into today's party.

615
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,770
They invited hotel chefs and all the food are special.

616
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,300
Is that Logan Lee such an important person?

617
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,510
Is he more important than you?

618
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,990
Min Hyeok's mom, what are you talking about?

619
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,380
Don't you know who Logan Lee is?

620
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,100
James Lee's son is the most successful Korean American.

621
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,060
Min Hyeok's mom, compared to your high education, your knowledge is very low.

622
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,420
That's what I'm saying, you should read the newspaper more often.

623
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,050
Honey, during these times,

624
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,910
how nice would it be if you stepped it up and helped with connections?

625
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,960
That's why I dressed up nicely today.

626
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,130
Not anyone can do that.

627
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,550
Only Chairman Ju,

628
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,890
Only Chairman Ju is able to become friends with a person like him.

629
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,540
People who live in the penthouse

630
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,930
are truly different from us.

631
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,080
Here she comes, the penthouse wife.

632
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,450
- Oh my. 
- Su Ryeon!

633
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,830
I haven't seen that dress before, it's so pretty!

634
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,860
Your scarf and dress looks so pretty together.

635
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,820
My husband bought it for me. It's a special day today.

636
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,040
As expected, no one can follow Chairman Ju's sense of style.

637
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,440
It would be nice if Je Ni's dad were here today too.

638
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,950
Where's Chairman Ju?

639
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,180
He went out to greet Logan Lee. They'll be here soon.

640
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,430
I should go out too.

641
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,630
- The first impression is important. 
 - Of course.

642
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,450
- Teacher Cheon. 
 - Teacher Cheon!

643
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,430
Your scarf. It's the same one as Su Ryeon's.

644
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,160
Su Ryeon said that Chairman Ju bought her the scarf.

645
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,730
And it doesn't seem like Doctor Ha would buy her that scarf.

646
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,730
Did you pick that out yourself, Teacher Cheon?

647
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,570
Why did you happen to select that one—

648
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,070
Our dress code overlaps.

649
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,970
I'm the type who doesn't do what others do.

650
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,150
Is that so? I thought it was the other way around.

651
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,900
I thought you had a cool personality that doesn't care whether something is mine or yours.

652
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,380
I'm ok, so you can keep wearing it.

653
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,050
You must've put a lot of thought into picking that one.

654
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,450
I'm going to use the bathroom.

655
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,650
Teacher Cheon looks totally flustered.

656
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,830
And she's running away to the bathroom.

657
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,160
Did she pick the same one on purpose?

658
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,140
She may act like she has a strong pride,

659
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,840
but she's really a copycat.

660
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,440
Seo Jin.

661
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,130
You've never not had something you wanted.

662
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,700
Same thing with Ju Dan Tae.

663
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:33,770
Sim Su Ryeon. Do you think the penthouse will be yours forever?

664
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,200
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

665
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,640
Welcome.

666
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,290
This is my wife.

667
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,850
It's a pleasure to meet you.

668
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:06,460
- My name is Logan Lee. 
 - It's an honor to meet you.

669
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,060
I'm Sim Su Ryeon. Thanks for coming tonight.

670
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,540
You guys look like a lovely couple.

671
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,730
I'm jealous, Mr. Ju.

672
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,140
If I knew this is gonna be the kind of scene,

673
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,600
I would've brought a partner myself.

674
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,820
Min Hyeok's mom, why is this so funny?

675
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,720
You're an important guest.  We can't leave you lonely.

676
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,590
So I brought your partner.

677
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,250
Please come in.

678
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,790
No. How—

679
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,060
Chairman Ju, did you invite Oh Yun Hui?

680
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,670
Yes, I invited her.

681
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,650
You invited her without the permission of the Hera Club?

682
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,700
This isn't like you, Chairman Ju.

683
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,380
Not a Hera Club Member,

684
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,480
she's here as an employee of the J Kings Holdings investment team.

685
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,330
I'm working with Chairman Ju on his investment team.

686
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,100
Thank you for inviting me to this wonderful party.

687
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,570
I've never been to a party like this, it's very nice.

688
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,350
Hi Logan.  You're looking great today.

689
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,920
The suit looks nice on you.

690
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,760
Thank you.  You look splendid yourself.

691
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,310
Thanks.

692
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,050
What are they saying?

693
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,680
What's on earth going on?  Am I the only one who doesn't know?

694
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,920
Since when was Oh Yun Hui working at your company?

695
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,860
Congratulations, Yun Hui.

696
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,750
My husband complimented you saying you are a great employee.

697
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,820
I heard you made the Logan Lee meeting happen.

698
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,850
Oh Yun Hui did? Why? How?

699
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,100
Are you friends with Logan Lee?

700
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,070
The night is young, I'll explain everything slowly.

701
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:15,450
But before that, the delicious food is making me hungry.

702
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,330
Can we talk while we eat?

703
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,480
That sounds good. Come over here.

704
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,730
After dinner,

705
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,290
we are planning on having a lighting ceremony at the fountain.

706
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,160
Logan Lee said he wanted to see that.

707
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,590
Yes. I hear it's the signature of Hera Palace.

708
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,210
Wow. You're all dolled up for your date.

709
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,040
What are you guys doing here?

710
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,240
Where's Seok Hun?

711
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,820
You came out because Seok Hun asked to meet you?

712
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,550
How absurd.

713
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,600
I have nothing to say to you guys.

714
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,240
Is running away your hobby?

715
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,920
Should I call Oppa Seok Hun for you?

716
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,470
You'll probably regret it. He's really scary.

717
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,610
Seok Gyeong, why are you doing this too?

718
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,370
I had some words with a rude piece of trash,

719
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,700
but did you think I was actually your friend?

720
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,870
Oppa Seok Hoon and I made a bet,

721
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,920
who would be able to trick you better.

722
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,010
Did you really mistake my brother liked you?

723
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,070
What did you say?

724
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,600
Stop acting fake and innocent.

725
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,860
We know you're threatening us pretending to be Min Seol Ah.

726
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,670
What are you talking about? Who am I pretending to be?

727
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,240
You're so brazen, it gives me goosebumps.

728
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,310
What's the point of asking if we already know she's going to act clueless?

729
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,300
Look at that terrible acting.

730
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,170
Let's skip to the conclusion. We can't attend school anymore with a girl like you.

731
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:53,160
So apologize for what you did and drop out of school.

732
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,110
Then we'll coolly cover it up for you.

733
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,670
Why do I have to do that? What did I do wrong?

734
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,910
She's a complete freak and psychopath!

735
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,990
You're the one who stole Min Seol Ah's shoes, right?

736
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,240
How can this thing attend Cheong Ah Arts School?

737
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,000
You bring down the standard.

738
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,630
Do you guys have nothing to do?

739
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:16,710
Are you that afraid I'll defeat you guys if I keep attending Cheong Ah Art School?

740
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,540
Is that why you're doing this?

741
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,530
Why would we be afraid of you?

742
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,620
You're nothing!

743
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,330
There's no need to get worked up.

744
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:28,020
She'll tell the truth eventually.

745
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,990
Where's Seok Gyeong?

746
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,240
She left earlier.

747
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,730
The tutor will be here soon.

748
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:53,570
You have a skill of surprising people in many ways.

749
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,700
How did you convince Chairman Ju?

750
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,180
His company is not an easy place to get into.

751
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,210
Yun Hui, you surprise me the more I know you.

752
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,720
I heard you brought Logan Lee.

753
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,030
That's so impressive. How did you do it?

754
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,780
It's probably...

755
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,530
My sincerity was felt by him.

756
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,490
Where did you learn English?

757
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,020
Your diction was good.

758
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,120
I studied.

759
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,650
If you want, I can introduce you to a good teacher.

760
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,990
I can listen to English very well.

761
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,230
I just can't do the speaking part well.

762
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,360
You're the host today, so don't drink too much.

763
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,840
Ok.

764
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,510
Is Doctor Ha not coming?

765
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,880
I sent him a separate invitation.

766
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,480
Would he come? The situation with that family is a mess.

767
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,580
Did you not reconcile?

768
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,030
I saw Doctor Ha sent flowers and a ring the other day.

769
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,870
Don't be too harsh on him.

770
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,250
A couple can fight,

771
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,190
and deceive each other. That's how it is.

772
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,150
Don't you think so, Honey?

773
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,840
I'm not sure. I'm not deceiving you with anything.

774
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,980
You know I'm not good at lying.

775
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,030
Excuse me.

776
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,990
Bravo!

777
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,360
What is this?

778
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,950
I think you're amazing, Su Ryeon.

779
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,050
You know how much I respect you, right?

780
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,640
Always graceful and kind,

781
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:30,360
you're the best wife who supports her husband well and a mom.

782
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,740
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong are great at their studies

783
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,870
and even became the PR models side by side, and  we're even having this  congratulatory party.

784
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:41,030
I'm so envious.

785
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,800
They aren't even your biological children,

786
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,370
how did you raise them so well?

787
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,150
What are you saying, not her biological children?

788
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,700
- Teacher Cheon, are you drunk? 
 - Didn't you know?

789
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,390
I thought you were all aware. Ah

790
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,240
I'm sorry, Su Ryeon.

791
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,340
But don't you think this would not be a secret these days?

792
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:30,170
Not once have I ever thought that Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong were not my kids.

793
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,570
And I've raised them that way so far.

794
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:36,180
It would be best to be careful with such words.

795
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:40,640
It's not good to hide anything or to be secretive.

796
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,140
If you're confident, there is no reason to hide something.

797
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:48,800
Honestly it was a little obvious you weren't their biological mom.

798
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,800
If you were the real mom, you would have an audacity that you could never show

799
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,900
even if you had to rise from the dead.

800
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,800
Is that so?  Parents are always lacking in something.

801
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,060
I'll have to try harder.

802
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,870
It isn't something that works by trying.

803
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,620
It's just instinctively loving your kids.

804
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,810
   
 Are you enjoying the party? 

805
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,770
 I heard the lightening ceremony would start soon. 
 I think that's the best time.  

806
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,750
 Tell people that you're Min Seol Ah's mother. 

807
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,320
 Speak loudly and clearly so I can hear you. 

808
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,160
 If you don't do it yourself, I can't do anything except do it myself. 

809
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,730
What are you doing? Why did you bring that up and in a place like this/

810
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:03,840
How about you?  You showily bought your wife the same scarf as mine.

811
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,980
You laughed "haha, hoho" with a loving face. Are you that happy?

812
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,290
Are you so excited?

813
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,310
If you love your wife so much, why are you seeing me?

814
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:15,860
I didn't buy her that scarf—  Don't you know today is an important event?

815
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,860
You don't need to make us uncomfortable in this way.

816
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,700
Are you crazy?

817
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,050
I don't know.

818
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,030
It seems you've become a different person all of a sudden.

819
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:34,380
Tell me how much you love me.

820
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,870
This is unlike you. Why are you acting like this?

821
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,530
- Don't you know my heart? 
 - I don't!

822
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,300
So let me confirm it immediately.  Right now!

823
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,620
Don't drink too much, you're drunk.

824
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,740
After finishing the party, I'll wait for you at the villa.

825
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,190
Since there are many eyes watching, go in first.

826
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,410
Okay.

827
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:29,160
Hey, you bastard! How did you do such a thing even at a place like here?

828
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,800
Are you guys animals?

829
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,590
You, I never liked you from the start, Ju Dan Tae you trash-like son of a b*tch!

830
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,030
You must've known it. But this would be the only time I got beaten by you.

831
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,480
Don't you think this would be enough for you?

832
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,990
What?  You bastard!

833
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,500
You have such an inferior complex, you bastard!

834
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,430
You have no right to live with that woman.

835
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,520
If you have a bit of conscience, let her go even now.

836
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,840
You're a son of a b*tch who doesn't know how to love a woman.

837
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,810
What? You son of a b*tch!

838
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,030
Son of a b*tch, I'll kill you!

839
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,770
What are you guys doing? Stop it.

840
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:21,330
Stop! I told you to stop!

841
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,090
- You bastard! 
 - Stop!

842
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,780
Stop!

843
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,440
Logan Lee!  Logan Lee is here!

844
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,340
Won't you start the lighting ceremony?

845
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,730
Are you going to take all responsibility if our contract falls through?

846
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,830
Move aside!  I'll kill him!

847
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,670
Let him go! Let him go!

848
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,580
Ah really!

849
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,130
That's why Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong acted cockily.

850
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,140
I thought it was strange somehow.

851
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:00,360
If she were their biological mother, would she be so uninterested in their studies?

852
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,850
There was a reason Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong were so gloomy.

853
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:08,470
I agree so. She so often pointed out the kids' faults.

854
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,770
It all makes sense now.

855
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,240
Right?

856
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
Oh, Teacher Cheon.

857
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,250
Unni, is it true?

858
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,660
What Cheon Seo Jin said earlier.

859
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,930
I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

860
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:33,190
Why are you sorry? That wench is the crazy one.

861
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:37,390
Who is she to reveal someone's private life?

862
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,820
That was all the bastard Ju Dan Tae had told her, right? Those bastards who should be struck by the lightning.

863
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,520
Does someone have to give birth to be a parent?

864
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,630
Who has raised the kids with sincere care?

865
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:51,420
Unni, don't mind what Cheon Seo Jin said at all.

866
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,500
Everybody knows how hard you've tried.

867
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,020
I'm fine.

868
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,920
I mean it.

869
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,060
You must've had a lot of heartache, Unni.

870
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,610
 Fake Min Seol Ah, Bae Ro Na 

871
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,400
 Agree to drop out school? 

872
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,870
Where is Chairman Ju?  There is a guest here.

873
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,230
He doesn't answer the phone. Did something happen to him?

874
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,930
 I've already gotten punished. 

875
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,310
 I'm not happy. 

876
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,400
- Honey!  What happened to your face? 
 - Oh my!

877
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,740
- What happened? 
 - It's nothing.

878
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,920
Why are you here?

879
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,760
If you want to be here, you should've put some effort in your appearance. What's the matter with your appearance?

880
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,620
I changed my mind.  I won't divorce you.

881
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,660
What did you say?

882
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,300
I told you I wouldn't divorce you until I die.

883
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,630
I don't care if you see another man.

884
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:21,960
In return, you live unhappily as my wife forever and die.

885
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,270
I'm sorry.  Something urgent came up so... Please enjoy.

886
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,540
Dr. Ha, Dr Ha! Wow.

887
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,870
What's the matter with that punk?

888
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,410
- Wow! 
 - T-That...

889
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,090
I'm sorry for making you wait.  I had some business to do.

890
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:42,190
No, it's fine.

891
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:46,170
I've prepared for you to light the lights yourself. Please come this way.

892
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,360
It's an honor.

893
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,500
- Shall I? 
 - Please.

894
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:22,130
I also prepared a special gift with the heart of welcoming Logan Lee.

895
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,130
Well, let's count together!

896
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,000
Start! Ten! Nine!

897
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,200
Eight! Seven!

898
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,420
Six!

899
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,060
Five! Four!

900
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,040
Three! Two!

901
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,350
One! Zero!

902
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:53,150
What the?

903
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:58,580
 The culprit who killed Min Seol Ah is inside here. 

904
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:10,890


905
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:16,330
♫  Our pushing and pulling hearts only hurt each other  ♫

906
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,350
♫  Only hurt each other  ♫

907
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:20,760
♫  That is so bad  ♫

908
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:26,080
♫  It guides us on a path we can't go back to now  ♫

909
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,220
♫  It guides us  ♫

910
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,570
♫  Now good bye yeah  ♫

911
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,760
♫  Tell me Tell me your true heart  ♫

912
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,780
    
 ♫  Tell me your true heart  ♫

913
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,860
 The solid evidence that Sim Su Ryeon has threatened us meanwhile! Because she is Sim Su Ryeon's daughter. 

914
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,880
 We should get a divorce. 

915
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,820
 Let's sign the divorce paper. 

916
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,000
 Didn't you know your mom was hitting on my dad? 
   

917
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,410
 I'm going to quit this school. 

918
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:53,420
 The person who killed Min Seol Ah. Min Seol Ah's cellphone. 

919
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,360
 Let's get Seol Ah's revenge together. 

920
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,630
 What brought you here?
