1
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,153
Morning.

2
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:27,913
Good morning.

3
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,230
You lucky flies.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,260
What was that?

5
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,260
Just admiring the blooming cherry trees.

6
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,430
Guess it's spring, huh?

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,040
Couch potato.

8
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,390
Let's go flower viewing.

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,340
Really?

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,330

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,340

♪ Look up to see ♪

15
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,830
Kids are so full of energy.

16
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,690
Youth is a blessing.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,190
They're cute.

18
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah.

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,710
Want any?

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,180
Yeah.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,350
Then we'd better get on it.

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,150
Yeah.

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,660
Sure.

24
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,460
Let's go home.

25
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,250
- Come on.
- H-Huh?

26
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,510
- Hurry.
- Okay, here.

27
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:37,420

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,080

♪ I'm sure tomorrow... ♪

31
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:58,740
- In, go in!
- We're back!

32
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,540
Don't put that there!

33
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,620
Lock the door, okay?

34
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,083
- Hey! No wet clothes on the floor!
- It's fine.

35
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,113
- Our floors will soak!
- Later.

36
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:11,281
Augh, I feel gross.

37
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,790
I got it.

38
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,380
- Turn around, hands up.
- Woah!

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,500
Hold on.

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,823
- God, we're soaked...
- Turn around.

41
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:30,203
- I got it.
- It's fine.

42
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,510
Down that goes.

43
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,260
There.

44
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:50,350
Your underwear is ripped.

45
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,383
- No way, really?
- Kidding.

46
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,203
You first. We don't want any colds.

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,960
Bath's ready, Yō.

48
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,440
Yō.

49
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,077
No bath today?

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,710
I'll take one later.

51
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,430
You'll catch a cold.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,290
The rain drained me.

53
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,500
Are you up for it?

54
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,018
Tomorrow, okay?

55
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,730
No smoking indoors.

56
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,840
I couldn't fall back asleep. I thought a movie would help.

57
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,660
Enjoy.

58
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,290
Excuse me? Tomorrow?

59
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,622
"Tomorrow" hasn't come in ages.

60
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,842
Good morning.

61
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:08,840
Next on our agenda, is the Sumiyoshi Real Estate resort.

62
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,453
Our concept for the hotel will be "elegance and allure".

63
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,703
What even is "allure"?

64
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,640
Wasn't I pretty alluring yesterday, rain-soaked and all?

65
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,460
I guess not.

66
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,003
No, that's wonderful.

67
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:27,443
Really?

68
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,520
Pardon?

69
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,540
My apologies, it's nothing.

70
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,930
Then on that note, let us all work together

71
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,720
as members of our respective departments.

72
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,600
Have you heard?

73
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,920
Apparently Ms. Katayama's pregnant with her second.

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,140
What a trooper.

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,920
- She is?!
- So I'm told.

76
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,360
I should get her a gift.

77
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,620
Lucky you, Ms. Katayama.

78
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,050
You got to have sex again.

79
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,180
Okay, now I'm being absurd.

80
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,610
Are you with me?

81
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,120
Hana, where do you buy lingerie?

82
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,173
You're sending her underwear?

83
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,613
Of course not.

84
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,490
Mr. Niina! Did you need us?

85
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,050
No, just left my phone.

86
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,441
Oh, we'll get those, sir.

87
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,101
- It's alright, I'll take them on my way out.
- Thank you.

88
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,790
Thank you.

89
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,410
Take me too!

90
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,990
How long have you been married, Ms. Michi?

91
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,410
This year's our five year anniversary.

92
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,600
- Then here's my pick.
- What?!

93
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,330
You two need a little spice, no?

94
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,480
Pricey.

95
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,250
Choosing lingerie for the pleasure of men feels wrong.

96
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,210
What other purpose does it have?

97
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,430
Huh? Uh...

98
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,150
comfort?

99
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,880
You're losing the battle and the war.

100
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,871
I'm not even fighting here.

101
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:18,131
I think I'll get this one.

102
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,590
So flashy...

103
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,410
Woah, looks good.

104
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,753
Always so prepared.

105
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,213
They're just leftovers.

106
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,940
Is this all the AI gave us?

107
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,260
Yes, that's everything. Was something missing?

108
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,510
No, thank you.

109
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,630
Augh, seriously?

110
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,910
I'm home.

111
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,780
Welcome back.

112
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,350
Did you leave a sock lying around again? You're missing a pair.

113
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,720
Yeah, it's still good.

114
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,283
Don't wear a sock you've already-

115
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,303
Look, cake.

116
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,900
A peace offering, huh?

117
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,440
He doesn't get me at all.

118
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,510
I'll come home early next Wednesday.

119
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:22,040
And the store?

120
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,180
It'll manage.

121
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,010
You're not even the owner, Mr. Manager.

122
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
You get off early on Wednesdays, don't you?

123
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,570
Yeah.

124
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:41,628
Then let's grab a nice dinner...

125
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
and get down to it, okay?

126
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,530
Okay.

127
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,760
Yes?

128
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:21,582
W-What the-

129
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,158
I see you're wearing them.

130
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,910
Oh... right.

131
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,330
Ms. Michi.

132
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,290
No need for weird advice.

133
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,000
You look pretty.

134
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,310
Thank you.

135
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,593
(Incoming Mail : Makoto Niina)

136
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,073
- Wait, really?!
- What's the matter?

137
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,310
"Thank you all for your hard work these past couple days."

138
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,930
"Let's abide by company rules sometimes, shall we (lol)?"

139
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,623
"Wednesday is No Overtime Day."

140
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,903
"I ask everyone to uphold these rules today."

141
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,890
What a guy...

142
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,580
Then I'll be on my way.

143
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,880
He's the best!

144
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,040
He knows everyone can leave easy, once the boss does.

145
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,865
On that note, good bye!

146
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,785
Huh? O-Oh, bye.

147
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,150
No customers means I can close shop early.

148
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,530
Hey, I'm still here.

149
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,200
No need to pay, you're the owner.

150
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,570
Treat your wife to a nice dinner.

151
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,070
Or what, want to get drinks together?

152
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,460
Well...

153
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,720
Never mind, it's a pain to act as a brat's counselor.

154
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,630
Next time, yeah?

155
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,130
- Good work out here.
- Likewise.

156
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,650
(Today's no overtime day!)

157
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
Sorry!

158
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,560
Good evening.

159
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,130
Miss, is this yours?

160
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,010
Yes! Thank you so much!

161
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,323
I found it right there.

162
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:55,003
I'm glad someone came for it.

163
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,117
Huh?

164
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,385
What brings you here?

165
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,980
Just grabbing something I forgot.

166
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,223
And you, Mr. Niina?

167
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,653
I realized tomorrow's presentation was lacking data.

168
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,290
- Anyhow, have a good evening.
- Likewise.

169
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,740
(Work got busy, so I'll be a bit late)

170
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,440
Although I've already picked blueprints created by AI,

171
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,540
I figured non-digital plans would be a nice reference as well.

172
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,310
But blueprints for Milkyway Resort? That was from ages ago.

173
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,790
Our AI may even call it unnecessary.

174
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:54,000
If that were the case,
an AI would deem me just as useless.

175
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,596
No, it wouldn't.

176
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:59,767
How can you be so sure? I'm nothing special, really.

177
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,170
- Ms. Yoshino.
- Yes?

178
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,410
Who do you think is a genius, Einstein or Mozart?

179
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,160
Great way to avoid the topic.

180
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,430
No, this is a quiz.

181
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,950
Then both?

182
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,780
No, I take that back.

183
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,680
I'll pick Einstein.

184
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:33,633
Everything Einstein discovered could
eventually be realized by someone else,

185
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,971
or even a self-learning AI.

186
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,631
On the other hand, Mozart composed songs unique to himself.

187
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,730
So the answer's Mozart?

188
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,800
Exactly.

189
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:54,130
"Death is when people no longer hear Mozart."

190
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,233
Huh?

191
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,863
So, who am I quoting?

192
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,740
I wonder...

193
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,920
Einstein.

194
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,790
It seems he was a big fan of Mozart.

195
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,290
They're both worlds beyond us.

196
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,660
True. We don't stand a chance.

197
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:20,314
Still, us humans are able to create out of nothing,

198
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,984
something AI's cannot do.

199
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,830
Is that so...?

200
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:37,020
You've given me a pep talk.

201
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,320
Sorry, that was my attempt at being suave.

202
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,170
Ms. Yoshino, are you still good on time?

203
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,250
Yes, perfectly fine.

204
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,140
By the way, were you going to search for this blueprint alone?

205
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,940
Oh... Well, yes.

206
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,250
Perhaps it's over here...

207
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,360
So he pretended to leave first,
to let everyone else out early.

208
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,610
What a kind man.

209
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,403
Are you alright?

210
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,903
Yes, thank you.

211
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,280
- Sorry.
- Ah, likewise.

212
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,530
- May I?
- Go ahead.

213
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,550
Hello?

214
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,940
Yeah, I'm at the office.

215
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,700
Yeah.

216
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,820
Still looking for that blueprint.

217
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,780
Oh.

218
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,450
- Sorry.
- No worries.

219
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,920
I think I'll be late.

220
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,220
Yeah.

221
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,003
Wait, this is it!

222
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:46,503
Here it is!

223
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:50,060
Everything okay?

224
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,140
Makoto?

225
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,820
Sorry about that.

226
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I found it.

227
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,353
What a relief.

228
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,113
Sorry if I surprised you.

229
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,740
Yeah, you too, Kaede.

230
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,640
(I'm done here. What about you? Any ETA?)

231
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,930
(I won't be home until past midnight, so feel free to sleep.)

232
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:22,716
What this day meant to me
versus what it meant for Yō,

233
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,038
doesn't even compare.

234
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,610
Ow...

235
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,650
What happened to us?

236
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,680
Hey!

237
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,554
Be careful!

238
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,234
Says you!

239
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm reminded of a saying I once heard.

240
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,550
When sex with your husband feels nostalgic,

241
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,610
your relationship's gone sexless.

242
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,590
What?

243
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,370
Cherry blossoms...

244
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:31,830
I don't necessarily want children at this moment.

245
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,960
I don't want sex for the hell of it either.

246
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,500
I want to have sex with Yō.

247
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes?

248
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,760
Huh?

249
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,330
- Good work today.
- Thanks for the treat.

250
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,720
I see you took a detour?

251
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,490
Yes, the night breeze felt nice.

252
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,330
Now that hits the spot.

253
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,870
Nothing's better than beer after a hard day's work.

254
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh, thank you.

255
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,240
AI can't savor this.

256
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,230
True. It's a human privilege.

257
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,690
And yet, some robots can now taste, and even cook.

258
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,339
I guess so.

259
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:17,029
But if there's one thing robots can't cook, it's a mistake.

260
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,470
A mistake?

261
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,020
Only humans have the ability to burn eggs.

262
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,540
We're also lucky enough to eat the mistake,
and laugh it off.

263
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,660
Fair point.

264
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,200
Honestly, why am I picking fight with AI?

265
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,140
Did that happen earlier, when helping me?

266
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,240
No, I tripped on my way out.

267
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,713
Are you alright?

268
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:53,033
It's definitely ruined, that's for sure.

269
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,730
By the way, it's getting late. Is that alright?

270
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,430
Didn't your wife call earlier?

271
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,533
Oh, well...

272
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,853
My wife says she'll also be late.

273
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:12,480
As I recall, she's the vice-editor of a magazine, yes?

274
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,860
What a career woman.

275
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,610
What is your husband like, Ms. Yoshino?

276
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,300
He's the barista of a cafe.

277
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,880
That sounds wonderful.

278
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,210
No, not even close.

279
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:33,250
He only focuses on himself,

280
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,570
and has no interest otherwise.

281
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,860
That's just how men are.

282
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,070
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,070
Everyone in the office knows you're a devoted husband.

284
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,220
You make your wife boxed lunches, right?

285
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,300
Yes, well... I like to cook.

286
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,510
My husband works in food service willingly,

287
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,580
yet doesn't even touch a kitchen knife.

288
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,830
Oops... Sorry about that.

289
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,930
I didn't mean to complain.

290
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,380
We don't even compare to your ideal married life.

291
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,190
Ideal? We're far from it.

292
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,870
Now, now. No need to be tactful.

293
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:22,158
My married life has gotten to the point

294
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,888
where even the tiniest issues has me scrambling.

295
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,300
Happens all the time in married life.

296
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,200
It wouldn't happen to you, trust me.

297
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,140
- You don't know that.
- No, I do.

298
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,670
I'm positive.

299
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,130
We've got our issues too-

300
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,053
Please, you're only adding to my misery.

301
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:41,903
- I'm being honest-
- My marriage has turned sexless.

302
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,170
Sir, please tell me. How do I become more alluring?

303
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,330
Sorry, I'm too drunk for my own good.

304
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:10,610
- You got me.
- Didn't I?

305
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,450
Please forget all of that.

306
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,620
Look...

307
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,230
A-Are you hungry?

308
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,420
Huh? Well... Yes, I am.

309
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,190
Then let's go. I know a great ramen place.

310
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,510
I'm home.

311
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,220
You're back late.

312
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,480
Yeah. Had overtime.

313
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,000
Welcome home.

314
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:03,820
Listen...

315
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,490
today...

316
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,630
Sorry.

317
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,050
It's fine.

318
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,973
I shared my secret with someone today,

319
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,793
and felt the burden in my heart alleviate.

320
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,410
Ms. Yoshino.

321
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,163
I appreciated the company yesterday.

322
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,913
Please, let me apologize.

323
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,210
Sorry I told you my strange woes.

324
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,060
I'll always lend an ear.

325
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:14,690
Truth be told... I'd given up on my husband a bit.

326
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,310
But I think I'll have a talk with him.

327
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,890
Next time, it'll be my woes then.

328
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,880
Like I said, no need to be tact.

329
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,630
Am I perhaps a bother?

330
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,830
Of course not.

331
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,030
Thank goodness.

332
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,895
Just know I'm your ally.

333
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:43,095
Huh? My ally?

334
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:49,020
How can I drink coffee daily,
when it always tastes the same?

335
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,370
'Cause you like it.

336
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,940
Once you like your own method,

337
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,910
you'll need the same flavor and scent.

338
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,020
No other coffee will make do.

339
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,622
True.

340
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:05,132
Sure, you're a great barista.

341
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,230
But you need customers.

342
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,417
Damn, when will the construction end?
(Now hiring part-timers)

343
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,580
You can toss that.

344
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,470
Mister.

345
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,030
Here.

346
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,970
Do you drink coffee?

347
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes, I'm a fan.

348
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,310
Here, it's an extra cup.

349
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,810
If you're offering then.

350
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,860
Thank you.

351
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,080
Where's my jump?

352
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,620
Don't you get bored playing one game?

353
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,330
No, updates keep it fresh.

354
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,780
This is the newest patch.

355
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,363
You go the opposite route,
and everything works itself out.

356
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:49,020
Maybe I'll give it a go.

357
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,510
Found a shortcut.

358
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,350
Over here, huh?

359
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,040
Makes sense.

360
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,900
Yō.

361
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,700
You know, next Wednesday...

362
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah?

363
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,780
I get off early.

364
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,610
Can you come home early too?

365
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,860
We don't need a promise to make it happen.

366
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,850
You're the one who promised first.

367
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,696
What am I doing wrong?

368
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,170
It's like I'm trapped in a never-ending labyrinth.

369
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,110
Ms. Yoshino.

370
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:31,350
Is everything alright?

371
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,873
Yes, fine. I'll be done in a moment.

372
00:31:33,873 --> 00:31:35,223
No, rather...

373
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,970
how are things at home?

374
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,140
Oh...

375
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,550
It's going terribly.

376
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,550
I see...

377
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,030
Well, I'll just need to keep at it.

378
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,415
Remember, today is "No Overtime Day".

379
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,495
Yes, sir.

380
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,810
I think the night breeze will feel especially nice today.

381
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,020
Right...

382
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,780
Good day then.

383
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,400
- They're so pretty!
- And in full bloom.

384
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,250
- Let's take a selfie!
- Sure.

385
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,520
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

386
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,700
- What?
- This is the pricey stuff.

387
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,530
There's more in the fridge.

388
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,820
Seriously?

389
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,940
Go for it.

390
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,710
This is bliss...

391
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,960
Jeez...

392
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,130
Vulgar.

393
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,720
Want seconds?

394
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,250
I'll make the snacks.

395
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:09,124
We're quick to forget
how lucky we are to be happy at all.

396
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,000
(Mother-in-law)

397
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,430
Hello! Yes, it's been a while.

398
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,410
How are you?

399
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,750
Yes, we've never been better.

400
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm glad my gift arrived before your birthday.

401
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,690
Did you like the pajamas?

402
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,050
Huh?

403
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,850
What? You want to nap alongside your grandchildren?

404
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,460
Tell that to your son's useless Yō Jr.

405
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:08,700
No, we're not leaving it up to luck.
(Wife Exclusive ED (erectile dysfunction): Excuse or Illness?)

406
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,950
You should've taken the call.

407
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,030
No need, I know she's fine.

408
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,280
I guess so. She always lays on the questions thick.

409
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,770
Feel free to ignore my mom.

410
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,160
Huh?

411
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,540
Does that mean we won't try anymore?

412
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,150
No, that's not it.

413
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,050
It broke...

414
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,180
If anything, I'm surprised it lasted.

415
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,170
I mean, five years of use? It's in tatters.

416
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:54,020
- Michi.
- Hm?

417
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,960
Here, I put your keys on this keychain.

418
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,660
It's a present.

419
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,400
Maybe Yō changed along the way, and I just never realized.

420
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,860
Ouch...

421
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,402
What now?

422
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,320
Don't force yourself, really.

423
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,450
Hey-

424
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,350
H-Hold on.

425
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,920
- Yō...
- Yeah?

426
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,130
Sorry... It's my period.

427
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,850
I see.

428
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,710
Nothing we can do about that.

429
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,440
Then how about a beer? Or better yet, I'll make coffee.

430
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,596
No wait, caffeine will keep me up.

431
00:39:55,596 --> 00:40:02,906
Yō... You can't fool me.
I saw the momentary relief in your eyes.

432
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,110
Excuse me.

433
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,120
Hello.

434
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,670
Now this is an oldie.

435
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,270
Sorry, we don't sell them anymore.

436
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,610
Is that so?

437
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:48,160
Chief Hagiwara, could you draft up a contract

438
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,880
for the aforementioned hot spring facility?

439
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,083
I would need it in three days time, before I meet our clientele.

440
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,423
Alright, I'll get that to you.

441
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,160
Here, for you.

442
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,513
- Huh?
- Open it.

443
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:11,003
Now?

444
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,670
What could it be?

445
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,523
- You'd never guess.
- Yeah?

446
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:18,293
I happened to find a similar keychain.

447
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,680
Really? I already bought one online.

448
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,320
Next time, text me before you buy something.

449
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,750
Oh...

450
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,552
Alright.

451
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,770
Sorry.

452
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,910
It's not just him.

453
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:44,990
I've changed too.

454
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,870
Thank you.

455
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,530
I use to earnestly thank him for any gift,

456
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,803
even if it was totally not my style.

457
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,673
Yō-

458
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,020
Oh no!

459
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:04,970
I have to change first,

460
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,650
or else nothing else will.

461
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:12,130
You know, we've both been prickly lately.

462
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,410
I know part of it's on me, so... I'm sorry.

463
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,920
Yō, I want honesty.

464
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,750
Can we talk it out?

465
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,610
Sorry, I know it's early. But-

466
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,710
Can we do this tonight? I'm late.

467
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,820
Yō.

468
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,300
This won't take long.

469
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,393
Yō, please!

470
00:42:33,393 --> 00:42:35,123
Then I'll be honest.

471
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,010
When you're so straightforward about doing it,
I lose my drive.

472
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:45,480
B-But-

473
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,960
Didn't you say you wanted kids?!

474
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,650
There's that face again.

475
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:55,690
Wait. Wait!

476
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,153
You're only adding unnecessary pressure on me.

477
00:42:58,153 --> 00:42:59,993
Pressure...?

478
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,993
Have I ever complained about this? Ever?

479
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:06,493
We're on a short break, that's all.

480
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:13,200
Do you remember the last time we had sex?

481
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,400
- Look-
- Two years ago.

482
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,370
We haven't had sex for two years!

483
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,530
Were you that desperate for sex?

484
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,600
Michi...

485
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,270
Your sex drive's a bit much.

486
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,980
Oh, thank you.

487
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,120
Ms. Yashiro, how does your day look?

488
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,560
Pardon?

489
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,180
I shall be free.

490
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,950
Sorry sir. Today's not a good day.

491
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,970
I see.

492
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:44,900
I threw a pillow at my husband this morning.

493
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,240
Come again?

494
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,970
I'm all booked tonight to fight my husband.

495
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,340
Although, since he's great at avoiding me,
this could end miserably.

496
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,250
Please don't push yourself.

497
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,170
Honestly, I think a bit of pushing is necessary.

498
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,880
Go for broke, you know?

499
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:25,100
Woah, it's fixed.

500
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,730
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

501
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,440
Take care.

502
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,060
Going through?

503
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,130
Oh, no.

504
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,810
Sorry.

505
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,630
Have a seat.

506
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,060
Okay.

507
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:27,740
Since you're here, have some coffee.

508
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,830
Thanks.

509
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,240
- Welcome back.
- I'm home.

510
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,120
- Thanks.
- Of course.

511
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:43,280
- Want to eat now?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

512
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,450
- Need help?
- No, relax.

513
00:46:51,347 --> 00:46:52,670
Shimizu...

514
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,570
Yes? Yup.

515
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,230
Can you screen share?

516
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,260
Never mind, I'll just head back.

517
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,723
Did I get the documents?

518
00:47:04,723 --> 00:47:06,653
Could you send me those?

519
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,820
I'll be back in thirty.

520
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,433
Yeah. What are the specifics?

521
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:15,103
I see.

522
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,810
Are all our photos the same dimensions?

523
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:24,690
Okay, our main image should be larger, so it pops.

524
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,583
Everything else that doesn't fit can be cut.

525
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,853
Yup.

526
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,850
Yeah, I agree.

527
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,650
Yup...

528
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,360
Sorry for lashing out this morning.

529
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,900
Same here. Sorry.

530
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,880
So you saw through me?

531
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,480
Yeah, I thought you'd be late tonight.

532
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,740
Besides, sitting around at home wouldn't help.

533
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,120
Thanks.

534
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,800
I hear the occasional fight is actually healthy.

535
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,860
Healthy, how?

536
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,570
See, I want us to be the way we always have.

537
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,220
Yeah?

538
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,990
How to put this...

539
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,550
We're not newlyweds, you know?

540
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,980
Marriage has lots of components to it.

541
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,333
Components?

542
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,693
We both work, make a living,

543
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,120
and get along. Life's fun, right?

544
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,610
In short, I think we're a sound, married couple.

545
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,060
Yō.

546
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,440
- Yō, listen.
- Yeah?

547
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,240
I don't want to have sex, solely for the fun of it.

548
00:49:11,037 --> 00:49:14,420
I want to feel loved by you.

549
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,270
Wouldn't you say that's important in marriage?

550
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,164
I married you because I love you-

551
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:27,484
Then shouldn't you desire me?

552
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:37,020
How does this not bother you?

553
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,860
I mean...

554
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,890
Alright.

555
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,420
I'll put in the effort.

556
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,020
Effort?

557
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,330
See...

558
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,720
I might have ED.

559
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,420
Huh?

560
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,490
Is that so?

561
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,480
Sorry I never noticed.

562
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,770
Yō plays dirty.

563
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,140
He used a terrible lie to avoid me, again.

564
00:51:04,037 --> 00:51:06,170
I'm off to grab a spot.

565
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,510
For our flower viewing?

566
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,130
Already?

567
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,080
- I'll get us prime spots.
- It won't be that crowded.

568
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,280
Oh, Mr. Niina. We're ready.

569
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,113
Thank you two.

570
00:51:16,113 --> 00:51:18,473
Still, I feel alleviated.

571
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,630
To be fulfilled both body and soul is a luxury I can't afford.

572
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:29,100
Mr. Niina, your drink!

573
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,350
Thank you.

574
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,340
Serve's up!

575
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,600
You too, Tanaka.

576
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,990
Thank you, sir.

577
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,495
Thank you!

578
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,140
Thank you, but I've drunk enough.

579
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,323
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- I insist.

580
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:45,893
- Enjoy, you two.
- No, wait!

581
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,320
- Good evening.
- Good evening!

582
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,097
Are you alright?

583
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,650
Yes. I feel much better now.

584
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:05,010
Is that so?

585
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,350
Oh, I have my own drinks covered.

586
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,150
Do you have a moment?

587
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,950
- I'll get us more drinks.
- Sir, I'll go.

588
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,720
- No, no, enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

589
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,270
- Ms. Yashiro, shall we?
- A-Alright.

590
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:25,045
- My wallet...
- Don't worry about it.

591
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,175
Thank you.

592
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,110
Do you truly feel much better?

593
00:52:36,056 --> 00:52:37,389
Huh?

594
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:39,679
Is that how you honestly feel?

595
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,290
Of course.

596
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:52,110
In fact, it feels like I've finally solved a hard riddle.

597
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:57,144
There's no point in creating discord once you're married.

598
00:52:57,144 --> 00:52:59,424
Honesty and dialogue is for fools.

599
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:04,945
Why ask?

600
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:07,085
Because you weren't convincing me.

601
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:13,470
Please, stop that.

602
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,570
Is my misery that amusing to you?

603
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:21,790
Honestly, what a relief.

604
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,450
I can finally stop worrying about the little things.

605
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,013
Ms. Yoshino.

606
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:28,583
Sorry about that.

607
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,690
I must be quite drunk.

608
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,140
You didn't drink tonight, did you?

609
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,340
I won't ever be satisfied, ever again.

610
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,840
This is how I meet my end...

611
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:59,260
as a woman.

612
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,690
Wait!

613
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,070
Please, wait!

614
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,690
Ms. Yoshino, you're not alone.

615
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,323
My marriage is the same.

616
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:08,123
We've become sexless as well.

617
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,039
I know the loneliness of being rejected,

618
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,999
of being neglected, even.

619
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,290
Really, I do.

620
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,100
I...

621
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,350
I thought I wouldn't feel the pain,

622
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,010
so long as I ignored how I felt towards Yō.

623
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:51,630
Our coworkers already volunteered, so why are we here?

624
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:56,160
Because I know Mr. Niina will buy lots. We have to help.

625
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,633
Hana, are you looking for something?

626
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,273
Huh? No, just admiring the flowers.

627
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,680
Welcome.

628
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,710
I'm home.

629
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,920
(Welcome back. I prepared some steamed dumplings.
Eat them on a plate, okay?)

630
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,480
Sorry.

631
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,000
I'll be fine.

632
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:43,210
(You're The Only One For Me)

633
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,313
(Even If You Don't Do It)

634
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:47,800
Those tears of hers

635
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,080
seemed like tears that had been building up
inside me for a long time.

636
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,623
Mr. Niina just avoided me.

637
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:55,533
He avoided me, right?
