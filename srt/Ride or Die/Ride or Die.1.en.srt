1
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,148
Good evening.

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,108
Good evening.

3
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,986
I'll take your coat.

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,404
Thank you.

5
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,355
Good evening. What would you like to have?

6
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,901
I'll have tequila. A Don Julio Añejo.

7
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,903
Double. Two shots of it.

8
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,197
Two shots? Sure thing.

9
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,233
Thank you for waiting.

10
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,651
Send one over there.

11
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,446
Of course.

12
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,535
Mr. Shinoda.

13
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,498
It's from that lady over there.

14
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,441
-One more.
-Certainly.

15
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,075
Do you always invite guys like this?

16
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,958
This method is easier.

17
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,382
And you looked lonely.

18
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,510
I did?

19
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,472
More than anyone else here.

20
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,144
Interesting.

21
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,862
You don't like that?

22
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,459
I don't dislike

23
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,627
girls like you.

24
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,125
Anywhere you want to go?

25
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,128
Let's see…

26
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,464
Your house.

27
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,467
The Hyatt.

28
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,762
Maybe I should go home.

29
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,182
Why my house?

30
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,103
It gets me excited

31
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,856
when I have sex in a house
tidied up by someone's wife.

32
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,611
I guess I have no choice.

33
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
How much do you earn per month?

34
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,018
I don't do this for money.

35
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,511
What do you want me to do?

36
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,864
Give me your wife.

37
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,080
Your wife is the one in that photo, right?

38
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,209
She's really cute.

39
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,549
You're a pervert.

40
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,301
I like that.

41
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,332
What the fuck did you just do?

42
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,271
THE DAY BEFORE

43
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,481
TOKYO COSMETIC SURGERY

44
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,864
Are you feeling okay?

45
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm fine.

46
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,743
I'm going to cut the other side, then.

47
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,703
It won't hurt, so relax.

48
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,466
It might hurt for about three days,

49
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,510
but try not to touch it.

50
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,221
Keep the incision area clean,

51
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,640
eat well, and rest well.

52
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,854
Do I look cuter?

53
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,317
You're one step closer
to your ideal double eyelids.

54
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,571
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Take care.

55
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,659
Are you done praying?

56
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,953
-Let's go now.
-All right.

57
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,040
-Okay.
-Let's switch. It's Grandpa's turn.

58
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,584
-Here, Dad.
-Be careful of the steps.

59
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,548
-Over here.
-Here you go, Kazuto and Sora.

60
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,218
Hold this. It's hot, so be careful.

61
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,977
-Thanks.
-Come over here.

62
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,189
Stick it in here.

63
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,653
Thanks. One moment.

64
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,450
-Put your hands together.
-Here we go.

65
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,079
Is it a boy again?

66
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,167
Yes. It's already noisy enough,
but now we'll have six people!

67
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,168
Shut up.

68
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,923
Rei. You should get married soon
and show Grandpa his grandchild!

69
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,051
Is there anyone you like?

70
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,011
Well, I guess.

71
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,682
-Are you Ms. Nagasawa?
-Yes.

72
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,142
HAPPY 34TH BIRTHDAY, MIKA

73
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,393
Is this to your liking?

74
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:51,979
Yes.

75
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,399
Oh, I'd like to have this too.

76
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,942
-I'll put it in.
-Thanks.

77
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,635
I'm home!

78
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,147
Drinking again.

79
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,987
It's dangerous, though.

80
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,674
Welcome home!

81
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,302
Jeez, you're drinking in the bath again.

82
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,847
It'll be dangerous
if your blood pressure drops.

83
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,641
With all due respect, my dear doctor,

84
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,062
coming home to this
is what motivates me at work.

85
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,648
Then…

86
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,318
as an exception,

87
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,446
-I'll pour a glass for you.
-All right!

88
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,700
Oh, no. Sorry.

89
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,954
It will be perfect once the princess
enters the bath with me.

90
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,706
What?

91
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,752
Happy birthday.

92
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,630
One more time.

93
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,099
Hey, you drunkard! That was dangerous!

94
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,934
Don't do that.

95
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,114
I'll go answer that.

96
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,493
My blouse is wet now.

97
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,704
This sucks.

98
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,668
Here we go.

99
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,049
Hello?

100
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,426
This is Shinoda.

101
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,638
What? Hello?

102
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,641
This is Tsujimura.

103
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,684
Tsujimura?

104
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,646
Tsujimura…

105
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,566
It's been a while.

106
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,571
It's been some time.

107
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,532
How have you been?

108
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,037
I'm good.

109
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,123
You know…

110
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,293
You can say no if you want, but…

111
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,588
can we meet now?

112
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,218
Come back soon.

113
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,097
Sorry. I guess not.

114
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,851
I'll come.

115
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,465
-Long time no see.
-It's been a while.

116
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,514
What's with this room? It looks amazing.

117
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,351
Well…

118
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,108
You haven't changed at all.

119
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,485
-Really?
-Yes.

120
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,407
I mean…

121
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,493
It's been ten years since we last met.

122
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,454
Oh, right.

123
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,842
How's your husband? Is he doing well?

124
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,136
Yes.

125
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,720
He's doing great.

126
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,902
This is the three million yen I borrowed.

127
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,447
Took less than five years.

128
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,620
10 YEARS AGO

129
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,710
What did your husband say about this?

130
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,547
He said, "I'm sorry for
all the trouble my wife caused."

131
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,965
He sends his best regards.

132
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,635
He's a decent guy.

133
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,072
I'm glad. Be happy.

134
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,206
Let's pay separately.

135
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,642
If you get into any trouble in the future

136
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,021
and your husband can't help you with it,

137
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,522
let me know anytime.

138
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,653
We won't meet again.

139
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,392
I love you.

140
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,480
You're lying.

141
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,934
What about you?

142
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,981
Do you still love me?

143
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,696
You think I could live a happy life…

144
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
with that meager amount of money?

145
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,207
Your husband did this?

146
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,884
Sorry. Are you all right?

147
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,846
I love you.

148
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,267
What's the matter? It'll be fine.

149
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,269
Look at me. Over here.

150
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,366
-That hurts!
-I'm sorry!

151
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,047
Sorry. Just go home.

152
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,133
What?

153
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,135
No way!

154
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm not going home!

155
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,559
I can't do this anymore…

156
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,104
Why did this happen?

157
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,371
Where did you go?

158
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,249
-I've been waiting for you.
-Sorry.

159
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,835
-Who were you with? Tell me!
-Sorry.

160
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,796
Who did you go out with? Spill it!

161
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,341
Who was it? Tell me!

162
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,885
Tell me! Who were you with?

163
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,145
Either my husband dies, or I die.

164
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,486
If you're going to die,
your husband deserves to die!

165
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,164
If that's the case…

166
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,920
will you kill him for me?

167
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,319
Hello?

168
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,906
It's over.

169
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,451
It's all over.

170
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,749
I left fingerprints
and was caught on camera, too.

171
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,960
What are you talking about?

172
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,967
By the time you're home,
the police will be looking for me.

173
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,720
Wait a minute.

174
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,811
The police won't investigate further
so long as they know who the murderer is.

175
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,815
They won't know you instigated the murder.

176
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,114
Where are you?

177
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,452
Hey!

178
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,741
Get in.

179
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,411
Hurry up.

180
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,544
Where are we going?

181
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,756
Anywhere.

182
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,145
No one is going to hit you
or kick you anymore!

183
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,516
Hey!

184
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,205
Sorry, can I use the toilet?

185
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,545
Sorry. I didn't want you to see this.

186
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,389
So he's dead?

187
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,483
He's dead, and I killed him.

188
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,783
And I lost my virginity at 29 years old.

189
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,857
Hey.

190
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,359
Can I join you?

191
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,498
What's wrong?

192
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,964
I was almost killed.

193
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,935
If you two stabbed each other,

194
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,271
it would have all ended right there.

195
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,216
You're right.

196
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,887
I'm sorry.

197
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,643
Get mad at me.

198
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,743
What will they call me?

199
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,790
A home-wrecker
who was jealous of his wife…

200
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,714
…or the lesbian fool
who was jealous of her crush's husband?

201
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,659
You smile when you lie.

202
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,127
And you look really cute when you do it.

203
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,601
My entire life crumbles…

204
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,398
with just a single smile of yours!

205
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,049
-Good work.
-Good work.

206
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,764
Over there.

207
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,016
After questioning the neighbor,

208
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,143
we were informed that
at 10:40 p.m. yesterday,

209
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,687
they heard sounds of objects crashing

210
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,565
and someone falling down,
so they alerted the security guard.

211
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,483
I see.

212
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,400
Okay.

213
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,861
-May I have a moment, Chief?
-Go ahead.

214
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,574
He slumped down here and died.

215
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,285
Nasty business.

216
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,578
It really is.

217
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,475
At first, I thought it would be easier
to use gasoline.

218
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,101
Burn the place down.

219
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,812
Why didn't you do that?

220
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,192
I thought you'd get lonely without a home.

221
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,654
I never had a home in the first place.

222
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,368
I'd get beat up for just existing

223
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,411
by my dad and my husband.

224
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,366
His alcoholism triggered a stroke.

225
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,368
He's been in a vegetative state for years.

226
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,790
I wanted to let the bastard die,

227
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,126
but he was kept alive
for my husband's good image.

228
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,301
But that ends today.

229
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,473
I'm hungry.

230
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,183
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

231
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,945
Goodbye, Dad.

232
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,840
I don't have much money on me.

233
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,429
Welcome. Please place your order
through the microphone.

234
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,599
I was going to turn myself in afterward.

235
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,519
Let's see. A teriyaki burger and cola.

236
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,313
I don't have much with me, either.

237
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,647
Okay, teriyaki and a cola.

238
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,982
A cheeseburger, please.

239
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,442
Of course.

240
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,360
I was supposed to come home from a trip

241
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,946
to discover that a burglar
killed my husband.

242
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,658
Thank you for your order.

243
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,577
If that will be all,

244
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,579
-please drive around.
-Got it.

245
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,376
Welcome.

246
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,546
I'll be receiving your payment first.
It's 1,080 yen in total.

247
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,965
Thanks.

248
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,968
-Here you go.
-2,000 yen.

249
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,720
Oh, excuse me.

250
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,263
-Yes?
-Can I have fries, too?

251
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,848
Yes, certainly.

252
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,327
I don't want it to stand out.

253
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,830
Should we just drown ourselves somewhere?

254
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,000
-No, I don't like that!
-Why?

255
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,710
Your corpse will swell up,

256
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,796
you'll get sticky,
and insects will eat you.

257
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,006
-Really?
-There's no way I'm doing that.

258
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,308
-Blow ourselves up using kerosene?
-Kerosene doesn't explode.

259
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,851
-Really?
-Yes!

260
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,144
Really?

261
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,564
-Actually…
-Yes?

262
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,109
I killed someone to save you,
so why are you trying to die now?

263
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,444
I mean…

264
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,282
is there any future for me if I'm alive?

265
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,374
What are you doing?

266
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:11,964
Pick one.

267
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:14,967
I'll go with B.

268
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,260
-B?
-Yes.

269
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,894
-You landed here.
-Okay.

270
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,355
Ta-da!

271
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,273
DEAD END

272
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,778
What's with that?

273
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,991
-Hey.
-What?

274
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,367
What should we do next?

275
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:43,912
-Hey.
-Yes?

276
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,748
I want to go to your parents' home.

277
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,249
Why?

278
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,586
I met your husband and saw where you live.

279
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,296
I met your father too.

280
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,382
I want to know more about you.

281
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,513
I'm coming in.

282
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,001
Satisfied now?

283
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,181
I lived here until I was 18.

284
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,770
My mom left after she got another man,
and I haven't seen her since then.

285
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,399
After my mom left,

286
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,860
my dad beat me,
as if I were her replacement.

287
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,325
It's as you said.
I had to sell my body to live.

288
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,665
That's why I chose the person
willing to buy me at the highest price

289
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,209
when I was worth the most.

290
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,594
I realized how much my life was worth.

291
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,850
I've used up my 29 years' worth
of luck, self-esteem, and rights.

292
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,853
And now I only have you.

293
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,774
What a cruel world.

294
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,276
You're right.

295
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,614
Why aren't you mad?

296
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,994
It makes me want to
give you a pat on the back.

297
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,498
It's so tiring to be with you.

298
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,424
I'm going for a smoke.

299
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,698
FIRST PLACE 100M HURDLES
NANAE TSUJIMURA

300
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,757
Set!

301
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,192
That's 14.5 seconds!

302
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,736
-All right!
-You broke your record, Tsujimura!

303
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,822
-Yes!
-All right!

304
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,907
-Is this the first time you broke 14?
-Yes!

305
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,952
You're doing so well today.
I couldn't catch up to you!

306
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,163
-Think I can do it?
-Of course!

307
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,749
-You can do it!
-Thanks!

308
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,002
That's amazing!

309
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,395
She was watching today, too.

310
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:22,482
I heard she's actually a lesbian,
so be careful.

311
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,736
But she seems nice.
Being gay isn't harmful or anything.

312
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,364
Wow, she just called her harmful.

313
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,577
-Let's go eat some ice cream.
-Let's go.

314
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,476
What's wrong?

315
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,821
These chocolates are so expensive!

316
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,575
Can you afford this with your
high-schooler's allowance?

317
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,206
I want tea.

318
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,334
Okay, then.

319
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,211
All right.

320
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,886
I bet your allowance

321
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,390
is more than my salary.

322
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,535
-Here.
-Thanks.

323
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,087
I wish I was your true love.

324
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,256
What?

325
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,443
Hey.

326
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,654
Let's kiss.

327
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,157
No, it's my first kiss.

328
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,493
Hey!

329
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,328
Geez.

330
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,999
Come here.

331
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,001
Where are you going?

332
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,377
The restroom.

333
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,232
I told you, forget about
that straight girl.

334
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,112
Sooner or later

335
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,157
she'll be sucking some guy's… you know.

336
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,790
That's true.

337
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,594
-What time do we start tomorrow?
-I think it's 8:00 a.m.

338
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,929
All right.

339
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,599
Hey.

340
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,398
-I'll go ahead.
-Got it.

341
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,986
You're still here?

342
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,156
I had supplementary lessons today.

343
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,699
Shall we walk home together?

344
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,409
Yes.

345
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,046
You're always working hard at practice.

346
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,924
I'm aiming for the top three
in the Inter-High.

347
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,802
That's incredible!
Didn't you only start at high school?

348
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,388
Right. There's a lot of pressure!

349
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,557
I'm sure you can do it.

350
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,017
Thanks.

351
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,447
-I'll go look at some track spikes.
-Oh, bye then.

352
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,631
Wait a minute!

353
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,424
Hold on!

354
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,512
Wait!

355
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,389
Hey, wait!

356
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,849
Stop!

357
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,853
I'm telling you to stop!

358
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,439
Come back!

359
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,899
-Stop!
-Stop running!

360
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,776
-Hey!
-Wait!

361
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,321
-Hey…
-Wait, damn it!

362
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,989
Stop!

363
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,242
Stop running!

364
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,621
-That hurt.
-Move aside.

365
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,831
-I'm going to check your bag.
-Wait a minute!

366
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,583
She took a pair of shoes, right?

367
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,710
-We got you!
-I'll buy it!

368
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,546
No, we'll hand her over to the police.

369
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,798
This covers it, right?

370
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,258
What?

371
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,468
-Let's go.
-Wait…

372
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,640
Money is not the issue here.

373
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,685
Hey!

374
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,603
I heard you're quitting school.

375
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,650
I only got into such a good place
through my sports scholarship.

376
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,904
Can't you come back
after your leg recovers?

377
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,825
I can't buy spikes because I'm poor,

378
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,703
and I can't get proper rehab
for my injured leg.

379
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,121
Thus, this is the result.

380
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,253
This is embarrassing.

381
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,589
A rich girl like you
had to see me like that.

382
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,640
And I was so sure of my running
and shoplifting abilities.

383
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,398
What are you going to do from now on?

384
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,611
No idea. Probably live
somewhere that you'll never go.

385
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,990
That's enough talk.

386
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,925
If that's the case,

387
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,011
I'll pay for the rest
of your time in high school!

388
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,808
How much were our school fees again?

389
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,102
Two million yen? Or three million yen?

390
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,022
If you're just going to sell
your body to men,

391
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,024
what's the difference in me buying you?

392
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,240
Let's change these lame glasses, too.

393
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,411
Who do you think you are?

394
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,789
I'm a rich girl.

395
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,668
What do you want?

396
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,213
Five years.

397
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,883
I'll wait five years.

398
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,053
If you can't pay me back by then,

399
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,597
let me have sex with you.

400
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,367
You'd hate that, right?

401
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,077
Sounds harmful, doesn't it?

402
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,791
If you don't want a girl's fingers
inside you,

403
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,503
go work in a proper company
and get married to some rich guy.

404
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,036
Damn!

405
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,539
"Caught speeding.
Pay three thousand dollars."

406
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,876
My first fine ever in life.

407
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,425
I called the police.

408
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,721
I want to start over from scratch.

409
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,849
You said you'll take the blame, right?

410
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,187
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

411
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,272
Save me.

412
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,059
You could've at least
let me fuck you first!

413
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,274
There's no time to do it now!

414
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,172
Thanks for waiting. Kamegame Sushi.

415
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,801
That will be 6,000 yen, please.

416
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,227
Well,

417
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,649
I wondered what you'd say
if I told you I called the police.

418
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:56,903
I was worried.

419
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,947
Since you don't get mad
no matter what I say.

420
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,225
I'm sorry.

421
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,189
It must have hurt.

422
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,995
I was going to tell the police
I forced you to come with me.

423
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,331
That's what I would tell them.

424
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,377
They shouldn't see us happily drinking,

425
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,046
so I wanted you to be afraid of me.

426
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,967
Even so…

427
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,846
After I hit you,

428
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,806
I saw how scared you really were.

429
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,274
That was the worst thing I could've done.

430
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,700
I'm sorry.

431
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,215
This is the end.

432
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,769
We can't run anymore.

433
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,287
Why are we having sushi anyway?

434
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,957
It's our last meal.

435
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,003
I can't eat raw fish.

436
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,673
-Really?
-Actually…

437
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,135
it's pretty cliché to have
sushi as a last meal.

438
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,431
Well, I'm sorry.

439
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,309
It's a cliché luxury that
poor people like me want.

440
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,445
I'm sorry.

441
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,411
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

442
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,284
We still haven't had our last meal!

443
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,369
You two! Stop!

444
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,495
Stop!

445
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,090
Hold up!

446
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,140
-What?
-Get on!

447
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,892
Hey!

448
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,853
-I'm sorry!
-Wait a minute!

449
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,855
Stop right there!

450
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,904
This is PC107.

451
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,699
I'm in pursuit of two
suspicious individuals!

452
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,117
This is PC107.

453
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,554
Mom?

454
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,598
What's going on?

455
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,309
You're sleeping in this late?

456
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,978
Playing hooky?

457
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,604
Why are you here?

458
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,649
I had something to do in the neighborhood.

459
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,110
I texted you, didn't I?

460
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,367
Also,

461
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,328
your dad went for an arrhythmia checkup.

462
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,999
It cost around 80,000 yen,

463
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:47,086
but turns out he's fit as a fiddle.

464
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,131
Oh well, as long as he's healthy.

465
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,092
But we don't know if the doctor's a quack.

466
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,101
How's your girlfriend?

467
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,812
She's not home today?

468
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,734
Sorry.

469
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,485
Oh, well…

470
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,530
She…

471
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,575
I think she left.

472
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,620
You're not sure?

473
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,042
You know,

474
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,837
that's what I don't like about her.

475
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:36,135
She didn't introduce you
to her parents, either.

476
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,307
She said her parents would be hurt

477
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,225
if they knew their daughter was gay.

478
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,519
So…

479
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,231
she said filial piety dictates
she shouldn't tell them.

480
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:57,656
What? She's taking you for a fool.
She's just afraid to tell them.

481
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,335
You know,

482
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,213
when you brought her to me and your dad,

483
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,092
you mustered all your courage

484
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,551
and introduced her to us.

485
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,848
I was happy.

486
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,729
But that girl acted as if
none of this was any of her concern.

487
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,126
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

488
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,505
Mom.

489
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,050
I'm sorry.

490
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,762
What for?

491
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,644
I'm 34 years old,

492
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,897
and I'm still like this.

493
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,363
I couldn't give you a grandchild.

494
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,119
What are you saying?

495
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,538
You're still the same, even at this age.

496
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,457
Such a crybaby

497
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,209
and always acting so spoiled.

498
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,393
Anyway, you look older now.

499
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,481
I can see those laugh lines on your face.

500
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,011
-Hey!
-What's wrong?

501
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,555
-Oh, no!
-Wait…

502
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,098
What?

503
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,558
One minute.

504
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,114
No good.

505
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,326
-We're out of gas.
-No way.

506
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:51,747
CAFETERIA HIROSATO

507
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:53,582
After you.

508
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:56,877
Welcome.

509
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,045
Table for two, please.

510
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,339
-This way.
-Okay.

511
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,608
Beer has never tasted so good!

512
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,969
-That's good!
-I know, right?

513
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,106
It is good, isn't it?

514
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,367
I think it's the first time
I've seen you make that face.

515
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,054
I'm heading to the washroom.

516
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,188
BUSINESSMAN SLAUGHTERED

517
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,732
SOCIALITE COUPLE'S DARKNESS
PROSTITUTE'S TWISTED LOVE

518
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,502
You guys look like you're having fun.

519
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,838
Sorry we were so noisy.

520
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:09,718
Did you lose your shoes?

521
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:11,887
Yes.

522
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,348
Are you all right?

523
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,892
Please don't mind me.

524
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,199
How can we repay you?

525
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:36,036
I can't just leave you two alone.
You stick out like a sore thumb.

526
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,458
Where did you girls come from? Tokyo?

527
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,128
You don't look like locals.

528
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,380
Or vacationers, for that matter.

529
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:47,965
Are you two here for work?

530
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,427
We're on the run after killing someone.

531
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,473
Since you saw our faces,
we'll have to kill you too.

532
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,861
I was in Tokyo until last year.

533
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,947
My company went under
and I came back here.

534
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,116
It's really boring here.

535
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,869
I'm just waiting for time to pass.

536
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:22,458
My company failed, I was in debt…

537
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,419
I even raised a hand to my wife and kid.

538
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,715
I received a restraining order,
so I can't see them anymore.

539
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:39,641
My wife looks like you. Just a little.

540
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,770
That's why I helped you.

541
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,165
Thank you for your help.

542
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,430
Maybe we should've asked him
to drive us a bit further.

543
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,391
It's fine as long as
we're sleeping under a roof.

544
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,275
I'll take a nap.

545
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,824
I knew it. You two are still here.

546
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,707
Is it really true that you killed someone?

547
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,005
That's a scary face.

548
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,676
I wanted to have a drink with you.

549
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:31,063
Where will you run away to?

550
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:33,231
No idea.

551
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,109
I wonder what's next.

552
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,571
Trying to escape from reality?

553
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,947
How old are you, young lady?

554
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,368
I'm 23 years old.

555
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:47,996
No way!

556
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,040
You look way more mature for your age.

557
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,751
You got me!

558
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,795
I'm 29.

559
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,967
Your hair is beautiful.

560
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,898
You like this, right?

561
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,748
Can we really do it raw?

562
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,669
I knew that you would understand me.

563
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,914
Hey.

564
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,256
Here.

565
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,429
I don't know what happened to you,

566
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:53,348
but take this.

567
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,283
Hello?

568
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,250
Rei?

569
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,677
It's you, isn't it?

570
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:00,725
Are you…

571
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:05,188
Are you all right?

572
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,527
I'm sorry.

573
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,032
You're…

574
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,203
not coming back, are you?

575
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:25,667
Sorry.

576
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,338
Don't apologize like it's nothing.

577
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,511
I…

578
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,975
I don't have a clue…

579
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,894
what you've been doing.

580
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,026
You didn't call.

581
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,364
And I don't even know…

582
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,368
where you're at.

583
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:09,919
I know…

584
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,888
I'm talking to myself, but…

585
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,101
the fact that…

586
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,150
I could only

587
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,903
like girls…

588
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,242
Ever since I was a child…

589
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,915
I was worried about it,
just like anyone else would.

590
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,594
But after I went out with you…

591
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,811
For the first time in my life…

592
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,610
I was glad that…

593
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,030
I was born

594
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,825
a gay woman.

595
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,258
Now…

596
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:51,062
…you're with the person you love, right?

597
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,254
I'm glad.

598
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,641
Goodbye.

599
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,180
Hey.

600
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:52,642
What do you want to do?

601
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,485
We could die together.

602
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,780
Or we could go to the police, too.

603
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,560
I want to take a shower.

604
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,481
And I want to sleep on a futon.

605
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:09,635
Us two…

606
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,764
we're not friends, nor are we lovers.

607
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:21,397
But I'm not against having a good talk
with you during our remaining time.

608
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:56,492
That was you, Ms. Nagasawa?

609
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,079
It's been dangerous around here recently,

610
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,664
so please don't do that again.

611
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:05,460
Sorry to trouble you. I lost my key.

612
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,555
So you really are rich, huh?

613
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,266
This place belongs to my dad.

614
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,483
-It's tasty!
-Yes.

615
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,569
You can't cook at all?

616
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,739
You can have all the good food
you want if you can pay for it.

617
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,868
You had someone to cook for you, right?

618
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:43,080
I did.

619
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,346
My mother

620
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:02,016
refused to accept that I was gay
until the very end.

621
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,812
So I asked my male friend
to pretend to be my boyfriend.

622
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:12,443
Then my mom told me, "I'm glad
you're cured of your homosexuality."

623
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,033
And then she died a while after that.

624
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,958
I don't want to be rejected
by anyone again.

625
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,210
I don't care if they don't understand me.

626
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,466
As long as I come to terms with it,
I can have a decent life.

627
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,888
But when I saw you,

628
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,350
the love I felt for you in high school
came rushing back.

629
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:52,316
I always wished I could be
the person you had by your side.

630
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,110
It all came back to me.

631
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:33,274
I WONDER IF THE WIFE WAS KILLED TOO

632
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:35,318
HURRY AND IDENTIFY HER

633
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,819
REIWA GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNA

634
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,164
I'll get the offal rice bowl.

635
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:50,833
-I'll have the beef rice bowl.
-Thanks.

636
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,176
Excuse me.
May we have a moment of your time?

637
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:04,930
We'd like to speak with you.

638
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:49,975
Why are you here, Masato?

639
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,813
The security guard called us.

640
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:56,899
He thought it was a burglar,
but it was you.

641
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,822
The person on the news.

642
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:05,366
That wasn't you, right?

643
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:10,830
What?

644
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,708
No way. Wait…

645
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,127
Seriously?

646
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,510
That woman…

647
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:27,805
Is she that man's wife?

648
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:32,351
I'm sorry.

649
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,856
Seriously, what are you doing?

650
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,672
I'm sorry for the precautions.

651
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:06,093
Things would get messy
if you were to escape.

652
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:07,762
I understand.

653
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:13,768
I'm… Rei's sister-in-law.

654
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:19,023
Are you two together?

655
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,819
No. It's not like that.

656
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:29,992
Then why are you two
running away together?

657
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:10,050
Why would you do this?

658
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,056
What is that woman in the glasses to you?

659
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,150
She's not the girl
you've been with for ages.

660
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:29,945
You knew?

661
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,033
I've wondered about it many times before.

662
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,791
Do you have feelings for her?

663
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,717
Say something. I won't understand
if you don't explain it.

664
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,730
There's only one thing you can do.

665
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,234
Turn yourself in
and atone for what you've done.

666
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:12,237
Don't commit any more crimes.

667
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:27,211
All right.

668
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:31,298
I'll go tomorrow morning.

669
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,384
Go now.

670
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:39,348
The sooner the better,
even if only a little.

671
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:41,475
Do it now and show you're sincere.

672
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,521
Then…

673
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,817
come back sooner, even if only a little.

674
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,240
There'll be a home waiting for you.

675
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,601
What are you doing?

676
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,692
I was thinking about
jumping out and dying.

677
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:42,286
Sorry.

678
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,372
We've been found.

679
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,018
My brother is going to drive me
to the police station now.

680
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:14,526
I'll say that I kidnapped
and imprisoned you.

681
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,908
Did your brother agree to it?

682
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:23,327
Yes.

683
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:30,209
I got him to understand.

684
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:34,963
We ran when it was just us,

685
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,924
but now your family is here, you do this.

686
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,176
What?

687
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:42,513
Just do whatever you want.

688
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:44,932
I'm just a stranger.

689
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,559
-Why are you mad?
-I'm not.

690
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:49,186
I just don't want to talk to you.

691
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,524
Just go to the police with your brother
for all I care!

692
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,659
Sorry.

693
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:08,247
I see.

694
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:11,625
You feel lonely?

695
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:18,590
Hey! Careful!

696
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:21,510
I hate it when you're so insensitive!

697
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:22,719
You're not a kid!

698
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,388
-Stop sulking!
-Shut up!

699
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,765
Hey, what are you two doing?

700
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,058
Calm down!

701
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,768
You're so pathetic!

702
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,770
Are you pitying me?

703
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,439
My brother asked me just now.

704
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:38,569
He said, "What do you think of her?"
And that's when I realized.

705
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:40,696
You're a pathetic person!

706
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:45,576
You can't think of any ideas to escape
from your husband, and here you are…

707
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:49,997
This only happened because
you actually killed him for real!

708
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,749
You bitch!

709
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,710
That's right!

710
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:56,628
I mean…

711
01:42:56,712 --> 01:42:59,298
You're just so damn pathetic!

712
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:00,507
Shut up!

713
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,551
Just shut up already!

714
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,609
You know…

715
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,945
once you've atoned for what you've done,

716
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,572
go find a good guy

717
01:43:23,655 --> 01:43:26,033
and try making a good family
and have a kid.

718
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:27,409
Stop it, Masato!

719
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:30,037
You start to understand some things
once you're a parent.

720
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:30,996
Masato!

721
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:32,080
And then

722
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,666
you'll be able to realize

723
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,503
the small joy of simply having a family.

724
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:40,923
You hear me?

725
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:05,781
All right.

726
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,503
I'll turn myself in with her.

727
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,930
I'm going to the bathroom
to wash off the blood.

728
01:44:30,847 --> 01:44:31,848
Hey!

729
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:40,482
I knew it.

730
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,652
We live in different worlds.

731
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:48,282
I should never have picked you up.

732
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:53,787
Why did you?

733
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:56,873
Pity.

734
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,460
I thought I was all that you had left…

735
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:04,172
since you're a murdering lesbian fool.

736
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:11,263
I see.

737
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:17,394
I thought you were going to elope with me.

738
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:18,729
I was so happy.

739
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:24,609
I planned on dying,

740
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,947
but I'll do what little I can to atone…

741
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:32,993
by living and testifying in court.

742
01:45:36,204 --> 01:45:37,289
And then what?

743
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:42,169
I'll live somewhere you'll never go.

744
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:09,029
We'll leave in half an hour.

745
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,406
Stay here.

746
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:11,508
Let's pay separately.

747
01:47:26,022 --> 01:47:27,441
Isn't this…

748
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:29,067
You saw it?

749
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,906
-You kept it all this time?
-It just happened.

750
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,453
-For ten years?
-That's right.

751
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:45,542
Hey, let's go somewhere.

752
01:47:46,084 --> 01:47:46,960
What?

753
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:49,629
Let's run away.

754
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:51,715
It's impossible.

755
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:54,176
We can't run away forever.

756
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:55,719
What are you thinking…

757
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:04,811
I was thinking that you're so cute.

758
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:23,246
Are you dumb?

759
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:26,791
I am.

760
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,338
I've locked everything up,
so I'll get the car started now.

761
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:33,465
-Okay. Be there in a minute.
-Okay.

762
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:47,312
Let's go.

763
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:48,772
Okay.

764
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,530
Ready, go!

765
01:49:00,867 --> 01:49:01,993
-Come on.
-Okay!

766
01:49:11,962 --> 01:49:13,588
Please do me a favor.

767
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:16,049
Don't say anything,
and just give us the car.

768
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:17,801
Give up.

769
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:21,388
There will be no end to this
if you keep dragging it on.

770
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,098
Please!

771
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,196
Why do you think I killed someone?

772
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:46,246
I'll never bother you again.

773
01:49:55,171 --> 01:49:56,131
Are you

774
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:58,717
prepared for the worst?

775
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:12,856
This is in place of your funeral offering.

776
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:14,983
Go, hurry up.

777
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:27,871
Hey!

778
01:50:27,954 --> 01:50:30,332
-I loved you, Masato!
-Hey!

779
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:33,043
Let me go!

780
01:50:36,838 --> 01:50:38,089
Rei!

781
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,476
Why did you let them go?

782
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:52,729
They could end up dead at this rate!

783
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:55,690
Rei looked

784
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:00,236
-like she was prepared for that.
-Then why did you let her go?

785
01:51:03,615 --> 01:51:06,326
Being alive doesn't mean
everything will be all right.

786
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:08,286
Yes it does.

787
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,538
They can start from scratch.

788
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:13,208
You…

789
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:17,504
you don't know why
she killed that man, do you?

790
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,047
No.

791
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:21,633
Me neither.

792
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:26,888
Well, thinking about it,

793
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:31,726
as long as they both know
what they're doing, so be it.

794
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:34,938
What are you talking about?

795
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,358
You…

796
01:51:39,275 --> 01:51:42,362
Who would you kill for?

797
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:45,198
I would never kill anyone.

798
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,451
-What if you had no choice?
-Why do you have to talk about this?

799
01:51:49,577 --> 01:51:51,579
If I could just talk to her…

800
01:51:53,164 --> 01:51:56,334
She's made up her mind.

801
01:51:57,168 --> 01:51:58,628
She's considered everything.

802
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,550
Why?

803
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:09,514
Listen up.

804
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:14,185
I… could kill someone…

805
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:16,813
no matter who tried to stop me,

806
01:52:17,772 --> 01:52:20,191
if it were for you or the kids.

807
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:27,490
Aren't you going to ask me why?

808
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:07,322
I thought you were dumb,
but so am I, it turns out.

809
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:09,741
Right.

810
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:14,621
We're really dumb.

811
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:17,081
-Yes!
-You moron!

812
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:18,249
Yes!

813
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:47,070
Splitting the bill made me feel
equal to you for the first time.

814
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:52,200
And that ends today.

815
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:16,349
Let's go.

816
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:18,935
Where?

817
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:22,146
Somewhere we can be alone.

818
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,404
That gets the heart racing, doesn't it?

819
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:35,368
Now this next song was requested…

820
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:37,120
This takes me back!

821
01:54:37,203 --> 01:54:38,580
It's "CHE.R.RY" by YUI!

822
01:54:45,169 --> 01:54:46,921
Courage

823
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:52,093
I'm bad at emoticons

824
01:54:52,176 --> 01:54:56,472
But my heart starts racing
When I receive one from you

825
01:54:57,056 --> 01:55:01,477
I shouldn't reply
To your messages immediately

826
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:05,815
That's what I heard from someone else

827
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:10,820
But I can't play mind games

828
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:13,740
Because I like you

829
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:20,455
I fell in love

830
01:55:20,538 --> 01:55:23,333
You probably didn't realize it

831
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:29,005
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

832
01:55:29,088 --> 01:55:32,842
As I type my message to you

833
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:45,021
The cherry blossoms bloom

834
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:49,108
As I watch the scenery from my room

835
01:56:29,857 --> 01:56:31,067
Hey.

836
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:34,988
If I had turned myself in,

837
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:37,073
you were going to kill
yourself, weren't you?

838
01:56:40,743 --> 01:56:42,996
I thought I should return you.

839
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,665
To your family.

840
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:54,716
That's why I abandoned them.

841
01:57:04,058 --> 01:57:06,978
For a dumb, lesbian murderer like me,

842
01:57:07,895 --> 01:57:09,564
there's no place to go back to.

843
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:14,861
You're all I have.

844
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:50,957
It must be nice for men.

845
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,000
They can put something inside women.

846
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:55,253
My fingers can't fill you up.

847
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:15,022
Just once is fine.

848
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:17,650
I want to hold the woman I love in my arms

849
01:59:17,733 --> 01:59:19,152
and have sex with her.

850
02:01:09,136 --> 02:01:11,847
Could you kill me?

851
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:27,780
Yes.

852
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:38,791
But if I killed you,

853
02:01:40,418 --> 02:01:43,337
what would I do when I'm all alone?

854
02:02:17,413 --> 02:02:20,833
I couldn't bear you not being in my life!

855
02:02:24,837 --> 02:02:26,464
It would kill me!

856
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:50,237
Now I've killed once,
killing twice would make no difference.

857
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:54,700
I can kill you if you want, but…

858
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:48,254
No way.

859
02:04:00,474 --> 02:04:02,017
This is embarrassing.

860
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:07,231
Should I stop?

861
02:04:08,899 --> 02:04:09,942
Don't stop.

862
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:38,304
You're the girl I love.

863
02:05:04,663 --> 02:05:07,833
I'm going to die!

864
02:06:02,346 --> 02:06:03,556
Listen.

865
02:06:06,183 --> 02:06:08,519
I don't want to live anymore, anyway.

866
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:11,480
I want to end my life myself.

867
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:18,862
If…

868
02:06:20,322 --> 02:06:24,410
if it would kill you to lose me…

869
02:06:27,955 --> 02:06:29,707
I can kill you.

870
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:47,975
Want to say anything before the end?

871
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:57,901
I…

872
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:06,035
I didn't commit murder so I could
have sex with the person I love.

873
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:15,336
I had sex

874
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:18,797
with someone I love so much

875
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:22,885
that I'd commit murder for them.

876
02:07:27,556 --> 02:07:29,475
Make sure you don't get that wrong.

877
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:07,429
Is this seat empty?

878
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:09,682
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

879
02:08:14,561 --> 02:08:16,313
Everyone's here, right?

880
02:08:16,397 --> 02:08:18,982
Observation is fundamental
for rough sketching.

881
02:08:19,066 --> 02:08:20,484
Please begin.

882
02:08:36,834 --> 02:08:37,751
Your name.

883
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:39,378
What?

884
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:42,005
What's your name?

885
02:08:42,089 --> 02:08:43,757
We've never spoken before.

886
02:08:44,925 --> 02:08:46,051
Tsujimura.

887
02:08:46,969 --> 02:08:48,220
Nanae Tsujimura.

888
02:08:52,808 --> 02:08:54,351
I'm Rei Nagasawa.

889
02:09:14,955 --> 02:09:16,123
Excuse me.

890
02:09:17,541 --> 02:09:18,500
Yes?

891
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:20,627
Did something bad happen to you?

892
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:22,838
Why would you say that?

893
02:09:23,839 --> 02:09:25,466
You seem down.

894
02:09:27,468 --> 02:09:28,802
Nothing happened.

895
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:31,805
Then can you smile?

896
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:36,977
I don't like it when
I have to draw someone looking sad.

897
02:09:38,812 --> 02:09:39,980
Got it.

898
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,652
-Hey.
-Yes?

899
02:10:26,735 --> 02:10:29,321
You remember the time we first met?

900
02:10:29,404 --> 02:10:31,114
It was in art class.

901
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:33,450
I do.

902
02:10:34,868 --> 02:10:37,704
You suddenly asked me to smile,

903
02:10:37,788 --> 02:10:40,541
and it was creepy.

904
02:10:46,463 --> 02:10:49,842
I couldn't forget that sour look you had.

905
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:55,597
You looked so pitiful
as you forced a smile,

906
02:10:57,266 --> 02:10:58,642
but also so cute.

907
02:10:59,768 --> 02:11:02,229
You're the one who told me to smile!

908
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:07,609
Why were you in a bad mood?

909
02:11:16,368 --> 02:11:18,370
My mom left that day.

910
02:11:20,372 --> 02:11:22,249
It was the day my family fell apart.

911
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:31,300
That sketch of me you drew…

912
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:36,513
I thought it would be great
if I had a family

913
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:38,599
that could make me smile like that.

914
02:12:39,284 --> 02:12:40,702
Here.

915
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:42,037
Get up.

916
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,001
Here you go.

917
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:08,772
Move a little.

918
02:13:11,984 --> 02:13:13,402
Where are you going?

919
02:13:14,194 --> 02:13:15,278
To pee.

920
02:13:45,183 --> 02:13:51,690
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

921
02:13:51,773 --> 02:13:56,028
As I type my message to you

922
02:13:58,572 --> 02:14:05,495
I prefer fruit that ripens slowly

923
02:14:08,832 --> 02:14:14,296
I want to start our relationship
With small talk

924
02:14:14,379 --> 02:14:19,968
I shouldn't reply
To your messages immediately

925
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:25,307
That's what I heard from someone else

926
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:30,854
But I can't play mind games

927
02:14:30,937 --> 02:14:34,316
Because I like you

928
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,113
I fell in love

929
02:14:40,197 --> 02:14:45,410
You probably didn't realize it

930
02:14:45,494 --> 02:14:52,459
Wishing "CHE.R.RY" upon the starry night

931
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:57,089
As I type my message to you

932
02:15:45,095 --> 02:15:46,346
Hello.

933
02:16:24,759 --> 02:16:26,303
From now on…

934
02:16:28,722 --> 02:16:30,140
Friends…

935
02:16:31,641 --> 02:16:32,851
lovers…

936
02:16:35,312 --> 02:16:37,147
that's all too complicated.

937
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:42,527
How about becoming a family instead?

938
02:16:44,362 --> 02:16:45,405
What?

939
02:16:50,327 --> 02:16:53,038
Why? What's wrong?

940
02:16:54,581 --> 02:16:55,498
Nothing.

941
02:16:57,209 --> 02:16:58,668
I'll go get something to eat.

942
02:17:09,638 --> 02:17:10,513
Okay.

943
02:17:45,715 --> 02:17:47,676
Ms. Nanae Shinoda?

944
02:17:51,721 --> 02:17:52,889
Rei!

945
02:18:04,901 --> 02:18:06,152
Ms. Nagasawa?

946
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,949
Yes.

947
02:18:11,908 --> 02:18:13,702
Please come to the station with us.

948
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:21,084
This way.

949
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:24,879
Rei…

950
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:27,549
Rei!

951
02:18:33,763 --> 02:18:35,390
I'll wait for you!

952
02:19:13,303 --> 02:19:15,889
NANAE TSUJIMURA
REI NAGASAWA

953
