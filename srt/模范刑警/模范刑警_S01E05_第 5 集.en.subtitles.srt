1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,960
But aside from that,

2
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:48,631
what kind of a guy would hang
the portrait that was drawn

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,091
by the woman he killed

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,428
in the middle of his office like this?

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,846
He doesn't care about that kind of stuff.

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,930
What? You know him?

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,350
We meet often.

8
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,936
What brings you here this time?

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,314
I have something to ask you.

10
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,816
This is Detective Kang Do-chang
who works with me.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,402
Hello. I'm Kang Do-chang
from Violent Crimes Unit

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,613
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,990
Please sit.

14
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,912
I guess it's not about something personal

15
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,039
since you brought your colleague with you.

16
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,087
Do you happen to know
a woman named Yoon Ji-seon?

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,716
She's a college student
who was murdered five years ago.

18
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,968
She was an art student.

19
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,386
I know her. Yoon Ji-seon.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,013
How did you meet her?

21
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,140
She painted my portrait,

22
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,185
and I commissioned her to paint it.

23
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,273
Did you ever meet her in private
while she worked on your portrait?

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,651
We did have a meal together

25
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,611
when she finished the work
and brought it to me.

26
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,571
And I never met her after that.

27
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,575
It seems you knew
that Yoon Ji-seon was murdered.

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,120
And you know that
the killer has been caught, right?

29
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,163
-Yes.
-Then you should be wondering

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,959
why we are asking you about
Yoon Ji-seon again now.

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,545
Why should I be wondering about that?

32
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,005
Because Detective Kang is
suspicious of you now.

33
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,843
He thinks you're the real culprit
who killed her.

34
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,972
What makes you think that?

35
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,558
I told him about you.

36
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,017
What about me?

37
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,395
Did you kill her?

38
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,406
Are you seriously

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,658
asking me that question?

40
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,410
Yes.

41
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,332
I'd like you to leave now.

42
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,254
Please contact my legal team
if you have further questions.

43
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,715
I have nothing else to say to you.

44
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,885
Let's go.

45
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,145
I'm available
for the lunch appointment again.

46
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,897
You don't need to cancel it.

47
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,196
What is your relationship with him?

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,823
He's my cousin.

49
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,326
Then are you suspecting your cousin…

50
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,621
I hope Jong-tae is not the culprit.

51
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,540
But we won't have much choice
if we find solid evidence.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,917
Hang on.

53
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,046
It seems like you're trying
to protect your cousin.

54
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,672
-Why would I?
-Why did you

55
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,467
corner him so abruptly like that,
asking if he killed her?

56
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,344
There's no evidence,

57
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,638
and the motive for the murder
is still unclear.

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,056
Asking him a question like that

59
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,850
is like telling him to be prepared
because we're after him.

60
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,352
That's exactly what I intended.

61
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,649
He's never been nervous or worried
after doing something wrong.

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,194
He believes there's no one
who can dare to arrest him.

63
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,904
I'm probably the first one

64
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,365
to ever ask him if he killed a person.

65
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:06,037
So if Oh Jong-tae is provoked
by your words and makes a move…

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,580
It means he killed her.

67
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,585
That condescending punk.

68
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,756
INCHEON JEIL INVESTMENT TRUST

69
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,762
The way she looked at me…

70
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,139
She was so pretty.

71
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,146
Yes, I know.

72
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,027
Jin Seo-kyung
for the head of the Legal Affairs Team?

73
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,571
Yes. The position is vacant anyway.

74
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,699
Are you sure it will be okay?
Do you all agree?

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,412
Mr. Yoo, I don't think I qualify
for the position yet.

76
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
Will the legal teams of other companies
accept this?

77
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,793
They'd lord it over her if she was
a reporter from the countryside.

78
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,879
But now she works at the head office
of Jeonghan Daily.

79
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,632
Who would dare to mess with her?

80
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,468
I'm sure she will pull it off.
I believe in her.

81
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,350
So it was about a month
before the incident.

82
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,311
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2, KANG DO-CHANG

83
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,895
How long did she stay?

84
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,522
Okay.

85
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,485
Did Yoon Ji-seon mention
why she went to New York?

86
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,112
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

87
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,156
Really? Did she go alone?

88
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,201
Okay. I'm sorry I keep bothering you.

89
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,619
Bye.

90
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,540
What are you doing?

91
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,917
There's something
I need to look into personally.

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,462
Do you think Do-chang is
up to something else

93
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,088
instead of going on vacation?

94
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,339
I don't know.

95
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,799
I don't care what others are up to.

96
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,218
He's not some stranger. He's your partner.

97
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,387
Still, he's not my family or something.

98
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,181
I'm comfortable doing things alone.

99
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,391
I'm going to head out.

100
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,609
Yes. I called you earlier.
Are you Mr. Lee Gyeong-ho?

101
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,696
You recently got assaulted
by Mr. Oh Jong-tae, right?

102
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,032
I was there that day.

103
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,077
I said hello to Mr. Oh.

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,245
Do you remember?

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,164
Yes.

106
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,419
Did you leave the company?

107
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,588
Yes.

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,341
I make less money now,

109
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,928
but this is much better than working
at that shitty company.

110
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm feeling at ease now.

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,557
I should've quit sooner.

112
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,689
I looked into the department you were in,

113
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,316
and your tasks were…

114
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,403
It's not like I had any specific tasks.

115
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,699
You can just think
that all the people in the company

116
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,952
are Oh Jong-tae's minions.

117
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,124
Then you must have handled
a lot of his personal affairs.

118
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,004
Jong-tae dates around a lot,

119
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,133
but I guess he was seeing only Ji-seon
around the time of the incident.

120
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,885
He even stopped going to the bar
he used to frequent that time.

121
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,929
How did they meet?

122
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,099
He met her while she was working
part-time for the gallery opening.

123
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,726
I've confirmed that
she did work at the gallery.

124
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,688
I also found out that the gallery is
owned by Jong-tae's acquaintance.

125
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,482
Are you saying they started
dating after that?

126
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,028
Yoon Ji-seon went to New York
six months before the incident.

127
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,197
Apparently, she went there
for some exhibition.

128
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,991
I checked the departure
and arrival records,

129
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,909
and Jong-tae was on the same flight.

130
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,787
They must've been
in a serious relationship.

131
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,706
I bet he made up for the age gap
with his money.

132
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,042
Then did she dump him after that?

133
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,254
Is that why he killed her?

134
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,882
-Maybe.
-Just because he was dumped?

135
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,719
He didn't seem like a lunatic though.

136
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,889
Jong-tae had a dog named Happy
when he was young.

137
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,766
And he beat the dog to death
because it didn't mind well.

138
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,312
Then he put a photo
of the dog and himself on his desk.

139
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,397
He'd look at the photo

140
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,650
and tell me that he missed the dog.

141
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,278
When he was little,

142
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,990
he thought he was allowed to do
anything he wanted at home.

143
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,286
And now he thinks that he owns the world.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,957
What are you doing?
You said we can't be late.

145
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,210
You go on ahead. We'll be right out.

146
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,336
Hurry up.

147
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,632
Hey.

148
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,385
If your relative comes under suspicion,

149
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,348
you are supposed to back out
of the investigation.

150
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,643
You know what I mean, right?

151
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,394
I'm just after the culprit.

152
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,563
I'm not thinking about anything else.

153
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,901
Let's go after the culprit.

154
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
LAWYER SO JAE-SEOP

155
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,874
To be honest with you,

156
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,168
you're at a disadvantage.

157
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,212
What should we do then?

158
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,422
I can't live without Jae-ung.

159
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,424
Don't worry. He's a competent lawyer.

160
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,260
He's got a lot of cases from me,

161
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,636
and he didn't lose a single one.

162
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,766
But Detective Kang, I've never
dealt with a custody case before.

163
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,143
What did you always tell me?

164
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,355
You said you became a lawyer
for the less fortunate.

165
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,190
She's totally unfortunate.

166
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,401
You don't have to go far to find one.

167
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,778
I know. I should take the case.

168
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,947
But the thing is…

169
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,160
-By any chance,
-Yes?

170
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,996
do you have anyone in the family

171
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,456
who has a very high social status

172
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,874
or a lot of money?

173
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,504
I see.

174
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,090
Objectively speaking, you really
are at a disadvantage.

175
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,550
Why?

176
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,094
I'm being evaluated for promotion.

177
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,345
I'm going to be a lieutenant.

178
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,097
It's an executive-level officer.

179
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,227
KOREAN JUDICIAL RESEARCH
AND TRAINING INSTITUTE

180
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,523
Mr. So is a competent lawyer.

181
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,734
Let's trust him for now.

182
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,235
It's hopeless.

183
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,571
What do you want me to do then?

184
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,489
Why did you have to get divorced?

185
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,159
It's not like your husband
cheated on you or beat you.

186
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,578
You should've put up with him.
Why did you get divorced?

187
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,913
So this is what
you wanted to say after all.

188
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,334
You're just like him.

189
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
You never think
from the woman's point of view.

190
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,506
Of course I tried to do that. I did, but…

191
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,176
If you could be so understanding
of the woman,

192
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,887
then why did you get dumped
by your bride-to-be on your wedding day?

193
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,139
That was a long time ago.
Why would you bring that up?

194
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,599
It's embarrassing.

195
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,768
No wonder you're my brother.
We're just the same.

196
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,813
Wait, Eun-hui.

197
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,983
Don't drink today.

198
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,818
How will I get through the day then?

199
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,654
Don't drink more
than three bottles of soju.

200
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,783
I already have a lot on my mind
without you adding to it.

201
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,586
I can't believe Jin Seo-kyung is
the head of the Legal Affairs Team.

202
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,463
Do you want the position?

203
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,674
Honestly, if you think about
my experience in the head office,

204
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,386
-I deserve it more than she does.
-Jin Seo-kyung.

205
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,305
She had Chief Prosecutor
Kim Gi-tae arrested.

206
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,682
Do you think the prosecutors
will welcome someone

207
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,768
who put their boss in jail?

208
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,778
Why did the PR department

209
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,072
of the Central District Prosecutors'
Office deny your access?

210
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,407
I guess they don't like me.

211
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,618
This isn't just about Ms. Jin.

212
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,329
It means they disregard
our entire company.

213
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,748
We should make an official complaint
to the prosecution.

214
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,126
What do you think, Ms. Jin?

215
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,795
I don't want to be narrow-minded
as they are.

216
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,047
It will only tarnish
Jeonghan Daily's reputation.

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,383
We should send someone else.
And if they do the same thing,

218
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,593
we will have to think
about how we should deal with it.

219
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,056
-Gwang-hui.
-Yes.

220
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,558
You go instead.

221
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,560
As Ms. Jin said,
we will see how they react first.

222
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,019
Oh, well…

223
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,190
Why would you send me
for such a sensitive issue?

224
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,525
Try to sort it out.

225
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,070
Mr. Baek, you have a good connection
with the Legal Affairs Team.

226
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,447
I need you to support him.

227
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,614
I will.

228
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,994
Then what will you do with Ms. Jin?

229
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,495
The news beat is full,

230
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
so there's nowhere else to send her.

231
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,791
Ms. Jin.

232
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,795
The first hearing for Chief Prosecutor
Kim Gi-tae will be held soon.

233
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,006
I need you to work
on the case on your own.

234
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,468
So are you telling me
to go back to Incheon?

235
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,219
After the first hearing,

236
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,638
the case will probably be sent
to the Seoul High Court.

237
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,687
All right. I'll go back to Incheon.

238
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,150
But I'd like to look into something else
other than Kim Gi-tae's case. Is it okay?

239
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,234
What?

240
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,321
The execution of death sentences
was recently announced.

241
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,531
The death-row inmates on the list.

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,908
One of them might be innocent.

243
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,410
-My gosh.
-What?

244
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,996
-Who is it?
-Lee Dae-cheol.

245
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,290
-Lee Dae-cheol?
-My goodness.

246
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,876
Mr. Yoo, if that's true,

247
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,462
the Blue House who confirmed
the execution will panic.

248
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,923
No. It's not just the Blue House.

249
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,799
It will turn the whole nation upside down.

250
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,844
-Are you confident?
-Yes.

251
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,972
I know I can prove it
and I'll take full responsibility.

252
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,016
Then let's just trust her and go for it.

253
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,022
Go ahead and do it.

254
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,565
Okay.

255
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,696
Good luck. You can ask us
for help at any time.

256
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,539
What if she causes trouble?

257
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,041
It would be amazing to prove
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence.

258
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,085
She can't prove anything

259
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,128
without the help
of the police and prosecution.

260
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,631
Do you think the police and prosecutors
are crazy?

261
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,133
Why would they help her
and put themselves in trouble?

262
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,971
It won't be amazing. It will
end up as a miserable failure.

263
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,853
This stop is Dowon Station.

264
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,356
The doors are on your right.

265
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,066
YOO JEONG-SEOK

266
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
-Yes, Mr. Yoo.
-Seo-kyung.

267
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,577
I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you
in advance.

268
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,038
I know it might cause
Assemblyman Yoo Jeong-ryeol trouble.

269
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,542
And I'm not doing this
to earn my spot in the head office.

270
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,668
I just think

271
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,546
this is what I should do as a reporter.

272
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,340
You don't have to worry about my brother.

273
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,259
You should just do your job as a reporter.

274
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
Thank you for understanding.

275
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,181
This is quite risky
for our company though.

276
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,019
If things go wrong, I might not be able
to protect you as your superior.

277
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,979
-Keep that in mind.
-Okay.

278
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,731
I'll be prepared for that.

279
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,955
Here.

280
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,791
Nothing was found
other than Jo Seong-dae's prints.

281
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,585
And there's no blood on the blade.

282
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,669
Thank you.

283
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,673
Hey, Dong-uk. What do you think
you're doing?

284
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,884
Well, I'm just…

285
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,553
Detective Oh asked me to do this.

286
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,680
If he asks you to wipe his butt,

287
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,600
will you gladly do so? Will you?

288
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,936
You should ask why

289
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,313
and find out what it has to do

290
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,981
with your job, you fool.

291
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,525
Hey, Jae-hong.

292
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,235
Watch your mouth in the office. Okay?

293
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,490
Detective Oh, we're a team.

294
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,409
We should all know what you are up to.

295
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,537
Why did you arrest Jo Seong-dae?

296
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,375
As a suspect for Park Gun-ho's death.

297
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,049
But I should release him
since Team One confirmed it was a suicide.

298
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,055
Darn it.

299
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,937
Captain Woo.

300
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,939
Do you not have any cases
to work on in Team Two?

301
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,234
-Do you want us to share ours with you?
-What?

302
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,319
Learn to supervise your team.

303
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,864
Don't let your people
interfere with our team's cases.

304
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,325
Darn it.

305
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,244
We wouldn't do this
if you did your job right.

306
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,954
Investigation isn't creative work.

307
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,790
You guys just make up and omit things.

308
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,958
It's just insane.

309
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
Hey, Beardy. Watch your mouth.

310
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,629
-Hey!
-He didn't say anything wrong.

311
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,631
If Park Gun-ho killed himself,

312
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,633
all the murder cases
should be considered suicide.

313
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,051
That's just ridiculous.

314
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,136
You idiot. Do you have…

315
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,346
Captain Nam, calm down.

316
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,682
They're out of their minds
with the audit going on.

317
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,643
They've raked off a lot of bribes,
so they need someone to pick on.

318
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
-What did you say, you jerk?
-What?

319
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,980
You idiot.

320
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,857
Gosh, stop that.

321
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,483
-You jerk.
-That's enough.

322
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,360
Why should I stop? Come here.

323
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,570
Get off me. Let go!

324
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,696
Stop it!

325
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,034
Captain Nam.

326
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,662
Don't worry about my team.

327
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,497
Just make sure to keep your team members

328
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,125
under control.

329
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,668
Get back to work.

330
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,086
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

331
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,693
I'm curious.

332
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,364
You must have enough excuses
to put me behind bars.

333
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,741
But why?

334
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,743
Why are you letting me go?

335
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,286
There's no other reason.

336
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,829
It's because you're innocent.

337
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,126
Do you know this guy?

338
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,044
KIM GI-TAE

339
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,171
You dropped this.

340
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,672
It's not mine.

341
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,425
I'll call you if I miss you.

342
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,388
And…

343
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,684
make sure to tell your boss this.

344
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,189
I was very disappointed that I didn't
get to talk to him enough last time.

345
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,816
I'll be sure to go see him

346
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,527
and pick up where we left off.

347
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,496
Do-chang.

348
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,414
Where are you?

349
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,959
Okay.

350
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,253
Oh Jong-tae?

351
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,130
Yes.

352
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
Are you talking about Oh Jong-tae
of Incheon Jeil Investment Trust?

353
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592
Yes, I am.

354
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,760
And it turns out

355
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,347
he's Detective Oh's cousin.

356
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,183
Are you serious?

357
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,602
Tell me more about it.

358
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,106
So Detective Oh thinks
his cousin, Oh Jong-tae

359
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,150
is the real culprit?

360
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,445
Yes. There was this painting
in his office and…

361
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,781
Hey. What was that? It's for me.

362
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,163
Ms. Jin. Is this how you
cover a case all the time?

363
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,497
What did you say?

364
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,666
Do-chang.

365
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,459
Why do you keep dragging
Ms. Jin into this?

366
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,171
We're already in the same boat.

367
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,964
Hang on.

368
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,300
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,760
Are you saying

370
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,721
I cover cases
by pouring drinks to some officers?

371
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,933
You scumbag.

372
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,520
Ms. Jin. Wait. Ms. Jin.

373
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,024
Gosh, you rude punk.

374
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,776
Why did you tell her about Jong-tae?

375
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,696
Hey. Wake up and look around you.

376
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,656
There's no one who can help us.

377
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,951
Ms. Jin is the only one
who can offer us help.

378
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,205
She's doing this risking her job.

379
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,664
She might change her mind.

380
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,499
Do you think we have time
to size her up now?

381
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,920
Lee Dae-cheol will be executed soon.

382
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,214
Our goal isn't to catch the culprit.

383
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,799
It's to save someone from dying.

384
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,926
You brat.

385
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,933
That darn jerk.

386
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,893
How dare he say that to me?

387
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,538
I apologize.

388
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,707
It was rude of me.

389
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,213
It's cold, right?

390
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,387
Oh Jong-tae asked Yoon Ji-seon
to paint his portrait

391
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,180
right before she was murdered.

392
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,768
And the portrait is still hanging
in Oh Jong-tae's office.

393
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,730
So he had a relationship with her
around the time of the murder.

394
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,274
-Yes.
-Then

395
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,734
why wasn't he on the list
of suspects back then?

396
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,529
I'd like you to find out the reason.

397
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,533
Don't you think the officers in charge
of the case have the records?

398
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,829
The initial investigation of the case
was led by Captain Nam Guk-hyeon.

399
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,167
I see. I'll talk to him.

400
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,962
Do you have a family?

401
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,547
Yes. I have my mother.

402
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,631
Do you have a boyfriend?

403
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,761
Why? Why are you asking all that?

404
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,015
I don't think you are
getting involved in this case

405
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,434
for Lee Dae-cheol's sake.

406
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,480
Even if Lee Dae-cheol ends up
getting executed for unfair reasons,

407
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,065
it's not your fault.

408
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,861
But if your family or boyfriend get hurt,
it's your fault.

409
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,282
Are you trying to scare me?

410
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,075
So that I'll stay out of this case.

411
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,291
Then why are you so obsessed
with this case?

412
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,169
I don't see any reason
why you'd want to dig into this case.

413
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,171
I don't have a family or girlfriend.

414
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,673
I don't have a boyfriend either.

415
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,175
And my mom is in a sanatorium.

416
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,887
Her condition can't get any worse
than she is now.

417
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,057
-Happy now?
-I'm glad to hear that.

418
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,644
I don't have a boyfriend
and my mom is sick. And you're glad?

419
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
I'm sorry then.

420
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,946
Detective Oh.

421
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,576
You don't know what makes
people happy or sad, do you?

422
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,684
I'll meet with Captain Nam Guk-hyeon
tomorrow and get back to you.

423
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,561
This…

424
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,564
This might come in handy.

425
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,944
Is this for self-defense?

426
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,076
Thank you so much
for your thoughtful gift.

427
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,379
I guess it's better than nothing.

428
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,093
Excuse me.

429
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,432
We did as much as we could.

430
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,726
We'd like to discharge
Ms. Lee Eun-hye now.

431
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,936
The thing is,

432
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,730
she's got nowhere else to go.

433
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,691
But this isn't a refuge.

434
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,527
And there are a lot of patients
waiting to be hospitalized here.

435
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,654
She keeps passing out on the streets.

436
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,990
She didn't need in-hospital
treatment in the first place.

437
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,325
If her guardian takes good care of her,

438
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,702
she can go back to normal life.

439
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,705
But the problem is she has no guardian.

440
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,206
I have nothing more to say to you.

441
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,250
Get her discharged tomorrow.

442
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,585
If you don't,

443
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,920
we will have to force her
to leave the hospital.

444
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,547
But she doesn't have…

445
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,465
Excuse me. Hey.

446
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,875
How many people are we pursuing now?

447
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,794
Jo Seong-dae, Oh Jong-tae,

448
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,297
and Nam Guk-hyeon.

449
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,258
Did you put a tail on Jo Seong-dae?

450
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,593
No.

451
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,096
Should we call our team members
and ask for help?

452
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,474
They still have
many years left in their job.

453
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,435
We shouldn't make things tough for them.

454
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,104
And it's okay for me because I don't?

455
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,733
-You started the whole thing knowing that.
-What about you?

456
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,861
Do you think things will be easy
for you for the rest of your career?

457
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,405
I don't care. My life has never been easy.

458
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,033
That's not it. You have your inheritance,

459
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,327
so you're not afraid of anything.

460
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,336
I'm scared of something, too.

461
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,922
Failing to catch a culprit.

462
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,257
Gosh.

463
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,551
There's a culprit I need to catch
before I die.

464
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,929
Who is it?

465
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,060
I don't know.

466
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,354
I don't remember.

467
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,774
Then how are you
going to catch the culprit?

468
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,401
I probably never will.

469
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,319
That's why I'm afraid.

470
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,280
I might

471
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,533
fail to catch the culprit again.

472
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,159
What are you talking about?

473
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,164
There are 119 cameras installed.

474
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,542
The crackdown will continue
until next March,

475
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,170
but about 280 cars were
caught already only in 9 hours.

476
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,507
The car owners must pay
a fine of 250,000 won.

477
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,928
Among the 337 cities in the world,
we are the 16th.

478
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,722
According to the global statistical site…

479
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,016
Hey, I told you to take the blanket
out of the machine

480
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,225
and hang it to dry.

481
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,811
If you hang it at this late hour,

482
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,438
it won't dry anyway.

483
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,482
You can just do it tomorrow morning.

484
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,152
What's all the fuss about?

485
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,405
We're not in a position
to have someone over now.

486
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,199
Stop complaining and do as I say
before I kick you out.

487
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,201
That's what the analysts say.

488
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,746
Has she gone deaf after all the drinking?

489
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,415
A group of burly men are going around.

490
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,751
They bow deeply at the waist

491
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,587
and threaten another gang member
who's down on his knees.

492
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,839
In broad daylight in the heart of Gwangju,

493
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,091
members of Incheon and Gwangju gangs

494
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,927
had a violent fight.

495
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,305
The police believe
that the Yeonan Gang from Incheon

496
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,808
went all the way down
to Gwangju for revenge.

497
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,729
And now they are trying to track
the gang members who ran away.

498
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,231
Those jerks.

499
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,234
The fine dust control system
will come into effect starting from today.

500
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,337
Who are you?

501
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,914
Ji-hyeok, think carefully about it.

502
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,084
Did you see the person
who stabbed your dad?

503
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,798
Do you remember his face?

504
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,887
Try to recall it.

505
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,557
You're the only one who saw it.

506
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,274
I don't remember

507
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,234
anything.

508
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,996
Mom.

509
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,585
Mom.

510
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,892
Mom.

511
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,062
Mom.

512
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,440
Detective Oh.

513
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,111
You don't know what makes
people happy or sad, do you?

514
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,797
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

515
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,298
Joo Dong-pal from the Yeonan Gang?

516
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,926
Yes. He's the boss of the Yeonan Gang
who caused a mess

517
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,803
in Gwangju yesterday.

518
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,347
We will use this chance to arrest

519
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,599
Joo Dong-pal and his gang members.

520
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,810
Do you think it will be
easy to catch them?

521
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,562
They must've already gone into hiding.

522
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,356
Come in.

523
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,650
-All right. Come on in.
-May I?

524
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,026
Hey.

525
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,153
-Come in.
-Aren't you on your vacation?

526
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,573
Gosh, Captain. I understand it's urgent,

527
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,741
but you can't call in someone
who's on vacation.

528
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,327
Hey, the incident happened in Gwangju,

529
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,037
but this is about our guys.

530
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,540
If we fail to arrest these punks,
it's our station

531
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,542
who will be pilloried by the press.

532
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,628
You're the only one
who can catch Joo Dong-pal.

533
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,506
Do you know a lot about Joo Dong-pal?

534
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,759
I've dealt with him since he was little.

535
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,845
But I'm on vacation now.
Does it have to be me?

536
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,305
Chief.

537
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,600
The guys from Gwangju Station
just asked us for help.

538
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,476
If they catch Joo Dong-pal before we do,

539
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,395
we'll be humiliated.

540
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,231
Joo Dong-pal's case is
under our jurisdiction.

541
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,775
Even if they catch him,
they should hand him over to us.

542
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,778
Who cares about such rules these days?

543
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,989
Whoever cuffs him will take the credit.

544
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:52,160
The Gwangju District Public Prosecutors'
Office already issued an arrest warrant.

545
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,245
Those mannerless jerks.

546
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:59,876
Chief, Joo Dong-pal is our fish
that we've been feeding in our farm.

547
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,629
Will you let the guys from Gwangju
scoop it up and take it?

548
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,755
We can't do that.

549
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,217
Are you sure
you've dealt with Joo Dong-pal?

550
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,803
I was going to go to Vietnam
with my friends from high school,

551
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,806
so I bought my flight tickets
and everything.

552
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,058
-I can't cancel it.
-Cancel it.

553
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,143
The cancellation fee isn't a lot.

554
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,855
-It's about 150,000 to 200,000 won though.
-I'm sure he will pay for it.

555
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,524
Then I guess I should make a sacrifice.

556
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,985
Please make sure our team
works on the case on our own.

557
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,238
If you bring in someone else halfway down…

558
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,200
Fine. I get it.

559
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,619
Kang Do-chang.

560
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,788
Good luck.

561
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,292
All right.

562
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,251
You rascal.

563
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,754
Gosh, I was going to rest.

564
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,426
JOO DONG-PAL OF THE YEONAN GANG

565
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,765
This guy.

566
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,059
He grew up in Incheon.

567
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,479
It means he's got connections
everywhere here.

568
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,272
So information could leak easily.

569
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,109
If we lose him this time,
we won't be able to catch him again.

570
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,070
All phone calls regarding this case

571
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,030
should be made outside the office.

572
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,200
Make sure to keep it confidential. Okay?

573
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,618
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

574
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,632
Ji-ung and Man-gu,
you two take care of Oh Jong-tae.

575
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,177
Whenever he meets someone, take photos.

576
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,222
Dong-uk, you stay here
and keep an eye on Nam Guk-hyeon's team.

577
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,183
Tail them after work
and find out whom they meet.

578
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,310
Give it up immediately
if you think you'll get caught.

579
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,687
-Yes, sir.
-Jae-hong.

580
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,691
I'll tell you the whereabouts
of some of Joo Dong-pal's underlings.

581
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,984
Catch them and interrogate them

582
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,486
so the Chief will think
things are moving along well.

583
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,157
-Okay.
-We're the only ones who can do this.

584
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,325
Let's just think

585
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,828
that we represent the Korean police force
and try our best.

586
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,663
All right then.

587
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,463
Good.

588
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,175
-Ji-ung, let's get moving.
-Okay.

589
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,802
We're going out.

590
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,847
Gosh, we're so busy
because of Joo Dong-pal.

591
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,142
That moron. He's just unbelievable.

592
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,853
Incheon Seobu Police Station,
Nam Guk-hyeon.

593
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,397
What?

594
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,649
What is your call regarding, Ms. Jin?

595
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,194
Okay.

596
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,822
Hey.

597
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,992
Why is Seo-kyung calling Nam Guk-hyeon?

598
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,204
We can't interrogate our colleague.

599
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,715
I got a tip regarding
the death-row convict, Lee Dae-cheol.

600
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,801
Detective Kang was in charge of the case.

601
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,303
If you have questions, go ask him.

602
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,264
It's about Oh Jong-tae, the president
of Incheon Jeil Investment Trust.

603
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,558
I heard you were in charge

604
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,186
of the initial investigation
for Yoon Ji-seon's case.

605
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,689
I heard that Oh Jog-tae was
in a relationship with her

606
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,858
at the time of the murder.

607
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,152
And there's objective evidence.

608
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,947
Then why didn't the police investigate
such an important suspect?

609
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,744
Oh Jong-tae was

610
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,079
on the list of suspects.

611
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,041
Then why did the investigation data
that Detective Kang took over

612
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,751
have no statements about him?

613
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
Because Oh Jong-tae had a solid alibi.

614
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,195
Close the office for now.

615
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,906
And until I give you a call,

616
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,160
go somewhere in the countryside
and get some rest.

617
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,744
-Yes, sir.
-Here.

618
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,747
It won't take long. Here.

619
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,918
We will get going then.

620
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,855
Jo Seong-dae speaking. Go ahead.

621
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,317
It doesn't matter.

622
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,321
I don't care whom I'm dealing with.

623
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,989
All right. Thank you.

624
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,827
Aren't we supposed to catch Joo Dong-pal?

625
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,245
We are.

626
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,415
Isn't it too big a deal for a side job?
He's the boss of a gang.

627
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,042
Joo Dong-pal has three women.

628
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,337
One for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

629
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,964
One for Tuesdays and Thursdays.
And the last one for weekends.

630
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,341
Whenever we want to catch him,

631
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,551
we can always pick a day
and go to one of them.

632
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,677
I'm certain he'll be there.

633
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,931
-Do-chang.
-Yes?

634
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,767
Do you see the guy
in the red shirt with a flower?

635
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
He has the biggest mouth.

636
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,064
Let's take him to the station.

637
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,025
-For what?
-He looks like a gangster.

638
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,361
Hey, you red pig.

639
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,696
Hey, you.

640
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,698
What's with the carnation?

641
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,451
Did they figure out
Joo Dong-pal's whereabouts?

642
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,702
They will soon.

643
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,663
What about the guys in Gwangju?

644
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,706
The Criminal Investigation Division
is on the case.

645
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,250
The Criminal Investigation Division?

646
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,043
They want to catch him themselves.

647
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,587
-I think so.
-You better hurry.

648
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,881
Catch him and have the press
cover it when it's still hot.

649
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,591
So the guys in Gwangju can't say anything.

650
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,884
Yes, sir.

651
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,177
Darn it.

652
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,933
Who is he?

653
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,435
He's Joo Dong-pal's underling.

654
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,272
Joo Dong-pal? Who on earth is he?

655
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,148
I don't know him.

656
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,067
You don't know Joo Dong-pal?

657
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,194
What's going on?

658
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,154
I guess he doesn't remember him.

659
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,157
He will recall the name
when we start talking.

660
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,827
Please don't worry. Let's go.

661
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,079
What? I really don't know him.

662
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,748
Fine. Just tell me where he is.

663
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,084
Then I'll say you don't know him.

664
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,421
You know what things are like here.

665
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,926
Do-chang is the best

666
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,846
at dealing with guys like him.

667
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,149
You were charged four times for assault.

668
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,943
He seems to be well qualified

669
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,903
to be a member of Yeonan Gang.

670
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,905
What are you talking about?

671
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,075
According to the Additional Punishment Law
on Specific Crimes,

672
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,202
you will be charged for
forming a criminal group.

673
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:54,957
You will serve out about two or three
times the sentence you did before.

674
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,417
On what ground?

675
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,127
All we need to do is catch Joo Dong-pal

676
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,379
and take a few photos of you with him.

677
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,674
Even the judge wouldn't
find it strange. Right?

678
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,218
What do you want from me?

679
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,013
We want you to prove
that you work for Jo Seong-dae.

680
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,307
Then you'll be cleared of charges.

681
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,851
I just

682
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,312
work at his office.

683
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,856
I don't even know what he does in detail.

684
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,484
So you just admitted
to working for Jo Seong-dae.

685
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,903
You said I'd be released if I did.

686
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,405
Jo Seong-dae

687
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,240
murdered Park Gun-ho.

688
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,911
If he's proved guilty of murder,
you'll be charged as well.

689
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,121
Damn it.

690
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,665
I don't even know who Park Gun-ho is.

691
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,542
And I have no idea who my boss meets.

692
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,212
I really don't know anything. I'm serious.

693
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,673
I just took some people to him
as I was told.

694
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,634
I didn't do anything.

695
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,387
So who did Jo Seong-dae ask you to bring?

696
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,139
Park Gun-ho?

697
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,018
-No. It was someone else.
-Did Jo Seong-dae kill the person as well?

698
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,647
No. He went back alive.

699
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,566
-I'm sure.
-Really? That's good.

700
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,276
You can talk about him then. Who was he?

701
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:16,247
DECEMBER 7 2018

702
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,706
Mr. Ko Jun-seop.

703
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,836
I need to talk to him in private.

704
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,254
You guys wait outside.

705
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,422
Yes, sir.

706
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,886
Don't worry. We will just talk.

707
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,480
Are you ready to talk now?

708
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,608
-One more time?
-Gosh, no.

709
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,444
What if we end up taking care of the body?

710
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,612
Hey.

711
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,328
We finished talking.

712
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,205
Drive him home safely.

713
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,372
Yes, sir.

714
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,133
Mr. Ko Jun-seop?

715
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,469
Yes. I'm Ko Jun-seop.

716
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,262
How may I help you?

717
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,972
We're from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

718
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,933
Police?

719
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,313
Is there any place we can talk in private?

720
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,190
Come with me.

721
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,151
All right.

722
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,654
What's going on?

723
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,872
I guess you majored in art.

724
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,457
Yes.

725
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,959
Which college did you go to?

726
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,044
I studied Western paintings
at Seongmun University.

727
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,463
Do you know Yoon Ji-seon
who was murdered five years ago?

728
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,131
We went to school together.

729
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,716
-Then…
-That's it.

730
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,262
We went to the same school,
so of course I knew her.

731
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,765
But I have nothing more to tell you
about her and me.

732
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,392
Are we done?

733
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,228
I'm busy preparing
for a presentation today.

734
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,312
Please excuse me.

735
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,607
But I guess you have a lot
to talk about this guy.

736
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,443
No. I have nothing to say.

737
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,695
That can't be right.

738
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,574
You must have thought of
this guy every night.

739
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,952
And the horrible memory
will keep haunting you every night.

740
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,204
You were a hopeless guy

741
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,833
who couldn't call the police back then.
And that's how you'll live forever.

742
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,085
We will make him pay for what he did.

743
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,130
What does Jo Seong-dae want from you?

744
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,382
What did you tell him
when you were taken to him?

745
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,386
Jo Seong-dae can kill a person
without a blink or qualm.

746
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,554
Then why

747
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,640
do you think
someone like him let you live?

748
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,561
He thought you had a reason
you couldn't call the police.

749
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,730
There's something you want to hide, right?

750
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,192
We can't do this today.

751
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,194
We will come back
with a warrant. Let's go.

752
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,740
Wait.

753
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
He thought

754
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,164
I killed Ji-seon.

755
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,460
He urged me to tell him why I killed her.

756
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,129
Why would Jo Seong-dae think that?

757
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,213
I was

758
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,507
Ji-seon's boyfriend.

759
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,762
But I didn't kill her.

760
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,935
I found this in there.

761
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,648
-Oh, that one…
-This belongs to him, right?

762
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,734
-Who?
-The day you came from New York.

763
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,236
Do you know I was waiting at the airport?

764
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,405
You were with some guy.

765
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,158
You went to New York with him, right?

766
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,828
He seemed to be well off.

767
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,458
No wonder he's rich
since he took you to New York.

768
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,919
I didn't know you were so materialistic.

769
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,008
Please don't go.

770
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,345
I don't have any feelings for him.

771
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,140
He said he'd sponsor me
without wanting anything in return.

772
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,434
That's why I trusted him
and went with him.

773
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,727
So?

774
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,521
Nothing happened in New York?

775
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,606
When we got there,

776
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,110
I saw his true face.

777
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,655
But I rejected him until the end.
I really did.

778
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,281
What did that jerk do to you?

779
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,909
Tell me.

780
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,286
Say it!

781
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,372
-What did he do?
-Please.

782
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,625
I'll take care of this myself.

783
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,961
Take care of what?
You said nothing happened.

784
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,879
It's true. Nothing happened.

785
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,840
Please believe me.

786
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,468
Please let me handle this.

787
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,138
I'll be sure to end things. Okay?

788
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,184
The only person I love

789
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,937
is you.

790
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,732
I love you.

791
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,362
That was the last time I saw Ji-seon.

792
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,573
And two days later,

793
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,993
Ji-seon was found dead.

794
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,204
The watch you found
at the studio that day.

795
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,457
Is this the one?

796
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,418
Yes. It looks similar.

797
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:01,258
The man you saw at the airport.

798
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,637
Right. It was him.

799
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,768
Why did you not say that sooner?

800
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,021
If you had said it back then,

801
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,814
things wouldn't have
gotten so complicated.

802
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,984
She was your girlfriend.
Don't you even feel upset?

803
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,736
Don't you feel sorry for her?

804
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,654
If I talked to the police,

805
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,323
they would've been suspicious of me.

806
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,159
If he's proven innocent,

807
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,411
I'll be the only one left on the list.

808
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,663
I'm the only one with a motive

809
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,166
to kill her.

810
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,628
Is that why you've kept this
to yourself all this time?

811
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,505
I can't believe this.

812
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,132
Don't you even feel guilty about it?

813
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,093
I would've told the police
if they came to me back then.

814
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,846
But no one…

815
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,058
No one came to see me.

816
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,269
I also want to go ask the detective
who was in charge of the case.

817
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,355
Why he didn't come to see me.

818
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,440
Why someone else became the culprit,

819
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,318
instead of the scumbag
who was chasing after Ji-seon,

820
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,241
What haunts me every night

821
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,577
isn't the punk who beat me up.

822
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,039
It's Ji-seon's face that I saw
for the last time

823
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,751
when she told me that she loved me.

824
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,842
Okay. I'll see you there.

825
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,427
Bye.

826
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,643
Do-chang.

827
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,771
Ms. Jin wants to see us.

828
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,398
Okay.

829
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,317
I should go to the hospital
to have Eun-hye discharged.

830
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,528
Will you drive my car then?

831
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,155
No. It's nearby. I'll take a taxi.

832
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,992
Call me. I'll come over
as soon as I'm done.

833
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,159
Okay.

834
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,416
Do-chang.

835
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,627
We don't have much time.

836
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,212
Don't waste your emotions for nothing.

837
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,423
I know that.

838
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,277
No, I'm really fine.

839
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,738
Just take it. Get some soju
on your way home.

840
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,742
It's from my investigation budget.
It's no big deal.

841
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,537
Okay. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

842
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,761
Are you ready?

843
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,307
Is that the prescription from your doctor?

844
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,772
We will stop by at the pharmacy
on our way.

845
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,650
Where? I'm not going to a shelter.

846
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,985
No, it's not like that.

847
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,654
We're going home.

848
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:10,989
My home.

849
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,784
Let's go.

850
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,042
Sir.

851
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,253
Why are you doing this to me?

852
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,049
What do you mean? What did I do?

853
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,134
You're the one

854
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,304
who arrested my dad.

855
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,183
You made him a death-row convict.

856
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,813
Do you think I will like you?

857
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,609
Of course you will hate me.

858
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,946
Keep loathing me.
I feel more comfortable that way.

859
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,791
The hallway of Haesong Hotel in Busan.

860
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:06,253
It's around the time
when Yoon Ji-seon was murdered.

861
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,507
They went in around 11:30 p.m.

862
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,178
And the woman who was with him
left at 1 a.m. the next day.

863
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,723
And…

864
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,686
Oh Jeong-tae left at 9 a.m.

865
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,272
Because of this footage,

866
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,315
Oh Jeong-tae got off the list of suspects.

867
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,608
Wait.

868
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,502
You should've told me you were coming.

869
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,671
This is it. Just eat.

870
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,673
This is a sumptuous feast.

871
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,134
Why would you grumble
when things are just good?

872
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,470
Eun-hye, let's eat.

873
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,807
-Eun-hye.
-She went out.

874
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,601
What? Where?

875
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,145
She went out to buy
some underwear to change.

876
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,640
Do you think we should change
the direction of investigation?

877
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,392
I think the guy named Ko Jun-seop

878
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,437
is more likely to be the culprit.

879
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,399
You met him. Did he seem like a murderer?

880
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,821
No. He can't be the culprit.

881
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,906
Detective Kang.

882
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,244
I heard you gave up your vacation
to catch Joo Dong-pal.

883
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,831
Well, he's under our jurisdiction.
Someone has to do it.

884
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,707
Then why haven't you caught him?

885
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,836
Don't you have all the gang members
in the palm of your hand?

886
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,464
Mind your own business. I will do mine.

887
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,678
-Detective Oh Ji-hyeok.
-Yes?

888
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,847
-Are you close to Jin Seo-kyung?
-Yes.

889
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,683
We're very close.

890
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,521
I guess a Police University graduate
is no different.

891
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,106
You're becoming just like them.

892
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,234
You're just as shameless

893
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,611
and thoughtless as they are.

894
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,072
I bet you picked it up from them.

895
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,700
What is that punk talking about?

896
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,287
I'm sure Jo Seong-dae found out

897
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,998
about Oh Jong-tae through Ko Jun-seop.

898
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,836
But Jo Seong-dae killed Park Gun-ho
for Oh Jong-tae's sake.

899
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,256
I guess Seong-dae threatened Jong-tae
that he'd frame him for the murder.

900
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,508
Jong-tae covered it up with money,

901
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,429
and after getting a taste for money,
Seong-dae started serving Jong-tae.

902
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,680
Isn't that obvious?

903
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,475
And it's highly possible that Captain Nam
also got the taste of Jong-tae's money.

904
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,771
I think I should look
more into this footage.

905
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,148
Go ahead.

906
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,902
-Call me if you find out anything.
-Okay.

907
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,368
Hey. Is Eun-hye home yet?

908
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,542
-Hello.
-About the footage.

909
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,544
I don't think we should trust it.

910
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,213
It's strange that Captain Nam
gave it to me right away.

911
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,299
I agree.

912
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,385
I'm going to hand it over
to the KCSI for an examination.

913
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,096
You are? That's good. I'll come with you.

914
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,431
You don't have to.

915
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,558
I'll get back to you
as soon as the results are in.

916
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,518
I'm the one who got the footage.

917
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,521
What if you find out something
and go to another reporter?

918
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,357
I can't let you fool me like that.

919
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,816
Do you think I'd do such a thing?

920
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,612
-Yes.
-You can come over then.

921
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,288
This is the original. It's not edited.

922
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,083
I'm sure the time code is
from when it was filmed.

923
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,588
Can I watch it again from
where the woman left the room?

924
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,548
I'm sure about this.

925
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,217
There's nothing suspicious.

926
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,470
All right. She's leaving.

927
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,055
Stop. Right here.

928
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,392
What is this?

929
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,104
I guess there was some dust in the lens.

930
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,438
Rewind it again.

931
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,983
She's leaving the room.

932
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,820
Stop. This.

933
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,367
A bug… Is it a bug?

934
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,412
A bug doesn't hover in the air.

935
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,248
You're right. What could it be?

936
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,384
This is a bug sitting on the screen
for a while and flying off.

937
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,937
The footage playing on the screen
was filmed by another camera.

938
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,858
That's why the time code
in the footage appears to be original.

939
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,446
That sounds plausible.

940
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,783
Now, we need to focus on Jong-tae.

941
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,105
No. I'll pick you up.

942
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,150
It's okay.

943
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,070
I'm the one asking you for a favor.

944
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,863
Yes.

945
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,240
I'll see you then.

946
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,706
Those rude idiots.

947
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,418
Is Eun-hye home yet?

948
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,004
I see.

949
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,257
By the way, where can I buy
women's underwear?

950
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,261
Not a place like that.
Somewhere in the neighborhood.

951
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:35,016
I see. Do they have underwear?

952
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,644
Okay. Bye.

953
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,733
Goodness.

954
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,659
Eun-hye.

955
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,544
Eun-hye.

956
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,213
Thank you for coming.

957
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,090
Mr. Park Gun-ho died.

958
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,843
He died because of you.

959
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,429
-That's…
-Why do you keep making others miserable?

960
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,728
I'm sorry.

961
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,607
It'll be all over soon.

962
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,402
You don't have to suffer
because of me anymore.

963
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,280
Bullshit.

964
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,283
-Eun-hye.
-Stop faking it and say it.

965
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,244
That you're innocent.

966
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,997
That you don't want to die
for something you didn't do.

967
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,958
Stop acting pitiful
because I don't pity you at all.

968
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,209
Eun-hye.

969
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,843
Fine.

970
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,220
I lied to you.

971
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,056
I really did kill someone.

972
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,852
I lied to others that I didn't do it
because I wanted to live.

973
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,689
I'm a horrible person.
So don't ever think of me again.

974
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,318
Dad.

975
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,405
Why are you being like this?

976
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,657
Why would you say that?

977
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,785
You didn't kill anyone.

978
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,079
I just said I lied to you, you fool.

979
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,624
Don't ever think of me.

980
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,917
Just think

981
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,377
that I never existed.

982
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,795
You'll feel comfortable that way.

983
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,006
And so will I.

984
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,302
I'm done.

985
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,876
Wait. Hang on.

986
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,753
Just a moment, sir.

987
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,227
I made a mistake.

988
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,522
Eun-hye… Please let me see her.

989
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,232
Let me see her again.

990
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,818
Please go stop her. Please.

991
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,445
Tell her

992
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,406
that her dad

993
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,201
wants to see her once again.

994
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,870
Please.

995
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,417
Please let me see her face one more time.

996
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,711
Please, sir.

997
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,056
Eun-hye.

998
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,477
Eun-hye!

999
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,828
Mr. Yoo, where are you now?
I have something to tell you.

1000
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,496
Here's my card.

1001
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,124
It's about Lee Dae-cheol's case.

1002
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,378
Really?

1003
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,589
I'll wait for you in the office then.

1004
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,384
Thank you.

1005
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:19,467
JEONGHAN DAILY

1006
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,958
Sir.

1007
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,837
Hey, you…

1008
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,841
It's all right.

1009
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,302
Let's go home and talk.

1010
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,014
Mr. Kang.

1011
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,814
My dad…

1012
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,113
Please save my dad.

1013
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:01,486
-Oh Jong-tae's alibi was fabricated.
-Oh Jong-tae wouldn't be the culprit.

1014
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,279
It's someone
who's more powerful than he is.

1015
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,364
He met him on purpose to prove a point.

1016
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,116
I won't have to go to court, right?

1017
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,159
Joo Dong-pal!

1018
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:11,078
Do-chang is busy
chasing after Joo Dong-pal now.

1019
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,081
The witness that judges trust the most
is the detective who was in charge.

1020
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,833
What if that detective testifies in court?

1021
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,795
I never asked for a retrial.

1022
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,755
Have you visited Lee Dae-cheol recently?

1023
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:21,923
Why are you asking me that?

1024
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,926
It's true that Do-chang is
reinvestigating Lee Dae-cheol's case.

1025
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,678
I hate that brat. She attracts cops.

1026
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,222
I said stop!

1027
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,642
Eun-hye is sick.
How could you kick her out?

1028
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,477
Do you really think
you can take care of her?

1029
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,646
She'll be reminded of her father in jail.

1030
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:42,777
